I hadn't eaten here in 8 years or more (since my days of bar closing~), but I decided to again, on a Monday night @ 9:30 pm.  Just AWFUL.  Waited more than 30 minutes for our food, then my salad came out WITH our dinners.  Chicken friend steak ok, but smothered in bad gravy...mashed potatoes might have been okay, but also ruined with a lot of BAD gravy.  The corn was crunchy-mushy.  I chose the fish & chips, which I feel should only be advertised with big window paint, if it's edible, I literally couldn't eat it...but the fries weren't bad.  The waitress said sorry for the wait, only one cook & he was slammed, but we were terribly disappointed.  I can't believe this place is still open, with so many good resturants holding on & stil more, popping up.
