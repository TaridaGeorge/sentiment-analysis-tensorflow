Been there Done that. The beer i had was icy cold. The band was not so great I think they were Rock Lobster. The crowd was mostly 20 something college kids. 

There was no wait service except at the bar. Which sucked also.

My friends knew someone in the band and fortunately we did not have to wait in line or pay a cover. Because believe me it wasn't worth it. 

Maybe I'm just to old for this scene? We blew out of there just before midnight. No one could get me to return to that so called nightlife scene. Guys dancing with themselves and other guys, same goes for the girls. The patio scene was even lame. What happened to mingling and being social?
