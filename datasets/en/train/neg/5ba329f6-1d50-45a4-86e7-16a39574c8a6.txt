Do Not Live Here!!! The management is horrible!!! They have no idea what customer service means, and change the rules whenever they see fit!! They have a bedbug problem and don't want to work with anyone to solve any problems. The GM needs training on how to speak to people, as she's clearly not used to working in this capacity. Although the units are okay and the rent is cheaper, this is truly a situation where you get what you pay for. Pay slightly more to just skip the hassle and attitude!!
