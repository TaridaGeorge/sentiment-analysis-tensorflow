Do not use them. May spend time, but don't use any cleaning or deodorizing products. They took a brand new bottle of super concentrate that take off paint and grease off your tires and sprayed the whole bottle on the carpet. Then they LIED about what they took. Said it was empty and they put their own stuff in it. Then next day the carpets smelled so bad. I texted him asked if they use any deodorizer or cleaning products and wouldn't answer my question and actually sent me a text back insulting me. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE. SKIP THIS COMPANY.
