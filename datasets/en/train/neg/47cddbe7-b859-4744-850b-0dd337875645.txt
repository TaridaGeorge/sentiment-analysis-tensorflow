Was with a group of 9, slow service...it was croweded and the waitress hardly saw our table.  People just ordered mutlipe drinks at a time anticipating slow service.

Ordered the most expensive thing on the menu, the rib-eye.  Worst piece of meat I've ever had.  One half was cooked rare, the other half was medium...with more fat on it then meat.  Waitress asked me to be honest about how it was and I said ok, and that was the end of it...thanks.  Never again.
