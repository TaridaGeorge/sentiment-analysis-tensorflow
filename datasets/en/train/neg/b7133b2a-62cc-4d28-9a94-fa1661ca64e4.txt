ALERT !! ALERT!

Pho Bang is now Pho THanh. The only thing that I had here was Banh Mi. So far it  is very good but it takes forever!!! There  are too  many waiters and not enough cook. 

I don't know if this is true anymore but waiter from this restaurant does not get tips, the owner takes it all. That's the price waiters here pay for getting paid under the table.
