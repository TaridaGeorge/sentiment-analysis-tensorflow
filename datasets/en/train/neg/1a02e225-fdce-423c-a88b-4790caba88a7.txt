If you think these are good bagels, you've never had a good bagel.  I wouldn't even call what they serve bagels.  Unfortunately, where I work they bring these in for various occasions so I'm guessing they're cheap.

If you're from NY/NJ area don't waste your time or money - you'll be chucking this in the trash after one bite.

Disgusting.
