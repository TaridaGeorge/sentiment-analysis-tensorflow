I don't recommend to go during the night time.  The workers are cranky, very poor customer service.  It's also very slow regardless if it's empty or not.  I have also encountered a piece of hair on my burritos.  I truly recommend Mikey's Restaurant Mexican Food in downtown buckeye.  They close earlier and are closed on Sunday's but their food is incredible!  It tastes like homemade food!  They are always happy to see you!
