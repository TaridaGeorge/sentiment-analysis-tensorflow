Such bad customer service at the framing desk. I wanted to custom frame a poster and I have never talked about custom framing to anyone before! The individual couldn't have been less interested and assumed I knew everything there was to know about framing , glass, spacing etc etc. After all that the price was $160 over what was displayed for the size of my poster. 

Simply put, they were a customer service disaster.
