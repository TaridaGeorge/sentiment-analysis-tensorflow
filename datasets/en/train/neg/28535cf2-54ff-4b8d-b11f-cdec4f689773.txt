i agree with the review prior to mine.  i was very put-off by the front desk when i came to the office to speak directly with dr. holy about previous skin treatment.  the woman at the desk knew i was upset and was annoyed by that.  neither my husband nor myself will return to this practice.  my concerns were never addressed.  no follow-up as promised me by dr. holy AND after commiting to treatment and paying a substantial amount  of money for the treatment, i am left without any improvement to my skin's condtion.  
BEWARE, BE WISE!
