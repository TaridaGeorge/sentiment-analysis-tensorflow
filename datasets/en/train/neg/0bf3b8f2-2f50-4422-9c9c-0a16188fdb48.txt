What is the big deal? The menu was terribly limited, the waitress didn't get around to us for 30 minutes. Luckily we were in a group so we didn't notice that much. This place is constantly over crowded, and the staff is rude. Their alcohol selection isn't anything special, and after we were done here we ended up going somewhere else for food, this place was hardly worth it, and certainly over priced.
