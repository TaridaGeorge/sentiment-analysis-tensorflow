Also known as "Aloha Cleaners". Ok Where do I even Begin?? I went in mid day, dropped off my husbands dress shirt and tie. When I went to pick up my items I was told his shirt had lost it's tag and they didn't know which one it was..I was sent to look through 50 plus men's dress shirts and try to find his...YA RIGHT. So not only did they LOSE his shirt they wanted me to figure out which one it was. They Still charged me for cleaning it too!!! I left with a "I hope this is his shirt" in my hand. It was not. We still have to go back to look through the rack. I will never give them my business again.
