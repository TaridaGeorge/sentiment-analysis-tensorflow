Pete's is one of those places I don't understand.  Growing up in Mesa, AZ, Pete's has a loyal and fanatical following.

I'm not sure why.  The fish is about as processed as you can imagine (rectangular squares of fish-like material).  The shrimp and "crabettes" are even worse.  

The only reason I can think of eating at Pete's is that you might want to relive the experience of bad junior high school cafeteria food (and my school had better food than Pete's).

Still, the place packs them in, and does a land office business, so I guess there is no accounting for taste...
