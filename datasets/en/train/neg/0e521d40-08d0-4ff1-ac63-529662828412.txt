This place was the only thing that was open in the area at 11pm. I was starving and I figured I'd give this place a try. This was a HUGE mistake! I ordered a shrimp and steak quesadilla to go. By the time I got home the quesadilla was not only swimming in fatty oil but it was drowning in it! I was disgusted at the pool of grease that laid atop my food! I tried to save it by blotting it with napkins but it was no use. I was NOT going to put that in my body. It was just not worth it.
