Service - not good.  Food - even worse.  Ambiance for 3 girls celebrating a birthday on a Friday night - yuck.  Long story short - not recommended.

*side note: This review is based on a happy hour experience.  Maybe, just maybe, dining on the other side of the restaurant would have resulted in a better review.
