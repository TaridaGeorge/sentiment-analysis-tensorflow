My husband and I came after the D-backs came.  It was expensive and had a limited menu.  Food was ok, but how hard is it for a sports bar to have good wings.  Our waitress was kind of rude, when we commented on the limited menu she told us that we were free to go to TGI Friday's.  We will definitely remember to try that next time.
