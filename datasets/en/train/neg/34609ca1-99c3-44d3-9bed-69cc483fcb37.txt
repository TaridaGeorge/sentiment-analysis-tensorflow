Out of convenience, I unfortunately shopped here again to pickup a few quick items for the week... You know, I finally noticed this place has the smallest selection of food items in all the grocery stores in the greater phoenix area... 

Additional annoyances recently noted, they try charging premium prices on non-premium brands; all the while trying so hard to craft displays/sections to act like they offer exclusive brands and organic food products. 

Major FAIL!  So annoying, as this just separates products that should be logically located next to each other; creating a more difficult prolonged shopping experience. 

Seriously, might as well go to Frys or Safeway, hell even Walmart, rather than deal with this disguised mediocrity... This place is a poor excuse for a grocery store and should be bought out by one of the bigger guys. We could use some more descent grocery store locations...
