What?  LOL, this place is HELL.  Back in my hometown of Chicago, this is where all the My-New-Haircut-Guys would gather to act like they had culture because they were slamming Sake-Bombs and butting chests together.

I had a taste for sushi, it was on my way... I peeked inside and thought to myself, "This can't be as bad as it looks."  Oh, yeah it can.  Note to the owners:  no, you cannot have BOTH a hip little sushi restaurant AND a sports bar.  It's loud, it's crowded, I had vegetable maki and it STILL smelled like old fish.  It's cheap, I'll give them that.  But if I had to deal with this place again, a chop stick would end up going through a baseball cap and into a skull.
