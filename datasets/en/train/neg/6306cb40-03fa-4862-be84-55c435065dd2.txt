Arrived to check in at 6:30pm and was told my room wasn't ready yet! Only request I had was for a quiet room, so of course they put me facing the main street. Besides the traffic noise, the idiots next door were hanging out outside talking loud until I finally got up about 10:30pm and asked them if they were serious! Seems like that's the type of hotel this is. TV was a joke it was so small and old. I wouldn't use the pool if I was on fire! And I wouldn't stay here again if it was free and I was homeless!!!
