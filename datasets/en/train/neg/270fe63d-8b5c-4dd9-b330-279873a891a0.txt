Worst service I have ever received. Had to wave down the bus boy to get a drink. They had us seated, then moved us elsewhere because they said it was our fault. Then, I had to wave down a bus boy to order a drink. Rarely saw our waitress, especially when she was needed. When I did see her, she was rude and never smiled. I was with a friend who had a food allergy that they basically tried to tell her she didn't have. Her mouth was swelling up and they told her they swore they didn't put this stuff in it. Okay, well... her mouth is swelling up. Explain that to me. They did however pay for that dish, but I will not be back. I'm not even picky--
