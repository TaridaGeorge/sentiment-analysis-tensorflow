DO NOT GO HERE.  Even if you've suddenly developed airport standards, you can do better. Walk down toward gate C17, you'll find three better places right away. The service here is slow, the margaritas are ALL mix and the food is bland and a complete waste of your money.  According to a couple other yelpers, the food here has been compared to "fast food." I--a complete stranger whom you should trust because I'm taking the time out if my life to tell you, a stranger, this info--am telling you it is much worse than fast food. I've experienced much more pleasure from fast food. It has flavor and doesn't cost what you make per hour. This place was better a couple years ago. Perhaps they have new management. Who cares. Take your biz on down the line.
