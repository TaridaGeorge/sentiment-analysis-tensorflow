bad vibe, bad customer service, and sub par sushi.

the w hotel scottsdale doesn't come close to satisfying three star food or accomodations.  although chic design, other attributes of this hotel push its overall experience down.  

frequent sushi eater.  try pure sushi, stingray, or blue wasabi.  you'll have a much better time, experience, and sushi.
