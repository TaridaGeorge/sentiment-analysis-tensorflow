Bartender is beyond rude!!!!!!! Very racist! My friends and I were the only brown people at the bar and he would not take our orders for dinner. Everyone else at the bar was white and they all had their food.

He wasn't that busy.  I saw him go back and forth a few times with empty hands. I didn't see him make any mixed drinks. Serving wine isn't rocket science or that hard.  

Even the host was a bad employee. If there is a wait, offer the bar, apologize for the wait, but never tell people "you can go somewhere else".  You can tell this place is established. Because only a place that established can stay in businesses even with these type of employees.

Will never go back or will never recommend this place to anyone.
