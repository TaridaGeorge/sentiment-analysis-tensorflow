I used to go here a lot as a fuming teen and I honestly can say that I was peer pressured into it by the god-awful social hierarchies of adolesence. The food here is terrible. The pizza is disgustingly greasy and I would never, ever pay money to eat here again. The company should have been the one paying me to eat here.
