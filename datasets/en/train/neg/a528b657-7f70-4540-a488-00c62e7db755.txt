Not even sure where to begin.  BAD.  VERY BAD.  Most of the meats were a gray color, the hot and sour soup was mustard yellow somehow...and we waited FOREVER for bad food.  After we'd waited thirty minutes, the waitress came out and said they did not have any more of the entree we ordered.  That took you 30 minutes to figure out?

And let us not forget the decor!  Wait, that's mean...there was NO decor so no need to comment on that!

NEVER, EVER AGAIN.
