AWFUL experience. My mom and I went to several dealerships one day and Cardinaleway Mazda was the WORST. The guys were pushy... seriously 3 guys coming at us at once. Then they showed me every car on the lot besides a Mazda. They wanted to talk about financing before I even test drove a car! I told them I wasn't interested in financing and that's all they talked about. They showed me a Lincoln and Mercury like I am some 70 year old grandma. Ended up buying a car that day at a waaaay better dealership with nice people down the street. I highly recommend you stay way from this place.
