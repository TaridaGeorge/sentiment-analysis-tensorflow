Stopped by on a cold, rainy morning for a hot cup of coffee. I should have gone to Steve's Expresso on McClintock and Southern or maybe Gold Bar across the parking lot. It had been a while since I visited a Starbucks so I had forgotten how BITTER this coffee is. The indoor seating (extremely limited) was all taken so I had to sit in the cold damp overhang to drink my coffee.
Thanks for the reminder of why I usually get coffee from the local shops instead of this chain.
