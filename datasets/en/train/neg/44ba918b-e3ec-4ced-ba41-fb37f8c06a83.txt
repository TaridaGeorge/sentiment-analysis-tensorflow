I am so appalled at the customer service at the Pet Club in Maricopa.  We made a purchase and specifically asked the sales associate about there return policy. When we needed to return the item, due to the fact that it did not fit in our house.  The supervisor said we could not return the item.  No signs were posted, except for one on the counter, which the item was sitting on about their return policy.  The supervisor stated it was not his problem.  He said we could contact corporate.  We will never go to this Pet Club again simply do to the fact of the lack of customer service by the supervisor.  " Do what you need to do"  a direct quote from the supervisor.
