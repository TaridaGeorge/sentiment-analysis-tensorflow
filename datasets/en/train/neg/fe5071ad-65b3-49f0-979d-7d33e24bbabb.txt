Whoever runs this stadium has no understanding of baseball tradition or how to serve people food.  

The concession stands were unbelievably slow. It took 2 and a half innings during a slow moving game to get a hamburger and coke.  What makes it unforgivable is that all the concessions are broken up by food.  So all that this concession offered was hamburgers.  There was no guessing what the next customer would order and the lines were huge.  Hmm, I wonder what the people are waiting in line for?? 

In the 7th inning, the stadium committed the ultimate sin for a ballpark.  They replaced 'Take me out to the Ballgame' for seventh inning stretch with 'Cotton Eyed Joe'.  Are you freaking kidding me??? 

What a poorly run ballpark... Needless to say, 1 star.
