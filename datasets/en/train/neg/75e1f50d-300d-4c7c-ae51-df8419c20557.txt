We were ever hopeful about sampling great tacos!  Got there around  2:30pm and the line was gigantic to get in.  We kept walking down over the bridge to the Cowboy Ciao area and the line still kept going.  Then we heard people who were leaving the festival saying vendors were already out of tacos!  No sense in waiting 30 minutes in line just to get in and pay $10+ without full opportunity to sample...so we skipped it.  :(
Hopefully organizers will plan more shade, better flow and longer lasting food supplies from the vendors next year!
