I have gone there twice now and I thought the first time might've just been an anomaly, but now I know for sure...THEY DIDN'T EVEN TRY TO CLEAN HALF MY SHIRTS!!! Just like the other review I read, half my shirts came back wrinkled, stained, collar rings, etc... This is NOT ACCEPTABLE. That's what I get for clipping coupons from those ValPak envelopes. I recommend going elsewhere.
