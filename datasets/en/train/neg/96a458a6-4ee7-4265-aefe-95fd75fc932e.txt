They get away with murder and jack your money way too much! That dumb lady that does finances in the office is a total female dog. The rest of the staff is pretty nice and very welcoming. Her on the other hand, is horrible. She is extremely unprofessional. Haven is making me pay all this money to them even though I don't live there anymore. Plus, they change their policies 24/7 so always expect to pay more than you expect. There are loud parties thrown every night and people dying, or banging on the walls 24/7. Good for college parties but not for living. Trust me, you're better off somewhere else.
