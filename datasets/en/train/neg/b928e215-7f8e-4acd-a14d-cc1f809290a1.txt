If there was a way to give zero stars, I would.  My family walked in the door at 4:50, and my son had to use the restroom, so my husband went to grab a high chair and table with my other son.  When he finished (is is 5 and takes forever), we walked straight to the counter to order for their "happy hour".  The lady said it was over, rudely.  I looked at my phone, it was 5:01!  Seriously?  She saw me walk in and use the restroom, and at the very least she saw husband waiting for me.  We were the ONLY people in there!  We ordered nothing an left.  I don't like terrible attitudes and rude customer service! I will never go back there.
