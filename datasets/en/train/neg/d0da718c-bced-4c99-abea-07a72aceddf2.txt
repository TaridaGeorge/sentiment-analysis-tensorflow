Bud and his crew made one too many mistakes on my little SUV and would not warrant the work they did.  It ended up costing me $300 for a tow from 100 miles away.  Bud's crew told me to "have it towed back and they'd take care of me".  They fixed the problem...something they didnt do right in the first place...but would not help me with the cost of the tow.  They also did work on my clutch and it chatters horribly.  I will have another company look at it.  Not Bud's.  Steer clear.
