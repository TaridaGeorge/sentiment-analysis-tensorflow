First time with Avis -- and decidedly the last. My boyfriend and I booked a rental for an upcoming trip and didn't receive a confirmation email. We called to request another sent to us and were puzzled when the reservation was lost, but more so when the customer service agent was unwilling to help us locate it. Our puzzlement turned to indignation when the "lost" reservation somehow ended up charging my boyfriend's credit card just fine.

A week and a half later, the reservation is still MIA, they have not reimbursed any of the charges, and no explanation has been forthcoming. Thankfully the credit card company was notified early on, so if Avis's inept business practices persist, we won't be held accountable.
