Huh?  They charge  $50 for "anticipated" incidentals daily?!?  I've never heard of such a thing and I do travel a fair amount.  When I conveyed my dismay to the desk clerk she told me not to worry because the charges would be reversed only 72 hours after check-out??!!??  WTF????  Hilton gets to use additional money of mine for the days I stay and then releases it back to me 3 days after I check-out????  Is this legal????
