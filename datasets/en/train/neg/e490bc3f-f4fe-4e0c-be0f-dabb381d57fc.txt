I have attempted to try this place 4 times and I'm thru trying. Way too small and always an hour wait. They need to get their asses in gear and fix this. I am not the only one leaving.... I'm sure they could double if not triple their profit if they simply expanded or just fit a few more tables in.... Screw y'all.... I'll go somewhere that wants and is prepared for my business.
