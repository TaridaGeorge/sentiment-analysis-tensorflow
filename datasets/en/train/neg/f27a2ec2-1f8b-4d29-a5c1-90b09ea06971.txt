One star for lack of vendors.

I was really excited to hear that there would be a farmer's market but I'm not sure they should call it that just yet. It should be re-named to one farmer, some hummus and some honey market. Aside from the great smells from the roast beef sammy's there was nothing there that interested me. 

Even the produce were lacking, maybe 10 apples a couple oranges. You get the idea. It took me a minute to see all that the market has to offer. Let's not advertise this until you get about 20 vendors or so. It was a huge disappointment.
