I ate here once about a week after it opened and stopped by three other times to sample beer because they had an outrageous tap beer selection for Chandler. Service was ... how do I put this... lets say very unprofessional. I met the owner on my second visit and understood why. I bet my wife that this place wouldn't last a year. She said 13 months to hedge her bet.   I have since heard it has shut down and reopened as the "Watersedge".   Update (1-09)  landlord has locked the doors.  Guess the name change didn't help things.  Enough said.
