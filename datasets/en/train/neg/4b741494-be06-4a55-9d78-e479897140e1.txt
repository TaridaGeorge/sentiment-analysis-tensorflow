I have been three times since moving to AZ, and the last two were ot by choice.  I have yet to leave without an awful headache from the ridiculously loud music.  It is cramped and the food is no better than what you'd order in a drive thru.  The prices are outrageous and the staff is less than 'happy'.  I don't know what AZ88 the other posters have been to yielding these great reviews, but if an awful headache and overpriced drive thru food served from unhappy cramped environments interests you, then this is your place.  I will never go again, even if forced.  Turn down the music and I may consider it...avoid!
