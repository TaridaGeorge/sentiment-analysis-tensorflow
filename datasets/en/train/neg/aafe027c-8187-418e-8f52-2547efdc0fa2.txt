The first clue that they're not worth their TravelSite stars is that the clerk requires a copy of your drivers license -- not for parking but to prove that you were there. It is comforting to know that they allow pets but my leg was molested by an unleashed dog in the hallway and the room door appeared to have been crowbar-opened. There was something old about the place but I really cannot complain, just yet, because our 3-night stay was only $169.  However that said and after one night I have realized that there was once a very heavyset body on the bed who left a permanent dent in the bed and how easily we both rolled to the center.
