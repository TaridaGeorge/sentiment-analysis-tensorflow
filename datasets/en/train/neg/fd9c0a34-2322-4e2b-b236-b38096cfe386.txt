So here we are not quite three years later and a huge crack across the top of the radiator that was not broke in the first place but we got talked in to replacing. Come to find out that no one is seeing our review because of some kind of filtering. We will be taking it to be repaired/replaced at Stanley's were they have been doing a great job for us over the last three years on all of our Jeeps.
