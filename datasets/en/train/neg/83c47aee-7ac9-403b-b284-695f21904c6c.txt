Little Caesars, Marcos, Numero Uno etc... the fast food of pizza joints. Beware places that have pizzas 'pre-heated, ready to go.'  Quite simply, you get what you pay for. I don't even put Pizza Hut, Papa Johns, Dominoes in the same category as these places, at least their pizzas are cooked to order.

Little Caesars crust is comparable to cardboard, the ingredients are unrelentingly cheap, and it's incredibly greasy. However the price is unbeatable. For $5 you can get a large pizza, but it's easy to see why.
