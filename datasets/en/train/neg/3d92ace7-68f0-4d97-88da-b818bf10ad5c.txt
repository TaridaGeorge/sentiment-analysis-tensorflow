We brought out of town friends for dinner hoping they would love the decor as well as the food. We have eaten at this restaurant with other friends and never been a real big fan, however we decided to give it another try. Worst ribs I have ever had they were tuff and not very meaty. Salad was boring.  The attitude of the ownership as well as the Chef is reflected in the quality of this restaurant. There is such potential, I will say the server was a wonderful lady as were the hostesses. Sorry we won't be back.
