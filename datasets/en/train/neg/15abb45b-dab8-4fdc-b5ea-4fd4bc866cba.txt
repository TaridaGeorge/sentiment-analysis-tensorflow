I had my alternator replaced to the tune of $713 in April of 2011 at Sun Devil Auto. It went back out again today(10/24/2012). I understand them not having a warranty on the labor for the service but the other three auto mechanics I talked to from competing stations said that their parts have a lifetime guarantee. I was astonished by this! I asked if they would consider ANY discount whatsoever for the service and they declined. Then they had the nerve to ask me if I still wanted them to fix it. Are you kidding me?!?!?  Fool me once!  I advise against using this auto center.  I know I never will again.  Furthermore, Sears just told me they are going to put in a new alternator for $516!  $200 less!!
