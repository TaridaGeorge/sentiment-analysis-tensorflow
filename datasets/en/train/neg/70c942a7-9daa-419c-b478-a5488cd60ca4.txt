Very sad news... The friend I was meeting for lunch at Soma the other day, arrived first to discover the doors closed and tables stacked upon one another. We picked another place but I could not help but wonder if they were just closed that day or if it was another casualty of the economy or whatever... after some surfing, I found this report that Soma has in fact "left the Valley" :(
