Very AVERAGE wine selection for a 'wine bar.'. That started our lackluster experience. Ordered the hummus plate... Three types (a tablespoon of each) a pita, few shreds of cucumber and a nice pile of NASTY dried out carrots.  - 1st issue = $9 for what I would have guessed to be $5 worth.  2nd Issue = asking the waitress to replace the nasty carrots with more cucumber.  When she brought the cucumber a WHILE later I recommended that they really should not serve food like that!  Her response, "they said they just received them today!" Soooo they bought the crappy dried out carrots -- not ME!  Would they serve food with bugs on it next...if they just got it today?!  What an excuse.  Well now I dont need an excuse not to go back!!!  Save yourself - try somewhere else!
