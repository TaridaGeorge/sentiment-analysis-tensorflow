Took my daughter to @DennysAllnightr for her Birthday Grand Slam.

Nobody came to the table for almost 20 mins.

Our server was Penny.

No coffee refills in the first 40 mins.

Time from placing order till delivered was close to 25 mins.

Food was same quality as always at Denny's, which is fine.

But the service was severely lacking.

I'm disappointed, even for Denny's.
