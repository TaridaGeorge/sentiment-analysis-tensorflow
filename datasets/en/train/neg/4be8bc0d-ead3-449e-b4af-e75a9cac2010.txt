Ganem came recommended by a friend.  I took my Breitling watch to them a little under 2 years ago.   They recommended sending it into Breitling to have a full service overhaul at the Breitling factory.   

I got it back, the watch worked great and I paid $600.

The problem is Ganem never sent it back to Breitling.  They DID have someone work on it, however, when I had another issue with it this year and did send it to Breitling, I uncovered the fact they Ganem lied aobut having sent it in.  Breitling had no record of ever having serviced my watch.

That to me is really shady.
