This hotel is a shit hole and so is Phoenix.  The area reminded me of a shittier version of Stockton surrounded by cacti.  Our rooms smelled like piss and sweaty gym socks. The check in clerk told us we have a view of mcdonalds as if it was a selling point.  OH SHIT A VIEW OF MCDONALDS? SIGN ME UP!  I slept in nasty sheets that had questionable looking stains (cum and blood).  My friends bed looked liked Patrick Bateman played fun with hookers and coat hangers the night before.  Also,  house keeping didn't replace my blood stained towel I used to clean my bloody nose with.

Short version: Phoenix hotel, blood and cum stains, sweat.
