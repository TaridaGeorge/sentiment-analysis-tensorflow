This place is so rude, don't waste your time or money.  I paid nearly $400 for pills they never ordered.  Then, after I have to drive out of my way to get a few pills as they finally order what I paid for, they rudely accuse me of being at fault,.because I didn't ask for a postal code!  These are the rudest people who want your money but don't care if you never get the product.  No.apology, nothing.  Sham
