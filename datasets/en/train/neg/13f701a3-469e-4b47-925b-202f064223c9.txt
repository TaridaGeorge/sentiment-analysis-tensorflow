The food is too expensive. The portions aren't very good for the price. Across the street is Panda Express which is about the same amount of food, cheaper and has a drive-thru. The gentleman at the front counter that takes orders at the register had a cup in his hand taking a sip of his drink while taking my order. Then he proceeded to say hello to a customer I assume is a regular and threw something at him. It was all very unprofessional to say the least all while taking my order. Needless to say I won't be coming back.
