Food aside, I was having a conversation with the bar tender talking to him about his old country and I asked, have you ever been to Israel?

(Not that strange of a question for a middle eastern restaurant)

To which I get the reply, achh those people are so cheap.

I ask, which people?

He says, you know .. the Jews.

I haven't taken my business back since.
