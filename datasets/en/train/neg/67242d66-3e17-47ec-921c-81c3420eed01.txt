I am writing a second review, this yelp must think a negative review has a personal agenda.  I assure you, I do not.

I went to this place as a walk-in.  I was duped on the pricing (printed brochures and menus post one price but when I was done,  I was told it was higher) .  I witnessed another customer having this problem as she was checking out as well.

Regardless, the pedi was horrible.  Toes were cut unevenly, I had polish on the skin, and it was overall, the worst pedi of my life, and for a price that is WAY over the competition in the area.

There is a reason this place is empty - women of North Scottsdale won't tolerate this kind of work.
