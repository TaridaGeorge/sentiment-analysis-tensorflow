My husband and I just moved into the neighborhood, not far from this restaurant.  The week we moved in, we took his parents to try this place in hopes of it being a new favorite Chinese food place.  It was a complete waste of money and a total disappointment.

The layout is similar to that of Panda Express, but the food is far from edible.  The portions ARE big, I'll give them that, but they have to make up for the lack of taste somewhere.  We all felt sick after eating there and we'll never go back.
