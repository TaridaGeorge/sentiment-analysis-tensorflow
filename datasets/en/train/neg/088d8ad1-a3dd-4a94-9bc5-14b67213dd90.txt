I would never return to this place. Food is mediocre at best. The interior is sooo small.  The patio is about your only option.

Please go else where for your sushi and Japanese needs.  The cloth napkins alone is a total turnoff.  It leaves lint all over your pants! So cheap!!!

If you want to get a cheap eat, by all means, go there, but don't expect a top notch experience being that it's near the Biltmore.
