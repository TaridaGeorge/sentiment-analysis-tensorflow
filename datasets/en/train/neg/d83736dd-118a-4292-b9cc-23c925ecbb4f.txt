We stopped there after the Cubs game today. We were seated promptly and soon knew what we wanted to order, my wife and I both love Mexican food. There was one waitress and she was overwhelmed with seating people, taking drink orders, making the drinks and taking the food orders. Needless ot say, we waited forever to place our order. We ordered margaritas, but unfortunately they were out of triple sec. A Mexican restaurant that can't make margaritas?!?!?!?!?

People were walking out after getting tired of waiting for their food. The waitress was apologizing for the slow service. 

I'm surprised that we were sooooo disappointed after reading so many glowing reviews by others.

Nexdt time we're in Mesa, this won't on our list of must stops
