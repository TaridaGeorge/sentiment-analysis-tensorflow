I was a little shocked with the ethics of this practice.  There website reads "If you'd like to learn more, please contact us for a free consultation. We do offer bilingual staff and translator phones are available." When I scheduled a "free consultation" I was really impressed with the doctor.  Then I received a bill and Bethany Home Women's Health care and they billed my insurance.  When I called to ask why I had been billed for a "free" service, I was told it's only free if you don't have insurance, but they would waive the copay.
