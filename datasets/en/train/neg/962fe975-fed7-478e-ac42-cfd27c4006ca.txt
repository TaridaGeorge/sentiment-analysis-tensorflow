$$$$$ Hard Liquor & Hard Beats DOWNTOWN Phoenix! $$$$

BRING YOUR CREDIT CARDS!

An outdoor bar/dance club in front of the building next door to Fate (situated right off Roosevelt Row in The Evans-Churchill District) ... Nightly DJs ... and outdoor drinking (and dancing (?)) with a PERFECT view of the ever improving downtown skyline.  

Sadly they have NO "shelf/house" liquor selections so drink prices are pretty Damn HIGH ... I mean WAAAY high ... $11 for the cheapest rum & coke!

This is YET AGAIN another business venture making another huge improvement in the Downtown Art District ... HOWEVER, sadly the drink prices are just to high for this place to become much of a regular hang-out.
