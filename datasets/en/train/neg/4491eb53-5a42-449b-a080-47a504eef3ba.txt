I usually like Red Robin.  Normally the food is good and portions are huge.  This was my first time at the Happy Valley location.  The service was fine.  This single star rating is for the food.

I got the Prime Rib sandwich and it was incredibly small.  There was almost no meat on it.  The sandwich was over $13.  I don't know if they've decreased their portion size or what, but I would never have expected that from Red Robin.

I would not recommend this place.  However, I might eventually try another Red Robbin.
