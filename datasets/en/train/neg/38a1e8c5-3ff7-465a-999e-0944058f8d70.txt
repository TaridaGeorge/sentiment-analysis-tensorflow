I have tried this place twice now, and it fails to hit the mark.  Everyone else in my party has been happy both times.  However, I seem to be cursed here.  Whatever I order is always loaded with onions.  I absolutely HATE onions, and I avoid ordering anything that contains onions.  Last time I ate here, I asked for no onions in an omelet ith brie cheese that I was pretty excited about, and they left 'em in there.  I was too cowardly to demand that it be returned to the kitchen, I so I just didn't eat it.  Today, I ordered a sandwich which mentioned nothing about onions, and they were all over my food.  Yuck!  I ordered a muffin to mask the taste, and it did the trick.  The muffin was the only good thing I've eaten here.  However, if you like onions, you might love it!
