Waited 10 minutes, and no one came to seat us.  One waiter glanced at us once or twice, but said nothing.  There were several open tables and they weren't very busy.  Decided to go elsewhere.  

I ate here a few years back, and the stacked enchiladas with green sauce were good.  But I don't remember it being worth the bad service.
