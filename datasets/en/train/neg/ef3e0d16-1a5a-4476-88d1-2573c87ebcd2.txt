Don't like this place very much.  The decor is really cheesy and tacky, the location is horrid, and the food is sub par at best.  I come from the nyc area, so i've had my fair share of authentic Italian food and this place could do much better.  I'm also not sure what's up with the Ferrari in the front of the restaurant.  WHY?!
