Bottom of the barrel for heath care!!!  This ER sent my husband home with a reptured appendix. He never saw a Doctor. He saw a PA, who said he had the stomach flu. By the time he got back to the hospital, he was on his death bed with 110 temp. His entire abdomen was infected. We are lucky he made it out alive.
