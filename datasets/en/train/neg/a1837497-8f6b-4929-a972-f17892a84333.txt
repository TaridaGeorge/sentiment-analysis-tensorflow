Very unpleasant experience. Creepy male doctor. Uncaring. And no help.

I went to this Urgent Care with a swollen ankle so painful that I was nauseous, dizzy and having vision problems. The doctor interrogated me and advised me to get my head examined. I'm not kidding. 

Mom was right: good doctors don't advertise. This place actually solicits Yelp reviews.
