If I could give this place 0 stars I would.  Nightmare staff that changed multiple times through my stay.  Many maintenance issues that were not addressed in timely manner.  The real concern here is  the management.  Grace is the absolute worst.  She will lie to you with a smile from day 1 on.  I am surprised there are not many other comments yet, but I'm sure there will be.  It seemed to be a common feeling during my stay.  Its a shame Equity does not address the issues with her (I know there are many).  The rent #'s must be good due to the lies she tells and promotes her staff to tell.  Its a shame its in a quiet , but next to all, location.
