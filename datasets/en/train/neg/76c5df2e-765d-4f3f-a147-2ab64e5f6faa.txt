I've been to Five Guys before and was not impressed but I just chalked it up to my palate not agreeing with their menu. My boss dragged me to this location for lunch and it was once again an epic failure. It was so smokey inside from the staff cooking the burgers that I thought the smoke alarm was going to go off. To make things even more annoying, the staff kept yelling and making unrecognizable noises, which quite frankly made it really annoying to eat there between that and the smoke. Once again the food sucks and as always was completely overpriced.  I have no problem paying a lot for good food or even just good service. I feel like this place is a waste of your time and money.
