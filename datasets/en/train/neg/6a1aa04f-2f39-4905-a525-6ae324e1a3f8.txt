Wagon Wash SUCKS! The owners are pushy and rude. They did not have my brand of dog food, Evangers White Fish & Sweet Potato, they made me feel that I was stupid and tried to sell me on one of their brands. The homemade treats have sugar, which is horrible for your dog!  For food and treats, I love Oliver & Annie, for a good dog wash, try Smelly Dog!
