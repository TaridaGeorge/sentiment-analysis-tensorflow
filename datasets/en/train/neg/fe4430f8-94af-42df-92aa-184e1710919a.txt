Service: HORRIBLE. 
We had a reservation and they made us wait for 25 min. They did not have the courtesy of apologizing for making us wait. Trust me it was not a pleasure waiting with two kids. The owner was not at all friendly. 
Food: Good. 
But you will have to pay me to go back there. Never stepping in there again.
