Bought a fridge here after I saw in consumer reports that their service level was high when working with appliances and its been a big hassle. They said they would call me when it was in stock - they didn't so I called and they had forgot about me - so I asked when it would be delivered and we set a date - so I called that morning after making arraignments to be home and I wasn't on the list because the fridge hadn't come in yet - they don t know why so we set another date for delivery - they offered no apologizes and we Will see if I get it on this next date - they are a big disappointment - I should have went to Spencers - I Will next time
