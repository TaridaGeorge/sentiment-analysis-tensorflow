Based on a review in PHX Magazine, I decided to stop by Hillside Spot for breakfast today.  Not a good choice. 

I ordered Mia's Pancakes, a blackberry muffin, and regular coffee.  The muffin was good, but not spectacular.  The coffee was bad - it tasted metallic and "off" for lack of a better word.  Then my pancakes arrived...they were large, but not tasty.  The pancakes were too eggy, soggy, and SALTY!  It was bizarre.  I ate three bites and then left. 

I don't know if I was there on a bad day, but it was terrible and I was very surprised since it received good reviews.
