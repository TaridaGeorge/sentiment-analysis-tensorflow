I didn't think this place lived up to what it's known for.... BURGERS!

It was suppose to be this great place to have burgers, we get there to find only three burgers on the menu... kind of a let down. And they weren't anything special. Not to mention it was very dark inside. The only cool thing about it was that the fries came in this tiny grocery cart shaped baskets...
