Stopped by today in the middle of the afternoon and the place was dead, mayybe 3-4 tables max.  After the host sat us directly between two tables literally 2 feet on each side of us we asked for another table.  The host had the audacity to tell us the place was completely sold out and all tables were reserved.  We walked out and will never go back.
