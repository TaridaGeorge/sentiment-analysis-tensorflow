Never had worse customer service in my life.  Have received to-go orders on numerous occasions that were wrong and they have absolutely refused to rectify the situation.  Thank God for the many options surrounding them as they will never receive the business of myself or anyone in my family again.  Armando's is my new home.  Los Cerritos lost a very loyal customer today.
