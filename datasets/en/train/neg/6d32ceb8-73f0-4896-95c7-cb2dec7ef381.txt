Very poor service!! When we went, it wasn't even crowned but still service was super slow. There was one guy "Mohsin" running around.. Said okra & eggplant are same things.. Then got two cups of same dish when we had ordered two different dishes. Then didn't get 3rd dish & said "sorry, aunty left" :(... We were left hungry on a friends bday :(.. Apparently the chef sneaked out... Food quality was good but overall terrible experience !
