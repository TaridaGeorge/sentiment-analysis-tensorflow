Three times we have gone through this drive thru for ice cream. The first time they were unfortunately unable to serve this product because the ice cream machine was broken. Okay, no problem these things happen. But then we went again some time later for an ice cream cone. But unfortunately they were unable to serve this product as they were out of ice cream. Oh wow! 
Well we just tried it again tonight. We decided to get hot fudge sundaes.But unfortunately they couldn't t serve this product because they were out of hot fudge. 
Well enough of that! So that was our last attempt. What do you say you keep up with ordering products offered on the menu? This is the only establishment that I have had repeated issues with and not any of the other Mcdonalds in our area.
