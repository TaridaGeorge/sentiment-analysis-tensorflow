Dr. Williams is NEVER IN THE OFFICE.  She Always has "Fill -In" Doctors due to her being "Out of Town".  The staff does not tell you this until you have waited 45min.
It is VERY DIFFICULT to have a prescription filled by the "Fill In Doctors" due to the fact they write it on the address of Dr. Williams and their actual practice is elsewhere.  The Pharmacist can not fill a script with out the Actual Correct information for a doctor that is required by Arizona State Law.  This interferes with the Well Being of the Patient.
