Why and how is this place still in business??? This has to be the worst pizza in town. Seriously this place has got to be a cover for a drug operation or something. When we went in the guy seemed like he would prefer if we weren't there!

The pizza slices we got had apparently been sitting out for awhile.

Bad BAD BAD
