I was told that this place had one of the best burgers in town.
Yesterday, I waited for 56 minutes for my burger and fries...56 minutes!
And the burger was average; not the best.

I could have  a gourmet lunch in 56 minutes. 

You don't put 1 register and 3 guys behind the counter between 12 and 1.
You put 2 registers, 6 guys when it's busy.

Service was horrible. Wait was unforgivable and the burger was actually over done and very thin.

Disappointed, again!

Where is the real burger, real service? Please !!!!!
