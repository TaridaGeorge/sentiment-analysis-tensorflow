When I walked in the staff was very nice and pleasant. I started out with a cup of coffee that seemed watered down, just not much flavor to it. I ordered the 4 strips of bacon with hashbrowns scrambled eggs and biscuits and gravy. The only good thing I ate was the eggs and bacon. The hashbrowns were mushy inside like mashed potatoes. The food was over priced too. I would not recommend eating here.
