This place is a dive. Booked through Priceline since it was rated 3.5 stars (should have been 1 or 2).  I would rather stay at a Motel 6. All of the furniture was cheap, second hand, and all dinged up. The bathroom had paint peeling off the ceiling, was apparently painted by some cheap help, and had a plywood board coming loose from the wall that was apparently some handyman's solution for a clean-out cover. Even the outside gave the appearance of a sleazy motel that someone tried to put lipstick on. When I complained, they would not let me out of my 3-night stay since I had prepaid through Priceline. The place is a sham and not even worth half of the 65% discounted rate that I paid. Steer clear!
