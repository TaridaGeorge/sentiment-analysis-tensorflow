I'm from Tucson..been at the Tucson location since I can remember. This place doesn't hold a candle to the original. Rude, impersonal staff. A stale selection of has been micro brews..the employees rotate more than the taps do..my final day here consisted of me trying to order lunch with a shitty beer the server recommended..and him talking to his frat friends for about fifteen mins before i left three bucks on the bar for the beer I didn't drink, and left. I took a screen shot of the exchange that took place on facebook that was supremely unprofessional..maybe I'll post it..
