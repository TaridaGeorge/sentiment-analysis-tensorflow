I bet Barneys has so many weird faceless blue mannequins to fill up space in the customer-less store.

Take a guess at why people are spending money at other places? 1) CHEAP prices and crappy service.  2) Overpriced stuff, but GREAT service.  3) Crappy, cheap stuff and crappy service.

Sorry Barneys...you have WAY overpriced stuff and crappy service. You're not so special after all.
