What a nightmare. There were three of us eating there for the first time (and only) time. My daughter had found small slivers of chicken bone in her mouth, we were lucky she did not choke. The green vegetables I was chewing on had an awful taste, like clorox bleach. Not a nice taste, let me tell you. The third person  said the egg roll had an awful chemical taste. All three of us had to spit out what was in our mouths! We should have walked out, but we were hungry so kept eating. The hot and sour soup was very good, so we filled upon that! When the waiter came with the check and asked us if everyting was Ok we said: "Noooo". He smiled and walked away. Not sure he could speak English. What a nightmare. We paid and left.
