Someone said this place is like Postinos ... HAHAHAHA, yeah right.
If you want to be called 'brother' or 'dude' by an inattentive ASU student who couldn't wait tables to save his life but sounds like he's auditioning to be the next Casey Kasem then off you go.
Sorry but this place is a triumph of style over substance.
