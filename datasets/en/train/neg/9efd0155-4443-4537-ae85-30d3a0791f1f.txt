I would give this restaurant 5 stars for customer service.
I booked the Christmas Day Buffet for myself & my family. We were hungry & so looking forward to a beautiful dinner in elegant surrounding. It was the biggest & most embarrasing disapointment I can recall ! At 5:45pm, our reservation, they had run out of food?? It was like a frat party had got there before us! Mere crumbs were to be had !
All we had were two cokes & a glass of champagne curtesty of the manager. We left, found a chinese restaurant & ate. It felt a little like a scene from A Christmas Story !
5 stars for customer service.....the food..we shall never know..........
