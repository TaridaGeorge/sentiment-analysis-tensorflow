I'm in town for a convention and decided to grab a Sub to take back to the hotel room.  This Subway has a great location in the Arizona Center.  It was not very busy.  The staff was friendly and neat. 

I was disappointed when I got back to the room to eat only to discover that the bread either old or left in the microwave to long.
