US Airways lost my luggage. What was worse is that they lied to me and told me that it has made it to the East Coast from Europe, just to stop me from asking questions. They assured me that it was only one flight behind. 4 days later, it's still missing. If you're planning to have checked-in luggage, avoid US Airways at all cost. My sister also lost her luggage. They lied to her as well. Her bag was loaded on a different airline and traveled across Europe before getting it back several days later.
