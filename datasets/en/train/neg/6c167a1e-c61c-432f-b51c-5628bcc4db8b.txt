This more so goes for ALL corporate movie theaters...

Do the major film companies still question why people download movies? How about the $7 minimum to get in? Way overpriced, extreme unhealthy food choices? Or sitting through 20-30 mins of ADS? 
$30-40 just to be marketed at. Sad days for the movie theater business.
