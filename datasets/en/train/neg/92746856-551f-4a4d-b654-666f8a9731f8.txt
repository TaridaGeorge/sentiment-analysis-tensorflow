Ok Im giveing Del Taco one more chance....

I go in what is your best chicken Idem....

um Burrito or taco? he asks

Have you had the Burrito?

no....I haven't had ethier...

Have any one eaten anything here? I ask the rest of the resturant crew....they All shake there heads no....

ok so even if the food was discounted or free no one should ever eat del taco.....regardless I did eat a burrito.....

and my worst fears where confirmed....I could have dumpster dove at a taco bell and gotten better food......

Feed me bad food once, shame on you.....Feed me bad food 4 times Shame on ME....
