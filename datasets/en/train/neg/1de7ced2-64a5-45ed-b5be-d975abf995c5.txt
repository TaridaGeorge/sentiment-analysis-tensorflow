LOUD AS HELL!!!  they couldn't hear anything over the phone so i just went in person and that was even worse. kids jumping off benches, everyone on staff seemed pissed off and stressed out, no host/hostess so if you walk in you will stand there totally ignored forever unless you grab someone in passing (this happened to me and everyone who walked in the whole time i was there).  the menus had scribbles and dried food on them,  it's all pretty pricey on top of that but at least the food was good.  not worth putting up with the rest of that bullshit though.  guess i'll just have to stick with the frozen indian entrees and naan from trader joe's.
