This organization is involved in double dipping. They took the cash /insurance cards from participants, then later billed us (the company). Refrain from any clinic services provided by Mollen. Also, it's evident they employ nothing more than degenerates out of their corporate office. Try contacting them and you're dealing with nothing more than programmed monkeys. Spoke to a Heather at the corporate after I had  employees approach me about being billed last year, stated the problem, she did NOTHING! This has been an ongoing problem and i've been faced with this dilemna since Mollen set up their clinics here last fall. Refrain from this crooked company at all costs and save yourself the headache !!!!!
