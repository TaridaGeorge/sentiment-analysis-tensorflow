Got a two year contract with AT&T and bought an iPhone. Told them I was moving to northern Illinois and needed nationwide plan and specifically asked if they were sure I would have coverage where I was moving. They assured me I would have coverage. After moving, found there was no coverage in my area. I had to switch to Verizon and buy a new iPhone again. AT&T charged me $225.00 for early termination fee. I told them I thought they should wave it, since they told me incorrectly that I would have coverage here. The lady manager just got snooty with me, interrupted me, and said they would take me to collections if I didn't agree to pay their termination fee.

I would never ever use AT&T again, as they lied to me.
