We had an awful experience here where we were accused of driving by and scratching their "brand new" shuttle. We used to go here all the time and would recommend this place because they are fairly cheap and close to the airport. But after meeting with all their management from this incident and wasting an hour of our time for a false accusation, we would never go back. The police even got involved and said that there was absolutely no way we could have physically scratched their shuttle. Management was not accomodating or apologetic at all for wasting our time. I only feel that this is necessary to say is because I really hope that they do not victimize another innocent person just so that the shuttle driver does not have to take money out of their own paycheck for scratches.
