Ok
Gross.

I could go on and on about why this place was terrible.
I'll summarize instead.

1.  Their "sushi bar" is a joke.  They only have Krab products.  Thats it.  I grabbed a roll that looked like a Philly roll, only to find out they used carrots instead of salmon!??!  Sigh.  And gross.

2.  I didn't think the selection was great

3.  Some of the food was coldish....


That's all I got.  Its cheap, 8$ a person at lunch. 

The only thing I found edible was the crab rangoon, and that even tasted like the standard greasy chinese delivery type puffies.

I'll never go back, I'd rather eat at McDonalds.
And I hate McDonalds.
