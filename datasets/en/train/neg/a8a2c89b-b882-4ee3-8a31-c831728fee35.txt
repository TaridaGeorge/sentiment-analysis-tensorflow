Just don't buy any gift certificates at this place.  I went there for about 7 years.  Each year my husband would buy 12 gift certificates.  Sometimes I would not get there every month and that was fine with the previous owner if I went over the expiration date.  Not so with new owner.  Older lady that works there came running out after me and I have never been back!!  Even wrote the owner a letter which was never acknowledged.  They lost me as a customer plus my daughter and granddaughter. Too many other great places who want me to keep coming back.
