Really bad.  The Mac N Cheese tasted like it was powdered cheese with no bite/spice.  Also, we thought it was odd that they brought out the mac n cheese 5 minutes before our ribs came out.  We returned it.  We were told that they have a new menu.  The waiter was very nice, recommended the green beans and comped our side.  The green beans  and the local beer were the best part of the meal.  
We got the whole rack of ribs and only ate half and left the rest.  It was dry, not tender, no flavor.  This, even though we were told it was ranked Phoenix best??  
Then our bill came out wrong - they added an additional $22 to the bill by accident.  Mistakes happen, but this was overall just bad. 
Won't return.
