My girlfriend and I walked into Isaac Jewelers to look at rings today.  There were 3 employees on the floor and one of them was with a customer.  We slowly walked around the display for at least 5 minutes (obviously looking for engagement rings).

They did not say hello to us or even acknowledge our existence.  The bad news for them is that they lost out on my business.  We like Betteridge or Ganem thus far.  They have great choices and are super friendly.

There are too many quality choices in Scottsdale for this kind of poor behavior.
