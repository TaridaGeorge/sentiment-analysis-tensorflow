We use to go to La Fonda EVERY FRIDAY for months and months and months....we moved and quit going. The food was always de-lish!

We drove by and stopped for dinner the other day....it sucked!

This place HAD really good food.  What happened? New chef what?

Our meal took less than 5 minutes to be served....MICROWAVED....YUK1

I wont go back anytime soon that's for sure!!
