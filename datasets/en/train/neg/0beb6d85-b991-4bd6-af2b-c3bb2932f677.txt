I wish I could review the cold food stand attached to this restaurant separately because I want to tell any and all persons who think to stop by for quick sandwich to stay far, far, away from the tuna. 

I thought nothing was worse than slowly starving on my flight back home, but I found it in the form of this cold, barely-recognizable-as-food sandwich. I think I'd prefer eating tuna out of the can over this.
