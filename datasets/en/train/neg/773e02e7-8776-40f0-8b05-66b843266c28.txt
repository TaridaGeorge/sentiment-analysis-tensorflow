Lone Mountain Cleaners has gone through four support staff in the last six months.  The owner is arrogant and acts as if you are troubling him to ask for good service.  He is unfriendly and rude.  We have recently moved our business to Tatum Cleaners and have enjoyed the friendly, caring environment.  Why do business with an argumentative, cold, egotistical owner when you can go so many other places in town?
