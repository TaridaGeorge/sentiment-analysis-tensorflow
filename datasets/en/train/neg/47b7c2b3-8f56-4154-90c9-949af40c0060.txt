The hotel is fine if you "need" to stay downtown.  If your open to driving 10 minutes the Hilton is a much better option.  

I've been to many meetings/functions here and something always seems to go wrong with the AV. 

The food for the meetings is generally sub par, it is better to stop at the Circle K on the corner and bring your own food. (yes, I said Circle K, even their food is better than what is provided here). 

I wish I could upload a photo of the hot dogs and potatoes they recently provided as the MAIN DISH for a meeting I attended there.
