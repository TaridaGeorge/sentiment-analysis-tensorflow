We got take out from here, not expecting the best Chinese food in the world, but we were not expecting to get the worst! We did not like what we got at all. My white rice had a metallic taste to it, and the crab ragoons were very seafood-ish. I got a beef chow mien. The beef was ok but not great and we also got sesame chicken and they were very crunchy with little sauce. I would not recommend Chinese food from here!
