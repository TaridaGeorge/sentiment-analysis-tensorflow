First off the woman who answers the phone is not impressive at all.   I called to consign my furniture and when I asked her about some info on the store,, she said " do you want to consign your table or not!".  Quite rude.  That was a turn of for me.....
The next day I went in the store for some info but when I entered I knew this wasn't the right fit for my Robb & Stucky table.  The place had older style furniture..dated couches, florals, mauves.  There was one accessory that I would  buy in the whole store.  

Needless to say, I won't be coming back or consigning my table or anything else...rude stuff + gross stuff...what more can I say!
