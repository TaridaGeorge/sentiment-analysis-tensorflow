You pull me out of line so you can search me in private. Ask me why I'm carrying $100 in ones, look at everything one by one in my carry on, only to let me find out I'm missing my toiletry bag that has my glasses, contacts, tootchbrush, etc and then you don't want to help me contact LAX to see if it's around there. What a joke.
