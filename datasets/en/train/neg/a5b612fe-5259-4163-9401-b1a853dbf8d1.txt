This is the only Walmart in the valley that I have ever been to where they constantly are begging for change outside for some purpose.  I donate, but I cant tell if these people are legitimately using the money for a good purpose, or paying their APS bill. 

Its pretty annoying, that literally every time I go there, there is someone outside asking for change, please stop!

El Mirage also taxes you on food purchases, which is total BS.
