What a shit heap.

The sound is awful, the food is awful, and anything edible or potable is grossly overpriced even by venue standards.

Despite the fact they have two huge projection screens, you'll be lucky if they have one of them working, much less both.

And the tickets... Dear lord, the tickets. If you've going to pack us like sardines into a 100+ degree venue, without even the courtesy of breathing room, lay off the ridiculous prices and magical fees.

There are about a million possible venues in Arizona at which I'd rather see a show than Cricket, and that includes a damp cardboard box on the corner of Van Buren.
