I couldn't agree more with the other reviewer, although my problem is different, the customer service was much the same.  It took almost two weeks to get my computer back, even though it didnt even leave the city as it was under warranty, and they wanted to charge me $199.00 to backup the few things that I had not gotten to before my computer crashed.  Again it was a problem with the motherboard, but mine is only 3 months old...shouldn't that backup probably be free!!
