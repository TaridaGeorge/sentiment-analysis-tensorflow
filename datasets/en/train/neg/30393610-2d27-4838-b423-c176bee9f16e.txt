The first time I ordered take out here was during the lunch rush and the service was great, I couldn't have asked for better, they even waited for me to get there before getting my lemonade so the ice wouldn't melt, but I wasn't on Yelp at that time, so I couldn't review it.

This time, we called in at 8pm for take out, were told we were going to be connected to the bar to have them take our order, so we hung up after 5 minutes of being on hold, and went to Delux instead.
