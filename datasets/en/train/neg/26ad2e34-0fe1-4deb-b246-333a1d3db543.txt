OMG, where do I begin? I had lunch Sunday afternoon while the place was dead. We were seated and waited on quickly. I was halfway done with my yummy entree of 
chicken fried rice when I found a red twist tie in it! Needless to say, I didn't finish the meal. I spoke to the manager who was very apologetic and comped the meal, offered another, dessert, basically anything I wanted, but this was the second time I've found a foreign object in my meal eating here (the first time was last year) so I left a tip and walked out. No more trips to Elephant Bar for me.  . .EVER!
