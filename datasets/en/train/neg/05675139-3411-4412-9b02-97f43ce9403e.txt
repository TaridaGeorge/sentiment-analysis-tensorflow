Terrible experience here. First, I was stabbed in the gum with the sonic cleaner device when the dentist wedged it between my tooth and gum. I literally yelped in pain. Then the dentist spent the rest of the appointment telling me how much additional work I need (as if I am letting her anywhere near my mouth again) and surprise they already checked to see that my insurance will pay for it...I'm going back to my old Dentist.
