The place is practically run by teenagers. So-so service, and food is okay.

You order at the cashier, they give you a number, and then they deliver the food to you. Problem is, they bring it as it's done, not as you'll want it. Ordered Wings and Pizza with another couple. They got their wings we got nothing so we got to watch them eat. We then got our wings... they got to watch us, then they got their pizza, and we got our pizza. Woulda been nice to get them all at the same time.

Great place if you're dropping off a bunch a kids after a baseball game for just some pizza. other than that... I'd stay away.
