The service is extremely slow!  We sat at our table and must have had 4 waitresses go past without a clue!  The hostess finally came over and we mistook her for our waitress and she said she would send someone right over...10 min later and nothing.  I called the restaurant on the phone line and again I was told someone would be there.  A few minutes later the waitress showed up and checked on the two tables next to us and ignored us....what a waste of time!!!!  I have never been treated this poorly at an eating establishment.
