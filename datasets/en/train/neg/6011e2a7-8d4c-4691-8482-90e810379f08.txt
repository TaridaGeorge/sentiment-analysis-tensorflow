One of the worst quick lunches I've ever had.  I come in and order to someone who literally does not know english, and I speak no spanish.  My order was simple, a #7 no lettuce, and a honey mustard wrap- not lettuce.....guess what LETTUCE on both..amazing...  and, the chicken wrap (took picture) had a piece of chicken the size of a chicken nugget.   On top of the no english, and my order being wrong- they are ketchup nazi's...  they ask if you want ketchup for your fries and burger---they will give you a grand total 2 packets, if you ask for more they look at like your stealing and appear that they are offended you would ask for such a thing......star rating will drop to a 1 star if I poop my pants.......
