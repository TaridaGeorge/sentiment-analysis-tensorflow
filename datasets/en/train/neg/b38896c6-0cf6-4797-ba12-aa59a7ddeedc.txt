Stayed here four times over five years. Each time it got worse. Was assigned a smoking room when we specifically asked for nonsmoking. They had a convention and said no other rooms were available. The room stank of smoke, was filfthy dirty with cigarette burns on the furniture, drapes and bedspread.  There were no toiletries. Asked front desk for housekeeping and they never came even after two requests.
Stay away!
