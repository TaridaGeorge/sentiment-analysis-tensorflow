I joined a few weeks ago. Told the guy who signed me up I'd be playing racquetball and using the treadmill mainly. Sets me up. I pay fora year in advance. I call today and try to reserve a racquetball court. I'm told that I don't have the "amenity" of reserving a racquetball court on my membership. I can play all I want, but I can not reserve a court. Are you fucking kidding me? Who is the god damn brain surgeon who came up with this policy? Oh and how much is the racquetball court reserving amenity? Glad you asked. 180 fucking dollars annually! The whole year membership was about $450, which allows me to play racquetball. But, I have to pay $180 to "reserve" a court? What a joke
