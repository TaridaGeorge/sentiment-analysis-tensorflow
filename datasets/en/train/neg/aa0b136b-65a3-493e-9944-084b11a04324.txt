Not only is this a McDonald's so therefore nigh on inedible, but its a bad McDonalds! I have never had food from here that tasted good at all!

Two pet peeves: They have no bike rack. Y'know how Mickey D's is all, "We are for the active American now, come get yer carrot sticks!" Well, why don't you have a bike rack? Especially in one of the highest bike population densities in the country? Burger King down the block has 'em!

The other: They have done away with small drinks. The smallest is medium now. THE SMALLEST DRINK IS A MEDIUM. Even better? They still have lids labeled for smalls!
