If I have my way, last Saturday night will have been the last time I ever visited this Ichi Ban location.  I was disappointed by something different each and every moment that passed.

The sushi was not impressive as we were told it would be, the teppan grill chef was not that engaging or interesting, the overpriced food (from the fried rice to the scallops) was drenched in butter and otherwise tasteless, and the service was mediocre.

I could on, but I'd eventually start to feel bad.  I think you get the point.  If you are looking for good sushi or teppan grilled food, there are far better choices nearby.
