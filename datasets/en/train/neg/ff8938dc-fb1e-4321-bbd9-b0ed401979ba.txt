Stayed here for 2 nights. It was awful. I felt very uncomfortable in the room, couldn't sleep. We ended up checking out at 4am the day we were leaving.. The hotel is RIGHT NEXT to the highway so you hear the cars/trucks/motorcycles all night long. 

Just a very uncomfortable hotel atmosphere. 

Also, they charge a $2.50/day service charge. They over charged me $5, but when I called, they did reverse the charge.
