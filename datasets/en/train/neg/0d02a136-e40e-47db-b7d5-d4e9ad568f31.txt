I do not understand what barbarians all of you 4 and 5-star reviewers were going to before you went to the European Wax Center, but I had the worst brazilian wax of my life here.  It took much too long, hurt much too much, left a great deal of hair in the exact areas that should have been waxed, I had horrible ingrowns, and the hair started growing back almost immediately.  This means that the waxer was not pulling the hair out by the root, but was breaking the hair off. 

I can safely say, after several years of having been waxed in the right way, that this is not what brazilian waxing is supposed to be.  Save your money and go elsewhere.
