Disaster!!!  Went to Cafe Boa for New Year's eve.  Had reservations for INSIDE.  They only had seating available on patio.  It was very cold and there were not enough heaters.  Menu was limited to 8 items.  They only had two meat dishes.  We were informed that the filet was not available and while ordering wine we were informed that the prime rib was no longer available.  No other meat dishes were available as substitutes.  We left.
No manager stopped by our table during the entire 45 minutes we were not being served.
