Way too expensive for small tasteless margaritas.  Go anywhere else if you like margaritas, heck even Chili's is better.  I think they must have bought their margarita glasses from Hobbitville in Salt Lake City or something or possibly the thimble store.
Not worth the time to even walk in.  Wish I could leave 0 stars.
