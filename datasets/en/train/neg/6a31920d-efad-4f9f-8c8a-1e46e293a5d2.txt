It started with the waiter- horrible, then went downhill from there.  The sea bass was brown inside, the filet was tough and had a horrible taste,  the crab cakes were served with tartar sauce and were bland.  The waiter rarely came around and when he did, it was like he was forced to and doing us a favor.  Do yourself a favor, 
DO NOT come here, there are much better seafood restaurants to go to that also treat you better.
