My boyfriend and I were in the area and decided to stop in for brunch. At first glance, this restaurant looked really dirty and cluttered. 

A couple of tables were filled with diners but there were definitely tables available. After a strange and awkward pause, the hostess snapped, "Do you have a reservation because these people just sat down and we won't be able to serve you for another 25 minutes!" I have never been treated so rudely by a hostess before. She essentially shooed us out of there, it wasn't even a matter of being seated, it was a matter of being served for another 25 minutes, which is not a problem. However, after feeling so disrespected, we quickly left and will definitely never EVER return.
