We went there for dinner and ordered the steak and all the shrimp you can eat. They ought to call it steak & all the shrimp you ain't gonna eat because we'll never bring that yish to you! They took an hour to bring the first round and 20 to bring the next for my companion. Forget about getting a refill, cause it's not going to happen. By then, we were Ret-tah-go. Then they tell us that we cannot box our food up. WTH!!! There will NOT be a next time.
