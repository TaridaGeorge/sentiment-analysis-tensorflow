I got my acrylic tips done here and they did a terrible job. The first person started on my nails then another person took over. They looked horrible when they were done! There were bubbles on the nail bed ( they didn't brush the acrylic on all the way). When I went to get them taken off 2 weeks later, they yanked them off with a credit card. After they were done, my nails hurt. I have had acrylics before and other places have done a better job.
