I can't comment on the food because we didn't get that far.  The place had a less than pristine feel when we walked in, but we were willing to overlook that.

It was when we watched the hostess toss her hair around (literally bending over at the waist to flip it forward then all the way back) and proceed to put her hair up in a ponytail, take it out and then repeat the process, that we decided we didn't have the stomach to eat there.
