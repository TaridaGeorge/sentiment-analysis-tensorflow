You can't point fingers and blame others when clearly inferior product (In my opinion) is the problem. I have no ill will toward any establishment. If you want good reviews, provide quality ingredients and good service. It's that simple. If this much effort was put into creating a positive dining experience, I wouldn't have written such a negative review in the first place. 

Now go away.
