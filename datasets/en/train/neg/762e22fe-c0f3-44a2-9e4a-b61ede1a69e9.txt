I always believe in second chances so my wife and family decided to try the BJ again after an extremely slow and bland   experience a few months ago.  We arrived this am, are seated and the staff was obviously overwhelmed.  Waited 20 minutes to be acknowledged and our order taken.  Food comes and the special was an apple French Toast, eggs and bacon.  Since when do you put apple cinnamon cream sauce on French toast not o mention undercooked all of the bacon.  Terrible (and I was not the only one at the table thinking it was terrible). Hare to say it, but there will not be another chance.  We tried!
