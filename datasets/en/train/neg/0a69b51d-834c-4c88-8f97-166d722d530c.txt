This husband and wife team are expensive and conduct unnecessary procedures to run up your bill.  Dr. Perez did such a horrible root canal job on one of my molars that I lost the tooth and now the bone wont heal...therefore I cannot get an implant!!  It seemed every time I went in, they would spend too much time "measuring my gum line" and not fixing the problem(s).  Dont waste your time or money on these so-called dentists.
