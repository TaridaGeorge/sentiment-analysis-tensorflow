gross. althought i would be the first to say that there is an extreme dearth of good Chinese food in the whole frickin' valley, this is definitely on the LOWWWWW end of the spectrum. so. 

i've been here twice, as the husband's family seems to like eating here. i mean, it's new and clean... but the food? has gone downhill. the first time (about a year ago?) was decent. now, it's just gross. half of the items we ordered were EXACTLY THE SAME THING, but with different veggies/meat. and it wasn't like it was GOOD so you were happy about it. no. it was gross. shudder. and honestly? that's all i have to say.

THE END.
