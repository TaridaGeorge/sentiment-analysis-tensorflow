Read the reviews... This place is complete garbage. 

I showed up at 7:45am from their advice because they don't take appointments. I was the 3rd person through the door and was advised it would take an hour or so for my alignment. They told me on the phone the day before the same, so I was prepared to wait. 2 and a half hours later, they hadn't begun working on my car and advised it would be *at least* another hour. I asked for my keys and left without the alignment I needed, and I can promise you that I'm never returning to another Fletcher's. This was my first and last experience with this pitiful company. It amazes me that companies like this are able to stay in business when they treat their customers like this.
