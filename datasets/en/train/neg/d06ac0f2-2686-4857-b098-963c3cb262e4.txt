I was delighted when I was contacted by Sarah (manager) through Yelp to elaborate a little more about my negative experience at King's Fish House 2-3 weeks ago. I sent her a message back through Yelp giving her my personal email so Danny the GM could contact me but I have never heard anything back since. Maybe they dont check Yelp that often.. I am not sure what the reasoning is..  :o(
