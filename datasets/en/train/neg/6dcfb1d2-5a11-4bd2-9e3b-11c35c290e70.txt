I heard someone call Applebees the Walmart of restaurants and I couldn't agree more. 

Everybody assumes I would love this place because it has apple in the name and I really like apple themed things. But no. Ugh. Gross. Nothing on the menu is good and the prices aren't even cheap!! I can understand cheap prices for cheap food but the prices are the same as Chilis or TGI Fridays. Except they have good food.

The service is always horrible. The only reason I ever come here is because my boyfriends parents love it. No idea why.
