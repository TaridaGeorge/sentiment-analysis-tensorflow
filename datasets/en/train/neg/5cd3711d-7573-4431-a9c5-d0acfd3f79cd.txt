I went to this store twice to buy a pair of nice work shoes. The first time I found exactly what I wanted and went up to the counter to get a pair to try on. The associate didn't greet me at all and took the shoe from my hand and went to the back to retrieve the shoes. I walked away before she got back. I went back a week later did the same thing and this was a different associate. She looked at me like I was a Leper when I walked up the counter took the shoe from my hand. Not one smile from either of these woman not one hello. I turned and walked away from this woman as well. This store hires stuck up 20ish snobs. They don't deserve my business and they won't ever have the opportunity to get it again.
