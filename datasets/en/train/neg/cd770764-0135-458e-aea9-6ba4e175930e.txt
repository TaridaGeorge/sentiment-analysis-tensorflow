Where does one begin?  Sat ourselves at a booth.  Had to wait 15 minutes for someone to ask us if we would like something to drink.  Took for ever to order food.  Food came out individually over the course of 10 minutes....  The food order was wrong and it did not taste that great.

Here are a few things that you will experience when you go if you decided to go at all.

Wait 5 to 10 minutes to be seated......
Wait 5 to 10 minutes to get drinks ordered......
Wait 5 to 10 minutes to get food ordered.....
Wait 5 to 10 minutes before you get all of you food to the table....

Not worth the experience...  Not worth the money....   OverEasy is far far better!
