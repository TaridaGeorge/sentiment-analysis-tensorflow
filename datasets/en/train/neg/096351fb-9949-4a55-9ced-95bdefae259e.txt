I only Boutique shop out of town for a reason. This place is filled with clothes that came out a few years ago.  Old Ts and hats, some of the hats looked worm and dusty. The people behind the counter didnt even acknowledge that we were there. Ill stick to my out of town shopping spree's. By the way a Boutique should never be in a mallllll!
