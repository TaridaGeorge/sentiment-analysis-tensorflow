Yelp says open till 11:00 pm, arrived at 10:00 pm on Saturday night to empty place and informed that kitchen closed 5 mins ago.  Driving 15 minuted with a larger group than in entire restaurant makes me feel that mgmt or owner was not present.  If kitchen closes at 10:00 pm, please say that in Yelp :-)
