Only reason I went here is because our car was purchased through DriveTime and their deal comes with 3 free oil changes per year (for the entire 5 year loan btw). Everytime we come here the mechanics tell of us of some leak or part that needs to be replaced. 

Little does Sears know that I have a personal mechanic on the side. After he inspected it, he informed me that there were, in fact, no leaks. Tsk, tsk!
