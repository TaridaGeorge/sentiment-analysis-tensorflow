I was blown away by my experience at this Jimmy John's.  The staff was BEYOND LAZY, sitting on the counter arguing over who would assist me.  I was the only person in the restaurant when a young girl (apprx 16 years old) came in and dropped off an application.  The staff then, in front of me, read over her application, made a few sexual jokes and discussed where she lived.  Sorry, but the sandwich will not make up for that!
