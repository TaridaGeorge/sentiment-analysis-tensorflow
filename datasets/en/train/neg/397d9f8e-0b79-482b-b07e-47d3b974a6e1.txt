I ate there last month. They do not serve your drink prior to the meal (in a can) even if you ask. Worst part was the food. The guy scrapped the flat grill clean from the previous two orders into my plate with the meat. NASTY. The place is a dump atmosphere wise as well. I have never written a negative review. WOW!  Great concept....get your act together guys. :-(
