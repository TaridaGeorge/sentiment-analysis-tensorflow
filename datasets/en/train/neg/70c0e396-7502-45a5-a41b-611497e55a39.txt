I had a layover in Phoenix on Friday, September 21st so I decided to get some food from Paradise in order to take on my next flight. I ordered 1/2 of the southwest ceasar salad and 1/2 turkey sandwich on wheat in addition to a lemon poppysead muffin. I ate the muffin and salad with no incident. On the plane (after takeoff), I unwrapped my sandwich  and wedged inside the bottom portion of the bread and otherwise not visible unless the entire sandwich was unwrapped was a huge STAPLE. I couldn't believe that there was a staple inside my sandwich. If I had not unwrapped the sandwich and examined it (to determine if there was mayo on it) I could have been seriously injured by ingesting this at 30,000 feet. Take a close look before eating anything from here.
