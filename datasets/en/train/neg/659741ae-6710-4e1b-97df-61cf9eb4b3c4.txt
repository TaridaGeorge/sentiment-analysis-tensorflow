I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.

The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor.

The Angus burger at McDonald's has better flavor than this one, and that's pretty bad.
