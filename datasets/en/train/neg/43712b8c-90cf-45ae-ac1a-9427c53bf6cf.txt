What a dump!! The waitress forgot my wife's order, brought the beer with the glass stuck in the top of the bottle. No traditional Japanese greeting when entering and I don't think they cared if I left or not- I hate places that you have to hunt down the waitress to find your order, then hunt the ass again so you can have another beer. Really if you're that lazy-- just stay home like the rest of the people who don't want a job. Never again after living in Japan for 5 years with good sushi every wear these people need some serious training- YUCK!!!
