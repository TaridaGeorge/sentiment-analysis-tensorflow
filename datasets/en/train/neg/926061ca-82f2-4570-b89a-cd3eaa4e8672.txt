I can't understand why anyone would like this place.  I saw the comparisons to Crazy Jim's and Pita Jungle so I thought I knew what type of food to expect.  Oh, but how I was wrong!.  I wasn't expecting the Persian Room.  However, I wasn't expecting them to run out of rice!!!!!!!!!!!!! Nor was I expecting the "grilled tomato" to be a giant, flavorless roma that had just been boiled and put on the plate.  I wasn't expecting the salad to be a chopped mess of iceberg with a couple of pieces of red onion.  And I wasn't expecting to wait over 15 minutes in an almost empty restaurant for all of this.  Oh Zaytoon, the pictures your post on your website are nothing like the food we got.
