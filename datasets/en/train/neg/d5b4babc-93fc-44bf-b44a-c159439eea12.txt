AMF Mesa Lanes is very similar in fashion to all of the AMF bowling lanes around the country that I have been to.  There are a couple of distinct reasons to why I give a lower rating. The overall service was okay because it seemed to take longer than usual to get us going to bowling.  There were not too many people that night.  Lastly, they took away our pitchers of beer at least 30 minutes before close.  I am not sure if this is protocol, but we had a designated driver and our drunk friends could have finished the beer.
