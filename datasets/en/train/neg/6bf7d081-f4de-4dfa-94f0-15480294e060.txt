This is the reason why I stopped going to shows in Phoenix. Venues like this are terrible! This venue is trashy and overpriced. There are rude "security" that treated customers like sheep. One yelled at me because I was standing by a corner. The venue was too big and you could barely see the band. Luckily, I got a ticket for free and my friend bought me a a pricy 5oz cup of Bud Light beer. The parking was ridiculous. We had to drive around for 40 minutes and still had to pay to park. Needless to say, I'm never going to this again. Not even if you paid me.
