Oh my God, tell me this place was just having an off night. 

Three of us sat on the patio on a not overly crowded Sunday night pre-Fiesta Bowl for a good 1/2 hour before we could flag down a waitress to remove the old check from the table and recognize our presence. 15 more minutes before our bad drinks arrived (I could not finish my nasty Cosmo concoction). Another 1/2 hour before spinach and artichoke dip, which tasted like vomit with cheese, showed up.

Terrible in every possible way, save the nice outdoor space - a dime a dozen in this area.
