Sadly with new owners comes changes on menu.  My fav Barbecue chicken salad
no longer has a hint of the same taste. It should now be called flavor of tomato. 
 Also sad to find out that the most outstanding veggie sandwich now tastes like it comes from another country. Again not a single hint of similarity of same flavor. Im sure many people will love these new changes.  Yet, Im sad it's not the same. I woke up today dreaming about the old veggie sandwich! No joking!!!!!!!!!
