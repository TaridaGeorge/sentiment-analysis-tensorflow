Why would they 'fix' something that wasn't broken???  The place used to be slammed all the time but not any more.
If I wanted cheap Asian slop on plastic I'd go to Panda Express down the street.  Pei Wei was my favorite place to eat and now I hate it there.  All my favorite things are gone from the menu.  My beloved Pad Thai and the Thai Dynamite are gone and so am I.
