I came here for brunch because I heard it was good and I always thought there food was ok.  It was pretty disappointing.  For ten bucks I got eggs that were still clear and pretty raw  and cold hash browns that were raw in the middle but seared on the outside.  The service was so so.  It took a long time to receive first drink.  In fact the fruit cup came before the drinks!   The fruit cup btw tasted like it had been stored with some fish!!  What the..?!  The waitress brought free "shots" to make up for the bad food.  They were basically some awful juice concoction.  If I ever come here again it will for sure b only for happy hour and will sit at the bar.
