Terrible installation job on our kitchen cabinets from IKEA. They left a mess, scratched our floor, damaged our dining room table. On call back, they refuse to fix the bad installation and take care of the damages.
What ever you do...do NOT use this company. You are better off doing them yourself with your eyes closed!!!  And they are EXPENSIVE!!!
