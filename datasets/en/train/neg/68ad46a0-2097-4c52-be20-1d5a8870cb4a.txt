You know that sign you sometimes see in storefront windows reading...NO SHIRT NO SHOES NO SERVICE?

These guys should have a sign on their front window reading.....DRESS HOWEVER YOU LIKE...YOU'RE STILL NOT GETTING ANY SERVICE!

Complaining to the manager won't get you anything either.
I think they're all 'in on it'.
Yes.
A food and beverage service-conspiracy.

TIP:
When someone in your party suggests you guys use the elevator instead of the hundred or so front entry steps...all because you've had eleven beers, four shots, and nothing to eat...remind them how your service was so bad you actually got drunk, passed-out and sobered up, thanks to the slowness  of your lame waitress.

CR...please tell me my server had polio or something.
It's hard to believe anyone could move that slow without a major health issue.
