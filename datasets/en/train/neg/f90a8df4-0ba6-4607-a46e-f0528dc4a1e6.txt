Red light special. This will be the cheapest roch room you'll find just make sure  your packing after dark, scratch that@ all times. If your a single non~obesit female ask to be escorted to and from the parking lot.  They take on water conservation to a whole nutter level by confusing and aggravating the hell outta you so yah don't take a shower.   The dim lit breakfest room is s o depressing you don't even wanna see the pet bagel. This bagel is so flat I'v newspapers thicker then this begal.  Also the  equipment in the fitness room is all broken.  One good thing; cheap.  Pool area is very nice and relaxing. The bar is also made for midgets.
