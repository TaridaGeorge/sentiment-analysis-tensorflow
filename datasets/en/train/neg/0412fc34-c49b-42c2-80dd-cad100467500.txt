First off---we waited almost 15 minutes before someone came over to take our order.--mind you, they only came over because we finally got out of our seats and asked for service at the table!  Second we waited almost 45 minutes for the food to come to the table---keep in mind we have 3 children with us all under the age of 8 so patience is gone by now.  Third, no refills on drinks and Lastly----we wanted to leave and pay the bill and once again our server was not helping us so I had to physically take the bill up myself to pay.  What a complete waste of time.  If you are looking for a good beer and WAY better service, do yourself a favor and go to Red Robin.  The service is much better and so is the food.  What a joke.  Never again.
