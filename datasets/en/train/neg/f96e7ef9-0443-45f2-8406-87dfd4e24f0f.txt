This place was grosser than gross. When we walked in the store had the most foul smell (cleaning products + fungi + mystery), which should have been an immediate reason to walk out, but my mom and I got some yogurt anyway, hoping it would redeem the trip.  It was not more than 5 minutes after consuming the stuff that I was expelling it from my digestive system. Sorry for the graphic description but I figured it should be said. I'll stick with Mojo Yogurt and never ever go back to Orange Leaf.
