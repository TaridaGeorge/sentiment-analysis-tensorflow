This place was just half ass. $15 per person and it doesn't even include a drink is awful. They also don't RO their water and even a lemon couldn't make it taste right. The crab legs were tiny and didn't have much taste. NONE of the food was above 140 degrees as it should be. I had a plate of cold food every time. I'm surprised I didn't get sick. Such a waste of money. I will never go back and I will tell as many people as I can how awful it is.
