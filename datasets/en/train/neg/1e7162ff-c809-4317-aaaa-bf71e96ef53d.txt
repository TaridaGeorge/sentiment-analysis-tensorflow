Stopped by to get the inexpensive exterior wash.  Got home and had to reclean the water spots left over from the wash.

8.99 is the minimum price to get the exterior wash or dried after the spot free rinse.  There are cheaper places that will actually dry your car after the machine wash so you dont get home with spots
