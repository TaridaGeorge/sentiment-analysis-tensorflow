Worst airline EVER! My boyfriend and I went to Catalina island for my birthday. We were stranded out there due to a huge storm, with no ferry or helicopter service to get us back to the mainland. Called the airlines to let them know we wouldn't be able to make our flight due to the bad weather and they wouldn't waive the change fee. So $400 later to be booked on a flight the next day. This will be the last time we ever fly them, Southwest will be it from this point forward.
