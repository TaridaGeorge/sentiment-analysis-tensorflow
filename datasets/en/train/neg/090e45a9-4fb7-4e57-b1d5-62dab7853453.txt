Had a late dinner there last Friday night after a visit to the MIM. Hostess dropped us off at the table with the reverse happy hour menu. Server was very adamant about it not being reverse happy hour yet, so we shouldn't look at that menu.  Ahi tuna was not fresh, in fact quite foul tasting. I told our server, who said "oh, can I get you something else?" I said no, and ate around it, leaving it on my plate. She cleared our plates, gave us the bill with out taking off the ahi. You can't sell crap fish and call yourself a sushi restaurant.
