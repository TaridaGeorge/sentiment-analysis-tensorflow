Wrote a review about this place and interesting, it is was removed....It wasn't offensive in language. ....I would not recommend this place to anyone.  Rude manager, horrible service, long wait for food and when we got the food the onion rings and fries were soggy.  The nacho chips were soggy as well...the server forgot part of the bar order.
This is was the second time visiting Zipps so I did give it another try but I know I will not be back and would not recommend this place.  One reviewer got it right...'if you sit at the bar and order a pitcher of beer and a burger you might be satisfied but don't bring a group of 5 or more'...you'll be stuck with horrible service and worse, the food.
Sorry, hope the review remains on Yelp.
