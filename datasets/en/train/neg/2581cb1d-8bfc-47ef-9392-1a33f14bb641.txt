We got there and told them we had a party of 8 but wouldn't seat us until all 8 arrived or even take our name down. When the other 4 arrived they wanted to seat us separate like opposite sides of the restaurant. Told us 15 to 30 minutes and seated people they arrived AFTER us BEFORE us. After 40 minutes. We said something. Got us two tables not together. Finally. If it wasn't for our server it would have been horrible. Very disorganized and hostess couldn't even do their job. Won't come back. Only reason it actually got one star was due to the server.
