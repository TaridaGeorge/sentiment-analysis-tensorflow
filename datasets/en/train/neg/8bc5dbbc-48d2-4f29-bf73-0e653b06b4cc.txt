I stopped in here to eat while waiting on a tire change at Discount Tire.  I thought this was supposed to be a family restaurant. The waitress (girl) had on shorts so short, she probably should have been working at the Candy Store instead.  SHAME on Pizza Hut for not enforcing a better dress code. Sitting in a booth & having someone come to serve you your food with their rear end hanging in your face is not very professional.  Sorry... will not go back.  Can't even remember how the food tasted because this ruined the whole experience.
