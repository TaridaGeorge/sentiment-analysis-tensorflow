WTF PEI WEI? I shalnt and willnt be returning to this location EVER AGAIN! 
Not only is the cafeteria like dining area lacking personality, it's now remarkably uncomfortable. 

On to the real reason we all USED to frequent the Asian affiliated eatery, the food. Unfortunately somebody decided to redo the menu, dropping a few of my favs which was tragic in itself, I mean I didn't even get to taste goodbye. My number one, numero uno did make the cut, Mandarin kung pao and i have always been close. But without the chunky pieces of chicken I have come to love and expect, It seems we have drifted apart. Something we said we would never let happen to us.

Do yourself a favor, avoid this pee wee altogether.
