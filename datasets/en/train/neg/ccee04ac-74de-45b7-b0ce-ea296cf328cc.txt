We have given this location 2 opportunities--the 1st time was drive-thru, we were not permitted to order more than 3 donuts, so we left. This morning I went in, we wanted 4 donuts, my wait was over 10 min. The staff seemed bungled by coffee orders, lack of bags (my 4 donuts were placed in a dozen donut box). Also, donuts are made differently at this location--thinking they started out as boxes of frozen donuts & defrosted at this store. Not a recommend at all.
