Omg!  I'm so upset that so how rude I was beening treated, I went in there for shoes & clothes.  I found one that I liked so I was holding one shoe and asked the lady ( well first, she was ignoring me when I went up to her she pretended that she was doing something when matter affect she look dumb running left to right behide the cash register :) ) when I finally get her attention and asked to try to shoe in my size, you told that the one I'm holding in my hand IS my size.   UNBELIEVABLE!!!  I was so pissed off I drop the shoe and walk out..   I'm so sad because I love their stuff.  :(
