I have been eating at Roy's from Coast to Coast for 12 years and this was the WORST experience ever.  The server was rude, impatient and very unorganized.  Someone in my party asked her for something and she said "Remind me later."  Really?  Then the guy filling water litterally spiled water into my Dad's lap TWICE.  The expediter, when he brough our food, told someone at out table with a shellfish allergy "don't worry, none of our seafood is fresh.  It's either frozen or canned."  Then, the busser clearing empty plates dropped a dirty, sharp knife right in my lap!  What a comedy of errors!  Our bill was over $300.00 for COLD food, out of a can and it was for my birthday which of course was runined.  If you plan on spending this kind of money...Go to Flemings.  Way better everything
