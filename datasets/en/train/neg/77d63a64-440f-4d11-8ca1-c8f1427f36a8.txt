Nothing good to be said. We were the only diners in there and the employees were busier than us because the were on their computer on the opposite side of the bar. I feel like we would have had more than an Antipasto platter (overly dry cheese, pre-cut I'm sure, and less than impressive cured meats) if there was any sort of service.
