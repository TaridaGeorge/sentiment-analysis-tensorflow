The food was okay, but it is way overpriced for what it is. The server was not very friendly, and she wasn't attentive.

If that wasn't bad enough, I ended getting FOOD POISONING from this place! When I called to let them know about it the next day, the hostess brushed it off and said that they never have gotten any complaints about food poisoning before. She didn't offer me anything; she didn't apologize.

I already would never have returned to Sushi Brokers after the meal, but after realizing that this place gave me food poisoning, and after they were so nonchalant about it, I don't ever want to see or think of this place again!
