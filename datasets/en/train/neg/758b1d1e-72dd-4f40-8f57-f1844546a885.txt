We used to do Pei Wei at least twice a month for take out. The food was always excellent. We haven't ordered from there in a couple years. My son and I went there for dinner last night. The service was pathetic.I ordered a chicken salad, the chicken had no taste, it was a poor quality, they bathed the salad in a sweet sauce. The worst part was both my son and I were sick for the next 12 hours. Pei Wei will not make it back on to our take out list. Management this location needs help
