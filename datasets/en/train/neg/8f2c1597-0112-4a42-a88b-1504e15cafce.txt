Absolutely the WORST customer service experience, on multiple occasions. I thought after the 1st time, maybe it was that person or that department. Nope. just went in for my 5th time since moving from Chandler to Down Town Phx. I WILL not be back. ever. period. This location is Terrible. Ive never written a bad yelp review, until now; nearly 12 hours after going and im still PO'd. I'll save the extremly long review because this macys doesnt deserve the time of day, nor anyones hard earned Money. Go to Biltmore or Chandler Mall instead; or Nordstroms. At least they understand our money keeps them employed.
