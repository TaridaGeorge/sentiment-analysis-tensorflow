Rude waitresses. Bad service. Microwave tasting food. Seems like it would be fun if the food didn't taste like garbage and the help was pleseant. It smelIs bad inside, kind of like vomit. I love dive bars but this place has taken it too far. I will never ever go to this place again and I would not send my worst enemy there. May God have mercy on Duke's soul.
