This location is 1 of the poorest-run Johnny Rockets locations in all of Phoenix, right up there with AZ Mills, Avondale, Arrowhead, Norterra and ESPECIALLY the location at Westgate, where the Cardinals/Coyotes' stadiums are. They should really consider changing their style of delivery, when it comes to how they approach customers.  The food is unhealthy and the service is lackluster at best.  Epic Fail!!
