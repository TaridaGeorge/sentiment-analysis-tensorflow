Our family stopped in for lunch one day having medium expectations.  We will not go back.  The orange chicken came out cold for my daughter.  Not sure if they just figured "oh its just a kid" or what.  The crispy shrimp I ordered was boasting of being lightly battered in a sweet honey sauce with vegetables.  It was everything but that.  The fried batter was just about all there was.  It took some effort to find the shrimp inside.  I am still in search of a great Chinese restaurant in Ahwatukee...
