Lasy nite we were there about 7 pm. It so incredibly LOUD, I had to yell to be heard over the noise. I ordered the A1 pepercorn burg and my girlfriend ordered the `prime rib sandwich. There was no silverware when our food got to us.The waitress said all the utensils were dirty or havent come out of the dishwasher?  My girlfriends sandwich and the coleslaw on her plate was warm,slaw should be cold. She bit into the sandwich,had a funny look on her face and pulled out a broken toothpick. The toothpicks that were in her sandwich originally were not broken. The manager was informed about this and picked the entire check up,but we would never go back there.
