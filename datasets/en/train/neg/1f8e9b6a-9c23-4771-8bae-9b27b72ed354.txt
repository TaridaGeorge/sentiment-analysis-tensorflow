i hate to do drop this down to 1 star, but i just have to. I took my parents and grandparents here for a special dinner, and everyone loved the food... until we saw a roach climbing the wall behind us while waiting for our bill. It completely overshadowed what would have been a great evening. We ended up waiting for our bill at the front of the restaurant, and i discreetly let the server know what the issue was was. They were super apologetic, but that only goes so far. Honestly, I won't be back. Luckily, there's another location near by that i've also been to that has just as good food. (note: menu's are not the same between locations. Which i find odd, but interesting.)
