I don't ask for much. When I order a sandwich, I ask for no onions or tomatoes, depending on what the item includes. 9 times out of 10, it arrives with the offending fruit/vegetable in its full glory. I politely remind the cashier of my order, get a polite apology and the food is remade, sometimes just by scraping off whatever I had originally requested not to get in the first place. Tomatoes leave "guts" all over the sandwich when removed, but I hate to waste food or be rude so I suffer in silence. I'm tired of this dance; the food is ok if you get what you ordered, but I never do, so I think I'm done for a while.
