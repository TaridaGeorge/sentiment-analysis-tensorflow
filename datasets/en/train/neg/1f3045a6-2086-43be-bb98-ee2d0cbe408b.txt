Had an appointment at 8am on a Saturday. First time to a AAMCO.  No one showed up.  3 mechanics sitting around and can't get it.  Waited 30 minutes and left.  Called an hour later and nothing. Finally I call and get the manager. Instead of trying to get me in and take care of me. It was nothing about excuses.  They are right we are wrong. Blah blah blah.  Seems they close at noon and was in hurry.  So its open late and close early.  If you don't like it go someplace else.  Sounds more like it was a sign to keep me from going in.  I will pass on AAMCO in the future.
