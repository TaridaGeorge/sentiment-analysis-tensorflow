This buffet is terrible.  I can't believe the reviews of this place.  The food tastes awful, the sushi was hard as a rock, and nothing appeared "fresh."  Everything fishy was just terrible. I nearly gagged when they brought food out in those grey dish tubs to the metal "bins."  It's like--really?  You can't class it up a bit?  For the price this place charges, they should be serving food on solid gold platters being carried by butlers in tuxedos!  I ended up resorting to eating fruit, as it seemed safe, and filled me up just the same.  Oh, and one last touch to this place: there is nothing quite like a buffet that has its employees announcing over a loud speaker to the kitchen staff what they need more of.
