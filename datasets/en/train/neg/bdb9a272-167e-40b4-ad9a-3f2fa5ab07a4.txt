First visit was fine, everyone treated me professionally and with respect. while trying to gather information about my records and make a follow up appointment i was greeted by Kayla with an unprofessional tone and an accusation. Its frustrating enough dealing with a life altering health condition, but to be met by a representative of your health care provider with this attitude and lack of care is unbelievable. Thought maybe this was a fluke so i tried again, only to be met with a similar attitude... there are other options, my recommendation is to try somewhere else.

Dr Wilson this person is a representative of your professional practice, is this the image you are trying to portray?  disrespected, and disregarded.
