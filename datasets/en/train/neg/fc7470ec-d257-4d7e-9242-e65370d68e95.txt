Just had the worst gel manicure ever and the experience was awful. I had to sit and watch as one techinician practically assaulted a customer only to be yelled at and basically pushed out the door by the owner for complaining. All the while the owner was yelling in Vietnamese. My own gel nails are so horrible that I am tempted to have them done over tomorrow somewhere else. Some of the technicians are good in there, I have been in there before but after today I will go elsewhere.
