I was asking about the pricing of coming for a class and the woman was so unfriendly and impatient with my that I got instantly turned off. She told me the pricing for September and when I asked about October she said in a very nasty tone, "why do you ask?!" Shocked, I replied "because I wanna take a class." What an awful way to treat customers especially when you are representing a business that promotes peace.
