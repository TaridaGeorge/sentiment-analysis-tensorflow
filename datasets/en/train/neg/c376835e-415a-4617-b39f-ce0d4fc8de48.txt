This is the worst walmart out of the bunch! and that's saying alot. It took me 35 minutes to get assistance trying to print out some photos! The first employee I asked for assistance told me he's off in 4 minutes and he still needed to count his drawer so he couldn't help me...Really! I wanted to scream. I finally got some assistance when I picked up the paging phone and across the intercome told the store I was a customer in photo that needs help. I have been in this store on several occasions and I am always disappointed with the lack of customer service and the overall "get it yourself, I am too busy to help" attitudes of the employees. I tell anyone I care about to stay away from this location!
