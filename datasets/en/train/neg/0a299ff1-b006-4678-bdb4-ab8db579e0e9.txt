The worst Mc Donalds I have ever been in.  Completely turned off when while occupying the restroom I was washing my hands and the person in the stall comes flying out, it was one of the employees, they did NOT wash there hands went directly to the counter ready to wait on us.  We were getting an ice cream cone.  Truly turned us off of that idea.   We not ever go there again.
