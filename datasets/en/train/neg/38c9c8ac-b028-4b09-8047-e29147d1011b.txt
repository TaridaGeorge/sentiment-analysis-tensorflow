On May 4, 2012, while on vacation, I had a pedicure with Christine who injured me by removing live skin. A deep wound quickly formed and became infected, causing great and constant pain and making walking almost impossible. At the time, the doctor came to look at the injury and advised against using topical antibiotic.
Now 3 weeks later the wound remains unhealed and the pain remains severe so that walking is extremely difficult.
I've called several times and the first time the doctor called me back. I've requested a refund and only received one for the tip. I have seen a doctor since returning to DC who is treating the infection.
What was to have been a relaxing hour was instead and remains a painful experience.
