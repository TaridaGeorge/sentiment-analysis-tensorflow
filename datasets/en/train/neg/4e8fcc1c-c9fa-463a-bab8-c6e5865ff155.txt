Intolerable. 

Sticky floors. 

Guttersnipe clientele. 

So say this is possibly the worst theater experience of my life is an understatement. When I used to live on this side of town, I'd visit this theater out of "convenience of location." Worst thing ever! Not only is the place run-down looking, but you should expect to have people talking through the entire movie, throwing things towards the front, and the employees to be about as useful as thermal blankets in hell. 

Going here is like pulling out my toe nails with rusty pliers, only mutilating my body and potentially getting tetanus would have a much more pleasant after effect. 

Don't go.
