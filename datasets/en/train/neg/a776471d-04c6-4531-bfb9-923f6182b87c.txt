Who is running SOuthwest now? This airline, which used to be fun and inexpensive has become a corporate nightmare. On 4.2.2011, our family tried to fly from Denver to Orange County. Southwest held the flight for 60 minutes so a pilot could grab a seat and fly home. Flying as a passenger not a pilot. The attendant told us not to worry that they would hold our connecting flight. No connecting flight, next flight was four hours later and it was two hours late. Staff, including supervisor Donny, said too bad, can't help you, Southwest is an independent airline and we don't work with other airlines to accommodate delays. He said we should complain to the FAA. We said you bet but we would also share our experience on yelp. Prices are outrageous and horrible attitude by all staff.
