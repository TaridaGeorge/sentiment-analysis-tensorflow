Good food....horrible service....worse management. I can't grasp the whole "we don't have servers assinged" bit. "We want everyone to feel welcomed so we have everyone waiting on you" bs! That's the worst way to run a restaraunt. Every time I've been they've forgotten part of our order and/or just ignorred us. Id rather eat at Liberty Market across the street. I've spoken to managment about the bad service and all the gal has done is make excuses. That's not how you run a place. I believe in word of mouth...and the words out of my mouth to everyone I know is not to patron this location.
