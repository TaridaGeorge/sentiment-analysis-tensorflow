OMG, drove up to the 101 location today for my salt and vinegar fix, and it is just gone with a dumb sign saying it had to close immediately for "business reasons" and to try one of the other locations that are all like an hour away!!! I am devastated. If they don't open a new one around here soon, I am starting a petition!!!
