I read the reviews here so I could go to my first bar!  It was my birthday and everything sounded great on here.  Sadly, this was a huge flop.  The drinks were horrible.  $8 dollars for watered down drinks and crappy cocktails that taste like they arnt mixed.  I was not pleased.  It was completely full the night we went, so I couldn't really enjoy the pianos.  I do not deny that they were talented though.  I don't think ill be going back here.  It was an unenjoyable first experience.  I hope to find better!

I hope you all understand maybe the environment just wasn't for me, but I will tell you 100% the drinks were crap.
