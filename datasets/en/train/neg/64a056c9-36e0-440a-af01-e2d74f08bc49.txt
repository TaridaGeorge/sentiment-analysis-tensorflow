Been here twice and each time ended up having to make a rush trip to the bathroom after. The first time the shrimp came out uncooked, I sent it back and it seemed fine. Barely made it out of the restaurant before I had to rush to the restroom. The second time around, I had the same issue except also 24 hours of stomach cramps. A few other issues with service but minor compared to routine food poisoning.
