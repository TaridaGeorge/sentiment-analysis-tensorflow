BEWARE!!!! DO NOT TRUST THESE PEOPLE!!!  
The Pain Center of Arizona personnel are dishonest and deceptive.  They have caused me more harm than good.  I thought they were supposed to help people, but they have caused me irreparable harm and an extra $333.30 for no reason.  Instead of the commonly known "First, do no harm...",  the Pain Center of Arizona's motto must be - "First, cause irreparable harm, then rip off the patient".  I will never return to these lying, uncaring harmful people.  Repeating the warning, I cannot stress this enough - DO NOT TRUST THESE PEOPLE!!!  BEWARE!!!
