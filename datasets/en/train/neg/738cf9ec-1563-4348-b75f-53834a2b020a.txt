Terrible....TERRIBLE!  Zero customer service.  "Dan" (manager?  service manager?) was particularly unhelpful.  If they don't want to provide customer service they should stay in the mail order business.  Try Landis, Slippery Pig or Focus for service.  Buy parts at Beyond Bikes, Jensen or Chain Love, forget these bozos......
