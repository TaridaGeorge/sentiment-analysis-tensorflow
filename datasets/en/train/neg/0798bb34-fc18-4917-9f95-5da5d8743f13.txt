So they advertise a three dollar car wash but when you get to the kiosk someone tries to up sell you and when you say no thank you, they inform you that the three dollar wash is actually six dollars now and the three dollar wash is actually just a touch up. whatever that means?  They are advertising at the street for a three dollar car wash!!
