One of the more hip breakfast places around, The Breakfast Club can get crowded on weekends with a sceney bunch.  They have great eggs benedicts - about 5 different types one of which comes with steak instead of ham.  

Always had a decent experience here, until recently when the Scottsdale blondie server gal was aloof the entire time and tried to stiff us on the tip.  The bill was $32, we gave her $40 and she tried to avoid coming back to face us - as if we'd leave.  Coincidentally she was within sight in the kitchen flirting with a guy server - giving him some back-scratching action.  We finally caught a busser to flag her down.  NO WAY SISTA...The customer decides what your tip should be - not YOU.  Not going back.
