Well...I drove all the way from N Scottsdale to get a few subs and three dozen cookies for a party this afternoon. After two hours of my time, fifteen bucks in gas, and thirty bucks worth of unedible deli food, I can say that I won't be back. The subs were not prepared as ordered, and I have three dozen Raw cookies...yikes. If I lived there I would go back, however I don't...and I have waisted enough time and money on this place!!
I will add however that the staff was polite...thank you for that!
