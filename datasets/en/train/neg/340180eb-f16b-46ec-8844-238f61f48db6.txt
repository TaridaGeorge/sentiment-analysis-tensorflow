I had been wanting to go to this restaurant since I moved to AZ. I love the FOX restaurants so my boyfriend made reservations for valentine's day. I had my hopes up but I wasn't really impressed.  We were squeezed into a corner table, the service was decent, and it was quite noisy . I didn't feel that I was able to experience the vibe of the restaurant being in the corner. I order pasta w/breadcrumbs/mushrooms, and I ended up returning it. It just didn't taste right. Desert menu was a disappointment as well. Overall, I wouldn't recommend the restaurant.
