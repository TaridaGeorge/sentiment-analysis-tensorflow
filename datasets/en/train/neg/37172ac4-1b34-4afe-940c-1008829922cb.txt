This place sucks. Waited in line for twenty minutes since there was supposed to be a "free" cover. Got to the door and the dooshbag bouncers didn't care to stand by what the advertised, so we spent our money elsewhere. I do not support businesses that pull bait and switches, and I hope others don't either. Im glad I didn't go there and had a great time at a much more upscale bar with less sloppies trying to get numbers.
