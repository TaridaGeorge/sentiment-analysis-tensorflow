I had the same experience as Anabel A.in the previous review. The man used his nails to push my cuticles. He has a dirty towel under my hand with nail scraps on it from people before.. he used dirty tools.. he coughed in my face... it was gross.. i should have known better.
never go here! i certainly wont.
