I like Red Lobster but not this location. I got some kinda food poisioning from the Shrimp alfredo from the Southern Ave. location. If you wanna know what kind of bathroom experience I had after Red Lobster, just pour yourself a big bowl of Cocoa Pebbles and let it sit for 2 hours and then throw it against the wall.  You then get the sight and sound.
