Maybe it will get better, but this was pretty terrible beer.  Had the Industrial Pale Ale, which just tasted weird.  Had a few sips and left it - not worth the calories.  The oatmeal stout is okay tasting, but pretty watery and weak - tastes like something from Salt Lake City where you can't have a beer higher than 3% or something.  The place looks cool, and the bathroom is nice, and the folks serving are pretty nice.  But, I'll head over to Taste of Tops, Four Peaks or Papago if I'm in the area.
