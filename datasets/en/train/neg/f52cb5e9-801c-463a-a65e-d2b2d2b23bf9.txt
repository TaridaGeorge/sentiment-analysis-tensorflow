another reason why west coasters are stupid when it comes to pizza; they like nello's! when i moved to Tempe, i asked a few natives what pizza was good and they all said nello's. i ordered a vegetable pizza and got sick from it! the cheese was not very god, the spinach tasted rancid, and the crust was thin. to top it off, the workers have that typical "I'm a cool republican frat boy whose girlfriend is on girls' gone wild" personality.
