YIKES!  There is no way this place deserves five stars!  The pizza was so bad I had to go to Fry's to get something else for lunch... but then again, I guess at $4 for two slices and a drink, you get what you pay for.
'Homey' is not a word I would use to describe this place.  The family of aggressively accented men who run the place are probably the most interesting thing about it... but it's not enough to make up for the rest of it.  I am definitely not coming back.  Just gross.
