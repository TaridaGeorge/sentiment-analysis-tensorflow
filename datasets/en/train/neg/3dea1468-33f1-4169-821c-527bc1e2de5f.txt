We came to The Thirsty Lion for lunch, and had a lackluster waiter. We had to ask for limes 4 times before he finally remembered, and he never once asked of we needed refills. My Father in Law ordered tomato basil soup that came out luke warm, my daughter ordered mac and cheese that came with super old and dried out celery and carrots on the side. I ordered the Kobe Beef hamburger medium. It came out raw in the middle and super salty! Needless to say, we were very disappointed!!
