Walgreen's=crap.  This particular location has me convinced to avoid Walgreen's altogether for matters of convenience.  Poor service in the pharmacy is common.  This is strange for a place that was built around the pharmacy business.  Pharmacists here=decent people.  The pharmacy techs=overpaid, spoiled pains-in-the-asses.  They consistently act as if they're doing you a favor by filling your prescription for you.  The vagrants here are also a problem  Just drive to new CVS down the street or wait until real stores are open for convenience purposes.
