Avoid avoid avoid. What is this place Japanese? Italian? Do they know who they are? We ordered seaweed salad - I think my frys has better salad for $2; my daughter ordered California rolls - very average; the pad Thai was as bland as I have ever had and the calamari was over fried and zero flavor - no wonder they offer  sauce. Kids liked the cinnamon flavored bread so that accounts for one star.
