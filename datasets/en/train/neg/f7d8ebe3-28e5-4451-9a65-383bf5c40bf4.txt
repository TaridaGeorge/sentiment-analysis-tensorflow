I was browsing on Target.com. and decided to buy some items. The items that I was purchasing were shoes and clothes. I figured if they didnt work out I could return them in the store. That is what it said on their home page in bold print. After the long processs of checking out, I saw that I could use Paypal. I thought" great, that will be easy they have all my info". Well when the items arrived they were ill fitting and  poor quality. No problem I can rerurn them...so I thought. Since I paid with pay pal they are only able to give me a gift card. I am so angry and disappointed, I just want a refund the same way I paid. I do not want a $156.00 gift card!
