Been going here for 3 years for cleanings, everytime, they "find" something.  Havent had a cavity since I was young, didnt feel anything but appartenly I had one, they drilled, drilled, and drilled on what was called a "small" cavity, and 3 weeks later I still can not chew on that side of my mouth, and will be going in for the 4th time to try to fix.  Let me point out I never felt any pain in this tooth before! They charge above and beyond what the insurance pays, and I feel like I am going to finance a car with the seperate room and the pushy office staff.  Good news, with this painful tooth ache, I've lost 5 lbs, maybe they should go into weight loss business!
