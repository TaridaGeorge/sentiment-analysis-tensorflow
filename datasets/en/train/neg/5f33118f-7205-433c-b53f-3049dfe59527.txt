The lamb is not meant for human consumption.  I normally do not make it a practice to order my cats $40 lunches.  The lamb literally had no seasoning...no salt...no pepper...absolutely nothing.  Poor quality...made the mistake of ordering without checking yelp.  The fianc√© said "rack of lamb" and "delivery" and I was sold.  Fry bread was a slight saving grace but even that was lackluster.   I will never order from this place or anything even associated with Navajo ever again.  Thank you for killing a whole culture .
