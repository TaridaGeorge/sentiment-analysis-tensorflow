I don't know what all the hype is about this place.

I find their deserts pretty disgusting, and i have tried numerous ones because so many people rave about them.  They have all tasted like metal, and the cookies are always dry and hard on the outside and chewy on the inside.  I like my cookies to have a consistent texture.

They don't have any vegan options.

Their coffee is horrible.  It always tastes burnt, and they charge $.75 for soy.  Most places no longer charge for soy, or if they do it is $.25.  I feel $.75 is exorbitant.

I am done giving this place one more shot.
