On Friday, April 16, 2010 The management at this Arena allowed a drunk misogynist with really bad hair to abuse and assault me, refusing to remove the person even when I went to the trouble of hunting down the manager/team leader. 

The blond hefty usher who clearly didn't want to be bothered to do her job,  told me that they had no authority to remove the patron who screamed "faxxot" at myself and my brother for an entire period of hockey, and then called me a C_NT, and shoved me as I left the stadium.  I had earlier complained to the management that this person refused to stay seated and they said they had no authority to remove him. 

No wonder they are going bankrupt.
