Dr. Genet is the Worst Chiropractor Ever!!!! I have had many chiropractors that have done a great job and at American Chiropractic Center they 
Really Suck...... I will never go back and I would never recommend anybody ever go to this location. The Dr.'s at this location are only concerned about the money versus the patient. Dr. Genet acts kind in front of your face but really only wants to take money from the insurance company. Anyone that I encounter about Chiropractic Services I will only tell them to avoid American Chiropractic Center at all possible costs!!!
