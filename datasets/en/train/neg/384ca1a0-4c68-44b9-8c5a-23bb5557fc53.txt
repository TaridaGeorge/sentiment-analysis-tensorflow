I have been there twice- 2 times too many. I had acrylic nails put on and they looked hideous. Prices are decent for a reason. The people were friendly, but the actual service was horrible. The nails were crooked and I had to go home and fix them myself. I actually thought to myself how stupid can these people be--- it's your job. Either way.. don't go there.
