I have tried Chipotle twice. Once in Arlington, VA and next, two years later, in Scottsdale, Arizona.   The first time I just didn't eat much of the burro. The Second time I couldn't take it and returned it.  The food was so over-salted I cannot believe this chain was started by a CIA graduate and that folks actually like it.   When I asked for something less salty the clerk (who was very nice) said everything was packaged at corporate and they had no control. Yuck.....Really poor quality. Can good marketing with poor ingredients make this much difference?

I will never go to one of these mass marketed outhouses again.
