This is really small Whole Foods and the prepared food is sad.  Go to the Whole Foods on Ray off the 101 and you will be MUCH better off.  I came here to make my own salad from the salad bar and I didn't know the greens were mushy until I came back to work and stuffed a bunch of mushy organic greens into my mouth.
