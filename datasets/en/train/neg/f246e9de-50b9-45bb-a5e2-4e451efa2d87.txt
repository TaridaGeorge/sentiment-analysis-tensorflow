The reviews of Zoe's Kitchen so far have been more than generous. Yep, it has cute decor but other than that it's some of the worst food I've ever eaten. I would give it zero stars, but Yelp won't allow that so I had to give it one.

My partner and I ate here and both wound up getting very ill. We each missed a day of work and he was so sick they have to put him on an I.V.

Stay away.
