The store can be bigger, but they have great customer service. My boyfriend and I were kicked out last july for something that we still don't know what we did. we made a complaint to the HR in texas, they were doing an investigation and we havent heard from them back at all. i was wondering does anyone know who the store manager at the tempe location is now? I believed it was eric, but i wouldnt be shocked if he got fired for that cuz he approached us off of whole foods property claiming we did something to his store.
