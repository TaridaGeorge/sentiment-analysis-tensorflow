Had to give it a one star to offset all the B.S here. In reality the service sucks 
and is very amateur. The phones are not answered management is never 
to be found and the staff is 2 star at best. If you want fruit or berries bring your own
dish bowel to wash it as you can be guaranteed these people didn't clean it.
The so called Kobe beef is of course of the cheapest cuts available for humans
and the overall brunch and regular buffet is poor.  If you want a good brunch try
the Camellback Inn, or the Westin which is actually cheaper and 10 times better.
