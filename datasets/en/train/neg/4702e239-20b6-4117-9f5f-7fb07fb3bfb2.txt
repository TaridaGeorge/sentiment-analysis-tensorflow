Do not go here unless you absolutely need to see a band.  I went last night, and luckily didn't have to pay for any tickets (I won them).  Venue is dirty beyond belief, like I don't want to touch anything for fear of disease dirty.  Hot, hot, hot, in a bad way.  If you are going to have a non smoking venue you need to enforce that, all kinds of people smoking on the concert floor.  Sound, was mediocre at best.  Parking was a rip off, and I don't think they even own the lot.
