This place has the worst greek food I've ever tasted. The meat was nasty and tasted like spam, the rice tasted like rice-a-roni, and the sauce was just gross. On the positive side, the lettuce was green and was as expected. Seriously, the only thing they got right was the lettuce.

Do yourself a favor and try another place for greek food.
