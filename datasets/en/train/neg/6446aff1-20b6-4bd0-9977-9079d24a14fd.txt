Ok, so the reason why i am giving this place such a low score is mainly because they take themselves for granted waaaay too much. I was looking for a diner for a long time and when i saw it from the road i thought: oh this should be fun!!. oh well, 45 dollars for 2 entrees is waaay too much. plus the food was not fantastic, the service was soo arogant and the overall feel was like the were all saing: come on, you know you love it.. which immediately turned my off...

hope you have a better experience

good luck
