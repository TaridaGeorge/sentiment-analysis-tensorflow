My experience could not have been more negative.  The doctor's medical protocol made me very sick.  She admitted to several errors but did not correct them then would not correct them when brought to her attention twice.  Her staff did/does not return phone calls.  There are too many doctors in the valley to put your health in the hands of this doctor and her staff.
