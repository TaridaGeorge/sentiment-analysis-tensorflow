We came here on New Years Day for a late lunch.  There were six of us.  The atmosphere was dark but clean if kind of out dated.  The service was indifferent but polite.  However, the food was terrible.  Nothing was hot enough and the quality was poor.  I'm sure the food temperature was well below safe limits.  I ate some of the food and am now feeling sick.  None of us will ever be back.  My recommendation?  Never eat here.
