Headed here for lunch since they're only open til 4.  Had coworkers who liked the place and I love gyros, so thought we'd give it a try.  

The customer service was meh but the place was clean so thats a plus.  We each got a gyro and fries.  The fries weren't anything special but hot and greasy.  The gyro meat was not delicious.  It was really greasy and dry at the same time.  I didn't think it could be both.  I coudln't even finish my gyro it was that bad.  Needless to say, we won't be here again.
