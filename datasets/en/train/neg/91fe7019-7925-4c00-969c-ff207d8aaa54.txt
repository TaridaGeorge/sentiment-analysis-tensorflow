Horrible. I wanted to love my dinner here. The new casino is wonderful and I figured this restaurant would be as well. But, from our first order everything was far sub-standard. The worst was the sushi roll.  Seriously the worst piece of sushi I have ever tried. One bite and I could tolerate no more. The Lo Mein was no better. 

I will never, ever eat here again. Please take my advise if you love good food and avoid wasting time and money here.
