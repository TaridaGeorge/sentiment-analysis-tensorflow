I didn't have much luck here--could never find a clerk available to help me.   I did see some female employees chit-chatting among themselves behind the customer service counter while I waited for their attention and passed by one old fart talking on his cell phone while I stood there waiting to ask a question.  When I turned around and walked away he called after me "Can I help you with something?" but I figured if he could ignore me then I might as well ignore him.  I left without buying and took my business to the Home Depot down the street.
