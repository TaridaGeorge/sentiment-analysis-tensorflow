1 star for some beautiful frocks and reasonably well-edited pieces. 0 stars for some of the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I have been in a couple times and after today, will never be back. Owner is rude.  Rude. Rude. Rude!  Go next door to The Garage or Joy Li. They are sooo nice and have beautiful things. And even though I would rather shop at a locally owned boutique, I would prefer to go to Anthropologue or Nordstrom where they value their customers over this place.  I am still shocked.
