I am surprised so many people like this place.  My family and I went last July and we swore we would never go back.  The burgers were dry, the food was overpriced, and the service could have only been worse if I had been verbally accosted and then burned by a grease fire.

I even tried writing to corporate to complain about the experience.  I got a reply from the local store asking about the problem but after I gave details of the experience I never heard back from them again.  

I truly can not believe Cheeburger can stay in business with a Red Robin in the same parking lot.
