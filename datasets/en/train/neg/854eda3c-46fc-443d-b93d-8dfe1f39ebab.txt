Horrible customer service.  Their iPhone site says open on Sundays for service.  Well guess what this changed in march (3 months ago) and they never bothered to change it o. Their mobile site.
  
To top it off, some jerk salesman tried to joke around that he would do my repairs for me.  Then he told me that I was wrong, until I showed him my iPhone with the I correct information.

You'd be best off going to another dealership where they have an accurate Internet site and don't insult their customers.
