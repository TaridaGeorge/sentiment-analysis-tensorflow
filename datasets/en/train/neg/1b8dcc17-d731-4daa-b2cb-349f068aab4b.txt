I really want to like this Native New Yorker as it is close to my house.  I have been to various locations around the Valley and generally enjoy the food and atmosphere.  This location though is woefully inconsistent in both food quality and service.

Ever since this location has been open I have been disappointed that one week food quality is great but then the next time food is either under or over cooked.  Specifically the Chicken Wings, it's a roll of the dice wether your wings will be undercooked and slimy or overlooked and dry. The wait staff tells me this is one of the biggest complaints they get.  Unfortunately after years of complaints management can't seen to get it right.

Look elsewhere if you want good quality Chicken Wings (Wingstop #1, Buffalo Wild Wings #2) or any other Native New Yorker.
