This is usually how thinking about the Colonnade goes for me:

"I need to get some of that sweet new Martha all-purpose paint from Michael's"

.5 seconds later:

"Meh, I'd rather stay home than deal with that parking nightmare"

Then I'm sad because I don't have the new Martha all-purpose paint.

Wah wah.
