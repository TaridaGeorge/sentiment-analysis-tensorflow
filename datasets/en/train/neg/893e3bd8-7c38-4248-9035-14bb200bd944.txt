More often than not staff are extremely rude, to both customers and each other. Orders are rarely accurate and service is slow at best. A clean table is a rarity so I went through the drive-thru; my order was incomplete and without a receipt. 

After a dozen or so visits I have finally learned my lesson and will never patronize this JnB again.
