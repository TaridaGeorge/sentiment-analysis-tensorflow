Would not fix a problem that should have been caught by any competent Fedex worker. 

If I have to use Fedex ever again I will go to another drop off location.

Thanks to this shipping location for letting me post my first one star review. 

Don't want to waste any more of my time typing any more about them.

Did I mention the customer service was bad?
