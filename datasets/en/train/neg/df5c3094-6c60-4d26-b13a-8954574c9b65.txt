With the attitude that the staff has with their customers, I'm not sure how they've been in business this long. Their food is good but the times that I have gone there the customer service is pretty horrible to say the least. The kid that runs the pick up counter not once, not twice but every singe time throws the receipt at me. No thank you, no smile, no nothing! Horrible service from the entire staff!!
