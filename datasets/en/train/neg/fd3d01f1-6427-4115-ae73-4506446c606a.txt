The quality of yogurt is same as other location. But the toppings are quite less then other orange leaf location.

THE MAIN REASON FOR 1 STAR is CUSTOMER SERVICE. The owner seems to be very unhappy when asked about spoon/small paper cups for testing. I haven't seen this kind of resistance at any other yogurt shop. Even though I live nearby, I prefer to go to other Orange leaf location purely because of customer service.
