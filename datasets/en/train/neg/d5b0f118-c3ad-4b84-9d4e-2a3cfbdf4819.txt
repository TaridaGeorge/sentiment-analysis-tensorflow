This place is a cluster(fill-in-the-blank!) well, at least Terminal A is. Not enough seats, lots of slowwwwww old people milling about. I guess I wouldn't mind so much if it didn't take me twice as long to walk to my gate to weed my way through the maze of people that can't walk at a reasonable pace or with the flow of other people. This is my first time going through Phoenix for a connecting flight. It will most certainly be my last.
