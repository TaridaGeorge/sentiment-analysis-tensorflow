EW, this place stinks! Literally I don't know what the funk that smell was but it gagged me at the door. I decided to check out the buffet. It looked a mess. Most dishes were overcooked. The Mongolian BBQ had raw beef, chicken, pork and fish sitting out in what I would call a salad bar. The meat looked old and the beef was starting to turn. It wasn't even covered yuck! 

I decided I did not want to spend the night in the ER having my stomach pumped so I left. This is a scary place enter at you own risk. 

My taste-buds were spared the torture, I went to Famous Sam's and had some wings!
