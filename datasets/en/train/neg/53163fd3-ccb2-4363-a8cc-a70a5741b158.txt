Service was terrible. The server was nice, but not very efficient. If you want a better alternative to this same style of food try out YC's. Genghis Grill not only doesn't taste as good as YC's, but the portions are smaller and you are required to have a server you must tip. Overall YC's is the better bang for your buck and tastes quite a bit better.
