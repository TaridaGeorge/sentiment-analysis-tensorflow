I always have to try little hole in the wall places. Most times it works out. Not this time!!!

Very unappealing. Bacon was cheap and very small portion. Eggs over medium average. And biscuits and gravy poor. They did not have any flavor and gravy was watered down.

Pricey for the poor quality. 

They also did not offer Egg Beaters which is what my companion was looking for.  So she had to settle for a burger that was average at best. 

Oh well, off to the next hole in the wall.
