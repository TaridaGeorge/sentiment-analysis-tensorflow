recently used a "lunchclub.net" two for one coupon for lunch. my associate had the philly steak and i had the lemon chicken. both meals were short of expectations. the steak sandwich was a poor version of that meal. my chicken was very salty and the vegetables (steamed) were limp. needless to say, even with the coupon(still ended up paying over 20 bucks w/2 iced teas) , neither of us will be returning.
