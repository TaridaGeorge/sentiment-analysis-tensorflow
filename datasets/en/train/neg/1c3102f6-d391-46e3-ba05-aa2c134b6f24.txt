Are you kidding me?  When we showed up it was 90 degrees in the dining room. Coolers only it semed. We left no ones food is worth that. They should try and spend a little money on making their  sucker customers more comfortable while they eat. It just goes to show they don't give a rats ask about their customers, and it makes me wonder what their kitchen looks like...
