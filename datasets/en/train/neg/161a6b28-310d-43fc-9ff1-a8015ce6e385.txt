Not much of a resort. I would have been very disappointed if we would have got a room there for a true resort stay.  We stayed there for the Cavecreek Wicked Halloween event. They did have a 24 hr shuttle which was great in that situation. The room was still better than the drunk tank but not by much. The room was very dated.  It didn't even have a fridge.  The lobby and grounds were nice for the most part but all in all I was not impressed. I have stayed at Holiday Inn Expresses nicer.
