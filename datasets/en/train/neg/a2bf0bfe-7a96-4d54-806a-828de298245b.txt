We ate at Rico's for dinner on Sunday night.  By far the worst service we have ever had.  From the surly hostess to having to ask the waitress for our drink orders.  Food service was extremely slow.  Waitress even messed up the food order.  It was recommended by the concierge at the Pointe Hilton.  He should be ashamed for recommending it.
