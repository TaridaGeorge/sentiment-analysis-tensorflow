I used to stop at this store, but since they changed it (for the worst), I won't bother to go there again. The parking has always been a nightmare (and still is). I didn't see one thing worth spending my money on. You can find much better stuff at Antigue Gatherings (on Indian School) and the prices there are still very reasonable.
