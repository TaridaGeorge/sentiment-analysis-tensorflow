Great food...long wait to be seated.....very long wait for food.

Once the four of us ere seated, we ordered hummus, drinks and entrees. We decided to place all of our order at one time because we waited 40 minutes to be seated for lunch.

The drinks came quickly.  No hummus. A family of three was seated next to us.  They ordered.  Their food arrived before we were served our hummus.  Then we waited for our entrees.

THIS IS THE REVIEW I WROTE IN LATE DECEMBER?  I RECEIVED A REPLY FROM THE RESTAURANT WITH IN MINUTES OF POSTING.  THE MANAGER SAID TO EITHER CALL OR RESPOND BYBEMAIL.  I RESPNDED BY EMAIL AND NEVER HEARD BACK?

I SENY A SECOND EMAIL AGAIN NO RESPONSE..

I SUSPECT THEY HAVE AN AUTOMATED RESPONSE AND NEVER READ THE COMMENTS.
