Unless you are looking for drinks, save your money. Area was rundown, shop area had empty shelves and limited selection of sizes, and the fun was average.

Decent for drinks or watching sports but don't make a mecca for this place. The big unit I had was below average. Bun was hard. Hot dog was flavorless and chilli was bland.
