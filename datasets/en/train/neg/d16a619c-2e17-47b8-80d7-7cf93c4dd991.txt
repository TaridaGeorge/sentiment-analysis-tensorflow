Sprinkles cupcakes is nothing special and it just goes to show marketing is everything. The service is great and the presentation of the cupcakes is nice. When you see the pretty cupcakes in their nice box you really think you are getting a gourmet cupcake like other bakeries. The red velvet cupcake was Just ok. The Carmel apple and cinnamon sugar cupcakes were muffins. They were good but I was expecting a cupcake. The chocolate vanilla with sprinkles was the best but nothing to write home about. There are tons of great bakeries out there with amazing cupcakes. I will never come back here and I hope one day more people see past all the gimics and realize sprinkles is just a fancy store selling over priced regular old cupcakes and muffins.
