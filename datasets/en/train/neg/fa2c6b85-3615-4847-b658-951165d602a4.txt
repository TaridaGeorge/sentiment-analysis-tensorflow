I've eaten here 3 times and I kick myself for going back the other 2 times. The first time it was terrible. It was fish and chips and there was nothing but heavy batter, you had a hard time finding the fish, it must have been thin as a sheet of paper. But I gave it a second chance, figuring it might have been a bad day for the cook. So this time a got adventurous and had a rib-eye steak. What a disaster, it was cooked dry, so overly done I couldn't cut it with a knife. I asked for medium-rare. So, convinced I would not ever go back, until my neighbor begged me to go with her and again, terrible food. This place I would never recommend to anyone and I made it very clear to my neighbor I would not be returning.
