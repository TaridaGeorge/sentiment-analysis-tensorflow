Recently ate at Joe's for the second time and was disappointed. I love Liberty Market and Joe's Farm Grill, but Joe Real BBQ has a lot to learn from its sibling restaurants.

The food we had was pulled pork, cheesy potatoes, corn. All 3 were in order were dry, dry and soupy/flavorless.

I love some good barbeque, I hope this was an off night for the real cooks that I had the first time.
