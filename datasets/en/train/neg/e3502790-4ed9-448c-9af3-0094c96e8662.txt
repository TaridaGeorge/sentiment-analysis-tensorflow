After our second visit I feel obligated to share my thoughts with anyone from the East coast.  On both occasions the cook (not chef) overcooked even the veal, burnt edges?   The pizza  (both kinds) was the worst I've had in the 35 years of eating the valley's offerings.  Greasy, flopping, wet and burnt, and they have the balls to name this place Crust!   If the owners ever read this stuff they should pay attention to their Tatum & Bell location.  The wait staff was fantastic, the cook should seek other employment opportunities, maybe landscaping.  Or at very least send him to N.Y. to try an example of what he is trying to do!   Calamari was left in the fryer so long it was like eating a light bulb, they did correct it but the harm was done.  NEVER AGAIN.  You all have been warned,  good luck.
