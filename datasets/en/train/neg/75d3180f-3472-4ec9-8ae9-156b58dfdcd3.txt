I quit going there, my manager did not.  He came back from JJ's, looked in his bag and started shaking his head.  He had asked for mustard and mayonnaise packets.  Guess what wasn't in the bag?  "They can't get anything right.  It was a simply request.  You'd think with 20 people working back there they might get something right". 
I no longer patronize this establishment, they have proven beyond any measure of doubt that their employees could care less about whether they get your order right or not.
