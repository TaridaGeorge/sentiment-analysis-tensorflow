I just got an order of Chicken Supreme to go and I am NOT IMPRESSED!  The flavor is really good but the consistency of the chicken and the breading tastes pretty sad.  Ive been here before and enjoyed my meal, but this may be my last meal at Lychee Inn.

I didnt even finish my meal, im feeling sick to my stomach...
