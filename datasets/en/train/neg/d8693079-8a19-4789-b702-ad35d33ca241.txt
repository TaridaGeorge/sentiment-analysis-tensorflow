THIS PLACE MAKES ME SICK! 

The worst customer service I have ever come in contact with. Saw me one time and decided that they could not do the surgery on my teeth and kicked me on the street. So, I paid them to take a look and my teeth and get no service out of it. I called back to see why I was unable to be treated and the young lady there could not give me an answer and everyone else was busy. She said somebody would call right back and no one every did. 

DO NOT BELIEVE THESE OTHER REVIEWS, I AM SURE THEY ARE STUDENTS THERE. HORRIBLE SERVICE AND BAD ATTITUDES IS ALL I GOT FROM THIS PLACE.
