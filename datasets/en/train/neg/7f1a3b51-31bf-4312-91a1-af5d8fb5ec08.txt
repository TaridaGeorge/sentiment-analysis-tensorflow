My family and I have been dining at Sakana on Elliot for at least a decade and for the most part, have been very satisfied with our experiences. In fact, we would call it one of our "go-to" places. Over the last 6 months or so however, that has changed and as of today, I will not go back. Craving fresh sashimi and being consistently disappointed has not been good for my loyalty nor my pocket book. Today, my son and I tried yet again, wanting to give Sakana another chance. Today the albacore was fishy and mushy, some of the other fish was "borderline" and my cucumber roll lacked any substance or finesse.We were told nothing would be done in terms of compensation (i.e. taking something off the tab) because we did not inform them in enough time. Poor quality food, poor service...big bummer.
