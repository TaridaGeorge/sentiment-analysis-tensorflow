screw this place!  I brought my 5 year old daughter, my 5 year old niece and my 8 year old niece in here to get their nails painted for a Christmas party and they basically refused service because of the kids.  What ASS holes.  I will NEVER come back here and that's too bad for them because I frequent here often.
