My party and I sat at a table for 45 minutes and never even got menus despite being approached by a server twice and told we would be helped shortly. It wasn't even a busy night, and when we finally decided to leave and go elsewhere, we saw the servers chatting casually with each other by the kitchen on our way out. I eat out at least once a week and I have NEVER encountered service this terrible.
