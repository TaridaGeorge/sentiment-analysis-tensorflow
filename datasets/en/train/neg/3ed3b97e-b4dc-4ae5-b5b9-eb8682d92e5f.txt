Service was quick. When we ordered he didn't even ask if we wanted a salad or an appetizer. I order the pasta with manilla clams, one of the daily specials.  Pasta was not al dente it was almost raw and a lot of it stuck together. It was not homemade pasta but store bought kind. Sauce was over seasoned and way too salty.  Wanted to try this place because prices were reasonable.   My husband who only knows how to use a microwave said he could make pasta that tasted better then what we had here.  He had the veal parm. Will never go here again!
