Came here to eat with two kids. Ordered meals that would qualify us getting two FREE kids' meals but credited only ONE. The excuse was that I would have to buy two sides if I wanted to get two free kids' meal. There's nothing stating about ordering sides on the promotional add that was posted on the window. What a bunch of BS!!!! If they are pulling that stunt, then no more trips to JR.
