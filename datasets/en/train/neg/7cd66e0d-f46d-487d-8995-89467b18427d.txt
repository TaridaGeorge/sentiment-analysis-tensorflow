I always enjoyed this place prior to its remodel. The staff was always nice,Now I must say its the worst McDonald's EVER! They never seen to get my order right, food is always cold and never fresh. For all who want to complain I finally was able to get a correct phone number. (602-404-9785) Spoke to the so called manager Mariciela, while I was explaining the situation she was not even paying attention just giggling while I was speaking. Didn't seem to even care. NEVER AGAIN WILL I GO HERE FOR ANYTHING, EVEN IF ITS FREE. Just wish I could give a negative stars.
