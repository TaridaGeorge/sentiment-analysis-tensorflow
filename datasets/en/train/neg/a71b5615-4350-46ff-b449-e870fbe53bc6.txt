Happy hour is the only time this place is worth the effort. The portions are small, and all of the drinks are made with Skyy vodka and not much else. The servers aren't very friendly either,  and they seem to spend more time gossiping than taking care of customers. I'd rather take a risk at a hole in the wall sushi place... Blue Wasabi is no longer relevant and the 'blue' wasabi they serve with the sushi is ridiculous. I don't recommend this place to anyone in gilbert or scottsdale. Not impressed.
