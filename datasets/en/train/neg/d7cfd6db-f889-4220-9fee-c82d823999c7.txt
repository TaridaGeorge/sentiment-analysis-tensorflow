This is THE FIRST place in my life that has insulted me... There food isn't that good and the bartender Steve had the audacity to tell me I ordered TOO MUCH. WTF? Even though I expressed to him I would take it home if I had to. The interesting part is that through another conversation he gathered that I started going to the gym...therefore HE DECIDED I didn't need more food...hhhmmmm who the hell is he? I spoke to the owner, tammy, on the phone, to try and express the incident...SHE HUNG UP ON ME... after she called another employee back I found out, she commented that she couldn't speak to me bc I was in"bitch mode" Never will I EVER RECOMMEND this place.... They suck are are discriminating and unprofessional and there is nothing left to say.
