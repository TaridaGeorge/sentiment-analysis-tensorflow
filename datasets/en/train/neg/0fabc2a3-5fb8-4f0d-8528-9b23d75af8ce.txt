Whats wrong - I am uncertain where to start. 

The music was horrible, the DJ was an absolute douche bag (DJ Blade) who just played some stupid songs whose best DJ-ing efforts were a few scratches on the turntable too many. Hideous. 

The drinks were horrid. Not just the glasses they were served in (Mine had a crack in it!) or  the ice they use but even the drinks. They somehow could mess up simple orders as gin and tonic by insisting sodawater out of a tap is tonic. 

Shabby, horrible and down right rotten.
