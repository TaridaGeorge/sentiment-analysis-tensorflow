I went here in November 2003 and was not impressed at all.  The place is dark, dirty and dingy...my burger was small, overcooked (and I like things well done!) and not all that impressive - taste wise.  The fries/onion rings were about average and the cost was not as cheap as many people would like you to believe.

Now, keep this in mind - I had yet to try In-N-Out Burger when I decided I did not like The Chuck Box...once I had In-N-Out, it was all over for The Chuck Box.

I have no idea why anyone would go here with In-N-Out only a short distance away.  In-N-Out tastes better, it's cheaper and definitely cleaner...I wonder what frequent visitors to the Chuck Box think about it being dark as hell...maybe to cover up the grime?
