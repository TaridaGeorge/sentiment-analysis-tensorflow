This place sucks! The owner waited on us and her frizzy nasty hair was hanging down and all over the place. I guess because she had a hat on it was ok YUCK beside that she is a terrible waitress and this is the second time she has waited on us. The prime rib was the absolute worst we have ever had, the mac and cheese was pasta with milk no flavor at all. The owners kid runs around, screams and acts like a heathen and they think its cute and thats what paying customers want to experience when they go in there. We wont be spending anymore money in that place.
