Dry/Reheated:  I kid you not I walked in after the lunch rush and ordered a few slices of pepperoni pizza, the guy (without washing his hands after taking the money) walks to some left over lunch cheese pizza sitting on a counter tosses some pepperoni on it and chucks it back into the oven.  This pizza looked like it had been out for a few hours and it tasted like it did too (yes I bit into it against my basic instinct...I was hungry!).  Needless to say I didn't finish it, the two men at the front counter were not at all friendly in any way and I felt like I was interrupting break-time when I ordered my slice.  

I didn't feel "Italian" anything from this restaurant setting or menu.
