Really? Not very professional and merely sub par. Tiny and cramped salon. No top coats for finger nails or toes and no scrubbing the balls of my feet. (Which is why most of us GO get a pedicure) Seemed like they wanted to sell me some all natural products, while trying to pull me in with their "fun" personality. Sorry, I'm going back to Capri Nails!
