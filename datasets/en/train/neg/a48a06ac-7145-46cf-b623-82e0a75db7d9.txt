Disclaimer: I am a Thai person and a Thai food connoisseur. 

This is supremely average Thai food and overpriced as heck to take advantage of White People. Sorry to be blunt but that's all it is. $18 dishes that are $8 at a real Thai restaurant. The spring rolls were very bland and came with only a tiny bit of sauce for dipping. They should also include on the table a selection of fish sauces and spices to add to your meals and appetizers. They dont have.

If you like spicy, skip it for sure. Again this is what we would call Tourist Thai back in Thailand. 

Tiny servings.

The good. Friendly wait staff.

If authentic Thai is what you're looking for try any of these: Palees Crown, Tum Nak Thai or Royal Thai Grill.
