Somebody tell me where I can get a decent haircut and good service. Still looking and I have a lot of haircuts left in my life time.  I was passed over 3 times today after waiting for 45 minutes.  I finally got up and left.  Never returning to any supercuts ever again.  Don't waste your time or money at any of them!
