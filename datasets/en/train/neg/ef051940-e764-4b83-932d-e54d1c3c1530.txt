I hate this place.  Drugs in the bathrooms, drunk d-bags shoving people on the non-existent dance floor, bottle rats scuttling from table to table.... basically my idea of hell.  If you are 22 and don't know what class is yet then maybe this is your kind of place.  Otherwise, keep your money and stay far away.
