My husband was referred to Dr. Ralph Bennett with this practice by our pcp for extreme joint and tendon pain. After more than one year of extensive and EXPENSIVE diagnostics here was the result:
1) NO diagnosis
2) NO treatment plan
3) NO recommendations for how to manage the excruciating pain
We would not recommend this doctor nor this office.
