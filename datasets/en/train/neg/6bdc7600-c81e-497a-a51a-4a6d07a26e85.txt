The food is good here at The Herb Box; however, the service is very Poor!!
I have been a patron of this restaurant for a little over a year now, frequenting the restaurant whenever I'm in town. Sadly, I have begun to see a decline in the quality of the customer service and wait staff.
Being an entrepreneur myself, I felt it important to notify the management; however, it quickly became clear why the service has begun to suffer...
There are  better restaurants in the vicinity with a larger selection of food with great service!!
