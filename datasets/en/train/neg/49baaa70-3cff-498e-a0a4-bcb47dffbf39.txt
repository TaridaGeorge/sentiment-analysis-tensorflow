BE CAREFUL!!!!

Even though you are walking into a Lens Crafters store to get treatment from Dr. Irene, you are not dealing with Lens Crafters.  I went to Dr. Irene's office to get contact lenses, and I was told on the telephone that it would only cost me $15 for the exam (my insurance co-payment).

But it turns out that you have to spend an additional $60 to get a prescription!  

This is a RIP OFF!  Why would my insurance pay for an exam that doesn't include a prescription?!?

The doctor was nice, I guess...but I couldn't think of anything else except for the way I was getting ripped off.  It would be MUCH CHEAPER to go to an optometrist that wasn't located in a mall.  Seriously.
