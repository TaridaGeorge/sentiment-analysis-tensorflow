GAP (Great American Picnic) was a greatly reduced event from previous years. Ridiculous security checking everyones ID so they could drink. I have gray hair and am well over 50. Did they think I was under 21? I think not. 
The food was dull and expensive. Mostly Mexican and beer. Ho hum. No chic or trendy places. Well maybe Stingray sushi is. It had better be, since they wanted $3 for one segment of a sushi roll. When I saw the stingy portion (oh, maybe I have the name wrong. Maybe it is Stingy sushi?) I asked for my money back. 
I planned to buy $40 worth of tickets. I had trouble spending $10 because the choices were so dull.
