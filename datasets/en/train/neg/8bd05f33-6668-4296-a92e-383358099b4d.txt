Another vinyl-retailer casualty...I'm sad to see it go, because I am pretty old school and I do appreciate being able to get good releases on wax, but truth be told, I only bought one record from this place in the 6+ years that I've lived here. I never came across much here that caught my fancy, but there was always an abundance of boring 4/4 house in just about every boring subgenre you could imagine(progressive, tech, blah blah blah).
