BEWARE Identity Theft Warning! - This hotel refused to check me in unless they make a photocopy of both my driver's license & credit card.  When questioned how this information is handled I was told it kept in the office.  So they have a photocopy of your license and credit card and this information is not destroyed once you check out.   They also claim that it's the policy of the credit card company to make a photocopy of the card which it is not.  Apparently having a valid credit card and driver's license does not guarantee you a room at this hotel.  I ended up speaking to 3 people and challenged their policy and was willing to walk out and find another place to stay when they finally agreed to let me stay the one night.  YOU MAY NOT BE SO LUCKY.
