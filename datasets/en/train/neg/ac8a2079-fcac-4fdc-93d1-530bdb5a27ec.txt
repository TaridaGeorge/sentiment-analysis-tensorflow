i have to agree with the negatives here too! themost that stands out is the poor insulation!! i swear i can smell my neighbor's smoke weed thru the vents!! then the office people with their bad customer service! And it took two days just to get a bulb replace in my kitchen! (U had to get a work order for that)

the only reason we moved here was that they made it so easy to move in as zero move-in cost! hopefully moving out is going to be as easy moving in!!
