The dead walk amongst us.  This location is D-E-A-D and they're down to hawking the fixture's on the street. You might find some last ditch deals but you probably need to do so by month's end (Feb 2009).  Looking dire on this end of Mill Ave.

Thanks Tempe Marketplace for killing what was once cool.
