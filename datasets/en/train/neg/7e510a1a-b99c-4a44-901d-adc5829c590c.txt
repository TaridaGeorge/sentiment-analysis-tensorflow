This place is way over priced for regular breakfast food.  Might as well go to Denny's for half the price.  Even the bacon (namesake) was not even thick cut bacon.  It wasn't burnt I guess..  And why do they have hershey bags everywhere?  I didn't see any chocolate on the menu...

Oh, and they have a strict lunch can only be ordered after 11(?) policy.  It was 1040 when we ordered...  that's pretty harsh.
