Just saw Jack Johnson.  Great performance!   

Paid $5 for a flat coke(in a plastic bottle) and then was not allowed to leave with it after the concert - really don't know why I still had it with me, but really?

OK venue - OK sound - staff sucks.  Not the smartest bunch of folks - Guess they don't care who they hire.
