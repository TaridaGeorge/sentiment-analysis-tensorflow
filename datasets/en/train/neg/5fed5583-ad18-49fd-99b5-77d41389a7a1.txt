I went to Ulta in Desert Ridge and was really disppointed.  I came in to get my hair trimmed about forty-five minutes before they closed.  When I came in there were two stylists sitting in the waiting area talking to the receptionist.  They asked if I had an appointment (I didn't) and then told me they couldn't take me so late, which was fine.   Then one of the stylists, an older gentleman, found it necessary to lecture me for a good five minutes on how late it was, which I thought was terribly rude.  It's a shame, because I work and live very close and was hoping to find a good salon in my area.
