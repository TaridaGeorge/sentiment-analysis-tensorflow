I don't get it. 

What's the point of going OUT TO EAT if you have to cook your own food? I thought $5 was pricey for a bun, slice of cheese and unseasoned beef patty you have to cook yourself. For just a few more dollars, I could get a delicious cooked burger from Four Peaks with beer-battered fries. 

The crowd is older here. The patrons could have been my parents' age, if not my grandparents. 

I went for a friend's birthday. I adore my friend, but not her restaurant choice.
