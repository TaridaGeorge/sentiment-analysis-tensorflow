There for a get together in the bar on Friday.  Was a little late, so could no longer have the private room even though we called.  Orderd the shrimp scampi for myself they should have described it as a plate of not tasty pasta with a few shrimp.  Complained to the manager and all he could say was well let me take it away for you.  Did not offer to take it off the bill.  Other party had fish and chips and told me it was just so/so.  This was not the first time that I had been there for an office event and but for sure it is the last time.  Would go somewhere else where the services is better and the food at least has some taste.
