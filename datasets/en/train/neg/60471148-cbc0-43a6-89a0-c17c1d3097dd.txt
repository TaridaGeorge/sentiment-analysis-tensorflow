What a complete and total dump.  Really, if you can't keep driving then get arrested or something.  Whatever you do don't stay in this nasty place.  I will never make the mistake of staying in a Knight's Inn again and, in fact, will question any Wyndham property.  The place is completely worn out.  No bucks spent in upkeep.  The phones don't work, the lights don't work.  I don't think it was a safe environment.  We were remote and exhausted or I would have kept going.  Whatever you do, don't stay in a Knight's Inn.
