They charged me 50 cents to put a dog bone in a bag.
Gift wrapping charge!? It does not even look  like a gift.
If you charge me extra 50 cents to put $1 dog bone in the bag,ask customer first.
My dog does not care if it is in a bag or not.
If you charge extra for the wrapping,DO BETTER JOB.
POST WRAPPING FEE ON THE WALL SO CUSTOMER CAN PREPARE TO PAY 50 CENTS BAG FEE.
BITTER SERVICE.
