After waiting for all the Yankees to finish overwhelming a new place, I finally tried out Five Guys. There is no mention of a 'double' Pattie burger, but that's what a cheeseburger will get you. They may be handmade, but no taste and the bun is ridiculously small for that burger. I didn't order fries, but saw several greasy, greasy cups full of them. No wonder Americans are grossly overweight. If Obama thinks this place is great, I'm so glad I'm a Republican.....never again...In and Out is worse.  I cannot fathom what either of them are 'famous' for....on the plus side; the peanuts were tolerable at Five Guys.
