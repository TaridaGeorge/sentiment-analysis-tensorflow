They will nickel and dime you for everything.  Don't expect any favors if you are a Marriott Elite member.  No concierge room, no breakfast, no nothing.  Everything they say you get for being a "valued loyal customer" is already included in the $25 resort fee.  I have never been disappointed at a Marriott until I came to this resort.
