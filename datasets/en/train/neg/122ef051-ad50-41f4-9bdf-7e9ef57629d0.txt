UGH Avoid, Avoid.

I unfortunately had the person in training.  Look for the sign on the counter indicating that the person is in training and say "no thank you".  They work on their own, and have to stop and wait for the person training them to finish helping customers.  I was easily there for 30-45 minutes.  Then, my navigation system didn't work.  I complained when I returned and they said it happens ALL THE TIME.  What the heck.  Get new Navs.

You get the point, don't come here :)
