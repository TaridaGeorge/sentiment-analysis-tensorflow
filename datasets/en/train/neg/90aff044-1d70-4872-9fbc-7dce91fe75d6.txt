I tried to rent the meeting rooms 1 & 2 for a 30th birthday event.  I sent an email to Beverly someone.  She emailed me back a week later asking for my phone number again.  I gave it to her.   No response.  Then I called and left a message.  No response.  I called again a week later.   No call back for 4 days.  She told me she would check and see if the rooms were available for the days I needed and get back to me within 24 hours.  No call back ever.   This place has terrible customer service and no way would I ever go there again.
