Chompies is awful, my New Year's resolution is to never step foot in a chompies again. The food is always mediocre at best. The service is always super slow no matter how busy it is. I swear that they put some sort of laxative in the eggs because I can never get home quick enough. If you like crappy deli food go to Chompies , if you like halfway decent deli go to Scott's.
