Went here last Saturday, June 30 for the "party." Dance of the night was the Viennese Waltz, something I had not learned yet. I liked the challenge, but they expect you to know five moves in 90 minutes. Some people need more time than this. No separation of groups who had not done this dance before. Upon having to rotate partners, two decided to correct my hold without asking or saying anything. Through the course of the night, you find out that the "teachers" are students who go through different levels of instruction which culminate in a teaching position. Never again will I go here, I'll stick with the awesome instructors and techniques at Fred Astaire In Chandler.
