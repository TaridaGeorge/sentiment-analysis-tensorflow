I have't been to a Waffle House in 20 years... Now I remember why.

If you're looking quick, cheap, greasy spoon type food... Don't come here, it falls far below that standard.

Not any cheaper than a comparable meal at Ihop or Denny's, with much lower quality. The food at Flying J and Petro blows Waffle House out of the water.

Thin chewy waffles, undercooked hash browns, pasty sausage gravy, super salty diaphanous bacon...all rubbish.

Even the butter was some sort of "butter like" spread in an individual serving tub.

The premises were wet. Having come off 4 days of rain I was willing to give some latitude. Then I encountered the smell.

Upon peering behind the counter I discovered a small marsh which, at a guess, was caused by backup or overflow from the dishwasher.

Why won't yelp allow me to give a zero rating?
