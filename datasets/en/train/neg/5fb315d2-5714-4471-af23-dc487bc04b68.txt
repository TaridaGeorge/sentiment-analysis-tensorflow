Several years ago I ate at Golden Phoenix.  They had the best garlic shrimp ever - a huge platter full of big, plump, juicy shrimp with a tasty brown sauce.  So I ordered some today along with some sizzling rice soup.  The rice didn't sizzle when I added it to the broth, and the broth was flavorless, save for a little hint of soy sauce.  The shrimp were small, dry, overcooked, and tasteless, and the container was half full of sauce!  The sauce wasn't bad, but I didn't pay $10+ for a container full of sauce.  I will never go back there again, and I am trying to spare others from this miserable take-out dining experience.
