Garbage food, the food was not worth eating.
Yes, they are generous, but the flavor is not good. 

Almost every item on the happy hour list is a California roll with something on it, and the California roll was a lot of yucky. 

We decided not to eat about $15.00 worth sushi and take it to go.
The dog ate it the next morning. 

I might go back just to taste the nigiri, but 1 will only start by ordering one.
