Wow. Worst food poisoning of my life. Ate here Saturday night for my birthday. Started to just not feel right about 20 minutes afterward. Sunday I never left the bed except to go be sick. I lost a full FIVE pounds in one day. Stay away from the salmon. I for one will never go back. I'm really sad too because I decided on it from the reviews. Another reviewer said they were disappointed in the recent quality. I should have listened!!
