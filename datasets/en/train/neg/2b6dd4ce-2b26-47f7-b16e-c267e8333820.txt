I remember when NYPD put out some killer wings and decent pizza.  Ordered 18 Hells Kitchen wings and Da Works pizza.  The pizza was cold and I ended up with 24 wings.  12 were Hells Kitchen and 12 were medium.  Not only were they wrong but the wings were also cold and the hells kitchen were not the same as before.  My bill was 44 bucks for a large pizza and 18 wings.  A bit absurd when the pizza and wings are cold and unsatisfying.  Even if they were warm I can just tell the quality that NYPD is putting out is not the same.  Never again for me.  If I want mediocre pizza and wings I will pay mediocre prices at a different chain.
