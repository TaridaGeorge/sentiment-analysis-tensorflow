This is by far, hands down and without a doubt the worst food of any kind that I've ever seen at a restaurant.  I got the house chicken and it was bone dry.  It looked like they'd completely forgotten the sauce altogether.  I mentioned it to them when I was taking it back for a refund and she seemed to think that the sauce was now just under the chicken or had been absorbed by the rice.  I'd looked under the chicken and there was not one milimeter of sauce there.  I'd tried the small amount of rice that was browned by some substance and I could barely stomach it.

I have never in my life returned oriental food to the store before today.

Aside from the terrible food, the restaurant itself is a dive.  I will never consider eating here again.
