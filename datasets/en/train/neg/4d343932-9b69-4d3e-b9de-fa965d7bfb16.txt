This is not a complaint against JUST this particular WalMart! Consumers beware! I believed their ads about cashing checks for $3 each. I went to WalMart to cash my payroll check (because my bank was closed and I need the $ to pay my rent). I put in my social security number and was refused. Of course they don't tell you why; I'm thinking it has to do with the company I work for. Turns out...WALMART will ONLY cash checks for people with superior credit. NOW, shouldn't they say that in their ads instead of wasting my time finding a place to park and then waiting in line as customer service just to be refused? I was humiliated!  What does MY credit have to do with cashing my payroll check????? I will NEVER step foot in WALMART again!
