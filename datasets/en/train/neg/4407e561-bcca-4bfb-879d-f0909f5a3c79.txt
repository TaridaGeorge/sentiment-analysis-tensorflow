Worst OB office I have ever been to. Originally I thought they were great, but as my pregnancy progressed they were a NIGHTMARE!
The receptionist girls are extremely rude, both over the phone and in person.
The Dr and PA do not take any health issues seriously. Even after a hospital stay, they still did not pay any attention to my health needs. Their solution for everything is jamming medications down your throat instead of finding the root cause of the issue.

Even worse, these medications are not safe and several of them were Category C, which are known to cause birth defects. After a few trips to the pharmacy where a Pharmacist told me NOT to take them, a change in dr was the only solution.

Do not trust your health or the well being of your baby with this office.
