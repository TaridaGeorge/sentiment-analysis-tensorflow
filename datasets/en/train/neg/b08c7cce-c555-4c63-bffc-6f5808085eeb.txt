Please.  Can you spell OVERRATED crap?  What is all the hype about?  I swear, if memory serves me, In-n-Out was ok, definitely NOT great and that they served actual meaty burgers, not tiny McDs type, back in the 90s.  People rave and others have driven hundreds of miles to eat at In N Out. Seriously, they must be high. EZ Take Out Burger is far superior.  I last ordered a meal from In N Out in 2002 maybe, and it was trash.  I regrettably brought a group with me and was so embarassed that I subjected them to this lousy meal.  The service was rushed, the burger consisted of a PLAIN bun, with a tiny, flat, COLD pattie. The fries were mushy PLUS the price was outrageous for what was served.  Anybody that raves about that IN-N-Out junk MUST be smokin'!!  BORRRing...
