I was sitting outside of Macy's and decided to walk over to this store. I figured it was more of a kids store, mostly for boys.  Whoa!  It was a few days before Halloween, and it looked like a Fredrick's of Hollywood wanna be. 

Halloween aside -- this place came off as a low class and raunchy.  Was that really the intent of your business plan?  Did you feel you executed it well?  Who is your market demo anyway?  I mean really?  Ugh!
