Have been using this company for 18 years and been very happy.  Had a problem and for 200$ I was told ac was working.  20 minutes after they left stopped working. They were trying to help go thru a home warranty company but that failed.  I made another appt and there was a mixup that was absolutely understandable, then have tried to call for 2 weeks now  no callback.  Wow what happened?
