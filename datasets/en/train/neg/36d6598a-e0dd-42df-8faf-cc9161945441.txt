Awful, just awful! All the food was bland and tasteless. The steaks were dry and mealy, the waitress constantly kept saying, "i don't know" to everything we asked and she would only tell us the larger sized beers because she kept trying to up sell. Also they were out of medium rare prime rib, the mushrooms obviously came from a can, the potatoes were also dry and bland, and the au jus was some weird thick dark sauce. Don't go here, just go to Outback, its slightly cheaper and MUCH better quality.
