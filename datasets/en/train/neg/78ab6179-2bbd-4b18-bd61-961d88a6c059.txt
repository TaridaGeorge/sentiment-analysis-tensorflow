Oh boy!  My husband needed prgressive lenses.  The girl who helped (?) us told me we should get the "premium" progressive as opposed to the standard.  I asked what the difference in price was and she WOULDNT TELL ME!  She figured it all out nd showed my, like a car salesman, on a computer, a price of $171.  With insurance!  When I said that was a lot, she said we should get insurance on the glasses for another $30!  Good luck with that, sister.   I later found out the standard progressive is $75 with our insurance. We walked and ordered the same glasses online from zinni for a grand total of $61 without using insurrance.  Hold on to the wallet here, folks!
