I am new to yelp and this story is three years old but time has not diminished its relevance. 

It was December 2007 and my friend wanted to host her birthday dinner at AZ88 because it was so trendy.  Many from our group shared the bacon wrapped water chestnuts. 

Each and every person who ate the bacon wrapped water chestnuts was severely ill will food poisoning.  

When I complained to the manager of AZ88 he dismissed me, saying, "In my ten years working here, AZ88 has never had a food poisoning complaint."  A dishonest response, no doubt.  Regardless of whether they heard complaints in the past, I was there in the present complaining about four instances of food poisoning from one serving of tainted bacon wrapped appz.
