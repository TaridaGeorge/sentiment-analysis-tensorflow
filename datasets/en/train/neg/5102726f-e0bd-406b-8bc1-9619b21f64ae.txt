This was a complete waste of $35. They have a look book that only has about 5 choices to choose from and all the models have long hair. I have short hair and the 18 yr. old who did my hair had NO idea what to do with my hair. I asked for a refund and was utterly disappointed with this place. Great idea but novices work there.
