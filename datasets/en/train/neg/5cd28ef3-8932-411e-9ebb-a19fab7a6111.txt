Just tried to call them to get a pizza delivered. Rang through. Redirected to a voicemail box. "The mailbox belonging to".. GARLIC. JIMS. "is full. Please try again later."

Nope. Pizza Hut it is, and I'm never calling these turkeys again. Last time we called, the woman told my wife that the Buffalo Chicken Pizza THAT THEY'RE ADVERTISING ON THEIR HOMEPAGE was not yet available. Why the hell advertise it on the webpage then? And they don't have any coupons on the site either - the pizzas are outrageously expensive and just not worth it when you can get far better quality from Bronco Billy's or even Papa Jomino's.
