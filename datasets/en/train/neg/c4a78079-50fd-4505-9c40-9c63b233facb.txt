Quite possibly the worst steak I have ever been served. I ordered it medium, it came out bloody and I sent it back. After 20 minutes they brought it back and it was charred. It was so chewy and tough I couldn't finish two bites. Horrible. The server was incredibly slow and inattentive. 

I may have a drink on the patio some day, but I will not eat at this place again.
