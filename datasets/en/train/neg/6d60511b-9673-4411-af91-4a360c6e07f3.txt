We used to love coming here, but last night was the last time we will ever go. We are not a fan of the new concept - noodles with Indian food - really? The chicken was rubbery and the naan was just slightly better than cardboard. From what I can tell, while waiting almost 30 minutes for our food, is that they have one good waitress, but unfortunately she was not our server.
