I used to come here all the time only because they dont have those brushes that beat your car up..so I specifically asked them not to use the hand brush on the front of my car because they go so fast that the handle nicks the corners of my car.. So as I see my car going to the line up what do I see 2 guys using brushes on my car.. So we confronted the lady, and she proceeded to show us how soft the brush bristles are..not my point..but they were nice enough to comp us the wash..then the guy wiping down our car, was worthless.. From now on I'm washing my car at home.. what happened los olivos?
