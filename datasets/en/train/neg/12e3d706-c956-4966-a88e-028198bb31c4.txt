These people were less then helpful. 
Very typical car salesmen. 
I was straight forward with what I wanted and what I could affoard. They tried giving me anything and everything but what I needed/wanted. Everytime I got ready to walk away they woul dpull another car off the lot to show me. They did show me some nice cars, but it was to late in the game. Had they brought their A game to the table to start with I most likely would have bought from them. 
I had a much better experience from a much smaller dealership
