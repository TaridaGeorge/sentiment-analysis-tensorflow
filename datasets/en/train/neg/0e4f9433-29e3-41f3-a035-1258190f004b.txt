French restaurants are supposed to be a little stuffy, and attitude is the name of the game.  But you usually get superb food and the unfriendly atmosphere just becomes part of the experience.  

Not here my friend... the food is very mediocre and when you pay top dollar for it, something is definitely wrong.  I ordered the bouillabaisse (about $30) and was disgusted when several of the mussels were rancid.  The other fish and seafood in the dish tasted like they had been in the freezer too long.  

I'd like to say it deserves a second chance, but rude staff and stale food at high prices don't mix well.  Consistency in the restaurant business means everything, and this place doesn't seem to have it.
