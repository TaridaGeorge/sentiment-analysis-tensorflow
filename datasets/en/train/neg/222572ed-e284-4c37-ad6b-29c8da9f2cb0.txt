What is disappointment. The service here is the worst I have ever had at a bar. I came in late on saturday night and it wasn't that busy. I stood at the bar ready to buy drinks and shots for my group for 20 minutes.... The girl stood right in front of me trying to close out someones tab and couldnt figure it out, she proceeds to call 3 other workers over to help her, none of them acknowledged me or the other people waiting to buy drinks. Even a simple "we will be right with you" would suffice. Those bartenders didn't even look up. I don't even want to think about how much money that place lost last night from people like myself eventually walked out.
