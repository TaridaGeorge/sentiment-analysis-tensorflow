Ok. Just ordered dinner to go and it was ALL wrong!  Spent $12 on a curry chicken and there was tiny little pieces of thinned out chicken, total waste of money, seriously, there was NO chicken in this dish. I am SO disappointed. We also ordered Thai toast only to get some fried corn patty. It also seems they increased their prices. We did call and the lady who answered said that I ordered these corn patties and I said, "I have no idea what these corn patties are let alone the name of it to order it". Uggg. 

I'd rather go to Thai House which is further away to get Thai food - their portions are well worth the money there.

Sorry Osha!
