What a disappointment.  We had clients in town and had reserved a space on the patio.  We spoke with the manager 10 minutes before arriving and all was well.  When we arrived, no space was reserved and minimal effort was made to accommodate us.  We stood around the outside bar and waited for an eternity to be served by a bartender who seemed like he'd rather be doing anything else.  Plus, the patio is right next to the trash and grease trap -- nice smell.  The food's OK, the service is among the worst I have encountered.
