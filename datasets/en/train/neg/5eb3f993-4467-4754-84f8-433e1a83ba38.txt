Tried it a few times.  Hardly a warm welcome from the young girl up front. Thought I'd give it another chance since I love how close it is it my home, only to find out that when they say they are open at 7am, it's a tentative 7am.  I didn't want to drive around looking for another dry cleaner so (like an idiot) I waited till 7:30 and still no one.   Needless to say, it's time for a new dry cleaner.
