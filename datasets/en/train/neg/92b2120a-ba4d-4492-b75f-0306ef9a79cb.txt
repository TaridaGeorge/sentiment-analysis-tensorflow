Will somebody that works here PLEASE call the filibertos on Lindsey and Mckellips and ask them how to make The ARIZONA BURRITO correctly. I really love filli B's but this is freaking ridiculous. The potatoes are hardly cooked, the salsa is watered down and they don't sell a Jr. az like the others. D+++it and now Im craving one just writing this review but I know if i go Ill be disappointed. :(
