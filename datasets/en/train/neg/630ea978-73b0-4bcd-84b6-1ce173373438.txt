Thought we would check it out since it had received a few good reviews. I won't be back.No bathrooms...Have to go over to Subway for that. Not a big deal to me that it is a dive in a nice area or no bathrooms. Food is what is important...right?  Found meat on our food to be tough and burnt. Not tasty. Dry too. Won't be back. I can get a better meal at Ramiros or Filibertos just a short distance. Found it pricey too compared to competition.
