the restaurant formerly known as the best hong kong.

what happened to this place?  this used to be our go-to chinese restaurant in the east valley!

the food has gone down hill and the service which used to be 3/5 has gone to 1/5.

there was this young college age kid/busboy/waiter (who knows, he could have been older, just add 10 years to what you think they are) who actually chased us out the door and demanded that we leave 15% tip when we only left 10%....what a dufus

hello, we're trying to send you a message idiot.  i guess the best message is to not eat there and tell 100 other people to do the same

you shall be called "Worst Hong Kong"
