Nothing like a place that perpetuates the sterotype of a poorly run office.  Making a long story short....we had an injury to our son...we signed in and NOBODY looked at him for 20 minutes, despite crying in pain.
 
We were relieved when the door finally opened, but they actually called a happy little girl back first, who arrived after us, and was seemingly carefree.

Nobody explained...nobody checked us...nobody communicated anything.  We went to the ER at Scottsdale Healthcare and had a great experience.

One overworked PA, 3 other non-caring staff.  No traige.  This is not urgent care...it's barely a functioning doctor's office. Pass on them in the future.
