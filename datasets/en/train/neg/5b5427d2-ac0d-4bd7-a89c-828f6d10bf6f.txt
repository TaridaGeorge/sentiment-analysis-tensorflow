Staff is lazy and I took 2 vehicles here and they both came out with bugs still all over and they didn't wash grill area or rims. I was getting what was supposed to be a $120 service. This place is grubby and staff looks like they want nothing to do with washng vehicles or doing a good job. I will NEVER go here again!
