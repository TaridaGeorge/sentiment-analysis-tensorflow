I've been getting mani/pedi's forever. This wasn't very good despite choosing this salon from great reviews. I got gel polish that 'shrunk'...when i asked her to fix it she got irritated and said 'that's how it is'. Well it's not. The polish selection was terrible...few OPI colors and mostly off brands. And no less expensive than other salons. Won't be back.
