Gosh, I really wanted to love this place.  I love the name and LOVE the location.  It had a nice little patio and nice ambience.  First thing I noticed when I sat down was how my arm stuck to some substance smeared on the table.  Bleggghhh!  Service was slow but nice.  My hubby had a hamburger, he wasn't impressed.  It looked greasy.  I had a tuna something or other.  I don't know, when you order tuna....you don't expect Starkist...and that's what it was.  Double Bleggghhhh!  I'm bummed.  Also saw the cook outside in front smoking on his break.  Strike three.
