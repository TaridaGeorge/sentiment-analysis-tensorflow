We have been going to Richardson's for years, even before the fire. We were looking forward to the reopening. Have been there several times since but last night's experience was horrible. Service was poor, wouldn't re-cork wine we bought, food marginal, seemed to be understaffed. Manager said they went through a "major house cleaning a month ago and new staff are not all trained."  So we wasted $80 for 2 people to train their staff?  Manager offered apology and suggested we come back in a couple of months.  FAT CHANCE!!
