Dominos.com says the store is open until 11 o'clock. I called at 10:45, waiting on hold for 15 minutes, and nobody picked up. What gives? Also, the website won't let you place an online order if you live in Tortosa. Yet they will deliver when you call. This is been an issue for years, and I've asked them to fix it several times. Their only solution is to have you place a take-out order online, and then call them and have them change it to a delivery order.
