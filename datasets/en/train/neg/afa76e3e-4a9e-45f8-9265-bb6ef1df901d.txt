Although the food was good after waiting 50 minutes after ordering to get it to our table, at this point I would NOT recommend this place to anyone. The mango peach tea was awful, the service may have been faster if they were in a coma...unbelievable. I also did not approve of having UFC fighting on almost all of the TVs. Not my idea of entertainment watch two guys beat the hell out of each other. But considering they just opened and I understand there are some bugs to work out, I will consider going back one last time to if see anything improves. If not, I wouldn't miss the place.
