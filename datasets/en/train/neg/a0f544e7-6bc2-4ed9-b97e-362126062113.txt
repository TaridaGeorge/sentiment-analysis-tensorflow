This store is NASTY.  The hubbie will shop here, but after my last visit about 4 months ago, I am proud to say I have not gone anywhere near it and am committed to never set foot in it again.

The parking lot is horribly lit, very dirty.  Gee, nice you have a security car, but why not put up more lights??

Once you walk into the store, the place has an odd smell, kinda chemical, like everything has been dunked into some odd preservative or de-louser.

The shopping carts are covered in a greasy grime; I would hunt for one that I could stomach putting my purchases inside.

Wal-mart's lack of cleanliness makes it easy for me to pay a little more to shop at Target.
