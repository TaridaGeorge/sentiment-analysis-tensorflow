I am not even to close fan of this place. I read the reviews and was super excited to try something new. This place was super super loud. The music was so load that people were practically yelling to hear eachother. I didn't feel like I could even talk to my partner while here. 

I did get seated pretty fast. I ordered the deviled egg dip that was so over salted, I had to send it back. We also order the cheese fondue that is what made me give this place some stars. As the main dish, I ordered the Windsor Burger that was just okay. Nothing really to get excited about. It wasn't and isn't something to even remember.

Definitely not coming back or suggesting this place to any friends.
