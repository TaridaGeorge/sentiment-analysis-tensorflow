Horrible experience !!  Wasted five hours one day dealing with nickel and diming by the salesperson.  Went back two more times to try and work out a deal to no prevail.  They'll confuse you with inaccurate numbers and not show you the true cost of the automobile.  They valued my trade one day which we agreed upon but when I went back they dropped it a grand.  Bull and Kent, two horrible employees followed me out to my car and bagged me to make a deal after insulting me inside the dealership.  Would never do business with these clowns in the future.  Earnhardt dealership takes another hit, they are building some kind of reputation in the valley.
