Do not be fooled by the fact that they have the same location and phone number as the previous florist at this location. (Green Wood Pecker was awesome. I live out of town now and they were my go to for local delivery) 

Called Floral Fantasy directly, twice to ensure next day delivery to a funeral. 

I was made to feel that I was inconveniencing them and was told to order via the website instead. I did this WHILE ON THE PHONE with them as I wanted to be sure delivery would take place when memorial would start at 8:00 am next day. I even put the times, address and phone of the service and church in the special instructions field while ordering on line. 

I was mortified to hear that no flowers were delivered. 

Do not go here:

Waiting to see if the promised refund will materialize.
