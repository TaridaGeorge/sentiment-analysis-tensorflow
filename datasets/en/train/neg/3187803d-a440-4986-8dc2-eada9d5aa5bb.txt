If you love being ignored and treated rudely, this is the place for you. There are too many other local restaurants in town to put up with the bad service. if you are not a regular, forget it. We had to get our own menus, go to the counter for refills and condiments.....never an apology. Yes, we have been there more than once - guess we were hoping something would change. Food is average. Don't expect to get what you order - once I ordered chorizo and got taco meat. ( I know the difference.) A group of us go out to lunch every week. Not one person ever suggests the Cook E Jar.
