Only tried a second time because of a company yelp response.  It got worse.  Washer's knee had grease which smeared two large stripes on seat.  His advice was to come back tomorrow since it wasn't coming out with his towel. The car is brand new and this stain stood out. I had to ask for the manager who had to shampoo the seat.  A quick carwash turned into an hour nightmare.
