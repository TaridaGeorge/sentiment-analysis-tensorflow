If I could sue Carly's Bistro for the waste of my money and time, I would. Food isn't all that and service was slow. Do they even cook anything? I ordered the Santa Fe Sandwich. I asked about a substitution and the waitress rolled her eyes. Ugh. Never again. So many other great local restaurants and choices...I'll never head back to Carly's.
