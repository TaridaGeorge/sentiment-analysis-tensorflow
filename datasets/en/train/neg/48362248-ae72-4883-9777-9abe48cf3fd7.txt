Same poor customer service as the DD at Tatum and Bell. Why does it take them so long to make up the little breakfast sandwiches when the egg stuff is pre-cooked? And why do they screw up orders so often? There is a really nice deli in this same strip mall that serves breakfast. Next time, I'm going there.
