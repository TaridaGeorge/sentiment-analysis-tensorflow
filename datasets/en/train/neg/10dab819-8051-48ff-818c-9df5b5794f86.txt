How could you go wrong with a place name "Pholicious"? Many ways!  The staff was extremely nice however the service was very slow. They brought out our order individually at different times...forgivable.  NOT FORGIVABLE was the cockroach that crawled over the booth and onto my neck!  The owner or manager apologized as he handed us our bill! As we were walking out we noticed a crushed roach on the floor as well. Had we only seen it on the way in!
