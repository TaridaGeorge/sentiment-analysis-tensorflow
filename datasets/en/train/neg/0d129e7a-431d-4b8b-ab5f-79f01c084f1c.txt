I'm staying at the squaw peak resort and had a free breakfast voucher for this place. I waited for 15 minutes. No waiter. Finally flagged one down and ordered an omelette. Nothing fancy. 20 minutes later no omelette. Finally flagged the waitress down an said I had to leave. She said she would put it in a box for me and went to the kitchen. Three minutes later, still no waitress. No box. I walked out hungry. Went back for lunch. It was a big mistake. almost no customers there as we arrived at 11:10 am. It took FOREVER. Fifty minutes later my fish tacos arrived. Not once did my water get refilled. No one asked me how my lunch was. I'm never coming back. I wish I could give it 0 stars.
