The queen of Phoenix baseball eateries is closed. A sad, sad, sad day. The stories that were told in the place could fill the Hall Of Fame. In the 50's, 60's, 70's and 80's it was out the door crowded. It was THE PLACE TO SEE AND BE SEEN.

Alas, the economy and competition have done their best to shutter history. So long sweet baby, I'll miss your special charms and Scottsdale is a lesser place for your demise.
