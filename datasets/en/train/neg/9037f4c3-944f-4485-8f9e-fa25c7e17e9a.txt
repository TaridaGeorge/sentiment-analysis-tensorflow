On Sunday, July 6, I read a sign on the front door of this restaurant that read, "We are closed on Sunday, July 6 in honor of Independence Day." 

If the owner decided to use the July 4 weekend to take off for San Diego or something, I would have appreciated his being honest. I don't appreciate being insulted with a pitch that you are closed on July 6 "in honor of" July 4. 

The worst part is that I drove 20 miles to pick up my mom for her birthday and then drove an additional 20 miles from her house to Glendale in order to read the sign about celebrating July 4 on July 6. Lesson learned. I will not be returning.
