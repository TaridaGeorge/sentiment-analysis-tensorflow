While I was here.. there were sanitation issues with the cooks in the kitchen. One we saw touching his hair with gloves on then continued to work with food. Waiter got the order wrong, Dropped a towel used for cleaning tables on the floor then continues to use it. The Food was nothing special. I would have tried this place again for a second chance but for the sanitation practices of the staff. They need a stronger kitchen manager and a FOH manager! Very Disappointing!
