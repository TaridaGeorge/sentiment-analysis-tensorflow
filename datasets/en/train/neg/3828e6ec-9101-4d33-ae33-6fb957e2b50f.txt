First, let me say I really hate to give bad reviews.  I love to support local business owners.
I drove 15 miles to buy cake pops but when I arrived they were out.  The young lady working behind the counter  could have taken the time to nicely explain why they were out of cake pops, instead she wanted to be RUDE!
I decided to go ahead and order some cupcakes, they were rated best cupcake by New Times so they had to be good, right?
Well they were just okay.  Nothing to brag about.  
I would have gone back to buy the cake pops but based on the rude service, I will not return.
