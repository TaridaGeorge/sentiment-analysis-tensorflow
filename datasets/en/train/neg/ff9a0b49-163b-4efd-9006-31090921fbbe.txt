So I decided to give them one more chance and brought my son this time. Worst haircut ever -see photo posted. It looks like his 4 year old sister took a pair of safety scissors to his head. It looked passable when we left as it was wet but oh Jesus - freakin - Christ when it dried it was awful and it cannot be fixed -unless you shave it- until it grows out. Thanks for screwing up my sons hair just in time for holiday parties and photographs. FAIL.
