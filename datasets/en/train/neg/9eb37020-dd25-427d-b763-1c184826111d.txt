Ate here for lunch. You pay for what you get. The food quality is not that great. A lot of the foods were not replenished in a timely manner. Our server was Tammy. She fail to clear our dishes from our table as we went to get our different course meals. There were dirty cups and silverware on the other tables in our dining area where the people have already left the restaurant. One visit was enough.
