we have been there about 4 times... the first time was great so we went back the last 3 times have been progressively worse to down right disgusting! The last time will forever be the last time! The food tasted like it had been sitting for hours and when we complained to the manager she said its almost lunch time so they will be bringing new food out soon... I was like um what about now? She got flustered and spilled my sons drink on me!! I was appalled! My husband had already paid but she refused to give us a refund even though none of us really ate anything. Don't bother going here its over priced and not up to standards of a decent place to eat! Yuck!!
