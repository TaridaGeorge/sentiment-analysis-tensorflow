I have yet to move into the apartment complex, but the experience is already a huge let down.  I was quoted a move in price one day, the next day they increased the cost over $200.  When I complained about the difference, the person simply split the difference between the two prices.  The leasing agent then suggested I speak to the manager and I was put on hold for over 10 minutes.  I received a call today and the new move-in cost is now another $50 over what I was quoted when the difference was split.  The leasing office will take your application fee, holding deposit and then continually increase the move-in costs.  If you want to be treated fairly don't pay the application fee and holding deposit here.
