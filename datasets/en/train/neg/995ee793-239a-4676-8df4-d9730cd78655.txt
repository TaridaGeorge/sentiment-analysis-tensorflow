Not a fan. I scraped a cornea and came in with a towel over my eyes to block the light. The receptionist made not one, not two, but THREE inappropriate jokes to my fiancee about beating me up. Then my prescriptions were wrong - one for hydrocodone, which I specifically asked them NOT to give me because it makes me nauseaous, and one for some kind of antibiotic that my regular doctor disposed of immediately and re-prescribed me something that might actually work.
