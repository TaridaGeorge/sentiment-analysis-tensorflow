I signed up for massage envy a year ago.  I really like it at first.  One thing i didn't like is I would find someone that I really liked then they would quit or get fired.  Second I moved to Arizona and here they don't have the nice tranquility room and it seems that the hour long massage that I pay $60 for has shortened to 45 minutes.  It doesn't make me happy that they advertise 60 minute massages but you only actually get 45 minutes.  I don't recommend massage envy to anyone, you can find better deals out there, maybe get 60 minutes for $45, I've seen this deal out there.
