Someone needs to take the salt away from the cook, pronto! I had the mushroom swiss burger which was the saltiest thing I have ever had. Blech. My son had the bacon cheeseburger which was every bit as salty and terrible as mine. My daughter had the hotdog and couldn't eat half of it because it was too salty and just plain terrible. The fried pickle chips tasted like they were coated in nothing but salt. The fries were pathetic. The highlight was my wife's chicken avocado sandwich which was nothing to write home about. $37 later we walked out with the collective agreement that we would NEVER eat there again. 

I've had better burgers next door at Johnny Rockets and Johnny Rockets is dogshit!
