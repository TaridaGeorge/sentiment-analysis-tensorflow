The menu was FULL of great choices, we settled on the war wonton soup (soggy noodles, VERY overcooked shrimp, sickly sweet broth), teriyaki chicken (bland, fatty & more skin than chicken), yang chow fried rice (greasy, very poor cuts of chicken & pork), and chicken fried rice (again, greasy and with lots of fatty chicken). The service wasn't very good and the pricing was more appropriate for a MUCH better meal.
