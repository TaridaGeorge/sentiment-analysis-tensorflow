So unimpressed with the dress rehearsal that we PAID $5/ ticket and didn't even bother going.  After a 12 week class 1/2 the kids didn't even know what they were doing, and what they were doing was very little dancing and more waving hands in the air and spinning in circles.  Tried to get our $ back on the tickets and they wouldn't, but it still wasn't worth going.  Videotaped and sent to grandparents and even they were like "really, that was it?!"
