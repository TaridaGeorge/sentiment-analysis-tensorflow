Chicken and Waffles DO NOT BELONG TOGETHER. Ew.

I understand that the world probably thinks I am the scum of the earth for giving Lo-Lo's such a low rating, however, I cannot bring myself to like greasy, nasty food.

Why is the Kool-aid flavored red? Why is it not called "Cherry"? These are the questions that haunt my dreams. 

Not only do I hate the food here, but why is it in the middle of no where? I had so much trouble finding it.

You may be wondering why I even bothered to come here in the first place... good question. 

It is safe to assume that I will NEVER step foot in this door again.
