The Food Truck Festival was awful I wish got my time and money back.  I should up around 6:00 pm and the parking lot was packed. I broke my leg 8 weeks ago and it was hard for me to maneuver through all the rock and plug in wires. In two hours I was only able to three trucks, beetit, torched goddess and a barbecue truck. The creme brûlée was amazing, but I would rather deal with the crazy people scavenging for samples at Costco. We left earlier than we expected since most of the lines were fifty deep and headed to Postinos and had an amazing dinner. I rather go check out the good trucks in a different setting. Good Concept though.
