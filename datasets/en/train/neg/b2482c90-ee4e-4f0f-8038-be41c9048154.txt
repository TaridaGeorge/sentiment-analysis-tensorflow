These guys are just assholes. 

I was forced to throw away Cologne, moisturizer, hair product and a couple other things because I didn't have a plastic bag to put them in. The grooming kit I've traveled with for the last four years (and never had an issue with) apparently isn't good enough for Delta. Even US Airways let me travel with my grooming kit, and they are Satan's airline. Delta: if you do anything worse than US Air, you're hitting an all time low.

They're also slow through security (wasting people's money takes time) and generally unfriendly. They are really the whole package.

This shit is why people hate flying. Eff you Delta, never again.
