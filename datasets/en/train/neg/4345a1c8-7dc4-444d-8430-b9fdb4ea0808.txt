Maybe the blandest and most unappetizing Mom and Pop Chinese restaurant I've ever eaten at.

I had the displeasure of trying this place once during lunch for work, and once for dinner before a Suns game. Both times they offered cheap combination platters that ran about 7 dollars for an entree, soup, fried rice, and egg roll. Everything from there I would probably rank a step or two below what you even get at a Panda Express.

The Ma po tofu dish I picked last time for dinner was particularly awful and bland. Some cheap store bought tofu lightly fried with some soy sauce. If it wasn't enough, I got somewhat sick off of it too. How do you poison someone with a tofu dish? I guess this place is good at sucking every way possible.

At least its cheap.
