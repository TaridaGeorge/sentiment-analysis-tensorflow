Do not eat here!
I only came in here because I wanted to watch the Seahawks game while waiting for my return flight. I was horrified with the service (the brunette waitress was absent, slow, and it took forever to cash out - which is absurd in an airport restaurant - everyone has somewhere to be)! 
The food was terrible, but I wasn't expecting too much. 
What was worse, were the PLASTIC UTENCILS. I am not tailgating - I don't want to eat with a plastic fork/knife and plastic plate at a restaurant, not to mention it is simply wasteful. 
Walk around to find another TV in the waiting areas that might be playing your game [shudder] - this place is awful.
