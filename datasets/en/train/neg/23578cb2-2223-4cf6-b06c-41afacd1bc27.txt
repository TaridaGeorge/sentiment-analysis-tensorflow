If I could put zero stars, I would. They are THE worst.

We were upsold a silly insurance without realizing it and the gas package that the guy insisted we get was highway robbery. For what was $30 a day, for 30 hours, the final bill was $250! And the guy at the counter could care less.

Awful customer service, awful experience and I'll never rent from them anywhere again.
