What else could possibly go wrong?

Came with a group of 8. Wasn't too busy. Server only took drink orders for 7 and scurried off. Came back, took the 8th. Then only took food orders for 7 and scurried off. Came back and took the 8th. What, do you only have 7 lines on the pad?

4 of us got the same thing. Each one looked different, tasted different, and came out at a different time. The last one came out after the other 7 had finished eating. Add to that, the inside of the egg roll was still frozen. How could that happen? Made me nervous to eat the rest of the food.

And the art? I almost laughed.

Sorry, I'll give it another try in a year, but for now, 1 star.
