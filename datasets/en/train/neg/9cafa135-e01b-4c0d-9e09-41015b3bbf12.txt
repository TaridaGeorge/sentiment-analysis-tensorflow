Disorganization with office staff and inability to respond to emails started my red flags waving. When I called the office and Scott seemed to not want to talk to me and implied we never emailed, I asked him if I should forward my prior email. He then told me he would have Julie call me back. Julie did call me and I was not impressed with her communication style at all. I am a professional and understand that we all have bad days, but she could not find our email, then said 'Oh, that one...' Then, when I mentioned needing the lawn winterized she said 'What do you mean, winterized?'... Umm, nevermind... NEXT company on my list will get a call.
