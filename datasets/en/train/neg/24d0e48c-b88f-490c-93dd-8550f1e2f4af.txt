I would give Slices a 3 stars for their mediocre pizza however this place is dishonest. I ordered 2 cheese slices and a BBQ chicken slice and a gatorade and according to the prices on the menu, after taxes I should have only been charged between 11 and 12 dollars. However the guy told me $15. I did't realize he overcharged us until mid meal when I realized $17 dollars was way too much for what we got (wish I didn't leave a two dollar tip). Honestly, $17 dollars for 3 slices and a Gatorade? That's ridiculous, I can guarantee you I won't be going back there.
