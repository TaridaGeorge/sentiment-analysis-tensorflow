Run, do not walk, from these guys.

I sent a request for quotes to area dealers (via online services like pricequote and invoicedealers). The first problem was that I started getting duplicate emails with c'mons. And then I received emails from Tonelli. Then John Lloyd. I'd ask one a question and the other would reply "when will you be coming in?"

When I finally received a quote from them, it turned out they quoted last year's price. (cough... our real price is way over what other dealers quoted.).

I heard Earnhardt has a bad reputation for playing games like this. It came as no surprise when I experienced it.
