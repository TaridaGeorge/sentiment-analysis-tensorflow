The armpit of my local grocery stores. Freak show central. How many people actually have to grocery shop on those little "Scooter" things. Toothless people, smelly people, people with lots of facial hair..and those are the women. And it's toooo freakin big. A third of it is stocked with lawn chairs, fans and pool accessories. I'M LOOKING FOR FOOD! I only stopped there recently cuz I was dropping DVDs off at Blockbuster. BIG MISTAKE....The entry is filthy. The carts wobble more than Lindsay Lohan after a late night Les Deux binge. And the stench of urine isn't the best greeting for a market. Ultimately it was when my cart was "mistakingly" taken from me by the bearded lady and her Scooter husband that I ran my ass out of there and drove to Safeway. Ahhhh Safeway. Even the name is better. Safe. Way. Fry's??? Dumb name. Nasty store.
