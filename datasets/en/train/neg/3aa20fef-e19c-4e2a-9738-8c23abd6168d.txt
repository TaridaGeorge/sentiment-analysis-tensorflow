Late night desparation, dining disappointment. My friends and I decided to hit a downtown dining spot after a concert. Steve's was the only restaurant still open. They get 1 star for being open on a Saturday night. The blue cheese dressing tasted homemade and was full of yummy chunks.  Other than that, the service was poor and the food was blah. Whatever you do, don't order the rib tip basket. Ribs are chewy and greasy and COLD.  

Won't ever go here again. Pass it up.
