Place is still not maintaining equipment. Beware of twice yearly $15 "service fee".  This is in addition to your dues!  This is supposed to be for maintenance of gym.  It is not happening.  The place is getting dirty.  Pubes and dust all around the machines.  This place is going downhill fast!  I am going to start taking pictures and posting them on here.
