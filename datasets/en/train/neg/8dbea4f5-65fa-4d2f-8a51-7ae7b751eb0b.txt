Is this place a joke?? The food is disgusting at its finest! 

the first time I went here, I had the chicken taco salad... which was joke numero uno. I figured it might have just been one of those off days that everyone is allowed to have. So I gave it a go a second time... I had the burrito fundido, ummmm yea... joke numero dos. 

Never again will I come back. I've had better before elsewhere. DISGUSTING!
