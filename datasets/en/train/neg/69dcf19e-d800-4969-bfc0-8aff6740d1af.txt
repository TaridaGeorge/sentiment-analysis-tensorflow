We made reservations at The Deli for Thanksgiving several weeks in advance. We got back from a trip out of country that day and took the excited kids over for dinner. The place was closed. 

Thanks for nothing, The Deli. Would a phone call telling us you changed your schedule for Thanksgiving have been so hard?
