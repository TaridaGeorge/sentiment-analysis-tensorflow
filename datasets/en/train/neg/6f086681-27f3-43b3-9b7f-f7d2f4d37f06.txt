I guess I shouldn't compare the Vietnamese food in Arizona to Vietnamese back home in San Jose, CA because there is definitely no comparison! If you're Vietnamese and looking for good, authentic Vietnamese food, you won't find it here. The portions are small and when you order drinks, 75% of the cup is filled with ice. I guess if you're really desperately craving, then this place is okay. I, for one, will wait until I go back to Ca to fulfill all my cravings.
