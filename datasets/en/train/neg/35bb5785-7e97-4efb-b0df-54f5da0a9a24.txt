Seriously worst service and sushi I have ever had! The waitress didn't give us a refill, she ignored us when we wanted to pay for 30 mins, took pictures of her friends, got our order wrong and I found chunks of plastic in my food! When I told the waitress she looked at us and all she said was "that's gross!" and walked off! I was a waitress one time and I have been to lots of sushi places and this is by far the worst! Do not spend your money here! The sushi was horrible! What a mistake coming here!
