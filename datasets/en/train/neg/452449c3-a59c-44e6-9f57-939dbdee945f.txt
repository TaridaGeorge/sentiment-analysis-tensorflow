Went in to get my Optima battery checked on my (new to me) auto.  Tech told me the battery was bad.  Tech no longer recommends Optima but that the house brand is better.  I passed and went over to Auto Zone across the street.  
Auto Zone tech told me that the battery was good, was less than 2 years old and only needed a recharge.  In conclusion...Batteries Plus will rip off your grandma.  Beware of the bait and switch.
