Dear god truer words have never been spoken. This was the worst. I starved all day for this? I admit, perhaps a little snooty being Italian from NYC, but hey,I understand this is not NYC. But this was way off. The food was horrible. The place was filthy. I couldn't get in the shower fast enough. The people at the gate were just rude. I'll never go back. Yes,the woman with the cookies was wonderful. Worth checking her out.Cannoli's were great. But this was far from an Italian festival. I also plopped 150 bucks in 2 hours. This was a carney con!
