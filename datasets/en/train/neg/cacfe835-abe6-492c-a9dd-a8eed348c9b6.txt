WTF? WTF? WWWWTTTFFF? 
I must be on lonely island because this place sucks. I have a theory about pizza. You could take a loaf of wonder bread, a jar of ragu and melt mozzarella cheese on top and usually find yourself pretty pleased. Pizza is just, well....comforting. Cold/Hot you generally can't go wrong. 
NYPD is TERRIBLE! Pizza does not have to be New York style to be good these days. Although being from Brooklyn the Pizza in New York can't be beat. It is my favorite.
I wish they would take the NY out of there name because this place is PURE AND UTTER GARBAGE!!!
