The owner is a real jerk.  His attitude and lack of helpfulness was a real turnoff right from the start.  I decided I'd rather go hungry than give any money to support this place.  My friend who ordered before me (and also didnt appreciate the rudeness from the owner) did get some food.  Average at best.  Not worth the trouble.  The guy should think about closing his restaurant if he hates what he is doing.
