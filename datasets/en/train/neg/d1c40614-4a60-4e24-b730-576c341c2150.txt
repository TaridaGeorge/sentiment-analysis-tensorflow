Don't stay here unless you are single and under 30.  You could hear conversations from the pool through the sliding glass windows and every noise (including knocks on other guest room doors) from the hallway.  We stayed over night on a Saturday night and there was lots of "Night Life" all around us.  It was not worth the $150 - $180 per night plus the $19 per night resort fee.  

Thankfully, we purchased a free night for a charity event otherwise I would have another complaint.
