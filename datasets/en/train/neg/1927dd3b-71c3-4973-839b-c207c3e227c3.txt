The decor is fun, but the ice cream was just what you could order anywhere else, and the place was filthy.  Yes, the place was busy, but they were only making a half-hearted attempt to clean between customers.  It was hard to enjoy my ice cream because I was grossed out by the nasty floor under our table. I was also shocked that nuts were an extra charge on the sundaes.
