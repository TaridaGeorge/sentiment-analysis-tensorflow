No thank you. I ordered the red stew to go which comes with fried bread. Took 10 minutes to deliver a pint of what can only be described as awful beef/veg soup. Similar to Cambell's but had obviously been sitting over heat for the day as all the veggies were gooey soft and the meat dry. ICK. 
The fried bread was equally disappointing - flat (not fluffy) and had a horrible bitter taste which could only have come from old oil.  Dirty, no working AC.
