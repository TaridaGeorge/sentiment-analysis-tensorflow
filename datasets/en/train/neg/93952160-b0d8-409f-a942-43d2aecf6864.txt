I've gone here a couple of times and all times it sucked. I sat at the bar and when I tried to ask them about the sushi on the menu, they weren't sure what was what seeing as how the menu mixes everything and doesn't have whether it's baked or raw. And when I did get my miso soup it tasted awful and was cold. The sushi wasn't even that fresh either. Made me sick.
