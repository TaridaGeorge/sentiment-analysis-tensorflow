Love other locations, this one-NOT SO MUCH.

Took FOREVER for our server to ask us for a drink order. The table was dirty when we arrived, although more than 75% of the bar was empty at the time. 

Our drinks finally arrive via someone other than our original server(who was MIA for at least a good 5 mins or more), we were finished and waiting for our server to get back to ask for our tab! 
Horrible service, and truly disappointed about that since we absolutely love  Buffalo Wild Wings in general.
