This was the worst pedicure I have EVERhad!!  I will say that I went in at a semi-busy time of day without an appointment. Needless to say, this was the quickest pedicure I have ever had.  When I looked at my nails to check if they were dry I noticed two of the nails had bubbles and the paint extended beyond my nail bed.  The lady who had done the pedi had already started on another customer, and had to leave them to come back and fix my nails.  My friend was also having a pedi done and said that there were still rough spots on her heels.  I will never go back to this place again.
