OK...1st of all they claim to have a wood fired oven...Where is it?  I have Yet to find it at this place...all I found were wood piles outside.

Not the cleanest of places to eat...As a retired New York restaurant critic I first visit the establishments restroom for a quick check...impressions last forever!

Perhaps the pizza might taste good...it's a "so-so" choice for me and I have heard several complaints of stomach and dysentery from food served there...beware!
