This place was awful. I went to 5 thrift stores today, and hit this one last based on the previous recommendation on yelp, it was horrible. No AC in the middle of summer, hardly any stuff, bad vibe. I'm not a picky thrift shopper but this place was scraping the barrel. I appreciate that it benefits a good cause but I'd never go back.
