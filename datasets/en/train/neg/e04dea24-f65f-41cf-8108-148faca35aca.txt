The place is a nice speakeasy well hidden in downtown scottsdale with some interesting beers in the bottle.

This is where it ends.

The part that REALLY rubbed us the wrong way is 2 things.

1. The bar staff, chose to congregate right in front of us at the bar and chat all about various girls around the bar! "oh man those are definately D's, but probably fake".."did you see that one in the corner with the great ass?"

I mean come on!!! We are a couple, show some respect for your patrons!!!

Unreal.

2. The other main complaint here is all of the best seats in the bar have a sign on them that says "reserved for bottle service". Give me a break. This is why we sat at the bar.

We won't be back.
