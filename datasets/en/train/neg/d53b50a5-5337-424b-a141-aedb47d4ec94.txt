This place was the worst motel I have ever been to. Since we made reservations and arrived at 4 am, this was basically what we had to deal with. There was rat poop/cockroaches outside the door. There was rat poop inside the tub. The bed/sheets looked questionable. At night, this place reminded me of the stereotypical scary motels in horror movies. However, it's so gross, I doubt any movie monsters would hang out around here.

Even though this place is cheap, it's also cheaper to stay in your car.
