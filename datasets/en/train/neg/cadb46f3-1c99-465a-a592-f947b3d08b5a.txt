Went out of our way to visit this place.  The lady who greeted us was not very friendly or welcoming.  She seemed offended that I wouldn't buy bread because they do not make anything with whole wheat flour.  We bought a sticky bun anyway just because we didn't want to walk out without purchasing anything.  Then she made me feel stupid for asking for a healthy bread while buying a sweet treat.  She should know that bread is eaten more often than an occasional pastry...The bun was good but the ones at the Good Egg are delicious too...I will not be going there again.
