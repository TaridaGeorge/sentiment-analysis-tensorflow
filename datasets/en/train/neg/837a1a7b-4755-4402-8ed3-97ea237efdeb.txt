Food is good.. Service is so so (to be expected on a Friday night...)

The reason for the one star is the server delivered the incorrect bill for our table.  While the waitress corrected the bill she billed my credit card for both the correct and incorrect amounts!! 

My advice.. double check your dinner bill at this place..

Message to management:  Take the beef ribs off your menu.  The multiple times I've been there you're always "out."
