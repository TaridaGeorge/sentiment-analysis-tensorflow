Had dinner with family last Sunday evening at JW Marriott Resort (Tuscany Restaurant) and was disappointed at the limited selections on the menu. We love Marriotts and usually all their restaurants are good but not this one. The waiter didn't come back to the table often enough and the decaf coffee with desert was very weak. The tiramisu was the worst ever, very dry. We have stayed at many Marriotts throughout the country and they are excellent. The food tasted good but the limited menu and service lacked Marriott quality. Don't know if it's independently run(?)
