Waited 30 mins to find out the girl was skipping me on the waiting list. She said she wasn't skipping me, that there were places for two people to sit, but not one. The last time I checked, one person is able to sit where two people can sit. I don't give a pretty fuck that you are trying to turn more tables, if I am waiting 30 mins, when it's my turn, ITS MY TURN. If someone that came after me, sits before I do, you are skipping me. There is no arguing with me about it. Won't be back.
