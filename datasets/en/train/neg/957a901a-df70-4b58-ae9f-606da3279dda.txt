Please do not walk, run away from using Hendel's Air Conditioning.  We have had nothing but trouble with the new a/c unit that was installed in the summer of 2011 and the customer service people are downright rude when we call to have the problems addressed.  They don't seems to care one bit about the quality of their products, or the happiness of their customers.  The technicians that have come out have been very friendly and professional, but can't seem to determine why our new unit keeps breaking.  Save yourself a lot of headaches and use a different provider for your heating & air conditioning needs.
