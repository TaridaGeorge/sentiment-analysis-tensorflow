Great donuts but horrible service... Didn't get anything we wanted due to a language barrier between us and the limited English speaking employee. She claimed, in broken English, to only speak Spanish. She understood ONLY the word "dozen" and we got a dozen of what ever she felt like giving us, then proceeded to ignore us while using her cell phone!
Donut shops are a dime a dozen and we will never again return to Bosa.
