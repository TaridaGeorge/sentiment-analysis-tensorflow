This business operates like it's 1950. I went in to buy some Italian sausage and a sandwich and my bill was about $9.00. I was told I could not pay for it unless I spent $10.00. I was not offered any type of alternative. I was just looked at by a double digit IQ moron behind the counter with a blank stare. How do places like this operate in 2011? They at least should have someone in there who has more than a GED slinging grub.
