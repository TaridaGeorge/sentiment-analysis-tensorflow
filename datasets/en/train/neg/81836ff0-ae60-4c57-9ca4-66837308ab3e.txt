We drove over 50 miles to eat here.  Sadly, it is the most astonishingly horrible food I think that we have ever eaten (not just Chinese).  The fried rice was simply the worst we've ever had and we COULD NOT eat it!  We were there Sunday for dim sun.  We couldn't even eat the food, paid, left and went elsewhere to eat.  Being raised in Chicago & eating in Chinatown there in San Francisco, Sacramento & Boston, I cannot EVEN imagine these restaurant owners have are thinking.
