Whoever the manager was on Sunday 30th Dec was awful. I called to let him know that we got a pizza with things on it we did not order. His response was, "we use a mix so if you order green peppers you get other peppers, and i'll bet you $1000.00 there was no tomato on your pizza, you're just saying that because you didn't like my pizza".
Not acceptable. I will never go there again. We have given them many chances and I'm always disappointed. If I have the opportunity to talk to the owner I will let him know his people need to step it up...My only frustration is that we actually have tipped ungrateful people :(
