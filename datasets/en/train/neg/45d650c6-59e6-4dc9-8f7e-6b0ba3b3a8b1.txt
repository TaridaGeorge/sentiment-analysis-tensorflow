I don't eat meat so I probably shouldn't have gone here. My husband got the "Arizona" burger and really enjoyed it. I went with the vegetarian burger which is basically black beans smashed together. I do like black beans, but I don't like black beans with mustard, pickles and onion on top of a bun. I enjoyed the rosemary & olive oil fries, but not enough for me to come back a second time.

Our total was $15.00 and that was not money well spent.
