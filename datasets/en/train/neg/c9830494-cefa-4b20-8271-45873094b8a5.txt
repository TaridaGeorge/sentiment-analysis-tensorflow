I had a sub and since in the name of the restaurant it says sub's I figured it was ok to order... Boy was I wrong!!! The meat is not sliced there, it is slimy packaged meat!!! Nasty!  If you are going to open a restaurant where you serve sandwiches, don't you think it would be a good investment to buy a meat slicer and the meat?  I almost threw up, I could not even swallow it, I spit it out, a waist of $8!
