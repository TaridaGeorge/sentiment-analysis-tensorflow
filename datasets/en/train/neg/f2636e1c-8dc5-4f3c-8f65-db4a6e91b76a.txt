The food is really good- the customer relations stink.
We've been many times and always enjoyed the food, but the loud dance music, which is played even at lunch time, is clearly for the enjoyment of the employees.
The last time we ate here, we asked to be seated away from the overhead speakers. Still, it was so loud we couldn't hear each other, so I eventually asked the waitress to turn the music down. She did, but right away one of the sushi chefs confronted her and angrily turned it back up! Won't ever be back.
I'm really tired of restaurants playing music or t.v.s. Some of us actually talk over a meal.
