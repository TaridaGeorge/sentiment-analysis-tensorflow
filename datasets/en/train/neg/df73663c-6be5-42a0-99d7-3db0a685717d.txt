I was extremely excited to check this NEW restaurant out. I was craving BBQ and their menu was very enticing on-line.  I stopped in on a Sat night at 8:30 and it was pretty quiet.  Great menu options but very poor food, I had a combo plate with rubbery texture ribs  YUCK! and my Hubby had the pulled pork sand which was tasteless.  I would prob not go back.  Stacy's BBQ in Phx is much better as well as The Pitt's Again in Glendale.  Sugarbowl next door made up for the horrid meal.
