Treated with complete disrespect. Worst service I have ever experienced.  After waiting to see the manager I was directed to an employee who committed slander towards me very loudly in front of everyone in the store. Then the manager stepped in, spoke robotically without listening and then was incredibly harsh in tone and told me to leave. He said, "leave, get out, now"
