I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. The wife and I came here for Valentines Day. Overpriced and disgusting. The calamari was soggy and completely tasteless. The smoked salmon was also very bland. My wife had the organic chicken that was the highlight of the meal. Then I had the rack of lamb that was cold and completely undercooked. The wife had the bars of sin that was anything but special. Finally I had creme brulee that tasted like I was eating raw eggs with a candy coating on top. It took over 2 hours to get out of this hell hole for a 3 course meal. I will never come back here for any occasion. Good luck to you if you decide otherwise.
