Won't be going back.

The food was so so.  The Front of the House was a disaster.

We arrived early.  With no real bar area we were taken out back to the fire pit area and told a server would be a long to get us drinks.  After waiting 15 minutes, I went in and ordered myself.

We were eventually seated 30 minutes after our reservation.  They were then out of the entree I had chosen.

The courses came very slowly.  We had to send back my wife's entree as it was undercooked.

The only highlight was the pasta dish.

There are many better choices out there.
