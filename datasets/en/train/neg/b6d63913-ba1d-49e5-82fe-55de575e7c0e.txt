STAY AWAY unless you want a lifetime membership!! They make it impossible to cancel. Their CANCELLATION FORM is deliberately misleading in that the whole thing is about why you are canceling,etc., and right where you sign, it says that you agree to continue. They would not give a refund after they have been taking money from my credit card for 1 and 1/2 years after not using the gym and thinking we have cancelled. STAY AWAY unless you want a lifetime membership.
