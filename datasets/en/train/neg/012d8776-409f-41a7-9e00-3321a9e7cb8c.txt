The B&N in Peoria has to be the most lackluster B&N in Phoenix. Just looking at the exterior compared to other B&N is very dated. As a reviewer mentioned, you walk inside and the ambiance just isn't there. This store needs major updating.

I am shocked that B&N has this store in Aarowhead. Please build a better, larger store in Aarowhead or Westgate as we deserve something better than this.
