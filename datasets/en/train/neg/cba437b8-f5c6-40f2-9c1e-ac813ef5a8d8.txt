Took my son here for his 5th birthday yesterday along with 7 other family members....they refused to sing Happy Birthday to my son (it was an arranged birthday party); 2 of the people that had the fajitas are now extremely ill...this place is awful and should be shut down. Our waiter was always missing and every meal we had was cold.
