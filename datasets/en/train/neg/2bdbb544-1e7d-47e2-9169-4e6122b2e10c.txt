I intended for this review to be a scathing critique of the Arcadia location.  I cannot comment on the Glendale Pete's because I have not dined there, my apologies Glendale Pete's Fish and Chips.   This place is worse than the worst review I read so far.  Right, the locals really do love Pete's and I think I know why.  They were brought here when they were kids and have fond memories of the place.  If you want good short order style fish and chips go out to a real restaurant like the Fish Market/Blue Water, try the Hidden House on Fridays.  Hidden House pricing on the specials is pretty good,  the wait staff is cool and they serve beer!
