The first time we went we liked the food and service. We went back, big mistake. My wife asked for wine, expecting the house wine, she received the most expensive wine they had, $8.75 for half a small glass. I never received a water and neither one of us received or were asked if we wanted a drink that was supposedly free with the meal..The service was not what we were expecting at all. When our meal arrived, my 3 noodles stuffed with cheese were tasty, but they were not very filling. I'm glad we went the second time as we were planning a grad dinner there. We will have it elsewhere.
