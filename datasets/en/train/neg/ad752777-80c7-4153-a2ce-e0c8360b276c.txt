I won a "free" oil change at Sun Devil Auto through the local soccer program.  When I had the oil changed, they stripped the threads on not only the oil plug, but also on the oil pan.  Their solution to the problem was to plug it with a bigger plug and said they would have to charge me to replace the pan.  The oil, however, is still leaking.  Meanwhile, there is no place in town that will change my oil without me replacing the pan.  This "free" oil change is costing me a fortune!!!
