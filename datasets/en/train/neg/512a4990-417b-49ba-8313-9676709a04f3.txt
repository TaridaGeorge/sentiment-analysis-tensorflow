Terrible service, mediocre food!

Our waiter was a jerk!  The place was not busy.  Waiter left us without drinks for 15 minutes or more.  Entrees took over an hour to get to our table which would have been OK had the waiter kept us updated and bothered to show his face at our table (but he couldn't be bothered).  He walked by many times to serve everyone around us, but ignored our table.  Someone from our table had to go hunt the waiter down 3 times to get service.  I guess the waiters at this place are allowed to discriminate!  

When the food arrived it was not worth the wait.  I didn't even finish it.  The harried-looking manager offered us a free dessert, but we were so mad at the bad service we got our check and left.
WILL NEVER GO TO THIS PLACE AGAIN!!!!!
