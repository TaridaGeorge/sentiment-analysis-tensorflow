None of our rooms were ready when we arrived; the staff was INCREDIBLY rude. Our room smelled like chemical and the windows can't be opened. We came here for a wedding and not one person in the party was impressed. It's a shame that such a beautiful hotel is so horribly run. I would rather stay in a motel.
