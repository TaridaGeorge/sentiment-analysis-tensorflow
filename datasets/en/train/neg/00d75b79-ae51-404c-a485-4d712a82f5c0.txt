The ONLY thing I like about this dinasour is entering through the kitchen.

Unfriendly bartenderS, two of them, food is ok, but let's not go crazy here, it's not great.  Just another "institiution" that gets a free pass because...I don't know why they get a free pass.

The red-flocked wall paper is older than dirt; so are the waitresses.  Just so mediocre.  So many other places to go.
