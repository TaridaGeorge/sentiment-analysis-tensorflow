I went to Kabuki last night for a drink with 4 other friends and to get a little Sushi.  Drinks took forever to get the waiter told me that I had to order a drink first instead of sushi really WTF.  It was an hour for one order of drinks and two appetizers.  We then had to go out of our way to get our bill.  Great atmosphere good food Crappy staff..
