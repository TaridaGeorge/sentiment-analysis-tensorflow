If I could give it a negative , I WOULD!!!! I made my order, everything seem to be ok, I got a call an HOUR later, saying that they don't deliver to us, we are 2 minutes out of their delivery area and the cashier made a mistake when he took our order. They already made the pizzas but they can't bring them out . and they could do anything about it. They said so sorry. We order from another pizza place which took another hour.
