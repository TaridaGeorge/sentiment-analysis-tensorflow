Entering the store is visually overwhelming. There were so many things take in, I thought I'd found my new grocery store. 
I wandered for a good 40 mins checking everything out.... 
After the ether wore I began to realize something. While the selection was wide, it look OLD. 
I raced to the fresh fish and noticed that even packed in ice their little fish eyeballs where cloudy and sunken into the sockets. 
I looked at the frozen section and found some fish that had a sell by date of 02/2010. There was other fish that was packed by the store  with no packed on or sell by dates. There was canned and boxed food past their expiration date. 
I checked out this place on the Maricopa County health department and they had their fare share of customer complaint driven inspections.
