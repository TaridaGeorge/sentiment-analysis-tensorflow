Went here for a weekend getaway. Deal was too good resort credit equal to the room rate.....good right....well not so much. 

Arrival- very dated facilities I'd say circa 1980. Key card didn't open door back to lobby we go. 1st room right next to main stairwell and elevator with kids running up and down it....new room please.

Second room....burn holes in the carpet, bathroom was in a word gross.

Other comments....one pool...that's it. One tiny pool for everyone at the resort.

Called the front desk said we'd like to cancel our reservation as the resort does not meet our expectations. Thank God they did because I was prepared for a fight. 

If I could give this palce 0 starts I would. Old and disgusting.
