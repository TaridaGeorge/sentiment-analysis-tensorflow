Ok, I'm not from the South, I'm not a BBQ connoisseur BUT I've eaten enough good BBQ to know what a beef brisket sandwich is supposed to taste like.  What I had at Famous Dave's earlier this afternoon was NOT BBQ.  It was thawed meat that tasted like Little League hot dogs and with absolutely no BBQ sauce.  Honestly, the best part of my meal was the bread.  Yeah, that's what I came for...the bread.  Do yourself a favor and skip Famous Dave's. Skip the crap chain restaurants are dishing out and go for a mom and pop BBQ place.
