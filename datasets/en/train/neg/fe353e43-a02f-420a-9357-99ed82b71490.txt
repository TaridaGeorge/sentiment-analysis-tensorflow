If you're looking for vastly overpriced, underwhelming, unbalanced dishes in a beat-up, oppressive and dated environment, Vincent's just might be for you. If you like dining in a hot box because the owner is too cheap to crank the AC, this place might be for you. If you enjoy a kitchen that won't make the dishes you want and runs out of things, this really might be for you. If the prospect of 3 scallops for $18 sounds like a screaming deal, get down there right now. I felt like I was "playing" at fine dining as we sat whispering in this awful room with 4 other tables with those can lights shining right in our faces. Ugh. And the food, so heavy and old-fashioned. The waiters seem so beaten down and miserable in their tuxes. Throw in an unnecessary $2 valet, and the picture is complete.
