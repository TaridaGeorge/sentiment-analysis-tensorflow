I had a $25 coupon here and man do I wish I would have given it away, or maybe just thrown it away. I remember going here when I was a kid. I used to think all the ties hanging from the celling were so cool. Anyway, this place sucks. Everything we had, had no flavor, was cooked like crap, and just down right sucked. Even the corn was ice cold! How do you mess up corn? So even with the 25 bucks off I still spent around $60 and left very unsatisfied. This is a no go fo sho. If you are in the hood up there and need a good place to eat try Greesewood Flats, or Sassi. I guess I should write reviews on those places.... Maybe one day
