This place is ridiculous.  For the record, the view is really nice and worth seeing, but the food is atrocious.  It's not that the ideas for a particular dish aren't interesting, it's that the meats, cuts, and vegetables are flavorless and/or terrible.  For a $35 salmon dish, the salmon dish was farmed!  Farmed salmon at a restaurant like this!  What are they trying to pass off on us?!?  Moreover, the wine list was terrible.  

So the view may be good but if I remember correctly, you go to restaurants for food.  But, apparently the restaurateurs who conceived the elements don't subscribe to this philosophy.
