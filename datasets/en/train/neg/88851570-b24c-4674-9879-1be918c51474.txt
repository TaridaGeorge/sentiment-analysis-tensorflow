I received flowers today from my best friend for my birthday. She ordered them through FTD and they were delivered by Flowers 2005. I sent a photo of the arrangement with a thank you text to my friend and she called me immediately letting me know that was not what she order. The arrangment consisted of 6 gerber daisys, it looked like a $5 bunch of flowers from Trader Joes with extra greenery. An embarrassing situation for us both, glad we are such great friends. Unfortunately, being new to town and knowing that this is what I can expect from Flowers 2005 I will never order flowers from them.
