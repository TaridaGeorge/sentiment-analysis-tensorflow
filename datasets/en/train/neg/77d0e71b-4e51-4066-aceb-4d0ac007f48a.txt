I thought I would try out this location after my previous auto shop had closed and hoped, being that AAA recommended it, it would provide good honest service.  

Had an oil change/maintenance check done there and was please with the service.  But when I returned to have it looked at after the engine light went on, their "diagnostics" test was going to cost $105!  And that wouldn't have been waived if I had the service completed there!  I had to pass....free diagnostics test are available everywhere, don't be suckered!
