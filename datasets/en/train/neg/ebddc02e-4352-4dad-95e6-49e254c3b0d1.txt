We tried this for the first time tonight. March 16. Two weeks after opening.  Party of four. Very uninspired to say the least. Cold food. Poorly spiced. Good service , i felt bad for the servers, they seem to know the food is crap...bland cold ...yuck.  
The water was served with no ice   The calamari was as boring as fish sticks The pasta dish was cold and hard. There was no flavor to anything ....Boring chain. Don't bother.  I am holding back here. I could say much more. It's just a sad chain.  Pathetic.
