Place is so grossss total dump, I recently went to tempe for spring training and this place was right next door to our hotel "comfort inn"  this place is a dump big mistake food is like rubber and greasy not to mention you have to pay sauce??? that is just stupid  not to mention it's cash out, that should of been a red flag for dump.  Gave me an upset stomach
