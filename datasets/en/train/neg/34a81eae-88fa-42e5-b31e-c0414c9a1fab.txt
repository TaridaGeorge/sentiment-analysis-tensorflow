I am actually really disappointed in the service I got today. I went in and was deciding what I wanted to get. I saw that there was a chocolate moo'd and a peanut butter moo'd. I asked if I could mix the two so I could share the drink with my girlfriend. 

The girl answered: "Yeah, they're both made of the same thing, with different things in them." 

I'm still not sure what that means. She then snapped at my girlfriend and didn't even ask us if we wanted a free boost. 

It's a shame because I don't think we have ever had bad service at this establishment. It's one reason we've returned consistently.
