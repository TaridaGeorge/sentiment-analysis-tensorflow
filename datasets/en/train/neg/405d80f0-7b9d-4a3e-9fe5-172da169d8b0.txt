Tourist trap in downtown Scottsdale.  Beau and I were in for an awesome pizza experience.  What we actually got was: 

1. An antipasto that competed only with Costco tasters.  Haven't seen an antipasto so sparse  - with a few red peppers from the jar - in the Phoenix area. 

2. A server so lazy that apparently didn't wish to  recall the beers available - hey, just read the menu.  

3. Calzone was full of ricotta and cheese.  Nope, no flavor. 

4. Garlic pizza was okay.
