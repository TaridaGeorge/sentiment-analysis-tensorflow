We chose Bourbon Steak for restaurant week and were sadly disappointed. We were seated in the bar not the actual restaurant as apparently they did not want to offend regular clientele with the servings. Several couples were  all seated together along a wall with the restaurant week menus. The server came and told us he recommended a Kobe steak, interesting, as it was the most expensive item. We were given a salad that honestly had 4 bites. The portions were small and the food was so average. Will never be back.
