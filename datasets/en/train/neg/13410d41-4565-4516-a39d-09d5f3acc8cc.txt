The Wontons (Crab Ragoons) were just awful...it was a shame to spend $7 on such a horrible appetizer. The California roll had a stick of imitation crab and the Sashimi tasted like it was very poor quality/cheap.
The music was blasting so that I had to yell across the table to my boyfriend. The bartender was sitting at the bar, drinking with his drunk friends. 
Bottom line: I won't ever go back.
