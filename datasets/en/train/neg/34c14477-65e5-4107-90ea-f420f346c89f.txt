No good. Ghetto people live here and just walk into your apartment. Tons of brat kids in the parking lot that run at your car, neighbors suck, new RIVERSTONE management sucks, shootings happened 3 times that I lived there in 9 months. Alliance maintenance was great and right on the golf course was beautiful. Layout on 2 bedroom also nice but Too many other problems. Crappy carpet, upgrades are poorly done and hair was painted into the walls throughout. Can hear everything around you all the time and parking sucks for guests.
