There is nothing good about this place.  I am guessing most people that come here have never had a real philly.  This philly is a meat sandwich.  Nothing traditional about the Philly here, wrong cheese, wrong bread wrong everything  The fries were under cooked too.  Simply flavorless.  Don't waste your time or money.
