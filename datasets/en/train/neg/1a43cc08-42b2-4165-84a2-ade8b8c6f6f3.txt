Efes Turkish Cuisine is only Turkish restaurant you can find in Tempe but   it might be a misleading place for Turkish cuisine. 
I am originally Turkish and I do have idea about best Turkish food. First of all, stuffed grape leaves was dissapointing because they were using can product. No original Turkish tea and the meat was not really good. People can find very interesting due to belly dancer and live music. Unfortunately, live music is not Turkish at all. This restaurant can not represent what real Turkish food is.
