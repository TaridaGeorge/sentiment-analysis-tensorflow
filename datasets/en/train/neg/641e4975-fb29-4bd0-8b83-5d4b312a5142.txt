If you're serious about working out, this is not the place to go.
Equipment is always broken - both weight machines and cardio.
There are only a few clips for the barbells.
Pool is cloudy and dirty.
The staff is not friendly whatsoever - people working at the front desk never smile or say hi when you walk in.

I guess that's what you get for $25/month.
