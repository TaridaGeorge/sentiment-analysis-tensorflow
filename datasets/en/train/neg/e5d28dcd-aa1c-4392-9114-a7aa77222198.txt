Terribly disappointed! Anyone who knew this is a new product from Julian Wright's family ( owner of Canteen + la bocca + handlebar) would expect at least minimum service at this new bar, but ironically this bar is AWFUL at service. It took the waitress 20 min to attend us ( they were soo busy with their girl talk near their booths), we got our beers after 10 min and that was it. We didn't see them until after 30 minutes even after making constant eye contact and as a desperate attempt I had to whistle, got our check and left! RUINED my date night:-( . We felt like our business is not appreciated at all! There are a lot of friendly bars on Mill Ave. ...Handlebar and Julian Wright, you can do better than that!
