this place sucked.  plain and simple.  we had just finished cheers-ing with champagne for the very beginning of my sister's trying-on of wedding gowns, and a trashy lady and her mom walked past us into the store yelling "If you're gonna get married, DONT DO IT!" then approached us in the store to try to sell us her dress before she puts it on craigslist bc she's getting a divorce.  a perfect intro to this place and how it's run. temperature was over 80 degrees, she was sweating and it was incredibly hot trying on each dress. when asked for a clip to help with the back of the dress, the lady responded, "so NOW you want my help?" after 3 dresses we got the heck outta there and instead went to Brilliant Bridal in Mesa...it was fantastic!!
