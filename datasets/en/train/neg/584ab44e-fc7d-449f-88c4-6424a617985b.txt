I have always been a huge fan and have sent lots of people there. But that has all changed. The staff is incredibly rude, the manager Cameron has no customer service skills and yelled at customers. There used to be a friendly staff, this place is getting to have a bad reputation. When I was there I heard severs cussing and complaining about their tables....right infront of everyone!! I will NEVER go back to the Scottsdale location inless the staff gets better, as of now Chandler still has my business.
