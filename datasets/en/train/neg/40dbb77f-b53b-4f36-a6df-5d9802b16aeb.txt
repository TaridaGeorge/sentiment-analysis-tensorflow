Avoid this Olive Garden at all costs.  The host discriminates against minorities.  This is the second time this man insisted on showing us to the worst table in the house and when we asked for a different table continued to stear us where we would not "offend" the other patrons, dressed in shorts, flipflops and t-shirts.  Tables he selected for us included, a very large table for 8 for our party of 3  way in the back of the restaurant, next to the kitchen; a table right next to a dirty serving station, and a table in an alcove where our party was not visible to others.  

Although we asked for a more desirable table, it was refused.  Favored guests had one thing in common--they were all white, while all minority patrons were seated in undesirable spots.
