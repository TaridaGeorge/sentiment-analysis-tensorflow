This had to be the worst asian buffet I have ever been to, although it was late in the day for lunch, nothing was replenished, the food was cold and tasted like cardboard.
The service was rude and nothing was cleared apporiately. There was limited variety of meat dishes. Do not recomend and would not return. This certainly was not a bargain
