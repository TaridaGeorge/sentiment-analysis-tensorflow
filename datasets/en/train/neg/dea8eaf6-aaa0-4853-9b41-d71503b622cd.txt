Ok, seriously @Starbucks, there should not be visible evidence on the toilet seat that the prior user was... um.... having a bad day.

Gross.

No other comments. That's just unacceptable.

BTW: after being there at least 90 minutes, I used the restroom again just prior to leaving, and there had been zero cleaning done.

NEVER GOING BACK TO THIS LOCATION!
