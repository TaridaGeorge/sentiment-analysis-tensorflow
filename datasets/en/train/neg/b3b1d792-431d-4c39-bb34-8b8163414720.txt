ok so I work next door at the bead store, we've all had our share of encounters with this horrible place. A couple of times we've gotten bugs in our food... not fun! We have rats coming thru our walls from their place... and we always see them sharpening their tools outside on the cement. Not to mention, the owner is a complete bitch! She is rude and i would NEVER NEVER recommend this place to anyone. We have customers coming in all the time complaining about this place or asking us how their food is, and as soon as we tell them the horrors, they thank us, and we reccomend them to a nicer better place.
