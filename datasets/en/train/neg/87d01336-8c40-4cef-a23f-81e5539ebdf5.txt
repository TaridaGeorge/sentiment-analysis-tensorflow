CrackerJax is rediculous.  First we played mini-golf....the "greens" are worn out and covered in leaves and crap from the trees around them.  Then the boys went on bumper boats - I honestly dont think they have EVER changed the water in there - eww!  Finally we went and hit golf balls....we paid $25 for buckets of balls, and there was a problem with the balls we got from the machine - and I asked the kid inside for a manager and he said "you can ask for one but I cant do anything for you and they wont either".  Now THAT is customer service.  Five of us there tonight - spent $150.....wont make that mistake again.  In the words of my kids...."this place is SO ghetto"......

I will post a picture of what the balls look like that you get at their driving range....outrageous!
