I have been back to this Honey Bear's location several times since my first review.  And the place has gotten significantly worse on each subsequent visit.  This last visit will definitely be my last.  The place does not look well maintained at all and the food was an utter disappointment.  I ordered my usual hot link sandwich and my other half ordered a pulled pork sandwich.  My hot link sandwich was so so sad.  And the pulled pork sandwich was not only smaller and on different bread but also lacking taste or flavor, and add to that it not tasty.  Of course, it gave him heartburn later to his dismay   Now I need to find myself another place to sate my hot link cravings!.
