Used to be a decent place but had a REALLY BAD experience recently - food poisoning.  We ordered a spinach pizza without cheese and four of us shared it.  All four were doubled over the next day with cramps and the rest of it.  Called the store and they promised to follow up and call back but never did.  Shows that they are not only careless but also seemingly willing to play fast and loose with customer loyalty.  Hope the City of Scottsdale gives their operations a careful look.  Will not be going there again ever.
