The worst bra shopping experience of my life. After "spilling out" of a 32 DDI figured it was time to get re-measured. I was "measured" so poorly the girl suggested a 34 B or C - uhm needless to say if you spill out of a DD a B or C is going to be comical. The fit was so off and the girl seemed okay with it, job well done in her mind. My husband was laughing seeing me (which almost made the experience fun). I had a LOT more luck at Belle Lacet in Chandler - there you are actually fitted and the service is  EXCELLENT.
