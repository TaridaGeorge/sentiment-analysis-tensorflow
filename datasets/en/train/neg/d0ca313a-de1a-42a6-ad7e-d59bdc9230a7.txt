I had my wedding here and I was promised the moon and the stars.  However, on the day of my wedding nothing that was promised happened. My guests wandered around the property confused because they couldn't find our wedding (no signage/unfriendly staff), the 20 gift bags we prepared for our guests were stolen by the hotel staff, they fraudulently charged our credit card, and I could keep going!  Not only was our wedding day a disaster the hotel rooms were sub par. The sheets were stained with blood and is was very obvious that renovations and repairs were needed. Lastly, when trying to resolve these issues with the hotel management they were rude, unethical and uncooperative. My wedding day memories will forever be sour.  I will NEVER go back here!
