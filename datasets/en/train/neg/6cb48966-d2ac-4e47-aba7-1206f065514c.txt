Sports Authority...
Hi do you have black and white referee shirts?
Yeah, let me go check the sizes.
Great.
We have medium through extra large.
Awesome! And do those have a collar like a polo shirt? 
Yeah. 
Great, I'll be in today. 

*time passes*

Uhm, excuse me are these the only referee shirts you have?
Yup.
Ok because I was told you had one with a collar.
No, just those.
Well I wish I knew before driving all the way over here.
Yeah, sorry about that.

(had to grab it anyway, with only a few hours before an event in Phoenix requiring me to be in some sort of football related garb, the collar less V NECK was the best I could do with limited time)
