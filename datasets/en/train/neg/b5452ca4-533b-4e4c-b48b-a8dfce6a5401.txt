The hotel bar/restaurant isn't worth the free drink coupon. The menu isn't appealing and neither is the decor. 
All I wanted to do was get to sleep before my early morning meeting, but some kids were making a lot of noise at the pool.

As for the positives...close to the highway and the staff was friendly. 

The room was clean (enough) but I wore my flip flops, because I didn't want my bare feet on the carpet.

The cleaning people did a good job. The whole hotel just needs updating. Ive stayed at other "four points" and most are very nice...just not this one.
