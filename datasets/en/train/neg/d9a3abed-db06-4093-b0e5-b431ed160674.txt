They manage to cram chicken stock or other chicken parts into every single soup, including a basic tomato soup.  And don't bother asking if the "vegetable soup" is vegetarian either, because they pretty much all have chicken parts in them.

Why not fix the soups like your competition did, and this will be a non-issue.
