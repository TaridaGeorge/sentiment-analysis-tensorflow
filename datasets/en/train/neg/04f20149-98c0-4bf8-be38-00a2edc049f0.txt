Are you kidding me???!! The lady at the drive through here didn't want to hand me my drink until I handed her my card! HAHA really??!! My girlfriend was fumbling through her purse to find the debit card and I tried to reach for the drink she was handing me out of the drive through window and she immediately pulled the drink back and said, " um... How about you pay me first." Do I look that untrustworthy? Talk about making a customer feel low! I guess she thought I was going to drive off with a fountain drink and leave the rest of the order... What a joke!
