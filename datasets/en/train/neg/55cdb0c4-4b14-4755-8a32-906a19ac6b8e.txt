I cannot fathom why anyone thinks this is good thai....
nothing fresh about anything we ate, and in fact, I was sick (literally) after eating here. Guess I"m spoiled from eating authentic thai in Hawaii all the time, but this is a big thumbs down.
Lukewarm spring rolls, a soup that was not close to hot, and miss-the-mark entree's...me no likey....
