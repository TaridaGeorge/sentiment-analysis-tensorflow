Hostess is awkward and not friendly . 

We ordered jalape√±os on our burgers and instead of coming to tell us they were out, she just put jabaneros on it, and didn't say anything . A mouth full of fire later I ask wtf and she says oh yeah we substitute ........ Thanks for asking me .  Additionally, neither burger had the bacon we ordered on it. 

Potato salad was good but served with plastic spoons? 

Garlic fries were soggy .

Food was acceptable: I would try again. Can't speak for the wings.
