ARE YOU SERIOUS!!  This place is a joke.  Not only do they do a terrible job, but they try to hustle and intimidate you into buying their super expensive detail service, especially that loser Brain.  The constant pressure up-selling I can handle, but when they consistently return your car with water streaks, dirty windows, poorly vacuumed interior (one time they completely missed the sand in my car when they "vacuumed"), then it's time to go somewhere else.  Save your money, and the hassles associated with this place.
