What happened to this place? We have been here quite a few times and this last visit will probably be the last. We had bad service from the get go. No one sat us right away the servers were walking by looking at us but no host came. I had trouble finding anything on the menu that on a hot day in phoenix sounded good. Everything is pricey too for being so-so food. Salads are $10 and up. A trip to the bathroom grossed me out with greasy smudged hand prints all over the black stall doors. Walking back I noticed the floors were covered in crumbs and food. Our little boy dropped something under our table and let's just say they can keep it because it was filthy under there. 
No more rock bottom for us!
