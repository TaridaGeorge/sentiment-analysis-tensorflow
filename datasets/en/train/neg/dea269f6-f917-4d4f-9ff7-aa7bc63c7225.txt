4th time coming here, and it is Friday, Feb. 26th, 2010 evening. Never had bad service before, but this time was different. I really hate to post this, but the server wasn't properly trained & the service was horrible. We ordered our usual...received the food (shabu shabu), and wanted the same service with the mixed egg at the end, but the serve told us that they were too busy to do it for and that we had to wait. 9 tables and 3 servers, really??!!! R we not a customer too??!!! Incredibly dissappointed!! I've better to busier restaurants than this, and have never been told by a server that they were too busy and i had to wait. Need I say more.
