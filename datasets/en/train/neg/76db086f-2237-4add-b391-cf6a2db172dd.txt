I'm one of those people who remember going here as a child. Haven't been for many many years. Went for lunch yesterday to the Tempe location. Should have had the pizza I guess but the pasta caught our eye so I had the lasagna and my mom had the chicken parmagiana. AWFUL!!  The sauce tasted like it was tomato paste straight out of a can. There was very little mozzarella or ricotta cheese in my lasagna.  My sister had tortellini Alfredo and although the sauce was watery she liked it.  I would only go back to maybe try the pizza but it's unlikely. There are too many good Italian/pizza places nearer to my home.
