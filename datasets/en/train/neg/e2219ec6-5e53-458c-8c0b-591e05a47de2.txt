Trailer trash Phoenix now have a home! This place smells of urine but of which the aroma candles that are burning cannot cover. The locals with no taste in music, the songlist is all over the place with no sense of direction. Bare and lacking, the decor is in major need of the Fab 5 from NYC. I'm sorta afraid of even trying the food. Beach theme in the middle of the desert? Get the picture. Someone mentioned an Open Mike Night, but not gonna stick around here, I'm too afraid of what I'll see. Too many people wearing sweat pants for my like, and the woman next to me at the bar is using a hand stapler that the barkeep loaned out so she could 'fix' her shoe!?!?
Did I mention the drinks are dirt cheap?
