Came here with my family on a Friday night and the place was empty... not a good sign.  We had a restaurant.com certificate which we had printed that day.  The manager refused to honor the certificate saying that they were no longer a participating location.  Not sure where the mix up was, but we were not going to eat at a place with no one else.  Hope this saves someone a trip if they were planning on using a restaurant.com certificate- don't waste your time.
