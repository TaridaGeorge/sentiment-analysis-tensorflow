Stopped by for just a cocktail and to check the place out.  The bartender was rude and short with us.  After three attempts of trying to figure out what she was saying, we got it!  We didn't even get a chance to look at the menu as we couldn't finish our cocktails fast enough.  There was not a very welcoming atmosphere, apparently unless you are a regular, and the "smoking patio" is a joke.  Because of the non-welcoming atmosphere, we won't be back.
