Another restaurant that I can't figure out why people flock to it.  The food is downright bad.  My husband loves steak and gets sick if this restaurant is mentioned.  The sweet potatoe must have been cooked and then frozen and then thawed... it was so runny and icky.  How do you mess up a sweet potatoe?
