NEVER AGAIN.  Stopped in for a late lunch and there were about 10 cars in the parking lot. We walked in and found two other parties waiting on tables (and there were many available).  Staff walked by, totally ignoring us for about 5 minutes.  Finally we all ended up getting seated.  Then we waited and waited for someone to acknowledge us.  We finally got our drinks and after some time our order.  The food was not good, the service was bad.  The place was old and decrepid.  I can't image ever needing to go back.
