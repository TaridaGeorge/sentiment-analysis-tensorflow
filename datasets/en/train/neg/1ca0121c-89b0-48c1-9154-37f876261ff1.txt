Yeah this place is pretty bad. Hillarious crowd, dudes wearing Tupac spraypainted on there shirtz, multiple nfl patched jeans, etc. I've seen a couple people get kicked out, its good times. If you are a big fan of Souja Boy, this is the place for you. That song hits like every other jam. And in between most likely either "in da club" or Usher. Thats right, Usher. Bottom line, if you have to come  here, get really drunk. But do it beforehand because drinks are a bit pricey.
