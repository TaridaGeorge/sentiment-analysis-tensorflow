I know a laundromat is a laundromat but seriously, this one sucked--and I can say with confidence that I know laundromats well.

While it was only 90 degrees outside, the air conditioner was not on. I was sweating rather uncomfortably which made the already miserable laundry experience an even more miserable one.

In addition, the televisions were not on and we observed a customer putting Lysol in a machine with the employees knowledge of it.
