You get a lot for your money,  but that doesn't mean anything if you can't eat the food. We ordered chicken lo mein chicken fried rice and orange chicken. The noodles in the lo mein were edible but the chicken not so much. My daughter said the orange chicken was awful, I just took her word for it. And the fried rice wasn't  fresh. Waste of our money overall.  Their chicken taste boiled with no flavor. Good thing I had a coupon! Will not be going back.
