The drive through order taker was very rude, and interrupted me several times to ask questions she would have had answers to had she not interrupted me! Also, she asked me if there was "anything else" EVERY TIME I spoke. 
The experience at the window wasn't much better. I ordered ice cream as well as hot food, so my order took a little longer to process (which is to be expected). Instead of greeting me, taking my payment and giving me my drink I was left to sit for 5 minutes wondering if I should just drive away.
In my past experiences this DQ has always been horrible, but today's interactions prompted me to post here as well as on their website.
