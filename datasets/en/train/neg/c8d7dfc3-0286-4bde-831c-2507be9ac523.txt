I really wanted to love this because I am a downtown resident who loves to eat out, but I'm sad to say I won't go here again for dining.  I left feeling that I had just spent $15 on a small bowl of spaghetti-o's, and the packaged, stale breadsticks also left a lot to be desired.

I hope the powers-that-be at PastaBAR will note the negative reviews and re-work the menu, because the location and decor are amazing!
