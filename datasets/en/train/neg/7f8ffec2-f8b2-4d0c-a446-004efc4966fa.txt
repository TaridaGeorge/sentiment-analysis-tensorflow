I'm used to the Dave and Busters in Cleveland Ohio which is the size of a small city

This Dave and Busters is much smaller than the Cleveland one, and it didn't have a lot of my favorite games  :(

Next time I'll just stick in my hood and go to Gameworks

Dave and Busters - Gameworks - Jillians = all the same!  THEY'RE THE SAME!

Just go to the one closest to your house.

Boo.
