Yowza! Where to begin...first of all, we've driven past this place hundreds of times...and now we know why! Only reason we went in is because we had a coupon (they seem to hate coupons as employees). 
The service was horrendous! Totally rude and rather expensive for a bagel joint. It seems as though the only qualification to work here is the ability to come in at 5:30am. 
Egg and sausage are pre-made and are nuked for breakfast bagels.
As we were sitting in the restaurant (which was dirty), we noticed that the drive-thru wait was at least 6 minutes per person. Definitely not worth the wait. 
Needless to say, we won't be going back.
