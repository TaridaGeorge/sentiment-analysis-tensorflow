When the bread basket arrived filled with hot, flakey, tender, and tasty biscuits, we had high hopes for the rest of our meal. Sadly, they ended up the best part. 

If you do go, expect a wonderful view of the city lights and a loud, lively environment, but don't come for the food. 

Biscuits: awesome - they deserve applause.
Snake: too tough to chew. (Yes, we tried it.)
Salad: swimming in the dressing and tomato was spongey.
Potato Skins: cold and strange flavor.
Ribs: they were not falling-off-the-bone. The steak knife could barely separate one rib from the other. They were lukewarm with ho-hum flavor.
Corn: mushy
Green Beans: fine
Surprise Cotton Candy: cute and sweet

We were looking forward to a great experience, but left feeling like the smell of the steer manure at the entrance should have been a premonition: The food stinks, too!
