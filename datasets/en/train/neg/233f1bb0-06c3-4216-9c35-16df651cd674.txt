Walking in to this sprint store is a drag, no one greets you and if you do get lucky enough to get the help of one of the employees, in my experience, they act like its such a chore to tell you about their phones. When I went, there wasn't a single customer in the store besides myself and my sister, and 4 employees were chatting away! One tore himself away from them just to inform me that all the phones i was looking at were the exact same and he cant say that any are better quality than the other because there isn't a shred of difference between them- the epic 4g, evo shift and evo 3d. I was like ooookay and left having felt none the wiser about getting a new phone.
