I would give these guys 0 stars if I could, LIES, LIES, LIES!

Called and book my appt a day in advance... Then the next day, waiting... waiting for them to come I call to see where they were? -- Mind you THIS IS 30 minutes after my appointment window--

The guy "Santiago" on the other line a. has no clue who i am (which should have tipped me off in the first place that they were unprofessional), and b. continues to say someone called and canceled my appointment... YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING ME! You don't know who I am but then someone cancels my appointment and that's somehow right???

AVOID at all costs, not worth your time or hassle.
