SADLY, you never know until YOU FIND OUT!  

Originally the stain work she laid on my concrete floor was refreshing UNTIL it started to fade just a month after she stained my concrete floor and NOW she is blaming the manufacturers of the stain and not fulfilling her responsibility to make the faded work right by using another product.  Sometimes things go awry.  WE KNOW THIS.  For a professional to not take responsibility and come through with a solution to an $1,800 job is more than IRRESPONSIBLE and UNPROFESSIONAL.  I am disappointed in the overall experience with Lucretia and I am unable to endorse her with a pure heart. 

After this experience with her she has shown emotional unsteadiness and a vindictive behaviour that is clearly unhealthy.   

With great sadness after 5 years of doing business with her,
