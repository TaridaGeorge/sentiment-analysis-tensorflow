This was my first experience having Vietnamese food in Phoenix.  Maybe my expectations were a little to high. The place is small, run down and dirty. The floors looked like they hadn't been cleaned in months. The service was okay, but the disappointment came with the food. I don't think I can go back. I thought it was way to greasy... I won't be going back Needless, who cares about the price.
