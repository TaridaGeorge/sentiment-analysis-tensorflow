We are usually HUGE fans of ethnic marketplaces and food courts wherever we travel, but a word of caution here is needed.  My partner became violently ill after the combo plate here yesterday.  He had the birria and the red chili with beef and potatoes.  I had the  carnitas plate and was fine.  If the food looks like its been on the line too long, it probably has been.
