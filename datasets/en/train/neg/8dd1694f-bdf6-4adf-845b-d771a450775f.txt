It sucks that Yelp won't let me give this dump less than one star. DO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOT waste your time at this bar. Nobody goes to this bar. There might be 30 people there when a band plays, but if there is no band the bar is a ghost town. The bar could be cool, but there are like 5 owners who have no business running a bar. Go into the bar on a Friday night and you will know what I mean. The main owner must have deep pockets to keep funneling money into this waste zone. Give up and let somebody else make a good bar in that location. Stop over charging for drinks. It doesn't take a college grad to figure out lower drink prices and hot waitresses bring in paying customers.
