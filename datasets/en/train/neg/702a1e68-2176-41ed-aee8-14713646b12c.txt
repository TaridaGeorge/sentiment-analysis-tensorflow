I love buffets but this place has gone down hill. I was never really that crazy about this place but it went from about a 2.5 to a 1 since the last time I was here. Mac an cheese was watery, chicken alfredo was blah. Nothing was "bad" it just was not good. They had some enchiladas that looked like they were from a TV dinner..  I managed to find some fish and some smoked sausage that were decent and ended up eating mostly salad as it was fresh.
I would not recommend going here and I will not be back anytime soon..
