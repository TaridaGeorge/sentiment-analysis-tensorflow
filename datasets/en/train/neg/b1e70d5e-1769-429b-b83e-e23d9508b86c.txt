I ordered from this place twice.  The first time was ok and the 2nd was horrible and they got my sweet and sour pork order wrong.  I tried to call in another order and the guy on the phone didn't let me explain what I wanted and told me to not order from there again if I wasn't happy.  I never went back, I think there are many other places where the food is way better than this place as well as the service.  I don't need to spend my money at a place that does not value it's customers.  Also, the place is a filthy dive.
