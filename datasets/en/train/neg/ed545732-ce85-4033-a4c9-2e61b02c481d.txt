Ahhhh....what a depressing day! My wife and I went to Paesano's this evening and were disappointed to find that the original owners no longer owned the place. We did not go to Paesano's often but when we did we never had a bad meal; until tonight. Everything was different and the food was very sub-par for the price. We won't be back.
