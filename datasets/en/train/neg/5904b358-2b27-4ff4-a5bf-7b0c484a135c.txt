I ate here with my husband as a convenient stop before we went shopping.  It's cafeteria food, people.  I didn't go in there thinking I was going to get a five star meal for $3.99.  I got the veggie pasta w/ alfredo sauce and my husband got the spaghetti and meatballs.  I couldn't even make it through half of the store before I felt super duper sick.  No more cafeteria food for this girlie.  Stick with the hot dogs and ice cream that you can get after check out....
