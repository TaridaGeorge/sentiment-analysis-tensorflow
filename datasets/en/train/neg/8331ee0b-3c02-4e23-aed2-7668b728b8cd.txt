This was the 2nd time we went here.  1st time the food was very good...today it was the worst meal we have ever eaten...We ordered the "lunch 6 for 6 special", fish and chips.  It was terrible !!! The fish was mush and the sweet potato fries tasted just like the same greasy, mushy mess as the fish...we will NEVER be back !!!
