I am only giving 1 star due to the terrible service. There is one woman that works there in particular that is very unpleasant. No smiles. I had a return, within the given # of days, but she almost seemed personally offedned that I was returning it and was very short throughout the transaction... 

I love the merchandise and have purchased some great mosaic tile pots. I like the eclectic mix of items and will go back but will not expect good customer service.
