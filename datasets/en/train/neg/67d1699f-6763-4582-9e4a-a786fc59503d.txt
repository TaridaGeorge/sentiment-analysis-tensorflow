The girl in the purse department , Ashley , was so rude.  When I asked her about another store and she responded "well I would have to call." Then had me use my own phone to look up the number. Absolutely ridiculous. When I told her I preferred cream colored accessories, she kept being so rude telling me "well it's just going to get dirty." .. As I'm holding a very clean highly kempt purse. I don't need a sales associate telling me what colors I should prefer, implying I can't take care of my property.  She left me on my own to go talk to a girlfriend who came in the store with a puppy. She clearly was more preoccupied therefore instead of making my purchase there, I went to Michael Kors.
