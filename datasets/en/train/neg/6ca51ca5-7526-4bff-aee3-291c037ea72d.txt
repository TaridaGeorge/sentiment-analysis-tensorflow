I'm not fan of outlet malls, but Arizona Mills particularly irks me. It's extremely difficult to walk through the mall on Fridays and Saturdays and there's little children everywhere running amok. Also, a lot of the store merchandise isn't exactly discount/outlet prices. The crowds here aren't exactly inviting either, which probably is what makes me avoid this place as much as possible. The only unique  thing I can think of that this mall has is a Rainforest Cafe, but it's not like it's a must see, it's just more of a novelty place.
