I used to LOVE this place when it first opened.  It was a great afternoon hangout with friends.  They had great happy hour pricing, and great music (especially the old hairband videos showing on the TV's).  The food was really good as well.

Until...   Last year the happy hour changed dramatically.  Making it quite an unhappy hour.   Very poor specials and terrible pricing.  The service became worse as a result as well.  They can't keep good staff anymore.  The food has become very bland.  And once I was told that happy hour was only on the outdoor patio.  Yes, the SMOKING patio.  The same one that has become overrun with Loud and disrespectful ASU students.  

I'm not sure how this place went downhill so fast.   I won't go back anymore.  Will miss the decor though.  It's by far the best thing about this place.
