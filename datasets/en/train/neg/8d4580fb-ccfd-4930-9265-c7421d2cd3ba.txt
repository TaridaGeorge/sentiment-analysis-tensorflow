Wow, what a disappointment! The boyfriend and I were celebrating out anniversary by staying at the Pointe and decided to try this place for dinner on a Saturday night. At first we thought it was closed because there were no cars in the parking lot and the massive patio was completely empty, even though it was a gorgeous night outside. We walked in and were seated quickly in the empty restaurant (on a Saturday night!). Our waitress came over and greeted us by saying "you guys have been sitting here for a long time, right?" Ummm... no, but thanks for asking?! She was barely able to get through the specials. She was either on something or from another planet. We were now creeped out by the empty restaurant and confused waitress and left without ordering anything. We went to Tutti Santi across the street. A much better option.
