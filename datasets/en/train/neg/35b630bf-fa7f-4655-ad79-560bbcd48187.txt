Over priced with horrible service. 

Steer clear of the red headed waitress. She is rude, condescending, and lucky to have gotten a tip. The drinks were very sweet, the meal was fine, prices did not justify the quality or service.

Note that this restaurant is independently operated and not at all linked to the hotel. Its unfortunate, as this place clearly doesn't reflect the impeccable service of the Marriott.
