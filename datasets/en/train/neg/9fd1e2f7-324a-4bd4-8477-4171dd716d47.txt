I won't be going back to this place again.  I was given a gift certificate for a pedicure.  I didn't realize that the certificate had expired and when I went in to claim my pedicure, I was rudely turned away.  I believe it was under new management.  What a shame that they are not interested in my business.  Neither I nor my friends will be visiting this salon again.
