I saw this place yesterday, while i was out running some errands. I was very intrigued. The idea was similar to Cheba Hut (which i am a huge fan of) So i just checked it out for lunch and was very disappointed. I ordered the Magic Mushroom Burger with frys. The girl who took my order was very cute, but my burger was extremely salty. This alone "killed my trip". I may go back for a Shasta Cream soda someday. Hopefully the same girl who took my order is still there.
