I go to the car wash to wash my car. I don't want to fix the crack on my windshield, or the dent on my bumper. When you say that you offer those services and I politely decline them, please stop keep trying to push them by offering better deals on the wash packages. It completely turns me off as a consumer and drives me to write bad reviews online.

Wash quality was not worth the $20 either. Really doesn't make a difference if you do the $10 wash.
