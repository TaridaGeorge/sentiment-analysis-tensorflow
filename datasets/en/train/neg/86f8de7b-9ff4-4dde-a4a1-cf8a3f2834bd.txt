My friends and I went to Sandey's Broaster Chicken on 1155 S Higley in Mesa, AZ. As loyal customers we are highly disappointed in the change. They have added an Indian Buffet to the restaurant. The macaroni and cheese was not cheesy but tasted like flour and was soupy. The cole slaw had an after taste to it like it had not been properly covered in the refrigerator at night and absorbed the odor of other foods. After leaving the restaurant the smell of the Indian curry lingered in our nostrils and attached to our clothing. Unfortunately, we will now have to find a new Broaster Chicken restaurant. We will not be going back.
