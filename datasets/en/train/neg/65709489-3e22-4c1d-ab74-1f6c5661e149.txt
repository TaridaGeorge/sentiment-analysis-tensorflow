Is 0 stars an option? This is the most disgusting eating establishment ever. Caesar salad was browned iceberg lettuce topped with two packets of Ken's caesar dressing (in the packets), a bag of something remotely resembling croutons, a lump of cubed boiled and still frozen chicken, and a plastic bag containing plastic utensils. Then all of that was covered with a cracker as big as the plate. Did I mention it took 15 minutes to get a glass of water? I know, I give the star for my waitress who washed her hands.
