I decided to try this place for breakfast..you go in and order and then they give you a number and you sit and wait for your food.  I ordered the breakfast quesadilla with chorizo..it was very bland and really greasy.  Maybe I shoulda waited and went next door to The Farmhouse again, next time I will.
