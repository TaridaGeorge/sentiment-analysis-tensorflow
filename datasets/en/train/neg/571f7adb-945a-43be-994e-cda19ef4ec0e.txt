I love Sonic drive-ins and have eaten at Sonic all my life.  Today I stopped in to pick up a supersonic cheese burger and tots.  Got home, I'm sitting on the couch enjoying my burger...which was really great until...I had eaten nearly half of the burger when I bit into the tomatoes and at first thought it was just a stringy tomato until as I was pulling it out of my mouth...to my realization the stringy thing i had bitten into was actually a blonde hair.   YUCK!  YUCK! YUCK!!! Since my head is shaved and the hair was in the middle of the burger, it could have only gotten into my burger while it was being prepared.  Had it not been for the hair, this would have been 4 stars.
