Went there for their buffet lunch with my girlfriend. It was going okay until she got about halfway through her iced tea and then she discovered the cockroach floating not on top of the tea but  deep in. Didn't notice it at first because I guess iced tea is the perfect camo. for these disgusting creatures. We both immediately lost our appetites and they comped half of her meal. That was it. Disgusting place and I will never go back there ever.
