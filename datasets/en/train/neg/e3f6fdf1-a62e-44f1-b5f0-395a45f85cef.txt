Wade came out to fix my broken AC after my home warranty company sent him a work order. He looked at my unit and reported to my home warranty company that he ran my serial number and that my unit was part of a factory recall. The home warranty company refused to fix it and also said they would not cover the unit because of the recall.  I called the factory rep myself and asked them to check the serial number. My AC was never recalled.  I called Wade with this information and he maintained that it was defective. He still insisted that he had checked the serial number. It took me four days to appeal his report and get my unit fixed, all during record heat.  Don't trust this guy.
