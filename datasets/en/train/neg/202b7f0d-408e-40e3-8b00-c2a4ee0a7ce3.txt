I used to be a big fan and supporter of PetSmart and PetSmart Charities but all the good they do is overshadowed by the harm they cause with their misguided, unfair, prejudiced and damaging breed specific anti-Bully breed policies.  Please, no matter what breed of dog you have, don't shop at PetSmart or use their hotels or day care or grooming or Banfield veterinarians until they correct this injustice because your breed could be next!  Read about their discriminatory policies in their own words here...
