Worked in Scottsdale for over 18 years.  Ventured into this place for lunch last week and what a dissappointment.  Like a strip club, this place probably feels better at night.  During the day it felt really unkept.  Tried the chicken wings, a staple of any good sports bar right?  Not here.  A couple of the "wings" were so mangled they were not recognizeable.  Think "Frog Back".  Needles to say, I cant recommend nor will I go back.
