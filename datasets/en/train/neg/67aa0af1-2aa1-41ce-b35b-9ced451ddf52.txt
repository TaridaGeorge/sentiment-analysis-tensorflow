I had the carnitas street tacos with rice and beans.  Very bland, dry, not at all flavorful and very SMALL!  Was with a party of 3 on a Wednesday night at 7:30 and had to ask for chip refill 3 times before we actually had our request granted.  Black beans were dry and bland and the red rice I would compare to something you add water to and steam on the stove top, not impressed.  

If you want to go hob knob with the pretty people and pay too much for less than par food/service, then enjoy...I won't be back.
