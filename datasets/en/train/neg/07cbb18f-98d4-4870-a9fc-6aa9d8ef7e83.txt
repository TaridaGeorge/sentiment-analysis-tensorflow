My most  recent visit to this store was not a good trip. You walk in and smell this funky smell. The employees were very rude.  This is one of the worst Fry's I have been to. It has really gone down hill these past few years. The clientle reminds me of those you see at a Walmart Supercenter, meaning they are rude and their kids running all over the place tearing up the store. I won't be going back there anymore.
