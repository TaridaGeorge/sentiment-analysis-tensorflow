Every_single_time I come in here, there's a line. I went on a Sunday night at midnight and waited ten minutes before I walked out. One of the problems is that there's too few employees - and one will either pick up the phone or go outside to help a customer. They need to have a dedicated cashier and just give priority to people buying things. The service here FUCKING sucks if you just want to get in and out in under five minutes.

I've noticed that people will change random parts in the parking lot. Ramps, jacks, etc. Often at 3am. I'm not a lawyer but this is a huge liability concern; it blows me away that they allow this.

It's also a magnet for WT. Avoid.
