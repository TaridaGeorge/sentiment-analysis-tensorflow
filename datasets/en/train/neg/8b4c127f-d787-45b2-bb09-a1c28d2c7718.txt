APS sucks. Just moved to Phoenix from Mesa where I had SRP.  I can't believe all of the crazy fees APS tacks on. They are way more expensive than SRP. They spend 1 million per year for weatherization programs. That's our money they're using. I would rather my money stay in my pocket than pay for all of their ridiculous programs, advertising, and events. JERKS! Cut back APS, and save us some money.
