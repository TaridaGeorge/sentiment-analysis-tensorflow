Yiikes. Unless you've never tried sushi before in your life, and this is the only place that serves it within a 100 mile radius, then be my guest. Ra definitely serves up a trendy atmosphere and great service, but those factors alone are not enough to mask their below par food. This is definitely an Americanized sushi place where rolls take the stage, but were quite disappointing. We ordered 4 different rolls, and the rainbow roll looked like something my 4 year old cousin could make. The chicken yakitori was incredibly dry, and the yellowtail sashimi was just decent. The most memorable item was the edamame...yes. it was just. that. bad.
