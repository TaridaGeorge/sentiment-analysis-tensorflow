Service was poor and food came out at all different times. I had flown in some clients and their wives. We went out to one of Evening Entertainment Group's clubs in Old Town and to RnR the next morning. One of the meals didn't even come out until after everyone else had finished. It was breakfast time, nothing special that should have caused such a horrible delay. No manager ever asked how our visit was or if there was anything that could be done. Typical management at EEG I guess; no concern for their customers.
