This is one of those places that really pisses me off. 

The food is very good, the beer is even better, and the atmosphere is super-cool. It's just the type of place we need more of in downtown Phoenix. It's even open late!

Unfortunately I have to give it one lonely star because the service so often SUCKS. More than once I'v been told that because I don't have a reservation I'd have to wait up to 45 minutes despite the fact that the place was less than 50% full.

The final straw was in the middle of July, when I was asked to "please wait outside" for my table. Are you kidding me? The food ain't THAT good.
