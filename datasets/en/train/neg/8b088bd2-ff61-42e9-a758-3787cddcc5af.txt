I just dined at this restaurant and can say without exaggeration that it's the worst food and service that I've had in years. With a party of six diners, we ordered a round of food after the bars had closed. Our choices were a cross-cut of the menu--wings, a burger, a chorizo burrito, a navajo taco, an omelette and an egg sandwich. 

Our order took about 40 minutes to come out and not all of it was there. Extra bacon ordered did not come out until our food was consumed. The extras that come with breakfast (toast, etc.) never came out after repeatedly asking for them. The waitress was unapologetic.

The food itself was lackluster at best and inedible at worst. Please don't eat at this restaurant--you will be disappointed. Go to the IHOP on Apache or go home. You'll be better served.
