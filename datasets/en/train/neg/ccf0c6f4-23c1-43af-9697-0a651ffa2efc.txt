after my delicious first wrap, i went in here again and got the alota fajita with beef.

it was disgusting. i had two bites and spit the second one out. the beef was gritty and seasoned weird. the green peppers and onions were stringy and not nicely textured.

my salsa was watery and it had one huge tomato chunk it. the chips were STALE.

wtf, mate?
