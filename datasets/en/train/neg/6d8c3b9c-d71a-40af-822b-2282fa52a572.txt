I am so sad to report that their cupcakes are awful. They look gorgeous(and the packaging is adorable) but they are way to sweet and the texture of the cakes is spongy not moist. The pumpkin cake is decent, the pecan is disgusting(and I love pecan anything!) the chocolate mint were ok but all three of my cupcake loving kids wouldn't eat more than two bites. It is a shame this is a chain since they cannot tweak their recipes. If you are a photographer and need cupcakes in your shots then spend your money here but if you want edible cupcakes keep looking.
