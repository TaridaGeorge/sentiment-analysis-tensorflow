AWFUL SERVICE! Ordered a slice last time, and it was pretty decent and well-priced... but just ordered a whole pizza and the service was awful, I bit down into my second slice and THERE WAS A ROCK IN IT! A rock!!! How does that even happen?!

Went to take back the pizza and they just offered to replace the slice until I asked for a full refund... then they shorted us by $3! I WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN!
