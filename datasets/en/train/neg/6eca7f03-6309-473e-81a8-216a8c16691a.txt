2nd trip was quite disappointing.  Ordered a couple of bento boxes.  The miso soup was not hot, barely lukewarm if that.  WTH, why can't they serve hot miso soup.  Also, the rice that comes with the bento box wasn't Japanese rice.  It was Jasmine rice.  I would be okay with it but it was undercooked.  A bit too dry.  The rice on the california roll was dry too.  Sucks.  Tempura was still decent but the rice and soup really ruined my meal.  It will be a long while before I head back there again.
