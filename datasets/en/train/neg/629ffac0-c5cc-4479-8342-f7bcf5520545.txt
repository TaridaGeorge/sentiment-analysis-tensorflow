Please avoid Dr. Kerbs, as he is totally careless.  I won't go into details but three out of four things he did in my mouth needed correction.  He doesn't care about what the patient wants and went so far as to grind down a perfectly healthy tooth because his badly formed crown didn't fit properly.   He is a menace.
