Yikes, this food was terrible. Super greasy, tasteless pizza. I got a cold turkey sandwich and it looked absolutely NOTHING like the huge poster in the window advertising their sandwiches. I could have made the equivalent at home for one-quarter the price. The best thing about our dining experience was the free Wi-Fi and the tasty soda (which seems hard to find these days, a carbonated, non-watered down soft drink).
