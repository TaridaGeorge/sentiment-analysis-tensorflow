Last night before the D-Backs and Cubs game I stopped in for what I thought were going to be cheaper beers before going into the game.  I was way wrong.  Actually I think it's cheaper to drink inside the park then this place.  The only good thing is it was full of Cubs fans so I was in good company.  I won't make the mistake of stopping here again.
