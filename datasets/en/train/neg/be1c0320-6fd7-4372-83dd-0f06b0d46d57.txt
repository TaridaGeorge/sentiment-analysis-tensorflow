Definitely NOT Debra.  
She was not as helpful as I thought.  Proofing was poor and though it took 3 times to get one of the cards redone, several complained about the size of the font as the background of the invitation was dark.  Spent a lot of money and should have been very satisfied.  Several vendors were shown the invitation and agreed with me.
