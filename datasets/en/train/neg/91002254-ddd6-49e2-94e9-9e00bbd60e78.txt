Im suprised this place managed to rate as high as it did.  This place is just down the street from me so I decided to give it a try.  I live to regret that decision.  We ordered chopped pork, ribs,  and some sides and I didn't like any of it.  I couldn't eat it.  The whole group felt that way. Maybe we caught them on an off day, but I don't plan on finding out. There is no way I'll be returning.
