Everything here was underwhelming. The menu is huge and, just like you would imagine after watching a few episodes of Kitchen Nightmares, you know this isn't going to end well. 

Both meals were just not good - not terrible "I'm worried about food poisoning bad" - but definitely not good. The waitress took our drink orders immediately upon sitting and still we didn't get our drinks until halfway through our main course. A second drink was never brought and we decided better to pay and leave than press the issue. 

Takeaway: Not worth it under any circumstances. The decor is cheesy, staff is underwhelming and the food disappoints. Turns out you can't have 1000 things on your menu and pull it off.
