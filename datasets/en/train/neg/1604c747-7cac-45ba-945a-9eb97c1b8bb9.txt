They wanted to charge me $195 to pick a lock - eventually they went down to $175 after letting them know there was no way I would pay that. They said the Service charge is still $35 - after it looked like I was going to just pay the $35 they came up with a 10% discount - it took them 5 minutes to open the lock - the price should be around $100 tops -These guys come across so greedy that they don't think about how word of mouth can make a small company or break it.
