Wow, this was the worst eyebrow wax I have ever had. I read the other two reviews and I wonder if I even went to the same place. I didn't have enough time to run to my usual waxer somewhere else so I decided to run in here and get it done. I should have ran away when I saw the eyebrows of the lady that was waxing me. I specifically told her that I just wanted a clean-up and I did not want them thinned. Well, I guess she didn't understand or didn't care because she took almost all my eyebrows and even loop-sided one of them. She also proceeded to burn me, not clean me up, and leave wax on my eyebrows so that I had to rub oil all over when I got home to get off. Please beware when going here for an eyebrow waxing.
