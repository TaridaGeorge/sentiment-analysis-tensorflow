Ordered a thin crust sausage, tomato, onion, and green pepper pizza based on all the great Yelp reviews. A group of us all tried it, although there was just something wrong with the taste. In the end we couldn't pin it, wasn't that good. Ended up tossing it. The breadsticks were much better, although nothing exciting to write home about. Can't recommend this restaurant.
