Ok, I'm a huge food lover and me coming here starved and ordered the chicken katsu and tuna sushi rolls and I gotta say I didnt finish it. The chicken was too dry and not enough rice with it and the sauce that came with it was just bad as the chicken. The sushi had too much rice in its roll and just barely any fish meat on it. So i just tasted rice and sea weed on it. Will not recommend anybody here.
