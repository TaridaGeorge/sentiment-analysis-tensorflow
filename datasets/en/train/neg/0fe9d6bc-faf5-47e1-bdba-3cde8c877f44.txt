I took my 3 year old here for a haircut and he walked out with the worst one ever.  I understand he is a kid, but he always sits still for his cuts.  The stylist looked as if she was not comfortable cutting his hair and completely rushed through it.  We were out of there in 10 minutes!  To top it all off, she cut his ear with the clippers and didn't even bother to wipe the blood off.  When I made my appointment, I made sure to tell the receptionist that I was bringing in my 3 year old.  Not sure why they gave us someone who clearly isn't good with cutting a child's hair.  We will definitely not be going back.
