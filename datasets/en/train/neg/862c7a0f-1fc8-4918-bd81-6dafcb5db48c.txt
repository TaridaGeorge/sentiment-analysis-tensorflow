Group of us sat down to enjoy a meal at this place.  I've heard nothing but splendid reviews from close friends. 

Immediately after we were seated, a WT-waiter barked, "What do you want?"

...Later in the evening, same waiter snarled, "NO" after being asked for a refill.  

Having to correct the narcissistic waiter's etiquette, twice... I ask for a manager... but still got inferior service, even from the meek supervisor.  Food was so-so, at best....  Libations are overpriced...   

Never going back.
