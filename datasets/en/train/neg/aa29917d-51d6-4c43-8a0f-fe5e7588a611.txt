what is this filth that i am eating?

had it delivered ... but whoops!  forgot the rice.  how do you forget the rice?

anyhow, the peanut sauce was deplorable ... it was literally the consistency of water, i could pour it down the drain - and did.

the panang curry was the same -- more like soup and less like sauce.  this place is easily in the bottom 3 of thai places i have ever eaten at.
