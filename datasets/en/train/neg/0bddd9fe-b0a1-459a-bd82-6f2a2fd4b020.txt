So, we traded our timeshare for this one.  What a mistake, furnishing were so uncomfortable, not able to sit for any length of time.  We were on the second floor, no elevators, had to drag our suitcases up to our room.  Not a good choice.  If you have a choice to trade, do not pick this place.  By the way, the bathroom, only one sink was probably built for a handicap level.  If you are tall, very strange to have to bend so far over the sink....And, the desk constantly called to set up time to discuss buying, extremely annoying.  Never again....
