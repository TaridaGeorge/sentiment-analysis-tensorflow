Sorry Cornish!  You have a good thing going it seems but need some polishing/cleaning.  The place was doing a really brisk carryout business while we were there.  Very friendly and eclectic staff.  Good beer selection too.

The pasties were tasty but the temperature of the filling when reheated was not consistent - some hot spots, some cool spots.  I worry that this could be a recipe for food illness.

The star killer came just as we were getting ready to leave.  A small roach came crawling out onto the bar in front of us.  GGGAAAAHHHHDDDD.
