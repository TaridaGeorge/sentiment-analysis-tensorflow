I was there yesterday for lunch. I got some veggie noodles along with rice. Taste was ok (nothing impressive). Not sure why I was served rice. I would have preferred a lot more veggies in the noodles than bland rice.

The water was chlorinated and it was pretty bad. I had a couple of sips and I am down with soar throat and cold. I am not going back here, ever.
