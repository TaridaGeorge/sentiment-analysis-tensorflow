I ate here because I've worked in this general area since 2002 and have never patronized this establishment.  I was wise not to do so.  YUKKKY.  I ordered a ruben, which seemed safe.  The dressing was overly-sweet, as was the coleslaw, which was my only salad option.  The fries were the thick-cut kind that never seem to get crisp.  Just simply awful.
