The food at Pita Jungle was nothing spectacular. I was excited to go here because of the great reviews. First of, we ordered a few things of the happy hour menu, hummus, baba ganoush, lemon chicken and one more which I've already forgotten. The lemon chicken was decent quantity and had some flavor. The rest of the apps were mediocre with regard to taste and tiny tiny servings! I had the chicken platter and my husband a gyro. His gyro was decent, but my platter was not..the chicken was dry and the beans very plain. The pita they served was also dry and stale. I wouldn't go here again.
