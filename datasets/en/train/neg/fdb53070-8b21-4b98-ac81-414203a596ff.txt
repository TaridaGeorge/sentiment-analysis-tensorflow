Normally great food and service. Today was a different story. Employee cutting/making food without gloves. I asked him to put gloves on before he prepared my food and I was met with attitude. He sarcastically told me he has been busy and washed his hands 9 times already.
When I asked for the manager, he told me he was the regional manager. Continued with sarcasm and rude comments. I walked out with my 2 starving kids.  I live 2 blocks away and I. Won't. Be. Back.
