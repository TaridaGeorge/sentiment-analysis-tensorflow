They LIE.

We terminated membership when we moved out of the area, and asked for the final month of dues refunded, since we would not be able to use the club.  Management squirmed and said it was corporate policy, out of their hands, but they would "ask".  Of course, the answer was "No".  Corporate hides behind local management, and is very difficult to contact directly.  But I found a way, and discussed the matter extensively, and reasoned that they should not be paid for doing nothing.  Corporate stated they would have local management call me to discuss further.  Never happened.  "Manager" Jim M. is a smiley-faced, full-eye-contact liar.

In the end, we were shafted for $70 for this overpriced, overcrowded, underventilated sweat house.
