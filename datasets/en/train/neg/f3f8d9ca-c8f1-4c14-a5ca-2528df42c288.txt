Talk about bad customer service. Husband and wife team - the wife is a total sour puss and seemingly hates you for walking in the place. No smile, no greeting, she has one purpose - to take your money. Pointless signs are everywhere such as the one notifying you of a charge for the second refill of your drink (really what percentage of people actually have a second refill??), and don't dare move the chili peppers from the condiment area or you will be shot!! 

Pizza is good especially if you are hungry - could be better if they had a wood oven.
