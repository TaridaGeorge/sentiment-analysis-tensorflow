Eww...if I could've given less than half a star, that would be my rating. This place was gross. The decor was so modern and cold it felt more uncomfortable than a doctors office. Maybe I don't understand improvisational, it was not what I expected. I expected to write foods I  like and don't like, and the chef would prepare a special meal based on my interests. Instead, the menu is a list of 8 or so meats (kangaroo, wild boar bacon, foie gras, frog legs, etc) you cross off won't you won't eat, then the chef will give you one of the ones you did not cross off. It was all tasting size portions, and to be honest I'm glad they were just that.  If you got the kangaroo, another table who didn't cross it off got the same exact kangaroo.I would've been much happier going to McDonalds. Yuck!
