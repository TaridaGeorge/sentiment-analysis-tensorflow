Okay, I buy most of my shrubs and trees at Bakers, but they were out of what I wanted. So, off to Berridges.
They had 3 or 4 of the vine I wanted, but they looked AWEFUL. The employee explained that they had all been hit by some mold disease but picked one out and told me it would be fine. I was doubtful but needed this vine.  I paid about 40% more for it, and it never grew and eventually, just died. Nothing I have ever bought at Bakers or even Home Depot has ever refused to grow.
And in case you're wondering, I got FOUR of that same vine elsewhere later and they are growing well.
You might be saying to yourself, why did she buy it if it looked bad? Because I trusted the nursery guy!
BOO!
