NOT RECOMMENDED

Mediocre and substandard food quality. If you are from NYC or San Francisco, you'll be VERY disappointed.

The Spring Rolls had the chewable texture of rolled-up paper, and the Crab Wontons were some of the worst I've ever had. Of the 4 signature dishes tried, they all fell short with in quality and taste.

Pei Wei Asian Diner needs to completely revamp the menu. The infrastructure is well designed but the food is a major problem. The food is poor quality and overpriced. If something is not done soon, this chain is going to close permanently. No one is going to pay the price for substandard quality.
