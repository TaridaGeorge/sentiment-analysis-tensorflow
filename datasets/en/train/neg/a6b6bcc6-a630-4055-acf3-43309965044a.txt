Awful experience.  We went TWICE and she lost our pottery both times.  She claims "I never lose pottery", but what are the chances of someone losing pieces two times in a row?  No refund, but I'm welcome to keep coming back and creating work that gets lost!  My advice:  Go to somewhere more organized, particularly if you have kids
