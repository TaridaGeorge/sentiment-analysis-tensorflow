Pizzeria Bianco is kinda like the hot girl all the guys liked in high school. Everyone knew she was top cheerleader and would date the captain of the football team, at the same time you also had a sneaking suspicion that their family would resemble "Married with Children" in a few years. I know that all of Phoenix is a twitter with love for this establishment, but I say no. DON'T GO HERE.
The hostess acts with total disregard for the people waiting and the pizza reminds me of California Pizza Kitchen, but not quite so pleasant. With the four hours of your life you will spend wasted waiting for dinner here, either enjoy one of the many other amazing local pizzerias or visit a neighborhood place in any other city that will put this establishment to shame.
