I am just graduated from ASU and I have avoided mill avenue like the plague, unless it was at night. Why would I pay ALOT of money, just to park where my car isn't even watched, just to get hassled by homeless and begged for spare change by drug addicts. I feel like Im in an episode of walking dead when I am on this street. Not only are there homeless and pieces of trash lingering and begging, there is literally trash everywhere and everything is dirty. If you are a guy, the only store for you is urban outfitters so the shopping also sucks.  I have no problem making the drive to scottsdale where you don't pay to park, theres no homeless, and the only drugs users than affect you are the roid monkies.
