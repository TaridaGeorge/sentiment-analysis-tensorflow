I use to refer folks. Not any more.  I ordered ackee and saltfish.  1st time trying it. Did not like it. Called and ask if I could exchange it for my usual (ox tails and rice) or get a store credit. I was informed that if it was prepared correctly and if I did not like it it was not their fault that I did not like it and that they should not and would not allow for an exchange or store credit......I will not be returning and will no longer refer others.  Lost patron....peace
