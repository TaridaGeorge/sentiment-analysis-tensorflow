The fact that this place is so crowded at lunchtime just confirms my suspicion that most Scottsdale residents have more money than taste.  This place is aggressively mediocre and proud of it.  You could get better Chinese at Applebee's for a lot less money.  I had to load on the soy sauce and chili oil just to make my lunch have any taste at all, and even then it tasted like mildly spiced dishwater.  Pretty bad when even your chili oil lacks flavor and authenticity.
