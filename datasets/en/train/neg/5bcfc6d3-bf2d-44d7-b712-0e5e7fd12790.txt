Took my dog here. It was the only place that doesn't require proof of shots. Pretty decent for my poor side. I can't cut my dogs nails cause they are black and I clip them too close and make him bleed every time I try. They gave him back to me and all seemed okay. Got him in the truck and he starts bleeding everywhere. Really I could have done that myself and save the gas and the cost of it. I won't be going back here. They get 1 star just because you don't need proof of shots to bring your animal there
