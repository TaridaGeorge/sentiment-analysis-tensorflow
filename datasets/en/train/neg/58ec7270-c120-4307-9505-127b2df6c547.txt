Sold me knock-off jewelry.  Showcased, marked and confirmed with THEIR jeweler that it was authentic Tiffany.  Now they're trying to fight me on the refund.  This tells me that they new it was fake or they were to inexpirienced to spot a fake.  Either way, not good business. This was the scottsdale location.  I am going to see the 'owner' after the weekend.  Hopefully, he will represent his business like his website does.  And to other review writers who commented on how 'nice' everyone was; OFCOURSE THEIR NICE! PAWNBROKERS AND BAILBONDSMAN ARE THE NICEST, COOLEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD! CUZ THEY WANT YOUR MONEY, BOTTOM LINE.
