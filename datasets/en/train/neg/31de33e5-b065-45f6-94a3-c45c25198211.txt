Italian, hardly. Tomatoes and cashews in a chiffinade of romaine lettuce, store bought ceasear dressing salad for appetizer, dinner was slab of burnt, frozen patty veal parm with store bought diner sauce, the wife had frozen ravioli with tons of bay scallops and store bought sauce.  If you got drunk at the bar it might taste good. Sit away from the loud piano.
