I thought about changing my older review, but I thought I'd leave it I hopes that my frustration with them is a temporary thing.
Monday I left work a little early to make sure I get to this shop before closing.  I had double checked the hours here on yelp.  I arrived to find that they are closed on Monday's.
Today, Tuesday, I drove over after work to finally get that haircut.
This time I arrived at 5:47 to see a handwritten note on the door saying that they are closing today at 5:45.
I'm not sure if I've got the patience to try again. Maybe I'll give V's at Norterra a shot.
