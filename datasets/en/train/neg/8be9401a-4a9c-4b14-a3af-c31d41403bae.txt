Food is delicious...great steakhouse.  Ambiance and decor is very chic and charming.  However, customer service was substandard and borderlining racist, so for that reason I give it a one star.  We had reservations and they wouldn't seat us in the main dining room where there was still tables available; said it was already saved for other guests with reservations, eventhough we had one too.  Seated us on the terrace with the other asians.  Felt a bit disrespected and discriminated against.  Waiter was a bit snooty as well.
