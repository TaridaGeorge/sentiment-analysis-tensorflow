This place is soooo overrated, crowded and the music is not memorable.  Also, the band BEGS for tips!   Tacky!  One night a bunch of us girls went early enough to wait for the band to start and had a couple of rounds of beers when the bouncer came up to the table we'd been holding and told us that in ten minutes our table was reserved for someone else and we'd have to vacate.  The owner's response when we objected was "So what.  I own the place"  I'm a Scottsdale native and this experience just proved that Scottsdale's hometown feel is officially gone.  We walked over to Patty's and had a great time, forgetting about those fake cowboys at the Spur.
