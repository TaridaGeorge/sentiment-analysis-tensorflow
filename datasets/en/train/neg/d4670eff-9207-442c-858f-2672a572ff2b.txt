This place is now renamed Super Moon, but I don't think I'll be making a trip to find out if it is any better. The buffet was definitely huge, with a ton of different foods on it. 

The chinese food had sauces on the side (you could pour sweet and sour sauce on the chicken) but the chicken was rubbery. Other buffet items like chicken nuggets, mac and cheese, jello, and pudding were available. The sushi looked decent but I did not try it because I was not sure how long it had been sitting out. The salad bar was loaded with half wilted lettuce. There were other bland items too, but nothing about this place stood out except for its high price. With all the great restaurants in the area I would never go back.
