Just came back from Sushi Ken. That would be our last time to go there. The service was horrible. I said again HORRIBLE. after they sat us down, We waited for 15 mins for water. When the food come, mine didn't come for a long time after they serve my friend's. Finally, the next table told the waitress they didn't order that dish. That was my dish. They took it to me. I wasn't very happy, but don't want to take it back. (who knows what they are going to do in the back) My friend was trying to stand up for me. He mentioned to the waitress we want a fresh dish. She said how FRESH you want. and look at us like we said something very ridiculous. Do yourself a favor, go somewhere else.
