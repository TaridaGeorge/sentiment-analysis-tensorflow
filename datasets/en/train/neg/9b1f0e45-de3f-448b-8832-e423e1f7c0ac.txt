Last week we discovered mold in the pillow. I was surprised since I thought that latex does not get mold. I sent them an e-mail and photo. After a week their response was that they cannot judge from the pictures and that there must be something wrong with the surrounding???  Horrible customer service after you buy the mattress. And the latex does not seem to be of the same quality as some other companies. I am still waiting to hear their response and whether they will send a replacement pillow.
