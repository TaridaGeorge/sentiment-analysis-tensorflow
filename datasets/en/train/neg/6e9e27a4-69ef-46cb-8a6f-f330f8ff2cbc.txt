As far as the pharmacy aspect, I totally agree with the last reviewer, Stephanie. If you want great pharmacy service at a CVS go to the one on Daisy Mountain and Gavilan Peak...always friendly there...it's a bit farther for me to drive to but it's worth it. However, the other employees at the Anthem Way store are wonderful.
