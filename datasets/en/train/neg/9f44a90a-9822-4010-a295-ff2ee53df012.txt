This place is gross. The first thing I noticed was how greasy the floors were..We got seated in the back..kind of upstairs. The place is rundown and needs attention. The ceiling above was dripping water right in our booth! The food? Big portions of tasteless slop. Nothing was edible. The eggs had no flavor at all..Hashbrown portion huge, but again..a blob of mush underneath like nothing I've ever seen or tasted. There was cheese on my toast..were did that come from? We didn't eat but a few bites..I paid and tipped as the waitress was nice..but never going back. The place was packed so someone must like it..Not I
