I am downgrading my last rating of 3 stars.  Some time ago, I stopped going to Shogun because of an unfortunate fish incident.  Time passed, and my husband and I recently decided to give their Happy Hour a try.  We parked the car, walked toward the door, and were hit with a bad oil smell that completely changed our minds.
