If you like Ground Control, stick with the Goodyear location.  I found no redeeming qualities at Verrado.  I had lunch there today, and don't plan to return.  Despite the fact that there were only a few customers, the wait service was poor.  We got drinks fairly quickly, but had to wait more than 30 minutes to put in a food order.  I ordered the Chicken Cranberry Salad.  The waitress brought out a different salad, explaining that the chef's out of chicken salad.  Really?  I can understand being out of a menu item, but the chef decides what my replacement order should be?  A dining partner asked for additional dressing, and, after waiting for more than 10 minutes and a courteous reminder to the waitress, finally got the dressing.  Total time to grab a quick salad lunch:  more than 95 minutes.
