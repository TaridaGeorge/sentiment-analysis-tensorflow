A lousy hot dog stand with expensive beer.
Four of us went for lunch Sunday. Server was great, but service was slow because she had tables outside and we were inside. Ordered brats and they were severely overlooked and bad. The spicy one was so bad that it was hard all the way thru. The cook ought to go to Ted's to see how good brats are cooked!
Tried Belgian Fries and they were so overcooked that they were black brown in color and totally crispy.
Draft beer was almost warm and very expensive. 
Food was very expensive too.
Food served was cool, probably because it came from a building next door. We were in bar.
Bill for 4 lunches and a couple of beers was over $160.
My summary: A BAD HOT DOG STAND, OVERLY EXPENSIVE, WITH SOME GOOD BEERS ON TAP...BUT WARM.
Will never go back.
