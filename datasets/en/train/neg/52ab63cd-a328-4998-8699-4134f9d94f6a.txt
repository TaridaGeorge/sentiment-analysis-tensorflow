This place smells sour... grimy. Yiiccch. Service was friendly and quick and happy hour appetizers are half off. However, "no tap beers during the summer." Say what?! We tried some mini chimichangas and meatball sliders. The chimis were deep-fried and the chicken center was pasty mush. The sliders had no flavor, not enough marinara, and came with a side of fries that tasted like they had been cooked in last Tuesday's oil. One of the jucier of the roided bartenders was called "mangina" by a drunk old man and took it really personally - that was quite amusing. 
Bottom line, though: It's a dirty bar, and it's just not the type of place you're supposed to see in the daytime.
