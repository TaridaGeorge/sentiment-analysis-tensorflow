This has always been a last resort for me when re-selling my clothes. I will usually take my stuff to Plato's Closet, which gives the same in trade or cash, then Buffalo Exchange, then Other Mother's. The last few times I've cleaned out my closet, I've opted donating my rejects instead of re-selling to Other Mother's because they pretty much give you pennies for your items. Yesterday, I decided to try them out one more time and I was more insulted than ever. Taking two pair of name brand jeans, an unworn shirt with tags still on, and 5 pieces of jewelry...they gave me a whopping six dollars and some change in cash! I would much rather donate my clothes to someone in need than to get ripped off by this store ever again!
