Umm...where do I begin?  Last week a group of us stopped in at DN after a party.  I had not been here in about 5 years, which back then it was ok.  Oh my what a disaster!  Jammed packed with wannabes.  Girls dancing on the ledges around the dance floor dressed in many fashion emergencies that made my head spin.  Drinks in plastic cups (super classy) and no room to move.  Yuck.  AND they charge you $5 to experience this nightmare.  Run!  Run away!
