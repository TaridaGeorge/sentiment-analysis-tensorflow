I ordered the phad thai medium with beef, and didn't like it. The "phad thai" is actually a tomato based noodle dish, and smelled like ketchup. Even though it didn't say anything about a tomato base on the menu! They switched it for me to "traditional phad thai," made with tamarind sauce, but it was really lacking the taste I associate with thai places I like. Bland. It didn't have much of a peanuty or fishy taste.

Might try their curry if I go back, since it seems like people like that.

Loud Music was, I assume, from Thailand. It was over the top poppy, and very loud. They even left it on for a long track that sounded like someone interviewing the band in thai. I'm all for authenticity, but the food was bland and the atmosphere was bizarre
