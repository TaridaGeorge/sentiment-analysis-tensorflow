Really crappy service.  And it took 4 attempts by the overwhelmed waitress to deduct the salad ( which we never received) from our tab.  She kept apologizing but just didn't get that we weren't satisfied by a simple apology.  By the time we left we just found the whole episode comical.  The restaurant looked like it was being run by a bunch of slackers.   Generally like IHOP food particularly because they include the calorie count but service has always been inconsistent.  You take your chances.  We lost this time.
