Went in for a pedi and a girl named Rosie took my hand and said you need a Mani on a week old fullest of gels she did a week ago. I thought cool $ 15 and she'll fix them since their uneven. I kept asking her why she wants to soak them in actone she claim she had to and as my nails fell off she claims I'm giving you a mani I told her that not what I asked for she refused to talked to me and yelled for David and he said I asked her to remove them. They were both rude and had all the staff looking at me weird. The owner offered to give me a $10 discount of a new set..I paid for my wonderful pedi and left nail less and disappointed.
