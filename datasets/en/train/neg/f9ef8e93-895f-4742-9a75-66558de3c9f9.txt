This is an old theater, or at least it feels quite old, that has very small screens due to the limited space provided by the mall space. I mean this is IN the mall, not next to it, like dead in the center. one of the theaters in there couldn't of had more than 25 seats, it felt like a living room. In the age of the CINE CAPRI theaters in Phoenix, there is no reason to go see a movie on a screen that isn't much larger than the one i have at home! you also have a ton of kids and teenagers from the mall who hardly care about the movie and just want to screw around and talk, ruining your movie. I love Harkins, but take a pass on this theater.
