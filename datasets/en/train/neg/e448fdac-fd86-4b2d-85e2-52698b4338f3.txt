I will do my best to refrain from any foul language during this review.

I have been using qwest for over 3 years now for Internet service only.
I have called in again today....No Internet connection.....

same routine Every time...
I don't have a land-line...let me give you my account number.....I read it directly off the bill...

I'm told that the number does not exist.......nor does my address....or name....

So they cannot help me......WTF!!!!
