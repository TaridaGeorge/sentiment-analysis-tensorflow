Bad customer service!! Employees need to get their info straight!  This establishment caters only to leagues...we attempted to bowl here on a Wednesday night and 3 different employees had different info.  First called to check on leagues and woman informed us it was "first come first serve".  We showed up at 5:15 and another  employee stated league was starting at 6-9:30 and no other lanes open....to come back at 9 or 9:30.  Showed up at 8:40 and 3rd employee stated another league starting at 9:30 and it was 1-2 hour wait!  Are you serious!?  This place only caters to leagues so don't try to go if you just want to bowl!  If I wanted an arcade I'd go to Dave & Buster's!
