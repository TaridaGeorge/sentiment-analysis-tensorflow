I wanted to like this place. 

I got all pumped up for some deliciousness and was really...really disappointed. The noodles I ordered were swimming in a watery sauce. The sauce tasted good, but it didn't stick to anything so it just tasted like... boring noodles and rubbery chicken. My boyfriend got a burger, he said it was boring. The sweet potato fries were unsalted, so they kinda tasted like sweet dirt. @ $22 for two meals, this was not cheap. 

The kid at the register and the manager who greeted us at our table were super sweet, friendly and helpful. But I'm not going back because the food sucked. :(
