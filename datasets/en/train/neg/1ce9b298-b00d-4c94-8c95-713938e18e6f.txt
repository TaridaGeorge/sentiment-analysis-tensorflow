I ordered  pasta bolognese.  Found what looked like a very long piece of dental floss in it.. The five others at my table couldn't believe their eyes.  I brought this to the waiters' attention and he made light of it. 

I did not finish the dish.   I expected it to be eliminated from the bill.  It wasn't.

I can't wait to go back.

Too bad, I've been there before and enjoyed my meal.
