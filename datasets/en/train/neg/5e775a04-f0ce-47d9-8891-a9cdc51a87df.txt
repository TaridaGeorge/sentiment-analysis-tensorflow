This store drives me crazy. I am all for supporting local businesses but not when the local businesses suck! This store has the WORST layout I have ever seen. I can never find anything. On multiple occasions I have had to ask a worker where something was only to find out they don't carry it or the worker doesn't even know. On top of all that the prices are consistently the highest I have seen. I don't have the time or money to shop here!
