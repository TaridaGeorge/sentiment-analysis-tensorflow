I asked for help finding Maderia wine, I was asked if it was a grape.  Than Sorry man I am a beer guy and the employee walked off with zero help.  After asking 4 different people I finally got a vague location of the wine - "It under the port down there....." Great. I could not find the mixers and soft drinks as they are in three different spots and 20 minutes later I got fussed at because my daughters helped unload the soft drinks and unloaded the one bottle of Maderia wine.  I was wrong to let them unload the cart, but the vehemence from the woman at the stand was not called for.  Never again - never.  I'll pay more at another store not to waste my time or deal with that lack of customer care.
