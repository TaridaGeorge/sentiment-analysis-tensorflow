Please Verrado ground Control owners... Go into your locations and see what's going on!! Food is bland !! Service is not up to par !! We have only 2 other places to eat in Verrado so your making $$ because of that reason and that reason only? Do you want to be a pub that serves beer and semi good martinis or a great gastro-pub that serves both great food and drinks? We as Verrado residents need you to care about quality and our loyalty! As of today I can't enter your establishment and eat a simple Quesadilla thats so easy to make taste good but your cooks(I won't say chef ) destroy it !! Really , is this what you want in Verrado ??! you need better management or owners need to wake up!! And smell the coffee next door!! Listen to your reviews
