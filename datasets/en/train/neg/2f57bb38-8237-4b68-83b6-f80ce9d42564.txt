Worst comedy club ive ever been to....Laughed my ass off at Dave Attell though....waiter sucked....i had two drinks and never saw him again...guess the 2 drink minimum was a two drink maximum....never go here..the staff treat you like crap.....if i was the owner i would do a reboot on my staff.......I guess i would go anyway if I liked the comedian enough...but im happy with a brick to sit on as long as im laughing....so what does that say about this place
