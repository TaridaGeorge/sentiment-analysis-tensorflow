This review is for the miniature golf only.

If you are in Tempe you don't have many options for miniature golf nearby. It's either Fiddlesticks or Golfland Sunsplash. If you are trying to figure out where to go, go to Golfland. They at least have interactive courses, some variation, and working "streams" for about the same price. At Fiddlesticks the courses are very plain and repetitive. They might be good for practice but are not a lot of fun. Also Google maps may send you the wrong way finding Fiddlesticks. It's on Elliot in Tempe between Priest and Hardy not Chandler by Alma School.
