Sunday Morning Breakfast

acoustic guitar awesome! BUT..

Service wasn't good the food not much better. I ordered the strawberry waffle it has butter, strawberry, syrup, powder sugar, and homemade whip cream.  Compared to the plain waffle it's $2 more expansive and for only 2 strawberries. To top it off the waitress never told me they were out of whip cream until I asked about it after she brought it out. Then she forgot the powdered sugar and butter. Try putting cold butter over cold waffles not cool. While all this was going on I was still waiting for my cream for my cold coffee.
