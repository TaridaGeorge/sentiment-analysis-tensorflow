Disappointing... 

A friend and I went for dinner the other night. We ordered the shrimp tempura roll, spicy salmon roll and Caliente roll (avocado, jalapeno and fish). 

The rice was chewy and the tempura was stale. 

On top of that, random Japanese pop was blaring in the background. 

The quality is not worth the money I spent. 

Skip this place and head over to Nakama in Avondale/Goodyear or Blu Sushi in Litchfield Park.
