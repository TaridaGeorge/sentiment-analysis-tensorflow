Yet another disappointing Asian establishment in AZ. I know Lees is a chain and maybe I just happened to be the unlucky customer but geeeeez!

Skimped on my meat and veggies. Was only enough to fill half the sandwich.
I ordered the grilled pork sandwich and also the BBQ pork. Both were dry... Meat was tough... No flavor... Sandwich was dry and the pickled carrots and radish tasted funny. Sad night :( went home and made salad rolls instead.
