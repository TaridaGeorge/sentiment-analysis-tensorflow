Wow. Probably one of the worst breakfasts I've had in my whole life. The biscuits and gravy are like eating warm glue. The potatoes are tasteless. I'd give it a half star if I could and that would just be for the friendly staff. Definitely several steps down from Dennys. I guess if you're over 85 like everyone else here eating, it's just food. Do yourself a favor and keep driving. I expected much more from a mom and pop place.
