I did not pick this place, met some people there that picked it. We waited 1 hour for our food, the waiter forgot our drinks twice and the food was just okay. To top it off, I checked my credit card charges a few days later and the waiter charged my bill four times for my bill and they were all for higher than what my bill was for. Fortunately my credit card company only allowed one charge to go through recognizing someone was not being honest.  I would not recommend this place to anyone! Service sucks and they are dishonest.
