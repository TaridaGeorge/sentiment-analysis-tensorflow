Eaten there several times - been sick feeling after 3 of them. Not a clean place, service is slow and with the exception of a few beer specials the menu is overpriced ($8 for a dozen overcooked wings?) 

Had hope for them to get better after they remodeled about a year ago but I won't be giving them another chance.
