Unless your into the metal melicia, loud music so as you cannot hear yourself think, and terrible food, then this place is for you. The food is less than terrible and WAY over priced for the quality! Oh ya I think they don't even put liquor in the drinks, our were way watered down! I know we are in a recession, but really what the heck??
