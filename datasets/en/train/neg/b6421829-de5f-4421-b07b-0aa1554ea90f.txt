The parking is my beef with this place.  Why does a customer have to pay $12 for each time we park at the garage?  If you move in and out three times, that's $36 for parking.  Yes, my company was paying, but this was just outright stupid and I wouldn't make my company pay for this again.
I've been to Phoenix twice since then, and I've avoided this place and stayed at the Marriot.  Much better place.
