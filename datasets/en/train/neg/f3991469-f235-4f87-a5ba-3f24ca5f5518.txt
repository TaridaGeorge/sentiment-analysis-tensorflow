I should have read all the reviews before sitting down to eat.  Well it was 5:30pm on a Sat night so you would assume that everything would be fresh.    Shame on me for assuming things.   The soups were horrible and looked they had being sitting there all week.  The pizza wasn't even pizza but crust with sauce on it.   The iceberg lettuce was a mixture of lettuce with chunks not even cut up yet.  I love Souplantation/ Sweet Tomatoes and I have high standards for anyone else tryiing to be a Salad Buffet.      I would have given this place a half a star but the manager was nice enough to refund my money so it gets one star.
