I saw today that Babies R us is offering a 20% off on ALL Glider and Ottomens, Which is fantastic! Except for the fact that I also noticed that they have not only increased the prices of both but a COMBO that I was looking at on January 4th 2012 and saved the link to (Which no longer works) is now not available as a combo (Actually there aren't any combos available) and is now priced at a total of almost $400 (Originally $239.98 for both).  So that got me thinking (Though I LOVE BABIES R US)- do they usually jack up their prices when coupons come out and try to make more money and pull a fast one....Ummm!  I will be following up on this!  I called Shermag (French Company) and hopefully they will return my call.
