I went here against my better judgement. My daughter insisted!! Walked in to their "new" location on Country Club just North of Main. They used to be at the corner of Main and Country Club~the old Sub shop building....anyway, we each ordered 3 tacos..that was it. The service was slow. We wandered over to the "bug" infested "salsa bar"..there were fruit flies or some other wordly little critters flying all over the place. ENOUGH SAID....NOt going back...thanks
