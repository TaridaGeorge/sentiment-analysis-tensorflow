This place looked okay on yelp, it was only a block from our hotel so we walked there to pick up breakfast on Sunday. We walked in and had to sit ourselves and were handed two menus without a word from a sullen teenage server and were then ignored for almost 20 minutes so we walked out. It looked grubby and the menus were sticky. Altogether this place deserves ZERO STARS
