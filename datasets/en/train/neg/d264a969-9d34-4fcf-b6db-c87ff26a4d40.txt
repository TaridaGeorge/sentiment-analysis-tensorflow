Not too happy with my last two experiences here. I booked a "suite" online last week and when I tried to upgrade it, I was told I had only booked a double room. Hmmm, it said "suite" on the website.To get the set up I wanted, it would be $159 for the parlor and an additional $159 for a king- a grand total $477 before tax for a room in AZ in the summer.  Lol- what a joke. This is the 2nd time I've been misled at this property. 
 Bottom line- it's not that nice. I ended up at the Villas of Cave Creek for the 4th- way better deal, nicer and didn't mislead me on the website.
