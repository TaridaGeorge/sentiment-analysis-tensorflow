If you like pizza with a TON of sugar in it, this is your place.  My husband and I found the pizza to be inedible.  When we complained, the woman behind the bar said that she's give us 10% off the next time we came in.  No thanks.  Worst pizza I've ever had.  If you really like pizza, try Oregano's, Grimaldi's or Pizzeria Bianco.
