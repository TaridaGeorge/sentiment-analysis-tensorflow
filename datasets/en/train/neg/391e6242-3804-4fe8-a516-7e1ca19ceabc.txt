One star for the most terrible service in recent memory.  Our server "DK" was outright rude and horrible, and outright ignored us when she wasn't making us uncomfortable.   As a former waitress of 14 years, I have the utmost respect, patience and tolerance for my former bretheren - but this woman needs to go.  BAD DK!  Otherwise, our Teppiniyaki (sp?) chef was wonderful, the food was delicious and fresh and a solid four stars.  I have been going to Kyoto since 1995 and it remains a fun and festive place with very reasonable prices.  Too bad it was ruined this time by DK!   DK needs a different job, more suited to her personallity, like euthanizing kittens or something.
