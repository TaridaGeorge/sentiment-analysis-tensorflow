Progressive insurance does not pay their claims.  I was rear ended by a Progressive insured driver.  I was told by a Progressive agent to get an estimate - which they OK'd - took the car in for the repair when they told me to and then refused to pay.  They are no better than the other company that advertises "We keep you legal for less."  What that means is that you pay the low premiums and they refuse to pay claims!  They are not even within the Insurance Consortium.  Beware!
