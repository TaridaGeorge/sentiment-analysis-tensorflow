If I could give no stars I would. Service was terrible, waitress was not friendly, never came back to see if we needed anything, waited a long time to get the bill, she never came back, had to flag someone else to pay.  
Now the food, it was very skimpy, piece of boneless chicken was barely 2 inches long and had no flavor, mashed potatoes must have come out of a box. This dinner came with a sundae that consisted of melted vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce. Had to flag down another waitress to get this as my waitress had disappeared. 
The prices are very high for what you get, I have went here for the last time.
