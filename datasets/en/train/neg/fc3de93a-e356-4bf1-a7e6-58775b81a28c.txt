Well I attended and graduated from mmi in hopes of being a motorcycle mechanic they said the industry was in need of mechanics hahaha BS the industry is so over filled with MMI Punk's being an mmi graduate actually hurts you when you apply for a job. too many kids screwed up MMI's name now its just a cosmetology school with bikes its a joke
