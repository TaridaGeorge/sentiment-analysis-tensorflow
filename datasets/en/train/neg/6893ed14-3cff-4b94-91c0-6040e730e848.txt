Dr Brooks Owned Aspire skin care which went out of business without even notifying his patients. I am now stuck with facial hair and he refuses to refund money because he thinks he did enough treatments. I wouldnt trust him. He is a liar and an obvious cheat. Thanks for the sincere honesty and ingerity you have towards your patients!!
