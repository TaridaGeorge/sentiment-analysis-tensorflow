Pizza, good not great.  Staff incredibly rude if you want a leisurely paced meal.  We ordered over a hundred dollars of food and drink (4 adults) but as soon as our pizzas were done the staff stopped refilling the ice teas and did not ask if we wanted a second round of beer & wine.  Instead they started pulling everything off the table, including the sugar!  It's all about turning over the table.  At least give people an hour at the table!
