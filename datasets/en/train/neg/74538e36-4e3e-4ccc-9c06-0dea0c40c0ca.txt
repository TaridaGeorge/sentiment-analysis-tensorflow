I went here for lunch thinking that it would be the same Pho in Oakland, CA and boy I was wrong!!! The restaurant looked much nicer and modernize but thumbs down for the food.

I ordered the rice plate with Chicken, shredded pork and egg cake. The only thing that tasted okay was the shredded pork. The chicken and egg cake were so bland, I had to put a lot of fish sauce which I hate.  Therefore, ended up not eating it. I ended up ordering a small Pho to be safe, didn't want to eat much carbs haaa.

Boy the Pho was such a disappointment, the broth had no flavor. No thanks to this restaurant!
