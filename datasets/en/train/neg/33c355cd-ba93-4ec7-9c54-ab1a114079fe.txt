Maricopa County Sheriff deputies felt threatened and concerned that a Pei Wei employee might tamper with their food when they were ordering during a recent food break. 

A manager remarked that the deputies were responsible for arresting too many of the kitchen staff at the restaurant.  It was suggested the manager who made the comment may have been referencing MCSO's recent crackdown on illegal immigration.

According to the Sheriff, the Pei Wei employee proceeded to offer to cook "something special" for the deputies.  The deputies, according to the Sheriff, felt threatened by the remark and returned their food, worried about food contamination.
