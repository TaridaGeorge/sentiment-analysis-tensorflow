I wanted to order a cake for my son first birthday. I went to the store, as I like the cake designs on their website.

I didn't ordered right away but got four cupcakes to go: chocolate, vanilla , lemon and  red velvet .The lady told me those were basically same as the(some of the) cake flavors. I am sad to say they were: dry, very dry, so dry and super dry :(  And I went in the morning! After that I decided not to order from them.

Maybe it was a fluke but that's not good when you're trying to sell cakes:-s

My rating is based on the cakes/cupcakes.
