I would have given it 0, but the Web site wouldn't let me. Has anyone who has given it more than 1 star ever really eaten BBQ? This is the McDonald's of BBQ. Texture and flavor both questionable... Sysco? The fact they charge as much as they do only makes their pitiful joke that pretends to be real food that much more pathetic.
