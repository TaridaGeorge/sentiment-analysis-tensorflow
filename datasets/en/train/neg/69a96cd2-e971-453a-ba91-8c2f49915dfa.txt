I saw this place on a show and me, and my husbend decided to check it out. I thought it would be fun to take my mother inlaw along as well. When we got there, we were blown away by how the place was set up. Was real creative. Our server took good care of us.

Our food came pretty fast. It was neat to be able to build your own. 

However, half way through our meals, we had enough. The food was way to greased up. We all ended up getting sick after. I think it might be because we were not used to eating that much junk food in one sitting. It is worth checking out at least once, but be careful what you order.
