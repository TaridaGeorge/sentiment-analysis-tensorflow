I think this place is way overpriced for what they are willing to provide with service and customer experience.  I've been in debates with the individuals who work there over things such as stains, etc.  The price point does not match the level of work, I have had to leave multiple items more than once because stains were not treated or followed up effectively.  If you know there is a stain on an item, and you treat it (once, twice, etc.) and it does not come out, maybe you should be proactive and point it out to the customer and discuss options (e.g., additional treatments, refund, partial refund)--instead of charging me and hoping I don't see what was left behind.  This location is extremely close to my house, but I will be going out of my way to not use it.  Unfortunate.
