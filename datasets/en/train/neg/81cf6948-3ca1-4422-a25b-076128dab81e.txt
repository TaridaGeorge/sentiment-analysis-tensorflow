What a disappointment.  This review is based on the veggie spring rolls and steak pho which are the most basic meals. Maybe I'm just spoiled living in san francisco where the restaurant foods are excellent. In any case for whatever it is worth: the rolls were fresh, i liked that. then the waiter brought one dish of sprouts w/ basil. Normally if two people order pho you each get a plate. We asked for another plate and the waiter said more? like he didn't get  why. i'm not sure. then the pho came. each bowl had two small slabs of thick steak, the 'broth' was tasteless.  We will definately not go back, definately not authentic. I'd give it 1 star but because the rolls were fresh,i give it two.
