i went in to exchange my BRAND NEW, STILL IN PACKAGE aquarium filter, and was told that without a receipt, I would not be able to exchange it.

this goes for all aquarium products over $10.

the manager was surprisingly rude, and didn't even attempt to save my business as i walked out of the door with my money that i will never spend at this pitiful excuse for a pet store.

CRAPPY!!!!!!!!
