I was hospitalized with an irregular heartbeat called afib at Chandler Regional Hospital where Dr. Ganem was the physician assigned to my treatment. He is not my regular cardiologist but I found him to be arrogant and not very informative.  He put me on a medication which was to treat the irregular heartbeat.  After being released from the hospital, I developed what I thought was afib again.  Went to my regular cardiologist and discovered the medication had given me a heart flutter.   I found out from 2 cardiologists and an Internist that the medication that Dr. Ganem had given me was not appropriate for my medical condition.
