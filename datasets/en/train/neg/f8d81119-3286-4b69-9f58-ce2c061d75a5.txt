Tried to visit District as part of the Urban Wine Walk. It was only moderately busy in the bar and several other tables were participating in the UWW. However, after waiting at a table for over 15 minutes, watching a waiter walk by us three times, and see another waiter bus tables next to us without even a hello, my group decided it was time to move on to find better service and an establishment interested in our business.
