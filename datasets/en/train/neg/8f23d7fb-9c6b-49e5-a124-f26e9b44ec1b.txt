This is the worst place to take your animal.  They had us wait for 3 hours and never did any thing for my dog.  They said they were busy with a dieing cat.  After 3 hours all they did was come in and ask if we wanted blood work and tests for $786.00.  My dog was having seizures, and the seizures had stopped, so we left and took him to my regular vet the next day.  They charged us $75.00 for doing nothing but let us sitting for 3 hours waiting for them to serve us.  I do not think we should have had to pay because they did nothing....be careful they are very unprofesssional.....
