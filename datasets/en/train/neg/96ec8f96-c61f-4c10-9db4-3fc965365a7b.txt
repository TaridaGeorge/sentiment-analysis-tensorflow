Ordered a meatball sandwich with french fries for delivery; couldn't be more disappointed. The sandwich was soggy to the point the bread had disintegrated into mulch. Did they soak this thing in a bathtub for a few hours before delivering it? The fries tasted as though they'd been left to sit for much longer than they should have, and were also very soggy--my guess is that they sat in a pool of grease all night. I won't order from here again, and I recommend you don't either.
