Disgusting.

Have you ever experienced a time where you are just craving sushi, so much that even a philadelphia roll platter would do? If so, have you ever been so revolted you couldn't finish the roll?

I hope you haven't. This was my first experience with that and I was left heartbroken and sad and wishing I had never decided to give this place a chance. 

While the decor is amazing, the menu looks unique and spectacular and even the rolls looked amazingly tempting when I brought them home, the love affair stops there. It's all superficial, and I don't date that type.
