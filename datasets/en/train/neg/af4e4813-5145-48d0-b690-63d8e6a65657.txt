Years ago I purchased a lifetime oil change.
Every time I go there & get my free oil change I receive lousy service.  Took my car in before 11 am & it's past 5 pm & my oil change is not even done.

I guess because they will not make any money they do not care. They told me my car should be done at closing which is 5:30 pm.

Needless to say I will never purchase anything from them.
