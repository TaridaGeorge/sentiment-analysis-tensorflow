The service was not great and my fiance was throwing up the food hours later. Also, we did not get everything we ordered. After we ate, I told the waiter, and instead of taking what we did not get off the bill (like I asked), he said it was ready and went and grabbed it and brought it out (by now we had finished eating and wanted to leave).
