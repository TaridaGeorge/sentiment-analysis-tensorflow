HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE FIRST THEY STOLE THE 75 cent that I was going to fill up my water jugs, then they told me they topped off my fluids which they did not my car almost OVERHEATED and now my radio plays softly even though my car is totally off. All I went there for was an oil change, that was all. WTF!!!
