I was a sub contractor on the new breakfast club construction project for the owner in downtown Phoenix. The owner has refused to pay the General contractor the retention on this project. Every sub and small trade on this job is owned money by a greedy owner who is acting unethical. Until he does the right thing and pays the retention out on his new building so that all the people who worked hard on this project can get paid what is owed, maybe then we can afford breakfast. Please help us stand up for small business and think twice about giving your business to a man who hurts other small business by not paying them what he owes. God bless.
