Me Eek! Methinks not, assigned from the mixed use of language styles..is because this extremely busy place all the time clearly has a customer base in which they could afford to put up parking lot shade.  No matter what time of days..this place is packed..and they do a nice job of keeping lines moving, unilke poor Basha's who has one clerk at a time, but then again, you have to dodge the tumbleweeds as they blow through the aisles...And still..AVOID Starbucks...Go to Tully's...just as good, NOT as expensive..and NO LINES.
