I was SO EXCITED for this to open, as we moved away from the one in east Mesa. I loved the pork quesadillas I got there. 

I went here about a week after it opened, maybe two weeks. I couldn't eat my rice, because it tasted like plastic for some reason. Like chemicals. Additionally, the beans taste nontraditional, kind of like bush's baked beans or something. Not Mexican food to me at all. 

The quesadilla was fine, but didn't taste as good as the other location. My husband didn't even eat all of his food because the meat was crispy like it was already cooked and then just reheated on a pan, or just burned oddly. And our waitress was just BLAH, kind of seemed like she didn't care about anything. Not friendly at all. 

Overall, I won't go back, especially for the prices we paid.
