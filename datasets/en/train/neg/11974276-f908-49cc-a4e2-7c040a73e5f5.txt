After reading Judy F. 's update, I will no longer go to this establishment.  I was a BIG supporter of this cafe when it was at the Esplanade, however reading Judy B. or Frenchie B's comments, private and a review, I will never send anyone there.  And I've sent many, saying the desserts are wonderful.  The desserts may be wonderful, however, that type of attitude is not needed from those who are related to the owners or who are the owners.   Very disappointing.  Desserts are worth more than Mc D's yes however the attitude is not worth my time, therefore, I will have my caramel sundae for a $1or support another local cafe.   All yelpers try to help locals, however, this cafe doesn't seem to care and approach the reviews very defensively.
