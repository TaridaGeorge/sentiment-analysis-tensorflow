Will never go to this salon ever again I went in to get all over highlights and some lady who just got out of school did my hair and she took five hours to do it and the highlights weren't  even to the roots and a lot of my highlights have spots of my brown color I think she was afraid to use a lot of the bleach and I wanted layers and side bangs and she really messed up my bangs they look all choppy I hate them
