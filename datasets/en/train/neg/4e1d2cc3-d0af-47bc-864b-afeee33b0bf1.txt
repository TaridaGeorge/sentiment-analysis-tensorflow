I went here for my birthday dinner tonight, my waitress had a very bad attitude. I ordered the Falafal dinner pita, these were the worst falafals I have ever had. They were dry, bitter, and crunchy... not in the good way.
 My waitress kept disappearing during the dinner, so water was very limited. When it was time for my birthday 'chocolate torte' it was basically just thrown on the table in front of me and the waitress just walked away. The torte was bad too, it tasted similar to dirt. But it was free so I can't complain too much. 

I really used to like this place when it actually looked like a Greek place rather than some stupid bar.
