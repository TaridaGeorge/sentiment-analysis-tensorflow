Been to the Majerle's in Phoenix, but this review is for the new place in Chandler - as I can't remember the last time I visited the downtown estab.  The bottom line.  Avoid like the plague.  A couple observations:
- The place was total sausage fest.  Like 20 dudes to one girl.  During happy hour.
- Worst fish and chips imaginable.  Now what place on earth serves up cookie-encrusted grease-soaked cod with sugar-laced french fries???  Yuck.
- The tartar sauce to go with that?  Nope.  Just all mayo.
- Hot wings, surprisingly, we're okay.
- Philly cheesesteak sandwich - ick.
- Cole slaw, more like sugar slaw.

Place blows.  So many other great places in the East Valley to visit with your hard earned dollar.  Vote elsewhere.
