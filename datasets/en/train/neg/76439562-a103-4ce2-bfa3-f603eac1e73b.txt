The food was okay but the service was horrible.  The table was not cleaned when we were seated. A girl came to clean the table with a smelly dirty rag and brushed all the crumbs on our laps. I asked if she would please get a clean cloth. When she came back she argued with me...told me the last one was clean. If a cloth smells enough for me to notice then it's full of bacteria and not at all clean. No wifi either. Why? The waitress said it's because people stay too long. I will not be visiting any Applebee's again.
