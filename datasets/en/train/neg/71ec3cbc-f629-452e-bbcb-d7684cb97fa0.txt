My husband and I live nearby so we decided to give it a try even though we think the best Thai in the valley is in downtown Phoenix at the wild Thaiger where we eat weekly. We ordered a curry dish, a noodle dish and the Tom ka soup. All had a flavor that neither of us cared for..very bitter and rancid tasting. The beef in the curry had lots of fatty gristle on it and the Tom ka was severely lacking in coconut milk. I only had a bite of everything and then opted for a Wendy's hamburger..That's  how unimpressed I was. This place may be close to home, but you can bet I won't be returning. Steer clear of this one!!
