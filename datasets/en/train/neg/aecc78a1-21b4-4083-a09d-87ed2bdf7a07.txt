Okay, so I actually joined Yelp so I could comment on this business. I purchased an Amazon local coupon which the owner refused to accept. Instead I was offered to purchase a tanning package for 65 dollars. I am unsure why the owner would sign up for the Amazon deal if she was unwilling to accept the voucher. It was a huge waste of my time. Not only did I drive out there to redeem my voucher but I also had to return home and call Amazon to receive a refund for the voucher I purchased. It is a very poor way to run a business and is a quick way to alienate customers. Even though it is down the street from my house I will not be returning.
