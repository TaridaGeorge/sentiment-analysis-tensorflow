Every time I go here, it seems like the staff has nothing better to be than berate their customers for not "ordering to their standards". One instance I ordered a grande iced coffee, sweetened and the woman when I got to the window tried to hand me a hot coffee. Clearly she doesn't know it's 105 degrees out and I've been coming here with the same order for oh I don't know three years. Used to tip, but forget that if I can't even get a correct order. Weekend staff is a breath of fresh air, but forget coming in the mornings... they really don't like their jobs!
