Awful lobster roll!  

Headed here for lunch while working downtown.  I was very excited to see the BIG menu -- lots of things looked really yummy.  Unfortunately for me, I decided on the lobster roll.  It was NOT GOOD!  It tasted mostly like fake crab meat.  It reminded me of the "seafood salad" you get at Subway more than any lobster roll I've ever had.  It was a crime to call this a lobster roll!  I picked through it and left 80% of it on my plate.  Did the waiter ask if everything was okay?  NO, he didn't!

I feel bad giving this place such a low rating after only trying one thing on the menu, but that's how unappetizing this "lobster" roll was.
