Went in for a small purchase (just needed to pay, advice not required). Two "cashiers" fully occupied problem solving for customers, had to call for a manager 3 times before he sauntered out. 7 customers waiting in line to pay. Finally gave up, put the items back on the shelf and left.
Next day, my wife goes in and experiences the same incredible lack of retail customer service.
This place should just close its doors to non-contractor customers, as they sure haven't a clue about what it takes. That, taken with their "bankers hours" and closure on Sundays sends a clear message that Home Depot / Lowe's is a better place to go.
