Okay, I have lived in Phoenix and in LA. I have always thought LA was more expensive until my experience at Maroney's Cleaners. Holy Crap Ohla!!! I paid $7.65 for a pair of lined pants to get cleaned by them. Now, I have paid anywhere from $1.50 to $5.50 but are you kidding me $7.65. Then to top it off...I was a bit disappointed in the actual dry cleaning service because my pants were not perfect!!! So, after I was done throwing a temper-tantrum in the tahoe I then proceeded to call and text everyone I know (okay just kidding) about my frustrations. The drive up service is convenient however the price is NOT WORTH IT!!!
