Horrible service! Horrible bouncers! Bartenders sold us beer 30 minutes prior to close and we had a constant parade of bouncers telling us we need to leave so they can close. One bouncer told us to finish up and no more than 30 seconds later another bouncer showed up to say the same thing! Quite annoying!
