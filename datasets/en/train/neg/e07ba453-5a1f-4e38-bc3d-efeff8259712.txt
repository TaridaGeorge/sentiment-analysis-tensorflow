Although you may think different ... this place is NOT FAST FOOD. They are located in the center of the 6th largest city and they have exactly ONE cash register. And not only that, the staff move as if they are mentally challenged and have an IQ of 60.

The food is typical Church's but ya' might want to plan ahead and make sure you have plenty of extra free time ...
