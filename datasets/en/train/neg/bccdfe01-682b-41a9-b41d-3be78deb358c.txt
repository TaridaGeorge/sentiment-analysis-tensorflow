I had a LivingSocial deal for this place and I called to place an order to go. The guy on the phone was nice until I told him I had the coupon. He was very short in his answers and was snotty when I asked for a sauce on the side. After I would order one thing he would reply with, "what else" in a very rude tone. I felt like I was being hurried the whole time and they didn't want my business. After getting off the phone I was so upset by the horrible customer service I decided to call and cancel my order. They aren't worth my time or money and I would never consider going there.
