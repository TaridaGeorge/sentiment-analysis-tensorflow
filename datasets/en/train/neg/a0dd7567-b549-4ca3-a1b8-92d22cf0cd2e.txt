Let me start with the fact that I love Old Navy, over the years I've been able to find some great deals.  

My problem with this Old Navy is customer service.  I had an employee complain to be about organizing racks, when I talked to the manager I was offered, and I quote "$5 appeasement bucks".  Basically there strategy is to give me $5 to shut up, not a good customer service plan Old Navy.
