Worst Apt I have ever lived at! I have lived at Aventerra for almost 18 months. Since I moved in it has gotten worse and worse. Aventerra has changed owners multiple times and now is owned by the bank. There has been at least 3 management companies that have run this place. My mail box was broken in to multiple times and it took management 2 months to fix it. Since the bank took over ownership Management has been letting anyone move in. The people that live below me are the most ghetto people I have met. They scream and fight all hours of the night. This has been reported to Management and to the Police. Nothing ever is done. Avoid this place!!!
