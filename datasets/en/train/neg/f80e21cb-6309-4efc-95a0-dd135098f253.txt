Great espresso, delicious baked-goods. Beware, though, you MUST order very slowly, and be sure to enunciate. And maybe ask the counter person to repeat the order back to you. Otherwise, you may end up with a bowl of oatmeal swimming in espresso. And delivered to your table 30 minutes after you ordered.
