One of the worst tasting cupcakes that I ever tasted. I had the vanilla vanilla and my husband had the chocolate vanilla. Minus-one star for the lack of originality in the names of the cupcakes(copied from Magnolia). Minus one star for the not so good service. Minus one star cause both cupcakes were way tooo sweet.  

They alleged that it was a "soft opening"--why do I even care? but I probably wouldn't go back.
