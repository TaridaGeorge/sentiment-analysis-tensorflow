Um... where do I start? My husband went to the buffet where the food looked as though it had been sitting under the heat lamps for about three hours. I ordered the General Tso's chicken combo. The chicken was chewy and the sauce was hardly what you could call spicy. The fried rice had bits of hard chewy chicken (?) in it and the egg roll was so greasy it was hardly edible. We ordered fried won-tons and they were saturated in grease. I had heartburn before I even left the restaurant. Save yourself the indigestion and the money and go somewhere else.
