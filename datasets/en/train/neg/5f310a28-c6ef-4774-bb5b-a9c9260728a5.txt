Thank God this place closed! I ate there twice and NEVERwanted to go back! The first time was right after they opened, and the food seemed over priced but fine.  The second time I feared for my health! The food was unappetizing , disgusting, and unsanitary.  The owner, who spoke little english, argued and refused to refund my money when I advised her the food was cold and unsatisfactory! Too bad this site won't except no stars!
