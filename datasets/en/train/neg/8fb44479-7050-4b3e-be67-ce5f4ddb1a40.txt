The people behind the counter at the pharmacy must believe that they are the only place in town to have your prescriptions filled, because their service is at a level that you could only expect coming from a monopoly.  It would be wise for them to keep in mind that, while they get paid to waste their time, their customers most assuredly are not.  I value my time and self-respect too much to come here again.
