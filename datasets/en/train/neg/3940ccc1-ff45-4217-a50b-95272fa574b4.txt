We showed up at 6:15 and were seated. We sat, and we sat and well, we sat some more. Two waiters were working the area around us but apparently neither felt the need to serve our table. After over 10 minutes of sitting without any acknowledgement we left.  A simple, "we'll be right with you." could've solved the problem or even better, the two host/hostesses could have taken a drink order. We will not be back. There are plenty of fantastic little restaurants all over downtown that treat their clientele as if they want repeat business.
