they have a good variety, but the customer service there is meh.
Nobody really knows where anything is and you can't get a hold of a clerk.

You have to pay cash if you buy less than 10 bucks.

Oh, and I found a squished dead ROACH in my food I bought from there.
The processed veggie sausages.... 
3" ROACH *shudders* all squished with its guts hanging out.

I am too traumatized to go back.
