Horrible experience. I know, I know...what's the point of reviewing a grocery store? Well, let me tell you--the lady forgot to put a bag of groceries in our cart (who is responsible in this situation... the customer or the employee)? Anyway... we remembered one item and went back for it next day but forgot the other item until later that same day! We had to go back 2x for our stuff which seemed rather silly. The employee was talking on the phone or to other staff the entire time. So frustrating!

This place is not nearby our home either. We stopped by after a trip up north to save some money on the way back home because they were having a sale. Clearly, that did not work out well--lesson learned! Not again!
