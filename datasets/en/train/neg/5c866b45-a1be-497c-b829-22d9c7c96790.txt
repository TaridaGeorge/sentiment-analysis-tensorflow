Bad hotel coffee shop.  Food is just bad. Service slow, inatentive, and poorly trained.  They are clueless........Ambiance is terrible inside......we were there at night....during day can sit outside in pool garden area..which I'm sure is pretty........and drinks are very thin......order beer or wine.   Do not go unless your staying in hotel........it makes a very poor statement about marriot At desert ridge.....
not worth wasting time on reviewing
