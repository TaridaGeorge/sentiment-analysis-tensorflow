Pizza is inconsistent. Sometimes under cooked, other times cut disturbingly wrong ( sad when half of it is for a vegetarian ). Forget ordering chicken wings! It's like pulling teeth!!!! How hard is it to get " medium bone out "? 4 out of 5 times it's anything but! Last night was the straw that broke camels back when we found out that this time they gave us honey BBQ. After calling the manager to let her know of the mistake, she replies "I guess some one else got your wings". Really!? An apology would have been more appreciated then a sarcastic comment! I don't recommend going to this Pizza Hut. The service is worse then the neighborhood it sits in. I wish there was a negative star I could rate this place.
