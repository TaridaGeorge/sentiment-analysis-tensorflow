I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone!  My son, who is 3, was left alone during one of the kid's camps during the summer.  He fell onto the concrete and hit his head.  Instead of calling, they put him alone, separated from his brother and the rest of the group  for 2 hours.  When I asked why, the girl said that it was because he wouldn't stop crying and asking for me.   She was upset at what the other clients would think if they heard him crying.  I was SO upset.  Not only because they didn't call right after it happened, but because she left him alone for the incident to occur and then was afraid of the consequences.  We will NEVER take our kids to this place and would highly recommend you not either.
