I once thought Rancho Solano was an excellent school; however, after having a child attend there I feel completely different. If your child does not fit their "mold", they will try to get your child out of their school. Isn't part of learning about being independent and being unique? Their test scores are high because they weed out the children who they don't want, and if your child has a difficulty in an area they will push it on the parent instead of trying to make it a parent-teacher effort. I know all of this because my child was asked not to come back to their preschool (and of course then they tried to keep the tuition). If you want your child to grow and learn to be independent, their own unique person, I would steer clear of Rancho Solano.
