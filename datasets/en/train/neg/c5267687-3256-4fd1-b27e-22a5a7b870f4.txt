Frankly, who cares? Bad logo even from the start with lego-land Hopi coyote to the howling dog look now. Throw in indifferent teams and financial problems throughout, why was this team moved from Winnipeg in the first place.

Also, retaining the whole "White Out" tradition in the playoffs is dumb. Sorry, but it didn't really work in Winnipeg (how many playoff rounds did they win in their NHL days?).

Plus they don't even play in Phoenix anymore.
