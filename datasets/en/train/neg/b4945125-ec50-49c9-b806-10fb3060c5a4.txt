I used the bathroom here with my 3 year old when the farmers mArket was going on and there were baby roaches all over. I first saw 3 and when I flushed the toilet one ran out from the seat! I immediately told the young girl working there and she said " I know, the owner won't do anything about it!". She went on to say all the employees wrote fake complaints just so he would call an exterminator and he still did not do anything. Anyone considering eating here should visit the restroom first!
