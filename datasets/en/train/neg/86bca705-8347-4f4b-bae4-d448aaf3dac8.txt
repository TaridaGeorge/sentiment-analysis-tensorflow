The service was extremely pleasant, but the rest of the meal was terrible.

My husband and I went for lunch today.  First we ordered a salad to share $3.50..which amounted to about 1/4 cup of lettuce with a slice of cucumber and a slice of tomato.

Next I had the lunch special which was $5.99 which consisted of a very small cup of watery chicken soup and 1/2 cuban sandwich.  Both the soup and the sandwich were a big disappointment.

My husband ordered some sort of over cooked meat dish.  It was watery and tasteless.  This came with black beans and rice.  I'm at a loss for words on how to describe them but, yuck.  His entree was $10.99 for lunch!

The only thing good things was the flan and the cuban coffee.  

My suggestion is to only go there for dessert!
