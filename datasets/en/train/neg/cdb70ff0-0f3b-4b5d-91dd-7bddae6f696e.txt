This is the worst cleaner I have ever been to!  They destroyed a new dress of mine & denyed any responsibility.  There was a huge basketball sized burn right through the dress, but they said that I must have brought it in like that!  (They cleaned it, put it on a hanger, and gave it back to me like that!)  They then proceeded to tell me that they don't have any chemicals there that could burn through a dress like that- it must have been my sweat!  We have tried and tried to have clothes done there because the prices are cheap, but every single piece we have ever gotten back it either spotted or wrinkled or now completely destroyed.  Stay away- especially with anything you ever want to wear again!  The prices are not cheap enough to justify the horrible work they do!
