Not worth the trip.  Quality has gone way down.  My steak was barely warm.  Mashed potatoes and veggies weren't anything special.  Lobster ravioli tasted like the Buitoni from the grocery store.  Lobster & shrimp pasta dish was mediocre at best.  The atmosphere is beautiful, and service was great.  Food was not up to par for the prices they charge.  Go to Grimaldi's or La Stalla in Chandler, and you will be much happier with your meal.  We swore the last time we ate at Brio we would not return.  Now we will never return.
