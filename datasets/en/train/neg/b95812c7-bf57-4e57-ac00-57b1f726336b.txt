I admit that this is a nice hotel.  The gardens are impeccable and serene.  But the service is an embarrassment to a hotel of this caliber.  The employees are supercilious, and this attitude also runs throughout management.

In short, the employees make this gorgeous hotel an unpleasant place to stay.  The Ritz Carlton has dated decor, but has much better service.
