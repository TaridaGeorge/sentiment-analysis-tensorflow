Lived here for about a year. Went to renew my lease and my already overpriced rent went up.  $1200 for a 800sqft 1 bedroom. The location is great and I like my balcony but I can't justify $1200.  The walls are concrete so it is difficult to anchor bookshelves or hang art.  The appliances are low end, the carpet is indoor/outdoor crap and the counters are laminate. It is fairly energy efficient with the concrete construction.  The parking garage -- people follow you in all the time and I've seen many cars with broken windows. The pool is ok but should be saltwater for the high rent.  The grills are never cleaned.  The office staff is very corporate, incredibly insincere.  Also lots of big dogs and very few leashes.
