Did not enjoy our lunch here.    Had to wait for a hostess to even come to the hostess stand to seat us.    The waitress took even longer.   This was on a Thursday at 2:30 in the afternoon.     It's not like it was a busy time.      Ordered the brie appetizer, wedge salad, fish and chips and shortrib.     The wedge was good but  the portion on the fish and chips was way too small.   Very poor quality cod.   My husband thinks he got some type of food poisoning from the short rib.   He was sick all night.    Would definitely not go back.    Also very expensive, not worth the money.
