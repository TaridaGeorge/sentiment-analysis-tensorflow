At twilight care the receptionist typed in my sons birthday wrong (found out later) so the insurance would not go through.  They let my 9 month old projectile vomite for over an hour until we figured out her mistake.  She was very uncaring & rude.  She didn't care how sick he was, the insurance better come through.  After she corrected her mistate, they let us back.  The Doc on call said...nothing they could do take him to ER.  They could tell us that while he was vomiting & crying in the waiting room?!  SO UNCARING!
