I love sushi.  The sushi at this place? Expensive and its not especially worth the high price.  There are so many good sushi places in the valley.  The sushi tastes old and falls apart when you pick it up with your chop stix (BoOO).  The miso soup seems like its from a dry mix. 

There are a few sushi places in town that are better quality and better prices. AKA fresher fish, better ingredients, and superior preparation.

Try: Sushi Creek:  If you don't mind a drive.  Very fresh, very well done.
        Mido:  Authentic little place with fast service and great prices.
         Koi:  Nice place to party and have sushi with friends (has now replaced Sushi    101 in my heart).
