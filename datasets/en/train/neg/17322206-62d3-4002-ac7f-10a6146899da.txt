was very disappointed,two other patrons the service was terrible,the waitress obviously wanted to be anywhere but at work and it showed in her customer service..The food was terrible,two ordered calzones that were not cooked,the mushrooms were not done,I ordered pasta that was terrible!and I lost my appetite after first bite! location for this facitliy is perfect for move patrons too bad the service and food didnt live up to that!
