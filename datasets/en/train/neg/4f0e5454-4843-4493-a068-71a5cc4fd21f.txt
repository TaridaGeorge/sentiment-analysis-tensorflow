This place is full of apparently inexperienced young girls who butchered our maltipoo's cut recently. They told me he needed to be shaved due to matting--didn't realize that meant a cut that is totally uneven, with some areas shaved down to the skin and other areas somewhat puffy. Also the insides of his ears were bright red when we brought him home, apparently from the shaving and overzealous "plucking" that was done. Our dog was shivering and shaking and wouldn't leave his crate for 4 days after this episode. When I called to complain, I got nowhere with the girl on the phone. She certainly didn't offer any explanation or a refund, as their "guarantee" states. Bottom line: find someone who's more experienced and less agressive, for your dog's sake!
