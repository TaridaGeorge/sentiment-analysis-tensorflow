2.99 car wash is for clean cars.  4.99 wash is NO better.  If you have any bugs , they wont budge.  Soap still remains after cycle.  And the dirty towels used to dry your car are disgusting.  Manager was rude and intimadating.  I guess they dont need the business.  Never ever using this location.  Too bad!
