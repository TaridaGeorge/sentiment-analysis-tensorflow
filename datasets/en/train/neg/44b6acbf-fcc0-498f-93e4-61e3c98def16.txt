We went there with the expectation of seeing girls swinging from the rafters. No girls swinging from rafters, and after looking up, I didn't really  see any rafters, maybe the lighting. What I did see was a lot of men, biker types, not my scene. It was a Friday and pretty busy, but just too loud to even have a conversation. Finally we saw two girls that were waitresses, dressed normal, but still no chicks swinging from rafters. So after about a half hour of this, we left.
