Tasty Indian cuisine with a British influence. Pub side has mostly British ales and are served in traditional, Imperial pint glasses.

Food is average and in line with most Indian Cuisine in the Phoenix area. Chana Masala with garlic naan is an exceptional combination at this location. Appetizers are high quality as well. 

Prices/portions are on par for most restaurants.

Service is about average as well - sometimes great, sometimes good, and sometimes poor.
