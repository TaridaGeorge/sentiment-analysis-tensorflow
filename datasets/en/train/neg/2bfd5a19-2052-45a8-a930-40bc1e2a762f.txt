Husband and I tried to eat lunch here yesterday.  Our original plans were to try Arrogant Butcher, but I was in a bit of a hurry, and thought Sing High would be faster.  Wrong!

We arrived just before the noon rush.  We were seated quickly and the waitress took our order almost immediately.  Husband ordered the lemon chicken and I ordered the mu shu pork.  Then, thirty minutes passed.  No waitress coming by to tell us the food would take a while, or refill our drinks, or ask if we wanted anything else.  Nothing.  So..... We Left.  The one star really is for the service, we actually didn't taste the food.  Not a good place to come if you need a quick lunch.  Why have a restaurant downtown if you aren't going to be able to cater to quick lunches on the go?
