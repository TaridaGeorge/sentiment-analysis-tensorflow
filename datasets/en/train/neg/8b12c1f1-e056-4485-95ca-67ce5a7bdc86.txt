I used to order pita pit at least 5 times a week, however, in the last 2 days I called for delivery and it took 6, yes six, hours for the driver to show up, then I figured I would give then another chance but when I called for delivery they said "we don't know where our driver is."  get a clue....you should be embarrased!  the food is great the service is the worst i have ever seen in my life!  they will be out of business in a year!
