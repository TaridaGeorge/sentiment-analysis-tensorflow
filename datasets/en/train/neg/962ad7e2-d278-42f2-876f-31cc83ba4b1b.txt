If you find yourself hungry in PHX sky harbor airport before a morning flight, look somewhere else.  The breakfast is TERRIBLE.  I ordered a scramble and it was clearly made long before I ordered.  The food arrived cold, and cold scrambled eggs aren't very tasty.  The service was mediocre at best.

tl;dr: It may be a decent place for a drink before your flight, but if you're hungry, there is better/cheaper food on any airplane.
