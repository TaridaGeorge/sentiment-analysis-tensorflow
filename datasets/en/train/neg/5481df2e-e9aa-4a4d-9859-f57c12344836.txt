Nothing I've eaten here has ever been good.  Sure, it only means two meals to review but I'm not a masochist so that's the best you yelpers will get out of me.

I had some lemon grass soup, it tasted as if someone had poured lysol into it.  In fact I stopped after the first spoonful out of concern for my health.

The fact that this place is still open pisses me off.  I blame the trendy vegetarians who don't know how food is supposed to taste because they've accepted it as a casuality of their dietary choice.  Unacceptable!  Cook at home and wise up so that these places can follow their natural progression to extinction.
