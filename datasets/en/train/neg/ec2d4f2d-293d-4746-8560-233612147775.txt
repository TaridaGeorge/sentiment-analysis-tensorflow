We are having some motorcycle issues. My brother has been building bikes and cars for over 25 years, so he is walking Dragnet through what needs to be done. Basically his 2012 bikes chain came off.. Not good. Not his fault. He actually flipped off the bike when the chain came off. on Bell road, luckily nobody took him out. Now he has a lot of $$$$ work that needs to be done. And you bet your butt Ride Now will be covering it. 

From what I have read and heard, I'd stay away from here when it comes to buying anything with a motor.
