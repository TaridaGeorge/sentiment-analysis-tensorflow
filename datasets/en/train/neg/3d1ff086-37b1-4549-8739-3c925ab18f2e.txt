How can anyone rate this 2 stars let alone 5? Walked in and the place was oozing with garbage! Look over the counter and there is dirt and grime everywhere. Lady had no clue how to do math helping us. I had a buy one get one free coupon for smoothies and she couldn't figure out how to deduct one smoothie and tried overcharging me 3 times before I had to tell her the total. The donut we tried was fine but the smoothie and cookie and cream iced drink was horrendous! I will never go back to this trash bucket.
