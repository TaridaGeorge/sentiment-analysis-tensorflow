I've found a few random housewares here but I never bother looking at clothing. This place is high traffic and especially with pickers (people who resell on Ebay or at consignment/resale stores).  My husband usually scores in the book department. Their Halloween costumes are far from cheap. $30 for a poorly made, mass produced item? No thank you!
