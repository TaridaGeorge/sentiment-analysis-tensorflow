WE have been ordering compounded chewsf for my pet for one year.  The first few batches were find.  Then one came that a bunch of powder fell out.  Then one was so crumbly you could not get the chew out in one piece.  This last batch looked like it was coated in honey.  I called and they said the drug is hard to compound and to put the sticky one in the freezer.  They said that was the best they could do.
I called a different compounding pharmacy for animals, and they said DO NOT FREEZE that medicine an that they compound that drug all the time and do not have the same problems. I will use the other pharmcy next time.
