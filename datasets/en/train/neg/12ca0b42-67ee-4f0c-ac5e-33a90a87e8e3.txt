The place, parking lot and entrance were packed leading me to believe this place would not be so bad. 
When I walked up to get my ID checked the muscle head chastised me for still having a vertical ID. What a great way to welcome patrons! 
Once inside our friends had reserved seats, but only one, so Vince G. had to stand almost the entire time. 
Alcohol sucked, tasted like peroxide. 
Music sucked, a bunch of shitty trendy crap. 
The only thing redeeming were quality servers.
