I've written some reviews before, but they've always been positive.  That's not the case with this one.  We had take-out, so I can't speak to the level of service, but the food (sesame chicken, happy family, pork-fried rice) was less than mediocre -- tasteless, oily  and pricey.  We won't be giving it a second chance!
