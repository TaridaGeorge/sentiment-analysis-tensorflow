I recently purchased cooked shrimp from the seafood counter... Ugh!!! Worst shrimp I ever had!!! It was like chewing rubber! What a disappointment. It was old I guess. Bought it to make a shrimp cocktail and use the rest for shrimp scampi. Two items for superbowl Sunday grinds, sucked. Don't buy the shrimp from Bashas.  You're better off buying the frozen one that's prepackaged. Will never go back there again.  Fry's has better shrimp!
