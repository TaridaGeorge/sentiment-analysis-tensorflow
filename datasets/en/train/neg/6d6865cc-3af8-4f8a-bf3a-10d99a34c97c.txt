Arrived @ 8:30 am on a Sunday and they were OUT of MOST Donuts???
They are opent till at least 6pm and I was told they would not be baking any more.  Then I was told the donuts are not baked there; but rather delivered. 
This Location is across the street from a Hospital and 2 blocks from the Scottsdale Police Dept. and they are out of Donuts???
I gave them a second chance today and I was told they are out of donuts due to it being MOTHERS DAY.  Really?  did the Owner/Manager not know it was Mothers Day?
Very Poor Selection and POOR ATTITUDE from the staff!
I HAD TO GIVE IT 1 STAR OR MY REVIEW WOULD NOT POST!
IT SHOULD BE A NEGATIVE STAR.
