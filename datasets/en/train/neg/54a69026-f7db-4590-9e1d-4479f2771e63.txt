Extreme warning about this business. James Rogers is a complete salesman that can't back up quality or his commitments.  I overpaid on a contract for sub par work that still hasn't been completed.  While still waiting for completion (a month past committed completion date), on March 23rd he finally informed me that he was out of business since March 9th.  Conveniently he had made another charge to my credit card on March 9th.  Since then I have talked to multiple people that are all looking for money from him.  Beware of James Rogers and Sun Rock Kitchen and Design.  

I could deal with the missed timelines and sub-par work, but this guy's lack of ethics remains completely unacceptable.
