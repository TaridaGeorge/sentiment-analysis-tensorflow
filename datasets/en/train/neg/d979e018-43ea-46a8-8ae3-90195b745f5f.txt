We went there on a Saturday night. It is a horrible experience It took 15 mins for someone to take our order. Then, 20 minute later, the cold dish is serve with rice. The cold dish was alright but the rice was so hard, it is like uncook. I believe they rush it. Then, we were waited for one hour for two main dishes. It was really unreasonable. We have never been to a chinese restaurant that will make me wait for one hour for two dishes. I was so pissed I left before they make my food. I was there for 1 and half hour and we left hungry!!! The owner must hired more waitresses and chiefs. Otherwise, this place will be close in 6 months.
