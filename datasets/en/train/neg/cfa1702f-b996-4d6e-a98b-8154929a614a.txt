This was a terrible experience.  I am a regular Target shopper and was returning three small items that were less than $5 total.  Two of the items were not coming up on their computer but were clearly showing on my receipt for $105.  The two service associates acted helpless dumbfounded and definitely not empowered.  They continuously asked me if i had another receipt.  After I screamed at them that it was ridiculous to put me through this for $2, they gave me a cash refund-for less than I paid.  I am still annoyed, I can't believe retail has sunken to this level of stupidity.
