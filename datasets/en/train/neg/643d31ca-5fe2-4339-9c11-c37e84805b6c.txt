I was charged for a exam/referral when I told them before my appointment that I didn't want a referral - I wanted diagnosis and treatment - otherwise, I'd go directly to the higher-priced specialist. 

They assured me 3 times that I could get diagnosis and treatment in-office, but at my appointment, they ended up just giving me a referral to a specialist anyway.
 
I would easily have just gone directly to a specialist if they hadn't confirmed 3 times that I could get the diagnosis and treatment I needed in-office. This billing practice is extremely shady. Frances M. (billing administrator) - you know that what you've done is shady. I'm calling you out on it.
