We were seated right away but from there nobody acknowledged us so we had to leave. There were some waitstaff serving others nearby but it felt like our table had nobody assigned to it. We had to be on our way in a reasonable amount of time so we had to leave 10 minutes later since nothing had happened. Other friends rave about this location so it was a disappointing experience.
