LOL. That's about all I can say about the positive reviews on this place. Took my Mom and family to Vincent for my Mom's 65 birthday. Sad place to eat. The wait staff was terrible - our drinks were very late, twice, and my wife was served the wrong order. The food was consistently bad as well - rubbery lobster, sad rice, and a strawberry cobbler that tasted like freezer burn. Did we hit the place on a bad night, or what?  Never again.
