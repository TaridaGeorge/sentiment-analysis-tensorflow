If you like sub marginal food-True Food is the place to eat. I had the summer salad-I've tasted better salads at an airport concession stand.
My husband had the halibut-chewy and dull tasting. My daughter was the only one that enjoyed her steak tacos-tasted the exact same at Blanco's.

Service was great but sitting on the patio was fine till the misters turned off. The temp.outside was a mere 100.

I would never recommend this restaurant, many great restaurants nearby.
