I have had way better sea food at the Red Lobster and the price was nice.  Seriously,  my baked stuffed shrimp was overcooked.  My husbands Halibut didn't seem like halibut at all.  It was dry but edible.  Our third party had Lobster and clams and he thought it was terrible.  We are from Seattle and I guess we know sea food. Rich food does not mean good food.  The turtle soup was good.  The staff was friendly.  Not a reason to waste 200.00 bucks on a bad dinner.
