Jeez. A water front? Now I know peeps from Arizona LOVE to come and soak up the sun and play here in San Diego... But, PHLEEEEEEEEEEZE. Scottsdale! Shame on you. This is more like a canal (ala LA River basin) that stinks. Looks like redevelopment has a huge hand here in this area, but the name, WATERfront... I can only imagine that hotels will start to advertise beachfront rooms...
