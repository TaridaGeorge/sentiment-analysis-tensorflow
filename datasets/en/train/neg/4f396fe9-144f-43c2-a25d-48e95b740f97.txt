First visit- huge disappointment. There was a hair in my potatoes (breakfast).  I pointed it out to the waitress (?).  After scrutinizing my plate to make sure yes, there really was a hair, she picked it up and said she would get me a new plate and walked away.  No apology. I was disgusted and asked for a refund which took forever.  Not sure why, but I kept apologizing like it was my fault that she had to be bothered to give me a refund. Only the breakfast was refunded, not the whole meal, which means I paid for a barely touched OJ which I asked for a to-go cup since it was apparent that I wasn't going to be refunded for the whole meal.  Very sad experience, bad service, no apologies. Will not be going back.
