The worst shopping experience ever. Went in for a simple bagel, butter, banana & sprite. My light lunch of choice working a delivery job in the heat. The bakery was dark midday, odd. Bagels not well displayed, very few choices.

Asked if I could get it toasted & some butter. No we don't toast, ask the deli for butter. Asked the deli, NO butter is not on our condiment order list. Check the bakery.

A big disappointment since Bashas offers to toast it and ask how many butters you'd like when you are selecting a bagel.

On a positive note, the wine department & steward looked impressive.
