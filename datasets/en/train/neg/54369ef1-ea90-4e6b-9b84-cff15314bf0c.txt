Although the waitress was very nice, There was mold on the Caprese Appetizer, the Tilapia was uber fishy and on the verge of being spoiled. They comped up dessert to try to make up for all the horrible things but, we got the creme brulee. It was honestly the worst creme brulee I've ever had. It tasted like goat yogurt. Awful. I want to support businesses that use organics and alternatives such as gluten free but, i will not be back. Maybe they were just having a bad day.
