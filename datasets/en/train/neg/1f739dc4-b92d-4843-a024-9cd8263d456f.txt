I do not understand the appeal. The food here was totally mediocre. The place is a dive that appears to have been around forever - that's about all the appeal I could muster from the place.

Greasy bacon, greasy potatoes; nice waitstaff but why go to a restaurant if not for the food?  The food here was ridiculous unspecial. And it's not like it's a value for the money, either.

Bleh. Never again.
