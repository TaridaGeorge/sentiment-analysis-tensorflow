Went for happy hour. They have decent prices for food (the sushi sucks), but limited drink selections. The happy hour martinis and margaritas have no alcohol in them at all. Our server was one of the worst I have ever experienced. He was in a foul mood and took it out on everyone. Even the managers were too busy drinking and flirting, they had no clue what was going on. The place seems to be a hang out for loud obnoxious girls that have to scream when they talk. I would not go back to this place when there are so many better places to choose from.
