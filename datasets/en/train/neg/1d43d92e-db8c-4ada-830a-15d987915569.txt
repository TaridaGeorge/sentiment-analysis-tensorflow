I actually would give this 1 1/2 stars.
After driving across town to find out what the fuss was all about, I had a vanilla bourbon cupcake with coconut frosting.
The taste of the cupcake was OK, but it was extremely heavy and fairly dry.
I'd give it a 2.
But the frosting was a too-sweet, heavy, lard-like blob with coconut on top.  Ick!  I'd give it a 1, since you have no zero.  
Bottom line: Never again.  If you are a coconut fan like I am, go to the nearest Whole Foods and pay the extra dollar or so to get one of their little coconut cakes.  Far superior.
