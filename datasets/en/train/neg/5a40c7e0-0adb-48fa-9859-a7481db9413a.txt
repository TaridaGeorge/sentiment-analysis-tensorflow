Even though I was a tourist in Scottsdale, this place built for tourists made this tourist want to run the other direction.  There were some interesting stores that sold nick nacks and then some high end art galleries in this shopping district. I don't think the area knows what exactly it wants to be.  I was really bored and wanted to leave as soon as possible.  My host had only been here twice since they had recently moved to the area but she even admitted this would be a place that she wouldn't mind missing the next time guests came to stay.
