I really wanted to like this place. I love the concept of gluten-free, vegetarian and vegan menu items.

However I couldn't have been more disappointed in the food, service and overall environment.

I ordered the sloppy joes and they were bland, tasteless and lacking any flavor. My girlfriend ordered the kale and beat salad which was beyond awful. Their "house dressing" was literally olive oil and lemon juice... disgusting.  We sent it back and she received the tomato basil soup. The soup was REVOLTING. It was so over salted to the point that is uneditable. 

Also EVERYTHING took too long, it was over an hour wait for the food when there were only about 3 other patrons eating there. The server also charged us for the salad and we had to make a comment for her to take it off.

Avoid this place like the plague.
