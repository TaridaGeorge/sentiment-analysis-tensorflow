Absolute rip off, have had multiple friends and co-workers get ripped off at this mechanic. Co worker had a hole in her gas tank, they quoted her over 600$ because they said it was a specialty part! Had her call Brown's automotive repair nearby and they did it for 300 out the door, literally half the price. Go to Brown's!
