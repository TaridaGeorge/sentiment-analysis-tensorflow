giving two stars is very over doing it for this place.  I have been here several times and I thought it was great the first tie and the second not so great and I had sat up at the bar then.  Too noisy but then it is a small place with tables close to each other.  I had terrible service for being a suday night outside and not very busy. I coud not even get them to bring over napkins till  almost thru the fishest sushi I ever smelt and not appetizing at all. All in all an experience that will make me say NAY NAY.
