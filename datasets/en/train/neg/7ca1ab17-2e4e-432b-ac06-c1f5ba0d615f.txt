I hate giving bad reviews because I hate spending money at places to not enjoy my meal.  

So I ate at Jimmy Woo's and had the shrimp in lobster sauce.  The food just really didn't taste that great and I totally was not impressed.  After tossing half of my meal I called it a night.  Well Jimmy didn't think so I barely made it home and I was seriously sick from what I ate.  I won't get into details but totally not a fun experience.  

I see many people have went there and been fine but I for sure will never go back unless just to drink.  I can't eat somewhere I got sick at again ever.  Too bad it's got a great location and nice bar.
