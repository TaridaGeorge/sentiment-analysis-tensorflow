OK, so I get here to Scottsdale and I am still on East Coast time, BUT this is a 1 star joint if that. While I do like joints, the quality here is not what was written about in this string. Very Average at best, I will say that the Habanera salsa was outstanding however. It could be that I am jet lagged, but I have been to Mexico and do pride myself on knowing food, Mexican and others.....perhaps it is good to those who just are not all that knowledgeable?  Good Eating.
