Um, the works pizza we ordered was smashed to one side, so we called back to get a replacement. The girl replied, "Well, we could send you a fresh one, but it wont be like 5 minutes, it would be more like a half hour. Or we could credit you for a large, one topping pizza." Um, not a works like we ordered? So we dug into the extra cheese only to find it under cooked. Ewe. When calling for a full refund because we didn't want to eat this crap, the guy who answered this time was very compliant, but never even said he was sorry for the hassle, or the crappy pizza. Bummer, I liked Hungry Howie's Pizza, but we wont order from this place again.
