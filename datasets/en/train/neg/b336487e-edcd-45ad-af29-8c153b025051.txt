My best friend was in town and wanted to check this store out.  She found it on Yelp and being a plus-sized women, she loves to check out new places that offer clothing for 'real' women.  

What a waste of time!  We made the drive to North Scottsdale and the place had styles for my grandmother.  Nothing was young and hip in the store and everything looked like a moo-moo.  I'd recommend going there if you were 60 and above.

We were in the store for 10 minutes and none of the snobby sales people behind the counter even bothered to come say hello or ask us if we needed help. Just because we don't look like richies doesn't mean you can't acknowledge us.
