This store is super close to my house so I shop here for the convenience. However, their service is awful!! They have a bell to ring if you get good service. More appropriate would be a foghorn to blow when your service is bad. It would sound like a fleet of ships were coming into harbor....Maybe then they'd have a better chance convincing us their fish was fresh.
