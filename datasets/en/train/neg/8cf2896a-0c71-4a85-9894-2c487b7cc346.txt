If you are interested in a taco place with extremely mediocre food that lacks cleanliness or ambiance this is the place for you.  It really is a shame as the location and the concept could be unbeatable.  I experienced this place with a select group of four individuals who disliked this place as much as I did.  As a group we ordered the following items: the chips and guacamole, the veggie, the barbacoa, the chicken, and the carne asada tacos.  The barbacoa was tolerable, the carne asada was pasty and overloaded with a horrible mix of shredded salad greens, and for the veggie and the chicken, think twice.  I love concepts like this one but I will not be returning to this place ever.  I wouldn't expect this place to be around very long.
