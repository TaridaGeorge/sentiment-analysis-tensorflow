RUN FAR FAR AWAY FROM HERE!!! If I could rate a zero I would. Got my Golden bathed, trim rear & paw hair, brushed and nails trimmed here. Decided to try it out over Petsmart because Petco is closer! BIG mistake! My dog loved being pampered, she is older very calm and always great for the groomer. Pick her up to find her nails too short bleeding and her crying as she tried walking and licking paws! It took about 3 months for my dog to let a groomer touch her paws! Poor thing was terrified for months! We are happily back at Petsmart where the staff knows what the hell they are doing!
