Been here a few times, only because we live near by. In the evening this place usually has a long line. They are usually under staff here, so the wait is long. When the employees are busy and in a rush they will usually make mistakes. Management really needs to help out and make sure customer service is a number one priority! I try to avoid this location and go somewhere else.
