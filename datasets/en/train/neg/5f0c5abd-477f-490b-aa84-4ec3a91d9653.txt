Terrible food.  The beef ribs were super salty, and they cost $5.50 PER RIB now.  Their new menu doesn't even have a price for beef ribs, it says "Market Price," so the sky's the limit on how much Stacy can charge for them.  And they only accept cash, no credit cards, so bring plenty of $$$.

The ribs were not smoky at all.  I thought this place was called a "Smokehouse."  Not the ribs I guess.

The Mac N Cheese was from a Kraft box.  The cheese biscuits were burned.  The fried pickles weren't fried, only dipped in raw cornmeal so they were gritty and dry.

We won't be back.
