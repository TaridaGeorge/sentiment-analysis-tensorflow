I am by NO means a fancy-club kind of drinker. I prefer comfy, dark dives... but this place is so freakin' dirty even the roaches don't hang out here.
Hot and sweaty (in Arizona did A/C ever occur to you?), an indoor-smoky atmosphere, shitty music that is cranked up so loud the speakers give feedback, sketched-out patrons who stand around by themselves and stare at girls (the ones who have dates, even)... not to mention there is no tap beer and only plastic cups for mixed drinks. 
~NARF!~
