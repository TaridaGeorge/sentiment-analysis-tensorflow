I don't write reviews, but this one is very necessary. We hired this company to manage the HOA at our complex and they turned out to be extremely incompetent and shady. It was a horrible experience. There were over 15 properties, including ourselves who dropped them from a contract after a couple of months towards the end of 2011. Money had been misused and there were high erroneous charges for simple maintenance work and quite a bit of missing money once they left. Our new company is still working to clean up the mess that The Management Trust left us. I would highly advise you to stay away from this company. They may sound like they have a lot of experience and produce great results, but it is all false! If I could rate it zero stars I would.
