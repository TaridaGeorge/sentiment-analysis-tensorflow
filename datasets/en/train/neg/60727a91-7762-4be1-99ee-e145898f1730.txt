I used to love this place but I suspect it has changed owners in the past few years.
we had a friend in town who fondly remembered a meal he once had there so we decided to try it again.. It was a pretty bad experience with bad service-they were unprepared for a busy Friday night. What a disaster! The food is ok ( too salty) but the presentation, lack of care is evident both in service and overall experience.
Someone at Thai Lahna needs to regroup and reorganize. I hope they get their act together because it is a great location and has been good in the past.
