Rudest service in the world. Our food came cold, the woman hung up on me when I complained. I wasn't even being rude. I called back and was told the owners would call me and still have yet to call me.

If you want good service and pizza, don't go here. You'd get better service in a barn. 

Awful. Awful. Awful.
