It's been 6 weeks(as opposed to a team members estimate  of 48-72hrs) multiple in-store visits & calls w/ management...yet the mill dept. has been unable to provide me with a quote for purchasing a new door & Lowe's third party installation service. 
In addition, the door installer was sent to the wrong address; given to him by a Lowe's employee, who asked me to repeat my address 4-times to insure the installer arrived at the right location.
Had it not been for my insisting the installer call prior to arrival; I never would've known he arrived early at the wrong address. 
DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME/MONEY, at this location!!!
