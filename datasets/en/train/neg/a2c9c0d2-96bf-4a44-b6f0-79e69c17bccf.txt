I've purchased wood here for years, and recommended this business to friends.  But today, I pulled up to purchase a couple bags of wood, and the employee who was supposed to be selling me the wood took a look at my "Obama 2012" bumber sticker, took a few steps back, and then said sarcastically "well, i GUESS I will still help you, even though you voted for Obama".   Not only was this rude, but none of your business.  You are in the business of selling wood, and I guess also you are in the business of trying to insult your customers.  Sour grapes cause your candidate lost the election? Keep that to yourself, Sir, and just load the wood in my car.  Rude.  Poor customer service. Inappropriate.
