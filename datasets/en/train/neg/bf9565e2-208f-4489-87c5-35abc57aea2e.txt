The McManager sucks.  (he wouldn't run his store Safeway card for me!)

The debit/credit card swipers suck! (they don't fit in their holders and they must use a freakin' dialup modem they are so God Damn slow)

They once completely ran out of MILK!

Their change machine was down for well over a week!

I swear to God, if  there were any alternative in the vicinity I'd GLADLY pay twice the price to shop there! 

Revamped store is nice to look at, shitty to shop at!  

Now with free Wi-Fi! 

EAT ME!
