I can't believe this place has that many stars! I trusted these reviews, as I am new to Arizona. This place is mediocre at best. 
The food isn't good. At all. 
The appetizers are like the ones you'd get out of the freezer section from the grocery store, except not as good. 
The Caesar salad was horrible. Even the loaded baked potato was bland! How does that even happen?! 
I will never go back, and I suggest you think twice before trying this place.
