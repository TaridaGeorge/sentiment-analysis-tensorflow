OK, so the staff at the Scottsdale boutique is nice enough.  Not snooty.  But not very knowldgeable either.  The problem is, though, with Cartier.  I don't know how they could screw up a simple engraving on the back of a watch but they did.  They also did it slowly, over several weeks, well, actually months.  So after a Tank ring, a pav√© wedding band and a solitaire, the watch was the last item we bought from Cartier.  It's not like it's good value anyway.  Their diamond are ordinary, their watches have ETA movements (most).
