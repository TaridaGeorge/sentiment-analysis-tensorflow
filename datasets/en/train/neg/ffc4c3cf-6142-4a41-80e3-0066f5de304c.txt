I used to really love this place and came often and would have given 4 stars. I forgave the horribly unkempt entrance that is liken a Van Buren back alley because they had terrific food and drink specials all the time. But unfortunately all good things must come to an end and this place is no exception.The quality of sushi has taken a nose dive, and the service is borderline abusive. On our last visit I was going to speak to the manager but realized she was too busy giving a server a back rub at the sushi counter. Shame on you Sakitini.
