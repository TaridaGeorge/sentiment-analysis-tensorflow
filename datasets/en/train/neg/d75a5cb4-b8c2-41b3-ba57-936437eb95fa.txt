Horrible.
On 2 separate occasions I tried to order food from my room at the Biltmore.  BIG MISTAKE.

I tried to order a burger but was told they have NO HOT FOOD available at 11pm.  I tried to order a chicken quesadilla at 2:00am but was told they have NO HOT FOOD available.  I asked how long it wold take to make hot food and they said 20min, but when I called back 20 min later, they said 25 - 30 min.  

Please note, the Late Night dining menu says food will be available from 11pm - 5am.  This is a complete LIE, there is no food available during these hours. 

I will never stay here again, nor will I recommend anyone I know to this hotel.  Stale, outdated, very far from parking, inconsiderate, unhelpful employees, and worse.
