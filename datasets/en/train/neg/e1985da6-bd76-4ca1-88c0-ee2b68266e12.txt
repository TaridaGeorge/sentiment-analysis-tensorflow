I have been a member for several years.  I don't understand why they can't invest in new equipment.  I went to the Moon Valley location today, and it was 10 times better. Moon Valley has all new equipment and each machine has its own tv monitor.  Paradise Valley is close to my house but I don't think I will be going to that one anymore.
