Party of five clearly overpowered cooks ability.  Three cheeseburgers and two orders of wings being the satuerday night special should not have taken 40 minutes to get.  



From our seats we could see our wings sit in the basket above the fryer fully cooked for ten minutes before getting sauce.  Our medium bugers were cooked to an overly well state of dryness that even cheese could not help.   The food servers were pleasant and apologetic about the time it took to get our food but the manager glaring at our children from the door to the betting room made us feel unwelcome.  We will certainly think twice about spending another fifty in this hole
