Restaurant seems kinda dingy inside, and some of the surfaces did not look like they had been cleaned in a long, long time. Samurai Sam's, I wanted to love you, as I miss good Teriyaki places in Phoenix (they are everywhere in Seattle, literally 30 within 5 miles of my old house). But no such luck, the steak teriyaki is chewy and has a funky  taste, and the chicken is nothing special, fairly dry, in an overly-sweet teriyaki sauce. Nothing seemed fresh at all, and based on the speed with which it was served, I doubt it was. For what you pay, you don't get a lot of chicken/steak, and mostly it's just a bowl of rice. Won't be back- The lack of cleanliness I could accept, but subpar teriyaki for a high price I simply cannot abide.
