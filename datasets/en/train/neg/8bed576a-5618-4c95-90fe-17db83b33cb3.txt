If there weren't tv's, chairs, and tables, this place would get one star...

The food is beyond awful.. t really is.. Seems like the burger was microwaved...

The prices are a joke for what you get...

I understand it is in an airport, but give me a break.

The service was the worst of all.... It seemed like the waitress was annoyed when we asked for the price of drinks because it wasn't listed on the menu...

We won't be back...

Garbage place...
