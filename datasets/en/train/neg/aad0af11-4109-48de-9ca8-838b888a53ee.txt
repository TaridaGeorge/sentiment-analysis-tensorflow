Disappointed because I wanted to send a gift to my Mother and Grandmother for Mother's Day.  Tried to order two gift tins of Medjool Dates on the website but unfortunately the website was not functioning properly.  No big deal, I will give them a call, which I did....  During business hours, but got an answering machine.  Left a message that I wanted to place an order.  Nobody returned the call.  I guess they already have all the business they need.
