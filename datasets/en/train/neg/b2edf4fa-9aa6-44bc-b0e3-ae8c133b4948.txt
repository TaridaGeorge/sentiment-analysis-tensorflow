This Yelp is for the Oishisa Sushi spot . Today I purchased Spicy Mango Roll with tuna I thought it might be a nice treat for lunch but it turned out to be a possible EARLY DEATH SENTENCE because the tuna was SPOILED so I had to spit it out .

BLEEP YOU Oishisa BLEEP YOU!

Bleeping Wally Mart Quality BLEEP YOU!!!!!!!!

and I called them to let them know
