This place is an absolute dive, I thought it would have been better from other reviews. Zia Records doesn't really have anything exclusive or exciting that will make me tolerate the ambience of the store. The prices aren't really competitive either, and some of the jewel cases were cracked and broken. I wanted to find some CD singles, I only found one and it wasn't in great condition and they wanted $7.99 for it, yeah no. The store is also very tiny and crowded and the media selection is very poorly organized. 

Anyways, I'm done with record shops, I haven't found any around that offer merchandise that you're only otherwise able to find online. As much as I would love to purchase music in person, I think I'll stick to Amazon and eBay.
