The worst! icky! 
I stopped by for lunch on a Friday afternoon. Ordered General Chicken "for here." They brought it to my table all packaged up and when I told her I was eating "in" I was informed they only serve lunch all packaged up (I guess its mainly a takeout place). . The chicken was gooey with no sauce to speak of. The rice was cold and hard in 2 scoops. No flavor at all.  The broccoli was so overcooked it was no longer green and smelled like poo. 
I'll never ever try again here. Definitely don't recommend.
