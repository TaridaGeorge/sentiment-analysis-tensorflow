This place is horrible. My bf and I stopped here because we had a groupon but it wasn't worth it. We watched as other people got seated before us even though our name was on the list. It took about 10-15 mins to get waited on and then almost an hour to get our food. Our waitress didn't stop to check on us once or apologize for the wait. The people next to us were being completely ignored by their waitress and waited an hour for food as well. It took forever as well to get the check. Maybe they should be better prepared for a Saturday morning. You couldn't pay me to come back here.
