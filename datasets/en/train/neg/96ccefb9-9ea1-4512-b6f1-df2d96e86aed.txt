No customer service.  I sent in a request 3 weeks before my husbands 40th birthday.  I waited a week, never got a response, so I called.  The assistant said I would have a call from the owner before the end of the day.  3 more phone calls and 2 emails later, still no return phone.  I would have at least appreciated a call saying they weren't interested.  Pathetic.
