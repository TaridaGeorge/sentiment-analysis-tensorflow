"Missed appointments and appointments cancelled without 2 BUSINESS days notice are subject to a cancellation fee of $50 per half hour of scheduled appointment time."
On Monday morning I canceled my daughter's appointment scheduled for Tuesday at 4pm and was told that I would have a $50 cancellation fee.  I was shocked, and said to the front staff lady, "You do realize we will not be coming back again don't you".  "That is fine" she said.  Life happens and things happen but there is no leeway or compassion with this office.   I received a bill in the mail the next day, before we had even missed our appointment time.  I have no doubt they had plenty of time to fill that appointment slot, but choose to bill me anyways.  I will take my business somewhere else.
