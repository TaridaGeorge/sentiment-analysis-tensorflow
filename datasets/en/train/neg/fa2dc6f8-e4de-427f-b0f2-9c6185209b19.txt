Sadly disappointed.  I've passed Lola's an uncountable number of times and each time thought I needed to try it.  I finally did tonight and was terribly disappointed.  For anyone that has been to Firefly in Las Vegas there is just no comparison.  The sangria was decent but nothing special and the tapas were just "so so."  The atmosphere was busy and our service sucked, but it was a very unique and cool environment.
