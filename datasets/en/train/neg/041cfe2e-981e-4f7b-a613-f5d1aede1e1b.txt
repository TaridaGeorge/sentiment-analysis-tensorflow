I hate this airport more than I could ever tell you. Sure, the wifi is free, and progress through the security checkpoint is brisk, but these are the only positive things I can say about PHX. The food sucks, the buses are confusing, getting out of here is a giant pain in the butt, and if you are a Continental customer you will be relegated to the Continental Ghetto (Terminal 2) which is by far the grossest, dingiest, most run-down of the bunch. The best part of coming to Sky Harbor is flying to another state.
