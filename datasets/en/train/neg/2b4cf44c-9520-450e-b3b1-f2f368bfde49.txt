I made a mistake, I made a mistake. I should be required to write this 100 times to remind myself how much I really don't like Pick Up Stix. I was desperate and hungry. I made a mistake.

While the lunch special PRICE is good the food is not. The beef with broccoli should be called beef with broccoli and a cup of sugar. It's WAY too sweet. The fried rice is bland as was the egg roll. 

Hey, there was one good thing they had free refills on soda. WOO-HOO! 

If you're really, really hungry and there's nothing else open you'd be better off eating a piece of stale bread.
