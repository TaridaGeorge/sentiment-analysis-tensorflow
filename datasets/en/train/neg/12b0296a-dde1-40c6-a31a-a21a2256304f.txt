This store NEVER has what I'm looking for (hiking pants, baseball cap, sports jersey, any type of college or professional team gear (I think they just have ASU stuff)etc.), everything looks picked over as if I have just missed the motherload of all sales on sporting schtuff. 

I have tried to give them business on 4 separate occasions and always leave empty handed.  

Another turnoff is that the people lurking around the inside and outside of the store kinda creep me out. It's almost like a Cabela's (they sell firearms, hunting knives, and whatnot) but lame.  Sorry, but I won't be back.
