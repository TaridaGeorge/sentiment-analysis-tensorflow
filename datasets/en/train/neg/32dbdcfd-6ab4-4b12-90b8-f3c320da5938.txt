Definitely not one of the better Bliss locations.  Rude staff, tiny lounge, there was no shampoo, no mouthwash, no lotion ....the steam room didn't work. 

When I asked staff why there was no product she said "You need to pump really hard".  I said "I did pump -very hard".  SHe said "oh well we're working on replacing those pumps".  

The excuse for the steam room not working, according to the staff member was that "sometimes it gets over heated".  

My massage was mediocre at best.  

If you're going to visit a spa in Arizona, visit Sanctuary or Royal Palms.  Bliss Spa is only worth visiting in LA, London or NYC.
