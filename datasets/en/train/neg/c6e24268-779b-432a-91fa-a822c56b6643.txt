I absolutely love all ice cream and yogurt, so I was surprised to find out that Mojo didn't pass my standards. 
I selected their smallest sundae cup (16 oz) and a few toppings and the cost of my sundae was $7.19. This cost more than my lunches at five guys, fatburger, and Blondie's. 

Not only did I find it to be overpriced, but it also wasn't that great. They only offer two sizes of sundae cups and a smoothie cup. The Customer makes their own yogurt and the sales staff doesn't offer suggestions. 
With two ice cream (they also offer yogurt) shops down the block with the cost being no more than $4 for just about any treat, I will be surprised to see how long Mojo lasts. I will not be giving 
Mojo another try and I would highly recommended the other two shops over Mojo any day.
