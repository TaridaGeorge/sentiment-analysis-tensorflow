The mgr/driver, was very dishonest and said the mgr. wasn't even there..she was the person that brought the flowers and the  person on the phone.......  after flowers delivered for my birthday from my daughter, our complaint was of no concern to her and was not willing to do anything to make it right.  The mgr. decided to reconsider after a day and 1/2, after being very rude and dishonest.   Thank you but a little too late!  I will not do business here and do not recommend.
