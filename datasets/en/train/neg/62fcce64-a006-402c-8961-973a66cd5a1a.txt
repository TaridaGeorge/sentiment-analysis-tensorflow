OMG!!  So this place is under new owners and this place SUCKS now!!  Ever since the new owners bought it this place has gone to HELL!  The food is frozen and not freshly cooked like it used to be.

We used to go here for $2 breakfast every Sat and Sun morning.  Our favorite bartender Tim is gone and our favorite cook is gone and our favorite waitress is gone and this place just sucks egg shells now!!

The owner thinks he can cook, so what does he do??? He puts the cook out on the floor to be a server!! WTH?!?  So bad for business.

Truly wish the previous owners would come back.
