pricy, and kind of unclean. I ordered a las vegas roll and some other shit, he reached in the fridge, right in front of me..pulled out a premade roll, dolloped some shit on it and handed it to me. I've waited longer for a fucking hamburger at mcdonalds..The seared tuna I ordered was also seared in advance. I asked the guy about it, and he said: "We make like 500 a day." I replied "how many do you think they make in japan?"..disappointing, lazy, and super gamey tasting shit. Oh, and ask me like ten more times if I want to join your fucking birthday club.
