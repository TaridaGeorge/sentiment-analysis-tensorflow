Eek! No way! This Fry's is not a place you want to hang around at after dark. During the Summer months, the homeless sit under the shadows of the building by the entrance sipping RC Colas and eyeing the customers, and Fry's doesn't do anything about it. Sure, the prices here are cheap, but you feel dirty just walking in the door. Try Bashes down on Osborn. Even that's less ghetto than this place. You'd think with the light rail being walking distance from the storefront that they'd kick it up a bit, but no. :(
