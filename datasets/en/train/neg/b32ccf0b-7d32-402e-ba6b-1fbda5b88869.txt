Stay FAR AWAY from this place.  Complete scammers.  My girlfriend brought here car in with a slow starting problem and said she thought it may be the starter.  Without running the simple diagnostic on it to confirm this was the problem, they replaced a perfectly good starter ($550 with labor)--it was only then that they proceeded to tell her that the battery was the real problem.  I asked the manager afterwards why they would not check the starter (which literally takes 5 seconds) and said he just does what the customer asks for and was obviously unwilling to refund any portion of the unnecessary work.  So unless you (or your wife, daughter, etc) are a licensed mechanic, do not use this garage.

COMPLETE AND TOTAL SCAM ARTISTS.  You would be better off taking your vehicle literally anywhere else.
