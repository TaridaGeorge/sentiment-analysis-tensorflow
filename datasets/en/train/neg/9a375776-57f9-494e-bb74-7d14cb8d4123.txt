To be fair I only tried this place once for lunch, so maybe this place isn't that bad. But here's my review...the only good thing about this place was our very lovely, outgoing, attentive server. They were playing children choir christmas songs (eek!!) on full blast! (so I couldn't even drown it out with my chewing or conversation) They only had 3 very short buffet serving tables. Most of the dishes were over cooked and the quality of the meats were very low. (more fat than meat) So I ended up only eating the only thing that I could enjoy which was the fresh cantaloupe  fruit and sauteed mushroom and cucumber dish. :(
