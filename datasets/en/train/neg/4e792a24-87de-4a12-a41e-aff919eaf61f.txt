Well, I've had good dining experiences at this location before, but unfortunately I embarrassed myself by recommending it to a friend who attempted to dine there last night. I say "attempted," because she was ignored by the rude wait staff, and ended up leaving after 50 minutes without any service. This is completely unacceptable, Sushi Ken was busy at the time, the level of staffing was supposedly adequate, but apparently it was Asians-only night because those were the only people the staff were serving. Now Sushi Ken will be deprived of not only my friends business, but mine and that of my entire family as well.
