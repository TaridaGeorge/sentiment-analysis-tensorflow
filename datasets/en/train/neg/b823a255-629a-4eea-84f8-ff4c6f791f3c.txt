Why oh why is it so hard to find good Chinese food in this town?  The two behind the counter at this place are Chinese - please don't tell me you eat the garbage that you serve to the masses in Phoenix as Chinese food.

I should have read the previous review because I had a simple beef with vegetables (how could that be screwed up?)  Hardly any beef, the veggies were all previously frozen.  The pork fried rice smelled like rotten fish.  The pork is cut into tiny pieces and are extremely fatty - I'm not even sure it's pork.  I did see a dead cat not far from the front door, maybe he will be on tonight's special menu?

Wahsun is not too far down 19th Ave - GO THERE INSTEAD, this place SUCKS!
