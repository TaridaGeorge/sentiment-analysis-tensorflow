Purchased two pairs of glasses for my son and picked them up today.  I would never pay their prices if they weren't on sale.  They are 2 - 3 times as expensive as other places.  

By biggest issue is their terrible lack of service.  When I picked out the glasses and paid it took over 20 minutes to be helped.  I asked if they were just busy today and their employee said, "No.  It is actually a little slow."  I couldn't believe it since there several of us waiting to be helped.  

Tonight was no different.  It took 20 minutes of standing in line to simply pick up the glasses.  Like last time, there were only two employees working.  I won't be coming back.
