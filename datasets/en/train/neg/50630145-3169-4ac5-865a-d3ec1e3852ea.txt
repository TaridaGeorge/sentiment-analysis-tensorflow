Drive thru order taker refused to change my drink size, said it only comes in large. Ummm, what??? In retaliation, when I was given my large drink the lid was not on all the way so it spilled all over my car. Every time I come here there is some problem, usually with the 2nd window not the 1st. Drive the few extra miles and go to the Taco Bell on Cave Creek and Bell.
