What a waste!  If I were a red-neck yahoo, I'm sure I actually would have gotten some service here.  Although I was in the market for a kayak and other goodies, it was IMPOSSIBLE to get anyone to help.  After searching the store to try and get someone to ask my questions, you could all but see them all but roll their eyes as I asked questions.  It was like PULLING TEETH to get any help.  I wasn't going to comment until I went to Dick's Sporting Goods and had the opposite experience.  I WILL NEVER GO TO CABELA's again!  A complete waste of my time.
