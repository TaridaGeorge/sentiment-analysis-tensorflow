I just had my car in for a auto accident during the visit the shop broke the ignition on the car. They are taking no responsibility and said it was already broken they had the car for a week, if it was already broken how were they able to stop and start the car that whole week! The repairs are going to run more than 600 and they will not even help pay for half. Don't take your car here it was their location on cave creek and hatcher!
