The worst fish & chips ever!!!! Do not eat at this place. For the quality of the food, it's way over priced. I won't even eat there for free. Everything taste frozen and nasty. It's better to buy the frozen fish sticks and fries at your local grocery store and just fry them up yourself and it'll still taste better than this place. Arghhh!
