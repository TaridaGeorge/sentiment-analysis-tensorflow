Disappointed-dont waste your time at this factory- like the past review stated. I hate going to the doctor-as most. The juvenile (just out of school ?) smart ass dr  B barely looked at my ear infection issue, but constantly smirked and made mocking remarks, harrassing. No communication skills, no acknowldgement, or anything, he just kept saying how professional he is!  Pathetic.
