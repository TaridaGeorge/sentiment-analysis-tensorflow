Customer service at this location is atrocious. After a work out session my work out partner and I were stopped and questioned by a manager with headphones, t-shirt and shorts at the front desk regarding whether or not my partner (we are both members) was training me. He was aggressive and we both felt quite embarrassed. We asked to have the conversation in his office since there were members coming in and out of the club. He refused. We have since canceled our membership. In addition the club is dirty. There was a banana peel by the squat racks for nearly 2 weeks. The women's bathroom has not been cleaned in a long, long, long time. The staff is usually talking and texting at the front desk. Poor customer service usually stems from bad management and lack of accountability. Avoid this gym if you can.
