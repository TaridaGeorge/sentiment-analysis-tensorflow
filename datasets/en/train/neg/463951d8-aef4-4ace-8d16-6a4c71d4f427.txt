I called here since my son wanted a particular frisbee before leaving for Europe.  I stated exactly what is was i needed and the employee said yes for sure they had it.  I re-emphasized that my son was specific, and again he said yes.  We drive 20 minutes only to be rather rudely told they don't have the one we needed.  Train your employees and don't be rude to my just because you are idiots.
