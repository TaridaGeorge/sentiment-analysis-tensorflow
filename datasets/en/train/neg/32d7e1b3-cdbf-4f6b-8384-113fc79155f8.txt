Zero stars!!!!  I love the food but had a huge incident where my life was threatened by another guest at this location and pretty much nothing was done. The group had a kid in full blown tantrum mode for over an hour. When we looked over and shook our heads we were then almost physically assaulted  and had a guy with a baby in hand threatening my life when I walked out.. Eeek!! The manager came to tell us not to be looking over and took a whole $10 off our bill and walked through the parking lot and never came back.. NICE... The owners feel he did everything he should have and plan on keeping him.. Sorry but no fundido is worth getting shot over.. Ill stick to Carlos O'Brians  where the food is great and you can actually count on the staff to take care of situations..
