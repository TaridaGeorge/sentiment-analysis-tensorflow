So much to say about this place.  The best thing about this place is the price.  $3 for a movie is awesome, but the cons outweigh the pros.  The theatre itself is disgusting.  The floors are always dirty and there are bugs in some of the theaters.  The popcorn is mediocre at the end of the night they bag up whatever is leftover and save it for the next day.  Its rarely ever fresh.  The candy is stale and the soda machine is filthy.  Also the staff are just an arrogant bunch of kids.  Will NOT be returning.
