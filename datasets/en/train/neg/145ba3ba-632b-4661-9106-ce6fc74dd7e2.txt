Beware of this place! 

They will definitely overcharge you and try to sell you repairs that are not needed.  They tried to charge me $1,700 for something that I later found through another source that literally cost me $30 to repair.  To add insult to injury I would have had to go back because they didn't even find the culprit that was causing the issue.  Beware of these con men.  They will sound credible through the use of technical jargon to gain your CONfidence.  They get you with $20 dollar oil changes and then here they come with a laundry list of repairs that, for the most part, are not necessary.
