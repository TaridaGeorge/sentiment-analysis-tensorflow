Just tried TR with the family - again.  My Ribeye came out too rare, made several cuts to find a good piece. They took it back to "refire". About 10min later I was given all my pieces back. I would like to say it was good, but looked too much like burnt dog food, too scared to try. I asked to have the meal removed and the waitress asked what was wrong with it. I explained that it did not look too appetitising and her comment was "isn't it the way you cut it up or did we do that." After 15min my waiter came back with the check saying my manager took care of my meal.  Would have been nice to see this manager before we left. Total time in the restaurant was 1.5 hours.
