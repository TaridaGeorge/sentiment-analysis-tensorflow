Horrible, horrible, horrible, service. Our waitress didn't do anything. Another waitress took down and brought our drinks, took our order and a different waiter brought us our food. If it had been busy , I wouldn't be so harsh. It was DEAD. Our actually waitress stood at the bar (right in front of us) and talked to the bartender. When we complained about our meal to her, she responded basically telling us it's not her job to prepare the food. At the end of our meal she was more than happy to bring us our check and not even ask if we needed anything else. I've been recommending to all my friends to go up the street to RnR - what a disappointment.
