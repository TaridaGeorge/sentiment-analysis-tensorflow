Awful. Unless you feel like catching something worse than what you came in with I suggest you avoid here. 

I believe this is how you figure out the wait time:
Walk in... Look around. 
Minutes with employee (x) + 30 
Number of people waiting (y) plus 15 - the time it takes for "vitals"
+
2.2 hours
=
eternity when your hacking up your lungs, have a fever & are trying to avoid an ER copayment.
