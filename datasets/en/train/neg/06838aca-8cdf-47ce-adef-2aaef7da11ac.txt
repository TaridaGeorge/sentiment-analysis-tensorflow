To be fair, we went to Matt's based on the raveswe read on various sources.  Like the emperpr's new clothes, we fail to see what the hubbub is all about. I recently went to breakfast there and order a cheese omelet with home fries and wnet away hungry and very disappointed.  The home fries were mostly uncooked and badly seasoned,  The eggs were hard and disappointing and the toast was hard and cold.  This was very unsatisfactory and it is certain that Matt's Breakfast lives off its laurels and not the food.
