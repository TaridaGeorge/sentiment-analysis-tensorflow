Reservation for 2 at 8:00 PM, showed up at 7:50. Waited until 8:35 to be seated. Had 2 very good drinks, and they were comped because our table still wasnt ready on time. Ordered salad, King Crab legs, and Lobster tails at 8:40. Salad showed up 40 mins later, followed by the main course 15 mins later. The salad was "Ok", but the King Crab was horrible, and the Lobster Tail was over cooked. Very disapointed in the food quality. We expected Sea food a little better than your local Red Lobster, but didnt find it here.
