Company kept my deposit, never gave me my product, I won a small claims court judgement and they still will not pay. Do not use. They are crooks.
In 2009 I ordered an Iron Door and metal inserts for my home. The Iron door was installed fine. Not great, but fine. The metal inserts never came. I was told over and over they were built, but waiting shipment in China. After 1yr, their contract says they will refund the cash depost. They stopped returning my calls. I filed in Small Claims Court in 2010 and won a judgement. They still refuse my calls and have not paid.
