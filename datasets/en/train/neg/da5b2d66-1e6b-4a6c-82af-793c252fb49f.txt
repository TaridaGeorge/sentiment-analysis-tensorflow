I like the way my review got flagged! If you don't like people giving your business bad reviews, do better business. The people here are rude and it's not a nice salon atmosphere. No one wants to pay money and let someone mess with their hair when they've been treated like crap. Maybe you can squeeze that into your business model and you wont have so many issues.
