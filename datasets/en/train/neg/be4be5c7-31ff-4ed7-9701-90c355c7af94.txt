Rude managers combined with a shabby hotel in a sketchy neighborhood.  Apparently these folks haven't realized that we're in a recession and if they want to keep their business they need to cater to customers instead of being rude to them. The manager was one of the rudest employees I have EVER encountered.  I wouldn't stay here again if you paid me.
