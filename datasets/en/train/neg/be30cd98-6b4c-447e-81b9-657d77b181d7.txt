Sunday afternoon for "brunch." Too noisy to carry on any type of conversation. Slow service. My food was ordinary, and the portion looked more like a side dish. Offensively small and therefore very overpriced. I couldn't wait to get out of there. I see several good reviews, but I cannot understand what all the fuss is about.
