Oh NO! So I have passed this place nearly two dozen times and every time I look inside the place is DEAD!! I wonder to myself WTF; How does this place stay open? Now, I love Chicken. I could eat Japanese, Chinese and Hawaiin everyday if it is grilled or sauteed. Not fried. So, I get done training and I decide Im going to give this graveyard a try. I walk in, no smell! I look around, No customers. I walk up to the counter and the only thing I can hear is the air vent. Fucking Crickets I tell you. So So quiet. I knew this was going to be bad. And I'm going to cut to the end here....... It was the worst I have ever had. The chicken was not fresh, there was very little flavor and the kicker...... Diaherhea (spelling) and the chills..... ENOUGH SAID!!
