Haha at Buca. 

Yeah, you have an array of typical dishes to choose from, but considering these are quite, SIMPLE, Buca still cannot master them. 

Thought the chopped salad would be awesome...but, I should have 
known, they used machetes to chop this dish, and then served us the bottom of the bulk, which means, sweaty, liquefied salad. Also, I don't mind having to order a 'side' of pasta, but I'm just so flummoxed by the choices: spaghetti with marinara? or fettucine alfredo?...choices, choices, choices! I mean, these two just pair so well with the porchetta rustica :(sarcasm): 
Apple crostata= standard apple pie. No warm apples, flaky crust, as falsely advertised on the menu. 

I should have learned from my first experience here. 

Good as a soup line!
