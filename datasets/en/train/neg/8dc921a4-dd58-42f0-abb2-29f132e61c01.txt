Who can resist Peach Cobbler at the farmers market? Not me!

They really sold me on the ingredients used, No eggs, No Butter, No Milk, No Animal products for that matter, unless you count the honey.

According to the video on their website "Grampy" used butter and half and half in his cobblers, so either they aren't going by the original recipe like they say or they were lying to me?? 

Who knows, but what I do know is this was the worst cobbler I've ever had. 
I literally threw it in the garbage after one bite. 
SO very disappointed!  And I'm pretty sure those were canned peaches too, blech!
