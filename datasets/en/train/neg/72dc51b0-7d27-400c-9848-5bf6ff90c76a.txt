Maybe there was only one person working at the kitchen this morning and this was the reason I got yesterday's potatoes for breakfast.. Maybe all the employees partied hard last night and they found it too hard to clean the tables, pick up trash from the floor and overall "make it all work", maybe the manager was depressed and he had some cruel cartoons (intended for children) running on TV,  in a place with NO children. Maybe... Maybe I will just choose a different place for Sunday breakfast next week.
