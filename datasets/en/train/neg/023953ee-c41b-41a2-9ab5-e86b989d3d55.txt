5 star name.....1 star facility.

Bathrooms...microscopic
Pool...not relaxing ....kids everwhere (no adult only pool like most resorts in phoenix)

I think you either spend the bucks for the Suites with their own pools, book at the spa so you can use those facilities...or just 
Go to the intercontinental down the street...
