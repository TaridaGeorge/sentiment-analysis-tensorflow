Above the door when you enter it says "you will find truth inside" and the truth is..... Its awful at kazimierz.

Made reservations for 8 at Peters food spot Cowboy Ciao. Also put down my creditcard to hold a spot for 8 at kazimierz for nye. Dinner was great, I dropped a grand on it (overpriced for atmosphere) walked into kazimierz where the owner Peter and the bouncer treated us like we were here to wash the windows. Very very rude owner and bouncer. they lost our name off the list then stuck us in a waiting area by the front and tried to pawn it off as our intended reserved private table. No dice Kaz, we are off to another bar... Ps the comped champaign was flat. Big let down. Big attitude.
