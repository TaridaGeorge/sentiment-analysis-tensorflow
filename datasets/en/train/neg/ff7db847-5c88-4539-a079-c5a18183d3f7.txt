update; their food effing sucks... so far i've tried the chicken salad with pita bread and the grilled chicken salad, both were pre-made sitting in a cooler... the chicken salad had about as much flavor as my vitamins i take everyday and the grilled chicken on my salad was tough and unpleasant... i will not get another 9 dollar peice of crap meal here ever again.
