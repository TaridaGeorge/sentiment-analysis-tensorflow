We were very disappointed in our sandwiches.  We both ordered the turkey on sourdough and a caesar salad.  The bread actually appeared to be just white bread.  It didn't taste like sourdough nor did it have any unique texture or thickness to it....it was just sliced white bread with a little cold cut style sliced turkey on it!!  Very disappointed!  The sandwich was nothing special at all.  And the salads were mediocre in flavor and small in size.  Not worth going back to this Paradise Bakery.
