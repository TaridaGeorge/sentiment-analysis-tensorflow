Stopped in for a Bloody Mary on Sunday because Hazelwood's and Zipps were jam-packed. The neon sign on the place says "Darwin's" but apparently is known as "Famous Wings."

Here's a "joke" from the bartender:

"What's the worse thing about being a Packers fan?

Telling your dad you're gay."

Bash Packers' fans all you want, but "gay" is not a synonym for "stupid."

Food was sampled and left mostly uneaten. Skip it!
