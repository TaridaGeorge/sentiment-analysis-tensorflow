Went there for lunch around 1:15, not expecting it to take 25 minutes for a salad. Sadly, this place is under staffed and lacking everything needed to be a good lunch spot. I DON'T recommend it. If you want a good sandwich place, drive down the street to Dilly's Deli or any of the other sandwich shops in Tempe, your wallet, your time, and your stomach will thank you.
