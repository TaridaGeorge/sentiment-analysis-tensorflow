I love their food but DO NOT come to the Scottsdale location.  I phoned in my order ahead to beat the lunch rush, I get there not busy i though cool.  I walk up to the counter, a girl comes up to counter looks at me don't say anything to me so I was like I'm here for an pick up order, she said "um hum" and tell me my total, turn around grabs my togo order.  I paid her, she gaves me my changes tells me there is fork over there, turns around and go into the kitchen..... Not a "How are You" not a "thank you" Not "have a nice day"  NOTHING.....  RUDE.    On top of that my meat was soo dry.  Never, never would I go back to this place again.... 
BAD Service,  BAD FOOD!!
