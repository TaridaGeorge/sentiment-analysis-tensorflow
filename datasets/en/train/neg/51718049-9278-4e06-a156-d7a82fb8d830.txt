We were greeted at the door by two lovely ladies. The place was not busy yet they said that it would be a 45 min wait to be seated out side

So we took the first available

15 minutes later after I spoke to the bartender and asked him why the wait for a table outside was 45 minutes yet no one is here. We were seated


Food options seemed interesting but NOT for the price
Atmosphere is great

If u want a quiet spot wait to go to this place when construction is done in downtown because they are building a Tilted Kilt pub upstairs and it was nosier then the people eating dinner 

 If u are a very wealthy person (your salary is more then 100,000 by yourself) u will be able to afford eating and drinking here
