I work here and I am so tired of getting cussed out by customers on a regular basis. I've been threatened, cussed at, had things thrown at me, been called every name in the book, and just all around verbally abused by the customers.   You all do realize that I am just  doing what I am told to do? And that I am not in charge of the company, I take my paycheck home and pay for my school so I won't ever have to work in banking again.  Think before your mean to a 21 year old girl who has never done anything to you.
