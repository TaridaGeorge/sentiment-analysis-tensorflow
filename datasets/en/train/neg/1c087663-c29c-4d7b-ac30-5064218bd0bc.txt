I used to go here about 10 yrs ago. Had a couple of bad experiences.  Thought I'd give them another try.  Placed my order requesting to add an egg and bacon extra crisp.  Only 3 other tables seated.  Got my order..missing egg. Pancakes tasted frozen and thawed.  Took awhile to get our order.  Wanted bacon 'burnt'.  It seemed to have been microwaved.  Only thing that I ate was the milk.  Waitress appologized. She took off the bill the only thing that was good...The Milk!  No mas. Sorry.
