I love TJ Maxx but after my wife stepped on a piece of glass and was bleeding through her sandal I was disappointed . There was glass all over the ground by the candles.  I understand accidents happen ok. But, we went in 2 weeks later and saw glass all over the floor AGAIN.  We did are shopping and we looked back before we left and it was still there just swept to the side.  WOW!
