I visited last night w/ my family and WILL NOT ever return nor make a positive recomendation.  The hostess was exceptionally rude commenting on our attire, "Have you seen the ones that just walked in?" even though were dressed similarly to other patrons.

The food was below average and the prices high.  I had the shrimp scampi and left it unfinished as it tasted like it was cooked in bathroom cleaner.  There are certainly other seafood places with better quality service and food for less expensive, definitley not worth the $$$.

Our table server was pleasant and professional, much more than I can say for the hostess.  Do not waste your time or $$$ there.
