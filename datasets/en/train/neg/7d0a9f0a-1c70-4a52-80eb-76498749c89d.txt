The boyfriend and I thought we'd check out the North Central farmer's market for a change this weekend.  We are also big fans of Short Leash so we saw the Epic truck and were all excited to give them a try.  On their very long list of options, not a single veggie dog.  Really?  How hard is it to put at least one veggie option on your menu, just seems like a poor business choice especially since because I couldn't eat there, you lost my carniverous boyfriend's business as well. Pull it together, Epic.

Edited to add - was contacted by the owner to let me know they do have veggie options but apparently they had a "streamlined menu" on Saturday.  Bummer, would have liked to give them a try.
