A friend and I went to the Langley's Country Market and thought the store was kind of cute but they carry items that you can get up the road for cheaper.  The thing that really got me was their "petting zoo".  It had a goat, sheep and a chicken coop.  Look at the pictures posted on here.  The chickens were literally standing in (standing) water and their own feces.  The sheep and the goat had nowhere to stand because there was standing water in about 90% of the fenced off area that they had.  Oh...did I mention that the sheep and goat had absolutely NO shelter and were out in the blazing sun?!  They have a sign that reads "Fresh Market"....one of the things they sell are "fresh eggs".  Not sure if the eggs are coming from their chickens but regardless, I would not buy anything from this place!
