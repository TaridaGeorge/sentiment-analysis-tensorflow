I have gone here off and on for about 2 years and am finished with these doctors.  There office staff are really indifferent and the doctors are basically the same.  I have had a problem for over 2 months and have been in 4 times, they do not call you back with test results, unless there is a problem and you are not allowed to speak to the doctor over the phone at all.  I waited over a week for a test result and until I made an appt. no  one knew where it was. I rarely go to the doctors but this is THE worst I have ever gone to in my 46 years..
