Don't bother, had breakfast here just last week.  Worst food i have ever had.  They get one star for the hot chocolate.  Ordered the two egg breakfast, pretty standard fare, but ordered my eggs over medium, they where served way undercooked, when i picked up a piece of egg with my fork you could see the uncooked slime hanging off the fork.  The potatoes with the dish where also undercooked and hard. I did tell the waiter and the person busing tables.  How can this place have such glowing reviews? I would rather eat at the Good Egg.
