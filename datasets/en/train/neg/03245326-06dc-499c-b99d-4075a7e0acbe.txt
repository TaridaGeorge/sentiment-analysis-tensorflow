Most disgusting restaurant experience thus far! My husband ordered me a salad, I didn't finish it so he finished it up for me. At the last bite he asked me if I was chewing gum. No, I wasn't as he pulls out a chewed up piece of gum!!!! 

Someone on staff spat their gum out in the salad and it ended up in my husband's mouth!! 

DISGUSTING!! DON'T"T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY, PASS IT ON BY!!
