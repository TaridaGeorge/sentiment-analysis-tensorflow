I HATE this Fry's location!

This location NEVER has enough cashiers on duty. I don't care if a cashier has to stand there picking their nose for five minutes until the next wave of customers come flocking with full carts, just have those empty registers manned!

Check-out is way too chaotic for me here, too many people and not enough check-out lanes. Even the self check-out is busy. I usually go on a weekday morning...it's too much like the Costco at Arrowhead. I hate shopping when it's a hassle to check out.

Fry's probably doesn't care why I don't shop here and WHY I would prefer to spend my money at a different grocer. So what, right?

At least the restrooms are pretty clean.
