I have been working in this area of 24th st and Camelback for months and see the signs for a farmers market every wednesday.  I have been wanting to check it out and I finally got to it today.  I have to say I was more than disappointed.  I honestly think that they buy their produce at safeway prior to setting up at 10am on Wednesdays.  Nothing appeared to be local and everything was overpriced.  The two "farmers"  that were working the one produce stand looked like made up "characters" of what people expect farmers to look like.

The bakery that has a table set up was severely overpriced, charging $6 for a loaf of bread.  Save your time and money folks! I am going to check out the downtowm market in hopes for better quality and LOCAL produce!
