Was considering stopping at this place for a beer when I saw the clientele - not my type of bar. 

Not to Management why the 1 star - maybe you should strongly suggest to your bikers to consider going just a little bit slower through the parking lot. There's a kids amusement park, Goodwill and some other businesses who share the same parking lot. These bikers speed through without and care and will eventually hit someone!
