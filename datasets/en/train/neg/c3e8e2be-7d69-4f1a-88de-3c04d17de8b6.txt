Dear Bouncers at Four Peaks,

So many people "judge a book by its cover"--and for good reason--the "cover" is the first impression that one gets of a business. At Four Peaks, you make for a terrible "cover" and I will not return until your attitude improves. Get off your high peaks. Until then, I'm off to buy a 40 of Bud Light at Circle K.

Kind regards,

Former Customer
