Pardon me while I vomit in my mouth. The smell and sight of the douchebags that roam this place like a herd of roided-out pitbulls will do that.

I've never come here on my own accord. I've always been forced to go with groups of people. I guess some of my friends have bad judgement. 

I had dinner here once for a friend's birthday. The music was so loud that I couldn't hear the person next to me talk. Food was extremely sub par as well.

I guess it's pretty fun if you're looking to take a semi conscious Scottsdale skank home for the night. Or if you enjoy torturing yourself.

The only redeeming quality this place has is Saturday football games. It's a completely different (and more douche-free) atmosphere. But that still doesn't makeup for how shitty it really is.
