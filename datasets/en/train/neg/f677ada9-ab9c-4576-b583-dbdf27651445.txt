Stingray? Try STINKRAY! The food is not fresh, at least it doesn't taste like it. The taste is more like processed cafeteria food. Anyone remember Picadilly? The flies buzzing around the restaurant and landing/vomiting on our happy hour rolls was a perfect addition to our already nasty "treats". If you want real sushi that's fresh and fly-free, stay away from Stinkray! Lastly, if you're thirsty, you better pack your own water because all you're offerred is one glass!

Disappointment all the way around.
