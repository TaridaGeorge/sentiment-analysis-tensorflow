was supposed to be best new rest. in town???  waitress raved about the toro (fatty tuna sashimi) and how good it was. Ive had the real thing in japan and this was not even close. It was extremely fishy and didnt even appear to be toro.  It could have been regular maguro for all i know.  the crabonara (crab pasta) was also fishy.  Notice a theme?  cheese and meat appertizer was ok but i could make same thing for half the price at home. disappointed beyond belief
