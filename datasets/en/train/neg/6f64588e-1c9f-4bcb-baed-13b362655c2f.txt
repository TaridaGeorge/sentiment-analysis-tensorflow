This place had good yelp reviews so I was hopeful, but sorry the food is bad .   The passionfruit lemonade was good except a bit sweet, I added some water in it when I got home.   I got a fish taco, and a carne asada taco.  The fish taco was really fishy, and was like the bottom greyish parts of the fish near the tail sorta thing, and the carne asada I just didn't enjoy the seasoning.  I love cabbage in a taco, but not when it's real big and chunky i like it a fine mince.   If you want to eat a good burrito/taco go to the taco stand in front of charlie's (gay cowboy bar at 7th Ave and Camelback).
