Where are you people eating pizza and claiming this is the best you have tasted? Its bland with a tough crust. The sauce has no resemblance to an italian pizza taste. There wasnt 1 drop of oil anywhere to be found. Rosatis and Casanovas kill this pizza and they are not exceptional. Also, a brick oven can only do so much. A traditional pizza oven is the way to go. In a nutshell, this is over priced crappy pizza!
