Dirty glasses on the table that were fresh from the dish washer, water that tasted of day old coffee, "clean" coffee cups with wet stains in the bottom, seated at a dirty table, dirty flatware, flys everywhere, cold food and crappy service.

Any restaraunt can have a bad day, but this many things wrong all at once suggests deeper problems.

How can anyone actually like this place?!

Well, we will never go back and I suggest you think twice about going your self.
