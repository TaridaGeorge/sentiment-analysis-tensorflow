The experience was awful from beginning to end:

1.  No greeter upon arrival.
2.  Waited forever before order was taken.
3.  Waitress was short (What do you want?)
4.  Water glasses smelled like dirty dishwater.  When we told the waitress, she didn't even apologize.
5.  Waited 10 minutes before complimentary appetizers (heirloom tomatoes and homemade mozzarella was not very impressive) were brought out to distract us from the wait.
6.  A total of 30 min went by before our food came out.  
7.  Grilled beef tenderloin was overcooked.  Medium rare came out medium well.  

Couldn't get out fast enough.  Definitely overrated.
