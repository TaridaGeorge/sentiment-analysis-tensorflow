LIPSTICK ON A PIG. 
This is a renovated Hampton Inn and it shows it on every level. I have stayed at many Indigo properties and I'm shocked IHG Hotel Group would call this it's own.
Just like other reviews, the walls are thin with wallpaper pealing. Very little closet space and cheap damaged furniture.
Also, beware. This is a party hotel. I stayed three nights and slept maybe 10 hours total.
