hilarious! where did the screaming yellow  "....we reserve the right to add 15% gratuity to your bill....." signs go?  aka we know the service and dimsum sux, so we'll try and make money another way.  best dimsum in phoenix (pretty low standards for a desert community i guess)  luckily there's plenty of competition now in the east valley (hint: go 1 mi east, 1 mile  south) NW corner, get there before 11am on weekends or stand in line with the rest of the other asians.
