Wow. You've GOT to be kidding me.

I came in with a small amount of pictures--some 16x20 and some 8x10.

I had a simple goal--have them framed. Since they were beach themed, I wanted a white frame.

So you know what I did?

Instead of buying ONE $40 frame
I bought 4 $10 frames at Goodwill on a half off day and a $3 can of white spray paint. And yes, they all matched. Total = $23 versus $160
