Toscano's may be taking advantage of the apparent captive audience at Pebble Creek. My good friend & I enjoyed their patio over lunch but food was mediocre. Grilled beef, chicken & shrimp were nicely prepared but salad greens looked like supermarket to go, iceberg lettuce, salads. Yes, we do know our beefsteak tomatoes and they were not included in the salad as advertised. In truth, my girlfriend enjoyed the chicken cheese crisp and the ice coffee was quite good. Service was just above being ignored.
