cash only ($1.50 ATM fee). chain concept from Vietnam. "mass-produced" baguettes ready "every 30 minutes" are not worth the trip.

$2.25 10" bologna salami and vietnamese veggies. what do you expect for $2.25?! great value...
but i was hoping for better.
--rancid pickle
--rancid red onion
--american cheese: think "cheap brand that wishes it were kraft singles" -- yeah, it was BAD
--no oil in the house, no vinegar in the house. only mayo and mustard in the 0.02 oz packet.

lots of choices here...
ice cream, wings, sandwiches...
cheap, generic, flavored coffee syrups displayed like precious alcohol... WHAAT!?? maybe it's a cultural thing.

but all i wanted was a good baguette sandwich. what a shame!
PASS!
