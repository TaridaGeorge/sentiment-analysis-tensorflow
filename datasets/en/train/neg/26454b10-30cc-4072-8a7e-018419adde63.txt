Wow, what happened?  The place was great the first time around.  The upkeep is horrible.  My booth had a bad stench.  You know, that dirty rag smell.  The sushi is such low quality.  The food didn't look fresh at all.  I didn't even want to try the ice cream.  It was so messy.  I don't think I'll be coming back here again.
