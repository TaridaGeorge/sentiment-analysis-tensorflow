My mom and I decided to go here because she has always wanted to go there. So we go there there are 2 open tables. We wait about 15 minutes and no server ever acknowledged that we were there. Very rude people. We just got stared down by everyone and the servers. They wouldn't even look at us or anything. Very small place and very annoying place. We left and went to ihop and was greeted right away there. We will never try to go to farmers market again it was a waste of time.
