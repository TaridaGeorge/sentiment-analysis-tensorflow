For the price, this place sucked a LOT.  The beds were incredibly hard, and the pillows were incredibly small.  It was noisy in the rooms, so it was very difficult to sleep.  We stayed there for 3 nights, and the room service barely did anything.  The beds were made, but the used coffee cups and trash weren't even cleaned up.  The pool was one of the main reasons we chose this place, but the pool was closed for renovation, and the staff was pretty rude explaining that fact when we arrived.  Terrible all around.
