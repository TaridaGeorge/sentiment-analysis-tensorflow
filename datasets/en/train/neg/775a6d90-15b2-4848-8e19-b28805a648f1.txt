Came here for dinner with my wife.  Entered and there were about 10 college males inside having drinks.  We ordered a turkey sandwich and a roast beef sandwich.  Also ordered one piece of bruschetta.  The sandwich was not good.  The lettuce was old and wilted, the bacon seemed like it had been sitting way too long because it smelled funny and was not fresh.  We were told we could not choose between the chips and salad because they were out of chips.  We were told they get their fresh deliveries on Friday.  It was Thursday, so that explained why everything tasted old and nasty.  The bruschetta tasted like jam and bread.

I would not recommend to place for food.  It is very close to ASU so it might be geared toward young college students who do not appreciate good food and just go for the drinks.
