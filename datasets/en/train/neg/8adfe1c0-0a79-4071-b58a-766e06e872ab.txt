This terrible example of customer service continues to be terrible.
Even after the management was told about the bait and switch tactics of the bartender and lack of concern and condescension by the manager, they still refuse to acknowledge or deal with the issues. Clearly the basic customer service principle of "the customer is always right' is still not practiced at this bait and switch operation.
