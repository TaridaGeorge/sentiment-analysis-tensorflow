I know that Fry's has better prices than Safeway but I still hate this chain. They never have enough checkouts open. Its setup is annoying because they have everything scattered around the store making you go down almost every isle to get what you need. I know that they do that so  you will buy more. Just gets me pissed and I end up leaving and going to Safeway. I also can't stand all the pan handlers in the parking lot. Why is it that every time I go to any Fry's some jerk has to ram their cart into the side of my truck and no I am not taking up more than one spot and I always park at the back of the parking lot because I enjoy walking.
