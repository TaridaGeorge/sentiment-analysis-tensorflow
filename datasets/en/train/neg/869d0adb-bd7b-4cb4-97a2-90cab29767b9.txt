Went there for lunch, place was not packed at all. Had an hour for lunch, figured could have a good lunch across the street from work & not feel rushed. We ended up having to get to-go boxes for our food after 45 min. My order was missing rice that came with it. Not the biggest deal but really? Also took a while to get the check. I used to like this place, not anymore. Will go back for drinks, but this was my last time dining here
