Soooo not impressed!! I got the three meat platter to try a little of everything. While tender the turkey tasted like the pressed roll stuff you get for sandwiches at the deli and the brisket was bland. None of it tasted smoked or bbq'd. I also got some hotlink on the platter which tasted old and reheated. The loaded mashed potatoes tasted like dry and reconstituted potatoes. Call me spoiled but I have had better BBQ out of a Banquet Frozen Meal.
