CLOSED?!?  I swear this was just open last week.   I placed an order online and did not get a call back within 5 minutes per their online order confirmation. I figured they were just busy with the lunch rush so drove over anyway.    Dark, locked up, furniture removed.  Sadly the "NOW OPEN!" sign is still up.   Too bad.  Seemed like a good concept
