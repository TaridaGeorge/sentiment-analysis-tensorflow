I guess you could say that this place has the worst customer service I have ever seen. I am a server myself and this place was horrible. There were 4 server girls and only three tables in the entire place, but yet not one of them could break away from their conversation to seat us. so we sat ourselves, then once we were sitting, no one came up to us. we were there for 10 mins w/ no service, waters, or hi the entire time. If i was the manager i would fire every last one of those retarted servers. we got up and walked out and will never return again. this would be the second time it a has happened. Maybe the bleach they used on their hair seeped into their brains. Or maybe they tanned so much they are just permanently fried.
