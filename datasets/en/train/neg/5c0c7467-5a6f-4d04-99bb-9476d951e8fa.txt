Curry chicken dish was thin and tasted like a little bit of curry in hot water. Chicken was pre-cooked and dry. Spring rolls were ok. Dipping sauce was horrible. It didn't suit the dish at all. Service was difficult as the staff doesn't speak English very well. Also waiter insulted me but I'm sure he didn't mean to (a comment about my weight). Worst part was when I smelled cigarette smoking coming from the kitchen. One guy denied it, the other guy admitted it. Bad food, I won't go there again.
