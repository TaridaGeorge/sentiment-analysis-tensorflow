This place is characterized by rude service, okay food, and a generally callous attitude toward customers . Ideally, this place would suit those who are looking for an awful evening in a nice part of town!  If you are anything other than lily white, blondes preferred,   expect to wait an eternity for any service.  The waitress we were unlucky to get was indeed a RACIST.  She was downright belligerent and rude, behaving as if she was doing us a favor by even getting us food and drinks. We were a group of eight people and had a tab in the $400-500 range yet got lousy service.  The manager was not helpful either and his attitude was simply that the waitress is usually very good - this despite the fact that we complained that she was awful. I have been here twice and will NEVER GO HERE again.
