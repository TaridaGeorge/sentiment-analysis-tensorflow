Should have checked yelp before I stopped in.  The food looked edible enough from the outside.  I ordered a Kung Pao chicken from the rude staff.  Got it home, opened it up, and the smell was off and the chicken did not even look right.  I took one bite and had to immediately spit it back into the box, tasted almost rancid.  I am SURE I would have been sick had I actually consumed any of the food!!!!  Panda Express across the street seems like high end gourmet compared to this dump!  Avoid at all costs!!!
