Dear Mr. McGrath,

I recognize you are a talented award winning chef. I love the Roaring Fork. However, I am wholehaeartedly dissapointed in what you've done to Pischke's - its just not Pischke's anymore at all. Pischke's was a fun, friendly, unpretentious, comfort food joint. I loved hitting Pischke's for lunch after a NASTY hangover. The single BEST SALAD ON THE PLANET was the Blackened Cajun Ceaser Salad and now its gone. Old Pischke's would've gotten * * * * * five stars.

Now it's snobby and overpriced.

BOTTOM LINE: Bring back my salad or else!!
