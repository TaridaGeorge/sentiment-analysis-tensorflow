To be fair, I don't know which Novus Glass in Arizona is responsible BUT BEWARE, somehow they got my phone number, I have NEVER done any business with them and THEY CALL CONSTANTLY.  They don't leave a message and if you try to call back and leave a message, it says "The Mailbox is full."  I have answered and when there was a person on the line, asked and demanded that they take me OFF their calling list.  They won't stop.  I have contacted the Arizona Attorney General and reported them on the government's DO NOT CALL LIST website.
And EVEN IF I LIVED IN ARIZONA AND NEEDED WINDSHIELD GLASS, which I don't for either...I would never deal with them and their marketing scams.  
By the way...that's such a positive review the other person wrote...BECAUSE THE OTHER PERSON WORKS FOR NOVUS!
