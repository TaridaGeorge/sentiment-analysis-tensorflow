This place sounded awesome, and I am always up for champagne, unfortunately I have absolutely nothing to base this review off of. My husband & I stopped in today after some shopping around 4 pm, there was only 3 other parties there. The hostess sat us on the patio, we were super excited to try some different champagnes and the weather was just perfect. We waited for 10 minutes and nobody ever came over to our table. We waited ten more minutes and still nobody. We decided to get up and leave and on our way out, absolutely nobody said anything to us. So needless to say, we won't be back and I have absolutely no idea how the drinks, food, or service is (besides completely non existent) :(
