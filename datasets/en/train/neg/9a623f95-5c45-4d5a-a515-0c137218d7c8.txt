This location used to be the best Thai restaurant in Tempe (Chars Thai).  Everything has gone downhill since Thai Rama took over.  The menu has significantly changed, the service (although not Chars best trait) is horrible and to top it off, I have gotten food poisoning twice from this location.  The first time I was not sure if it was this location, but when it happened again, I was sure.

Eat at your own risk.
