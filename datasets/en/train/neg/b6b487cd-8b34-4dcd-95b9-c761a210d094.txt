I was super excited to try this place after my neighbor recommending it to me.  The restaurant is nicely decorated but this has to be the smelliest fish I have ever ordered. I think I will save my money and go over to Mekong Plaza and order the fish out of the tank.  The Tuna Nigiri was mediocre.  Stay away from the Mackerel... the smell tops an NFL locker room after a long day of practice.
