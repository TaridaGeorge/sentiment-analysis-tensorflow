God I hate this restaurant. And it isn't for lack of trying -- collectively I've given it about 10 different attempts to wow me. Yes, 10. Each time the service has been horrific. Extremely slow, extremely rude. In one instance, the manager accused me of trying to get out of paying my bill, in front of other customers and staff members, because a member of my party complained about the fact that her order was messed up three times. Yes, they brought her wrong food three times. 

The food isn't even that good - I'll be honest. I am not impressed. I won't be back any time soon.
