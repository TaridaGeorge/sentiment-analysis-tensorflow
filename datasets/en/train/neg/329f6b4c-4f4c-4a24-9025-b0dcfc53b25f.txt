So we found out why people hate this place.  We were cut off after probably drinking enough cocktails, but that is not the bad part.  I understand when a restaurant thinks someone has had enough to drink and they say no more.  

The crazy part is they also cut us off from eating....What???  Awkward and embarrassing,  won't be back :-(
