this gym is whack compared to the other ones i go to(chandler, tempe). I have been trying to figure out the best times to go and pretty much i've come to the conclusion that if you're not there at opening time dont waste your time. If your goals are to put in a good solid hour of no bullsh**t working out then this place is not for you. I swear there's a gotdamn fashion show going on while i'm here everytime. this place really takes the enjoyment out of going to the gym.
