Sucks. You can't even order cheese enchiladas, only chicken, which essentially means it is all pre-made.  So the chef is really just a master of the microwave. Seriously. You have to drop $5 for chips and salsa, and those aren't even good enough to be free. Avoid this place, there are tons better Mexican choices in Scottsdale, some within less than a mile.
