We ordered from Chopstick Express and had it delivered to us.  Both the chicken with broccoli and the house egg foo young combos came with heaping portions.

The rice was dry.  The chicken with broccoli was bland and way too creamy.

I don't think you should have stomach pains after eating a meal, and since my hubby and I both had stomach pains after eating their food, we won't be eating their food again.
