Customers BEWARE.  This place will scam you out of your money when paying your bill. Visited this establishment for the first time, the bill was $40 and change and provided a $100 cash for the bill. Received $42 and change back. Where was the other $16? Gratuity was not added on the bill for them to snag the remaining MISSING change.  Just a heads up to patrons... I have the impression this is NOT the first time they have done this! I will NEVER return.  Awful experience.
