I payed $10.00 for a peace of dry old chicken, and bitter flat diet rc cola, good corn on the cob, and halfway decent cowbro beans. The people here were not very friendly, it was not a good experience to my standards, especially when spending $10.00. 

I could have just as easily went somewhere else for cheaper that was way better. Worst bbq I have ever had in my life. Horrible, I want my money back, I feel like I was robbed.

Screw you Honey Bears BBQ
