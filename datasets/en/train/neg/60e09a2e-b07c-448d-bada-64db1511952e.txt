I wish I could award no stars. I hate the fact that this is my "hometown airline".  Terrible reward program. Horrible customer service.  Grossly outdated and uncomfortable aircraft, especially on overseas flights. I've switched my allegiances to United...what does it matter anyway when I have to connect through Charlotte or Philly 90% of the time despite living in their hub city?  I'm no huge Southwest fan, but I'll take them any day over Airways. At least I'll save the overinflated checked-baggage fee. There's a reason no large carrier will partner with this fleabag joke of an airline.
