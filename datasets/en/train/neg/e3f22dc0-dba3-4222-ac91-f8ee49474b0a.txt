Three different occassions I have gone to purchase items at this location and all three times they were out of stock. The third time I even called in advance and was told the merchandise I was looking for was in stock. The clerk, when I asked, wouldn't even go in the back to see if there was additional supply that hadn't been put on the shelves. These were not "on sale" items - I was looking for every day computer and/or video cables and components. Save yourself a trip: Make the trip to the Best Buy in Surprise or to the one on I-17 & Thunderbird.
