Obviously a glutton for punishment- been here 3 times and EVERY time our service is ATROCIOUS. The pie is amazing- but cold when it gets to us.

And seriously... Management stands around texting?! EVERY time we have been there. 
I'll buy the pie to go next time if ever a next time.

Happy Hours prices - STILL TOO EXPENSIVE 
(drinks are cheaper and more quantity at other places)
Happy Hour food - Over priced, and not that great 
Pie- Awesome, you should try it for sure..... BUT YES VERY PRICEY

just too expensive of a place to continue going, when the service is sooo bad.
