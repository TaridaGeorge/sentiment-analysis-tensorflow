This is, without any doubt, the worst food in Scottsdale.  And since Scottsdale has so many bad restaurants, that's saying a lot.

There is generally one person in the "kitchen", who simply takes pre-frozen corporate crap and slaps it on your plate.

I can't even begin to describe how awful it is.    Just think of the worst airline food you've ever had, and that comes close.
