You wait in a single line that is covered and INFESTED WITH PIGEONS POOPING and cooing over your head. It STINKS and bird poop is everywhere.

Then you enter and think every things OK.

The theater is old and very stained, dirty and STINKS from filth and the chairs don't rock either.

My husband thought he was hungry and tried a soft pretzel from the concession stand. I took a bite, It was covered in FAKE Butter and the pretzel was like bread Styrofoam. It's a throw out.

I am NEVER seeing a movie here again everything about this place stinks.

I need my real camera to photo the pigeon infestation.
