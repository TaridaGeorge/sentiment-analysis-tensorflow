I wish I had better things to say about this place but I don't! The atmosphere is wonderful as we sat in the courtyard. However, our server was terrible. He rushed us to take out order and he had a nasty attitude to boot. We ordered a bottle of wine and had soup and salad. My soup was great but our salads weren't anything to write home about.  Once I got home, I checked my account balance and out waiter charged me twice for the meal! Wth!
