Very americanized indian food with bad bad service. Nice vegan and vegetarian options though... 

I tried the Chef's special and the four sauces seem to be all a bit off. Only the spinach curry was any good. Any don't go for the noodles! I know, its a weird option and as you know it, weird combo. Went out of my way driving but a huge disappointment.
