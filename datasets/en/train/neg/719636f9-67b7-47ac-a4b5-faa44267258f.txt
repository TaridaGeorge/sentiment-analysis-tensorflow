Stay as far away as you can! This was my second visit and my last. To have to prepay, be acosted and over charged for a job done incorrectly is disturbing in the least. A refund/replacement was out of the question for ruining my pants (hem that was not required making my pants too short!) unless she got the pants back!? Who does that? Nada is in no way interested in customer satisfaction or retention. Beware!
