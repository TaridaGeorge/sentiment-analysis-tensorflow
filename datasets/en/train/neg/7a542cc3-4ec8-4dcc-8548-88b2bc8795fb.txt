Seriously, what a disaster!  I can't believe this place is even in business with the newer, nicer Jo-Ann's so close.  Still, what a nightmare going in here over the weekend.  We waited 30 minutes in line to get a roll of fabric measured and priced.  We were buying the whole roll but they still had to measure it.  Then we waited 30 more minutes in the check-out line.  The excuse? " A bunch of people called out for the [Rock n Roll Marathon] race."  Well, that's why you call other people to come in and work or, why you fire people.  Take your pick.  I'm never going back here.  I hate being this close to the rez to begin with but after this joke, I'm staying away for good.
