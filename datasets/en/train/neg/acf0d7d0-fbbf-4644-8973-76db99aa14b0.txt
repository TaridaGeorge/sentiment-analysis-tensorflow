Located at end cap of strip mall. Reef? One very badly executed wall mural. Food was poor, though my wife liked the chicken wings & sweet potato fries. Kind of like a rec room in a prison, with same clientele. Large screen televisions and very loud hip hop music. Needs demolition rather than a makeover. Almost any choice for a sports bar is better. Waitress told us she had worked there 13 years and that there were new owners who had added "reef" to the name, Apparently for no known reason. A  depressing "dive" w/o redeeming virtues. Even with coupon promotions, this place has little to recommend it. 2 thumbs down.
