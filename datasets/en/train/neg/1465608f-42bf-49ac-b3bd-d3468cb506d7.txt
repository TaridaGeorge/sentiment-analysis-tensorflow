I went to Schlotzsky's in Texas...and in Vegas.  And it was amazing.  What happened?!  The bread was gross, the sandwich barely had any meat in it and was totally overpriced.  I'm totally confused--what happened to the amazing bread and the piled high sandwich I had?

Not to mention--once a year I get a Cinnabon cinnamon bun.  They sell them here.  Great, right?  NO!  It was lukewarm and DRY!  I feel guilty putting those calories into my body--if you're going to eat something sooooo sooooo bad, at least you should be able to enjoy it.

The girl at the counter had like zero personality...but I would've given the food a 1 star, anyways.  I'd rather take the hit-or-miss Gandalfo's!
