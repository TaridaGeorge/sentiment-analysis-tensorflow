I just had dinner here tonight and ordered a side of steamed vegetables for my 15 month old daughter, when our entrees came out I had to ask twice for the steamed vegetables, after several minutes the waiter came back and told me that I could have grilled zucchini or red peppers only and that the executive chef said that was all that was available and they could not do steamed vegetables. I an age where many people have dietary requirements that is never ending a simple request for steamed vegetables is refused. You can bet your bottom dollar I will never recommend this chain to anyone. I can only hope if you have allergies you are very careful at this restaurant as judging from my experience you could end up very sick or in hospital due to the non flexibility of the kitchen and chef.
