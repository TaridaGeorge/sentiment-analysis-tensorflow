It was impossible to make a reservation here because they never pick up the phone during hours. We were seating in the teppan room at 8pm and didn't get our soup or salad for an hour. The waiter was rude and didn't know the menu. The chief had to fix everyone orders because the waiter messed up. I never got a refill on my water. The chief didn't come until 9:30pm. An hour and a half after I sat down. The food was dry and no amount of spicy mustard could give it flavor. I took my husband to see a teppan show and I was so embarrassed when we left  that I took him to such a terrible place. The only thing good about this place is the atmosphere.  I should have stuck to my original plan and went to benihanas
