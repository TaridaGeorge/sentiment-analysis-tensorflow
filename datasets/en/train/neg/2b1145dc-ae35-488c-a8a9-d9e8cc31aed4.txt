We had a cheese and mushroom pizza. We order salads before the pizza and they showed up at our table 5 minutes after the pizza. I like a cheeze pizza where toppings cover the whole piece. The cheese covered only about half or 2/3 thirds of each piece and they were chintzy on the mushrooms The pizza is simply overprice. The manager apologize for the service and gave us an employee discount. I would not go back again unless someone picked up the tab.
