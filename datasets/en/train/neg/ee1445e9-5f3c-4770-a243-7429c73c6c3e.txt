I went here for lunch and ordered a Thai iced tea and the Duck salad. The duck was cooked rare and the salad was extremely spicy, contrary to the server's remarks. I ended up having to leave mid meal and throw up. It was and extremely unpleasant experience. I was so sick that I didn't even have a chance to speak up.
