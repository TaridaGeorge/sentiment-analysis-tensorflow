I won't give them any stars but to be able to rate you have to give one or more!!!! 
 
This store looks nice on the outside. Now that is where (nice ends)! 
We travel all over the USA and Walmarts are everywhere and we know what to expect. So we thought, this is not so at this store at 240 Baseline Rd. Mesa AZ. This store has the filthiest restrooms in the USA!!  I feel bad for those that have to work there. But I really feel bad for their guests. If they just knew they could shop anywhere else and be treated as a guest ,as they deserve!! This store has dropped to BALL. We will never return and my advice is you go to another Walmart. Until they retrain Management staff.
