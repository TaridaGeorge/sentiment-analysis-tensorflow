I'm going to keep this short and sweet. I ordered miso ramen and they gave me shoyu. I immediately knew that it wasn't miso because it lacked miso's distinct foggy hue and traces of fermented bean paste.  I have grown accustomed to the unique look of miso broth after having lived in Chiba/Tokyo for 3 years.

When I took my bowl to the service counter, the attending chef told me that because their miso has no MSG, it isn't as potent as "regular" miso. I have had MANY types of miso, and none of them taste like bland greasy salt water. Rather than own up to his mistake, the chef lied to my face. To make the situation worse, as I left the restaurant I saw a fellow customer enjoying genuine miso broth ramen.
