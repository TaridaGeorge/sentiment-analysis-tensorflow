I called this location to order a pizza for delivery. I was staying at the La Quinta down the street. I received a message stating this location had been closed. They did provide two other locations and numbers for their other locations that could assist me. I did call one of their other stores, I am writing a review for that store separately. 

I am only giving it 1 star due to it being closed (why rate my past experiences at this location now).
