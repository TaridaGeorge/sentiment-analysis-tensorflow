I had the italian beef from Al's and am not impressed at all.  It seemed bland, even with the hot peppers and cheese added.

Top the medoicre food off with the fact that my credit card started having charges pop up on it from gas stations in Chicago days after I ate here (I don't travel there and don't even know anyone who lives there).

Contacted the credit card company, contacted the police, and will NEVER, NEVER, NEVER eat here again.  I would prefer starvation.  I won't mention the name of the other location, but there is another restaurant in the immediate area that serves italian beef that is infinitely better and won't steal your credit card number, go there instead.
