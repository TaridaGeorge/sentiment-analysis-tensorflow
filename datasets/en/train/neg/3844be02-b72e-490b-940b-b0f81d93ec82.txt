I hate to give them even one star. Had the fish tacos and they were not remotely as described on the menu. Missing was the cream cheese jalapeno and coleslaw. They were frozen fried fishsticks with some lettuce and that stuff that passes for cheese in some mexican restaurants. What a waste of money!!
