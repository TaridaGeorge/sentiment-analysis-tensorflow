We had a pleasant time for Aloha here on Monday so we  attempted to have dinner here on Christmas eve. 

The maitre d said we would be seated in 15 minutes or less. We waited a good 25 minutes before she informed us the table had not been setup yet and she could only seat us outside or wait longer. 

OMG! Sorry young lady, located  at the JW Marriott which has several dinning options we got up and walked out! Maybe this is one of reasons why they have closed down the Scottsdale location!
