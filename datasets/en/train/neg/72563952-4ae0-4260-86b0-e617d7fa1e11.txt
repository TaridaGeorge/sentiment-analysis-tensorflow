We were on vacation so my family went here expecting a great French meal after reading the great reviews. The atmosphere was great, but the food was totally not the level of French food we were used too. We love froie gras so we ordered the poulet roti. The breast was super dry and there was no froie gras at all. The steak frites was very tough with no sauce and the bouillabaisse had no saffron in it. The best item we ate was the plat de fromage. All in all a very disappointing French meal. We love food and this one place we will never come back to.
