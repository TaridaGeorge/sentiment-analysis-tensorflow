Staying at the Homewood Suites across the parking lot. Wanted to watch the Kings game, so, how perfect was this! 

Walked inside...they were busy, but not slammed. Waited, waited and waited. Counted about 6 servers walking around...no host?? 

Walked down to the bar......no contact.... Well...that's about enough of that!!  Walked right out!!

I'm patient...but...common!! You got a bus running around town to pick people up, but, don't bother with the ones that walk through the door!!
