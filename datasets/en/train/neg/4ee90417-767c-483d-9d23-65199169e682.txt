The level of incompetence at this pharmacy is really alarming. Do not rely on them for important medications. They will call you incessantly when you don't need to hear from them, and you won't hear from them when you really need them.

It's crazy slow, they are often out of stock of meds, and none of the associates know what they are doing. Pretty appalling when you think of the important role a pharmacy plays.
