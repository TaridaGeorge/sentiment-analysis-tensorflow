Hello? GeekSquad?

I purchased a GeekSquad install of a wireless router and was told the next available opening was a week away. No problem. Sunday, between 12 and 4 they said. I called about 10am to confirm. No problem they said, we'll see you between 12 and 4. No one came. And when I called the store at 4 to find out why, there was no answer on any of their lines. Thanks GeekSquad for nothing more than a $149.00 bill and NO SERVICE!
