Go there for the "show" (cooks making loud noises with their knives and telling cheesy jokes and then dropping food with their clumsy hands) not so much for the greasy, below-average food. 

You'd be better going to Sakana, Kabuki, or even RA; that is, if you have fun friends like I do and do not need a circus freak to cook for you.

And that waitress: "more tea?... more tea?... more tea?" every five minutes. Here's some clues: 
* It's 100 degrees outside.
* I am sitting next to a grill.
* I am eating spicy food.
* and last, but not least: My cup is empty.

Yes, I'd like more iced tea. Please.
