I was drunk when I ate here. It did save me from a getting a hangover. The sicilian was garbage. The regular was the same. $10 for 3 slices. Bogus slices. It was just like Sbarro's. The pizza was floppy as hell.  I guess you can't really complain when you are drunk. In hindsight, this place was a poor imitation. I would prefer the hillbilly trash pizza I eat in Cleveland.
