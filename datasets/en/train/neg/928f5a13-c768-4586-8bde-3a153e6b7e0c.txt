Worst nail job I've had in my life. Didn't do what I asked and began chipping off next day. The actual nail not just the polish. Then even after I went back in and requested them to fix them my nails (it's been 4 days) have began cracking. There is bubbles in them. Horrible:( and a waste of mula to go here.
