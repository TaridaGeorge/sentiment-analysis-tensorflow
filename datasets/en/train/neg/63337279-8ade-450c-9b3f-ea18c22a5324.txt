ok conspire normally has some of the best chai in town but i feel they may be falling fast. i ordered a hot soy chai this morning and recieved a cup that contained none of my order. It was tepid at best, made with whole milk and had no chai flavor at all. In leiu of the chai they had flavored my beverage with about a gallon of honey. Not to mention it rook the girl about 1 1/2 hrs to complete my two drink order. Now the owner who is normally there makes a delicious chai but what ive learned is not to bother if there is anyone else behind the counter. Apperantly they have zero consistancy.
