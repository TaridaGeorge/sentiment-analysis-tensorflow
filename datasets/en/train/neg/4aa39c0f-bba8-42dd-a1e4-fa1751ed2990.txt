I love how their sign going in the front doors to the right talks about how they do not discriminate against anyone, and they go on to say what they don't discriminate against except sexual preferences, or anything that has to do with gays. Great job Cracker Barrel.. I'm sure you will be facing a law suit again soon, just like in the past.
