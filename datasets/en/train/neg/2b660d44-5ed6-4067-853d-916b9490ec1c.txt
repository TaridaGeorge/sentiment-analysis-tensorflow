I went to the location on Ray and Rural early on a Saturday. I ordered a Gyro. I was about to pay with my debit card and was told there is an $8 minimum purchase to use a debit cards. I said okay I'll take fires then, the cashier snapped "it already comes with fries". I said fine I'll take an extra side of Taziki sauce. He then snapped again "the total is still only $7.60". By then I said forget it and cancelled my order. I couldn't believe this guy wouldn't budge for 40 cents. If they are this cheap about debit fees then how cheap are they with the food?
