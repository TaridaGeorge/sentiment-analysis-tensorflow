We were double billed and the service was horrible. We sat on the patio and were completely ignored for 15 minutes until my husband got up and got our beers at the bar. The table next to us seemed to have no trouble getting them tobring their drinks however. Perhaps they were friends with the staff?  I've been here for dinner before as well and while the food is decent I'm not overly impressed. Having been to my fair share of Irish pubs in Ireland this is not a good representation. It is definately an American idea of an Irish pub and it is appropriately overpriced for the "tourists". I'll go to the pub down the street for better service and a true Irish feel from now on.
