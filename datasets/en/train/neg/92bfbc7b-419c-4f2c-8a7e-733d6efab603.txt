I went in to get an iPad case and I got more help and  info from other shoppers than I did from the staff. And checking out? A pain in the arse. No one wanted to take my money! Finally one associate told me to see any blue shirt in the front of the store, bc they have handheld scanners, but I couldnt catch any of them! It was ridiculous! Finally a woman I had overheard telling people she was just "directing traffic" noticed how perplexed I was and rang me up. Thankfully so, as I was about to just give up and hit another apple or just shop online.

If you are going to play with all the toys and gadgets, you'll be fine, just be prepared to tackle someone when you're ready to actually buy something!
