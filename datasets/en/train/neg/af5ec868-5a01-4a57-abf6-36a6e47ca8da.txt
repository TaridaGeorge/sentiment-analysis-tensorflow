I had heard good things about this place so I was pretty disappointed when the sandwich turned out to be even less appetizing than a Subway meal. And that's a stretch, cause I don't really like Subway, either. Silver Mine's subs were overpriced for a totally bland sandwich. Bummer. I imagine they'd be good if you're drunk and hungry for total crap at 2am, but I wasn't. It wasn't even filling.
