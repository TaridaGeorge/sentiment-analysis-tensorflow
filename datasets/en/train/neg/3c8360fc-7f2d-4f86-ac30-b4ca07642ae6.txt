I went in to eat but stopped in the men's room to wash up and EGAD! That bathroom had the worse urine smell I have encountered north of the Mexican border! This is a men's room that hasn't been cleaned in months. Do the employees use this restroom also? The manager obviously doesn't. I looked around at the neglect and filth in the bathroom and wondered what shape the kitchen might be in. But instead of finding out, I took my party and left to go to Benihana's which has clean bathrooms and kitchens.
