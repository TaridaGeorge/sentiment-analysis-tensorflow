UPDATE:  Within 2 hours of posting the review below,  Dickey's contacted me in order to make things right.   Well Done!    I declined their offer for a gift card, but will try their Shea location at some point.

In a world of liars Dickey's would be king. 

Having put an ad in the AZ Republic listing a January long special of $1 BBQ pork sandwiches on Mondays I had been driving up to this location after work on Mondays to take advantage of this deal. 

The Monday before last they were "out" of the pork but were good enough to substitute for another meat. This Monday they decided to NOT honor their advertised special stating "that isn't for Arizona." Your pants sir are on fire. 

A. You advertised it in an Arizona specific Newspaper 

B. The Shea location honored the advertised special
