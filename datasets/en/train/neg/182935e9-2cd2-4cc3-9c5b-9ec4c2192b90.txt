The bar-tenders are uninterested in service. The main concern is that they won't reserve your table if you get up to go to the bathroom, because they don't care. I ordered food had a few bites and told the bar-tender i will be back in a second...26 seconds later I come back to my table to find everything I ordered was thrown away and I was still being charged for it, even the beer I didn't get to try. This happened to me and several of my friends on many occasions. Locals know to stay away, it's mostly for tourists.
