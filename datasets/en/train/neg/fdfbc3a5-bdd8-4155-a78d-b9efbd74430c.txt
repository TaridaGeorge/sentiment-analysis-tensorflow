Ordered a bacon wrapped deep fried hot dog with their homemade relish........and potato salad......it came as potato salad SOUP and the hot dog was soooo salty that I could not eat it, the relish was tasteless and NEON green, the diet coke was good though......the reviews I read we're good which is why we stopped there, but all I have to say is the reviewers  don't get out much
