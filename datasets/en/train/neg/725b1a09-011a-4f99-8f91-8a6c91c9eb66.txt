GROSS. I had one bite of each item of food I brought back to my table. Not one dish was edible. Even the rice was overcooked. The salt and pepper shakers were sticky, i had to ask for new silverware TWICE. My fianc√©e and I refused to pay but offered to pay for our soda. Luckily they agreed. Will not be returning to this establishment. DO NOT EAT HERE!
