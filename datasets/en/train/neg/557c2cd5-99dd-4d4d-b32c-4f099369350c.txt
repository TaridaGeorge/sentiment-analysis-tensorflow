Literally the only place I can count on to get worse every time I go. Used to be good about 5 years ago. Breakfast burritos were the only things that were worth while back then but at least they were good and consistent. Now the food, service, every single thing is pretty much terrible. Los Taquitos is a stones throw away and is probably the best Mexican food in the general area so there is no reason to waste time / money here.
