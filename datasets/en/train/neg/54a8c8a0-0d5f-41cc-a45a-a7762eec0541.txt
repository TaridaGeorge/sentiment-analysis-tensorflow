customer service stinks- enough said.  i asked my doctor for a dermatologist referal and was given this guy.  in doing my own research i couldn't find a web page for them besides a single page with no contact information.  i called and after immediately being put on hold for 5 minutes i got hung up on.  yeah, i really want to go there now- heck, i don't even trust my primary care doctor after this
