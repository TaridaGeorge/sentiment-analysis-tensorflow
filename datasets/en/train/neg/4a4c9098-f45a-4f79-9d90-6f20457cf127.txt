Rating the golf course, horrible!!  Thank goodness there was no one in front of us and we zipped around the course.  They clearly stopped maintaining the course.  Bunkers are concrete, after a few times in them I decided to take it out and not bother hitting it.  No grass around the greens and the greens couldn't hold the ball worth a darn.  One green did have gravel on it, I putted the ball and it wiggled all over the place.  I'm glad I only played there for 15 bucks, which included the golfnow fee.  If your a horrible golfer I'd play there.
