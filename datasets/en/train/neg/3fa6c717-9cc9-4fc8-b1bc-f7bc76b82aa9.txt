Poor management, Darrin, the store manager obviously has little management skills and cares little about repeat customers. Hires incompetent managers that treat customers very poorly and allows extremely long lines. Managers that don't even train employees in basic customer service skills. Can walk through the store on Saturday and not be acknowledged at all.
