One word - "icky"

Not only did they mess up the entire order, everything was just.... gross. Their beans were tasteless, their tacos are NOTHING special. Rice is very tasteless too. Is it my fault I got a taco combo? 

This place is a family owned shop, and a lot of people grew up with it and chased it around as it changed locations a few times. I was taken here with someone that grew up with it, and they loved it. But the novelty has to wear off sometime.

There was hair in my food, I'll admit. The wait staff was less than friendly, and can not customize an order worth beans - no pun.

I guess if you're on Mill and want a greasy treat while being drunk, maybe you won't recognize all the faults this place has. But hair? No split checks? Me thinks not.
