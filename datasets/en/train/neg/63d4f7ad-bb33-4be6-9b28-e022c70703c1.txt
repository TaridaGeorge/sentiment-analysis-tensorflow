Not really customer service oriented.  I called up to get ginger added to my Broccoli Beef take-out order which I was placing and they said they will not do that even if I paid more for the ginger.  I decided not to eat there and refuse to do so now.  I recently was in the area and still can't go back in after the initial bad taste in my mouth of bad service.
