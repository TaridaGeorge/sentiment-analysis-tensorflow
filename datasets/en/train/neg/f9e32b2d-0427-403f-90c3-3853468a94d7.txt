Maybe we just went on a bad day, but I'm not sure how these reviews are so positive.  My friend and I went to Ken's after seeing the good reviews on Yelp.  The place is dark and not very sanitary.  The women working on our feet were CONSTANTLY preoccupied with personal calls and texts, and not very friendly.

By far the worst part was the waxing.  No joke - they used MASKING TAPE.  Not only was it a weird practice, but I had skin problems from the tape for a few weeks after.  

The whole experience was very unsatisfying and a little unsettling.
