One of the worst dining experiences we have had in a long time.  The sever was more interested in clearing off empty tables then checking to see if we needed any thing.  When we asked for more salad dressing he was gone for so long we wondered if he had to make more by himself.  The chicken in the chicken Thai salad was dry and hard.  To top everything off we asked to speak to the manager to let her know off our disappointments all she could say was " I am sorry".  She never made any attempt to make the situation better.  Obviously poor training for management and for waitstaff.
