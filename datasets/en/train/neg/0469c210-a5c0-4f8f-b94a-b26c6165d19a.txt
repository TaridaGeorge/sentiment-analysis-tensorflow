I am not a fan of this studio. The instructors are far too serious and do not allow for breaks or rests. Very grueling classes that do not concentrate on mind body awareness or any technique but that, "your purpose is to stay in the heated room for 90 minutes." 

The carpeted floors have soaked up everyone's sweat over the years which in turn makes me want to vomit the moment I step into class. I do not recommend this studio.
