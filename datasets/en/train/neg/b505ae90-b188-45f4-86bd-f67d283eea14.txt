I went here tonight since I was seeing a movie and thought it would be nice to grab something close to the theaters... I ordered a slice of pizza and my husband ordered a calzone - they brought my pizza out 15 minutes before my husbands food was done, so of course my pizza was cold by the time I started eating. The waitresses were nice enough but clearly need some training. On top of my pizza being cold, it kind of tasted like puke. We will not be coming back! I'm disappointed, I was so hoping to like this place since I come to the AMC by it so often! Do yourself a favor and skip this place, Pita Jungle is a few stores down and has much better food (I even like their pita pizzas better)!
