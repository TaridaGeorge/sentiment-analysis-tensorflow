I wish I could give this location a big fat ZERO.

But you can't.  But I can let everyone know how horrible it is.

For starters, their automatic doors do not even work.  I just find that appalling.  How can your doors not work on your store?  How are people supposed to get in there to shop.

The manager of this location is nothing more than a jerk.  I asked for help and all I received was attitude.

For a struggling supermarket that filed for bankruptcy, I would think service would be one thing you could promote at no cost.  But, not here.

I don't think it will be long before this location closes.  RIP!
