read the other yelpers reveiws and decided to try this out.  Must say I disagree.  Walking in, 2 dead roaches in teh entry window...omen.  Place had a cool bahama meets sports bar niche so we went it.   Went in for breakfast.  waiter had no clue about anything on the menu, kept asking US what the menu said.  Ordered a scramble and made sure it had cheddar, not american (asked because it said cheddar but they seem to list american cheese on everything else), it landed with both.  Asked for the potatoes to be crisp, they came blackened/el charro!  The bacon was unrecognizable from the blackened potatoes.  Wife's burrito was almost 100% full of potatoes.  Service was poor at best, a bit sweaty and unkept, but I will say my cranberry-OJ was good.  Avoid if you know what is good for you.
