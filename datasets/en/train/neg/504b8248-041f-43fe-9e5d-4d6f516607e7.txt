I am sorry, but my impressions are total different that the other reviewers.  I am a stickler for customer service and Total Wines has the worst customer service I have ever experienced.  I am a relatively big purchaser of high-end wines, not only for my consumption but for consumption by my wine "club" who meet regularly to try new wines -- especially the high-end, highly rated wines.  I am not exaggerating, but on at least 8 ocassions, I have called a number of stores, sent faxes and emails, and have never ever received a call-back or a response.  This is also true about their corporate offices.  HQ also never responds to inquiries.  They might have a large inventory, but if you can never find what you want, what good is it?  Also, their online website search capability is sorely lacking in capability.
