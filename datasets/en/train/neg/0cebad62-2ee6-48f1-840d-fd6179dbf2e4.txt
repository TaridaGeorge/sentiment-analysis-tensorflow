well, sometimes "little hole in the wall" places are very good and tend to surprise you... but not this place... The service was good and friendly, but the food was horrible. The orange juice tasted very bad, the gravy on the biscuits tasted like flour and water (paper mache) the bacon and mushroon omlet had a bad after taste... skip this place and go to ihop.
