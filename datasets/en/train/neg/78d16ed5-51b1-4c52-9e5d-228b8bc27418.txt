We are from out of town and were at a soccer tournament.  Called a day ahead to let them know that there would be a group of about 25.  Service was terrible.  Took over an hour, closer to 1.5 hours to get our food and then another 30 minutes to get our checks after we asked a couple times.  Portion size: small  After the terrible service, they added 18% gratuity.  What a rip off!
