I was so disappointed! 
Petit Fromage is now located inside Delicious Dishes. There is only a small case of cheese. I asked a staff member which of the blue cheeses she preferred and she wrinkled her nose and said "eww I don't eat blue cheese". HUH?? Needless to say I was ready to walk out. I asked which of the cheeses were made locally besides the one brand of goat cheese I recognized and she began looking around to find the place of origin. 
These people don't know anything about the cheese and the selection is awful!
