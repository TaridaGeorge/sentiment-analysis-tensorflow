I agree with Susan , I saw a Huffy bike for $200 yesterday , a dress for $100 and yes, the prices are way over priced and the 2 employees never greet you , the girl is always on her phone. I would fire all employees and hire honest friendly ones. There is never any good items , I believe one or some of the employees is working with an outside source to sell the valuable items like fine jewelry and antiques , there is never these items . This place should be shut down for good. 
 I hope God doesn't punish them for ripping people off and being money hungry.
