The only reason I would give this place a 1 star rating is due to their amazing soda and float selection. The food was absolutely disgusting. I never complain about food and I've definitely never sent food back, until tonight. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and was shocked to see that fries aren't even offered as a side. I took one bite of the burger and found bone fragments in the frozen beef. My sister also sent back her bean/veggie burger. It looked equally disgusting. It will take a lot of convincing to get me to go back.
