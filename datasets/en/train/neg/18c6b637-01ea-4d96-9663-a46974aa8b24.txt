I ended up walking out of this place without even ordering. It was way too pretentious masked as artsy for me. This is one of those restaurants operated by people who think their you-know-what sounds like roses and just because they call appetizers "tapas" they can charge an arm and a leg for them. If you want to discuss the dichotomy of society and the benefits of Mao while you pick at a single morsel of duck cooked in the tears of Republicans, this is the place for you. If you want food, go somewhere else.
