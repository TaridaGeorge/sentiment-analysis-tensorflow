Their higher prices add insult to the fact that many of the items I have purchased from them are SPOILED! I just went there last night for things for dinner. Came home, poured a large glass of milk and gross.. totally "off". This is NOT the 1st time this has happened. It's almost as if the AJs people are having a laugh at customer's expense. Just because the store is "trendy pretty" with misters outside for the hot weather.. and VERY overpriced food items.. does not make it a "fine" store. pfft.. and the affected "purveyors" word. What a joke.
