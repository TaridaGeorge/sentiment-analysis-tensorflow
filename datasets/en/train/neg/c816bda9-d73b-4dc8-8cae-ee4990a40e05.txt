Created a YELP page because I was annoyed with this place. Maybe they have great coffee but thats not my beef with them. 

I saw they were listed as a great place to smoke a cigar and have a cup of jo. Understanding that some great places do not allow cigars (4Peaks, The Yardhouse...), I called them and said "I understand you guys are cigar smoker friendly?''. The woman on the phone answered, "Yes". When I inquired on a smoking area she said "Just keep them as far away from us as possible". Rude.

Thats not "cigar smoker friendly" at all! A simple, "Actually, we do discourage patrons from smoking cigars" would have sufficed. I would have even still went for a simple cup of coffee.

Again, maybe their coffee is great...but I'll never know for sure now. Drink Lux!
