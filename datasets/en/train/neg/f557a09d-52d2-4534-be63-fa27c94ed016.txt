I have been comming to this place for 6 months now. Food and resturant seemed great until my last visit when there was a beetle in my salad, saw it when i was about to take last bite of my plate! I am pregnant and have a toddler who was eating it too. The owner was just blaming it on the lettus supplier. He didn't give me my money back, just said he will take care of me next time, well there wont be a next time!!!
