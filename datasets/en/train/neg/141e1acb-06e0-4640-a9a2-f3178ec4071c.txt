Do not think all Port of Subs are alike.  This location is AWFUL.  We've had bad service more than once.  We won't go back after the second time.  The bad service was unbelievable.  They actually argued with my co-worker over what she wanted on her sandwich and got really testy.  Just absolute jerks, I can't say it enough.
