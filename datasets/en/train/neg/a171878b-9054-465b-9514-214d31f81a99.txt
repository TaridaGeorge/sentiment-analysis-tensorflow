I don't understand how this place is still in business. I recently got a online membership here without visiting the gym first, big mistake on my part. Im disgusting to even enter the sauna, how this place is still open to the public is unknown to me. I will be canceling my membership effective tomorrow. I will pay a few more dollars at LA Fitness but well worth the extra bucks...
