Walked and we were seated quickly, hostess seemed a little put out as I looked around the restaurant, I had not visited since the space was occupied by Native New Yorker.  We sat and sat for well over ten minutes with no further acknowledgement from the staff. The place was not busy it was early in the evening. After another ten minutes of waiting we walked out. What a shame. I guess it is Spinatto's Pizza for dinner instead.
