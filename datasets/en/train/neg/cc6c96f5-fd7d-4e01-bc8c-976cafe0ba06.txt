So my first experience at Bikini will most likely be my last. This past Saturday was the night for me to get my long-craved for Amaretto Sour (followed by some beer of course) but alas, it was served with no less than 6 little creatures with wings!!!! Sick. The bartender didn't even offer my money back and I really wasn't up for another drink of anything there after that unfortunate incident. Thankfully, we made it to Cooperstown right after so the night wasn't totally ruined.
