Was like slop on a plate. I didnt expect it to be the best, ive had nm mexican a few times in nm. But this was very bland and was like slop. The green chilli cheese crisp was very good. But the beans were salty and the rice was dry. I wont be going back but its up to u if u want to waste ur money on slop and not go to ranosos traditional mexican food on ray and 50th by old madstone theater. Bean dip is good but runy cheap bastards.
