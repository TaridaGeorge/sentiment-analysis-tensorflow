I went here and ordered a hamburger about two minutes til closing, and sure enough i was in the ER with severe stomach pains by 3 AM.
I am about 99% sure that is what caused it but due to the inability to give a stool sample within the first few hours the doctors were unable to absolutely say it was their fault... Plus the wait times are horrible even for expensive food and a small menu to go along with the terrible service. 
I would recommend anybody who wants to get a hamburger late at night, to go elsewhere unless you want to run the risk of severe stomach pains and nausea!
