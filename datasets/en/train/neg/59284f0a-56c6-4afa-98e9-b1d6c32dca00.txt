They didn't have the meat for the sandwich I ordered. So I ordered another sandwich, which was cheaper and they didn't refund me the difference. Both my mom's sandwich and mine was dry and the bread stale. Oh yeah, and I found many small bones in my sandwich as well. DO NOT RECOMMEND. WIll NEVER go back.
