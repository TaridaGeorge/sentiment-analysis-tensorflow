STAY AWAY, spend your money else where. This place wrote the book on bad costumer service. Went there with the family and kids, and they had $10 cover, even for the kids, for a pay per view event. You could get food credit, so there were really trying to make sure you spent $10 per person. But the boneheaded manager would only accept cash to get in, and if you didn't have cash, you could use their ATM and pay a fee. They wouldn't accept a credit card, or even think of any alternative. So we didn't go in. So good luck in this economy, Mr. Buffalo Wild Wings owners, making do, with a crappy customer service approach and boneheaded manager. So we went to Elephant Bar instead and had a great meal.
