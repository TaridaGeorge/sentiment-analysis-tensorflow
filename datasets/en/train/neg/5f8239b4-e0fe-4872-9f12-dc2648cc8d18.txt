Very disappointed...I had my usual Dirty martini, but a friend wanted just a soda since she was driving....Do you know what they charged...$4.00!!  For a soda!  And it was in the smallest glass!  Come on....With DUI laws that we have here in Scottsdale and the economy crisis that we are in,  $4.00 for a soda is a bit much when it is cheaper at Target to get a case!  ($3.50) I am not cheap by any stretch, but I think it is a bit absurd to over inflate the price of a soda!  Don't go to Stone Rose if you are looking for a drink deal!
