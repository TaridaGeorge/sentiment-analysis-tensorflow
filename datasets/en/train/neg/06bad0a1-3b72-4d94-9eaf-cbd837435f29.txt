i will never go back to this place. i spent 27 dollars washing and no wifi. when i asked if they could turn it on, the girl looked at me like i was crazy. there is a big sign on the front window that states "free wifi" now as far as the machines go, they washed ok, nothing amazing.  oh, and the parking sucks. never again.
