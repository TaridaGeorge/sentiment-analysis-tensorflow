No need to put money in the tip jar here. I had $2 in my ashtray and about a dollar in change in the change holder next to my coffee cup holder. Whoever cleaned the interior of my car helped themselves to my change and ashtray money. So when it came time to dig out my cash for the tip it was gone--so I guess they self-tip here. I have not returned since (I used to use this car wash about every six weeks prior to this incident).
The comments on the high pressure up-selling are accurate. The wait time is far too long (bring something to read).
