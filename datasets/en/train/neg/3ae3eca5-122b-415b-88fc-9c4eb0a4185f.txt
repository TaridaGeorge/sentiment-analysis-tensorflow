I love thrift stores but I'll take my chances elsewhere from this Goodwill location. It is very stereotypical of what you would think a thrift store is:  filthy, cluttered, disorganized, musty smelling, pure junk clothing, and men who will stare you down while you shop. 

Good luck trying to find any decent furniture, even some that you don't mind re-finishing! There was not even a couple of nice basic pieces that I could take home and work with. I understand that some people might not have an option, but if you have a car with gas in it go somewhere else. The prices are pretty much the same as a nicer Savers or the like.
