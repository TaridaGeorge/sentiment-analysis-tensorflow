This place was terrible!  I came in here for the first time and they rushed throughout the whole service and was VERY rude when you asked them to correct something.  The guy who was doing my nails did not buff out my nails and only put nail polish on half of my nail.  I can understand mistakes can happen, however, being RUDE TO THE PAYING CUSTOMER IS INEXCUSABLE!!!! Here's a tip to the owner---TREAT YOUR CUSTOMERS BETTER & GET SOME TRAINING ON HOW TO GIVE PROPER MANICURES!!!!
