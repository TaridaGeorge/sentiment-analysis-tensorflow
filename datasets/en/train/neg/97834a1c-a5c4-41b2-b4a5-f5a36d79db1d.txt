Not good. Been waiting to try this place and so very disappointed. Cold under cooked bacon, just plain nasty spinach omlette, sad floppy un-browned home fries, did they open a green bag of "Simply Potatoes" and nuke them? And apparently we made a tragic mistake opting to eat inside, since it was hot on the patio. Employees yelling back and forth (not work, but goofing off-hey guys, it's small room with no acoustic merits-no need to yell), and one employee talking to her customer/friend at the counter so loudly about her drinking nites, that we could not hear each other, and heard way more about her personal habits than we cared to. Management must leave after the breakfast rush, or they don't care. Won't be back.
