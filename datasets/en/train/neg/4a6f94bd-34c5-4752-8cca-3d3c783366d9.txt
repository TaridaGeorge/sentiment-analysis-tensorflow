Ok, I forgot to rate this place.
GROSS.    Went with a couple of friends for a few drinks one night.  TO make the story short, after a few beers, one order came out, foaming over with piss.  The male server decided to piss in the beer bottle.  Maybe just mine, but I knew something was WRONG and poured some into the other's drinks. (I was tipsy). They didn't drink touch theirs either after that.  I've eaten there too and it's nothing to write home about.
