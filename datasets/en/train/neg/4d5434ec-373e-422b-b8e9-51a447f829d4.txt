amateur show at best, thought i was at someones mormen's basement. Couldnt stop looking at all the kankles from the "beautiful women" in the opening act. The double handstand was disturbing. wanted to look away and my vodka tonic did not help. For a ten year show i was expecting pros insted i got waiters from denny's at best. I got more injoyment after my morning B.M then I did the entire night. after the thousand thank you's the one they left out was the best proformer the bartender.
