We came here for restaurant week.  The crab cake was ok.  The signature coconut shrimp was rubbery.  Entrees were the ribs which were ordinary and seared tuna which had zero tuna taste.  Truly the WORSE part of the meal was the "dessert".  Again signature coconut cake and chocolate brownie with ice cream.  The Coconut cake was topped with this layer of stale coconut.  It wasn't soft and fluffy or toasted crispy.  IT WAS STALE as it had been sitting in the kitchen exposed to the elements for days!  The chocolate brownie was actually EVEN WORSE.  It was hard as a brick.  They could have very well been serving us those fake desserts many restaurants bring over at the end of the meal to show what they offer.  Save your money and go ANYWHERE else.
