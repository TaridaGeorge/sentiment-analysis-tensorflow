My roommate and I went here fir the first time today. The price was the only thing that was great. The chicken was dry, the tzatziki sauce was bland and thick, and the so called Greek dressing on my side salad tasted like cheap bottled Italian. The fries were ok, hummus was bland, and I said no onions on anything, yet onions were on EVERYTHING. needless to say, I will NOT be going here again. I can't even say that this was the McDonalds of Greek restaurants cause I would have rather eaten an McDonalds.
