Drinks are a bit over priced. The food is above average bar food. My problem is with the doorstaff; it seems like everytime we are there the doorstaff is hustling me/one of my friends about dumb stuff [IDs, expiration dates, footwear, etc.]  They also seem to have a proclivity towards abuses of power. I've seen the doorstaff get into altercations, where they clearly had the upper hand/control of the situation and still continued to use violence [for fun]. Most recently, they had a guy on the ground on Ash in a headlock and still continued to kick him. Sorry, but I need a de-stressing waterhole.
