The ambiance and service was good, but the food was awful.  Between my friends and me we ordered Sesame Chicken, Kung Pao Chicken, Kung Pao Beef, Chicken with Snow Peas and Cashew Chicken.  The only item that was decent was Cashew Chicken.  The Sesame Chicken was similar to the quality of a chicken nugget.  I think the food at Panda Express might have more flavor.
