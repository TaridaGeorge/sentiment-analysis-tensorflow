I live in a property that the management trust is in charge of and what they do around the complex is unnoticeable, and for an HOA higher than most, it's pretty frustrating.  When something did go wrong in our complex, trying to contact Corey Wells (our property manager) was impossible.  Hard to get a hold of, tries to get his secretary to keep you busy and not talk to him.  Given the run-around, find excuses not to help, and not a lot gets done, ever.  

I do not recommend this company, and if you are shopping around different property managers, do yourself and people who live in your properties a favor and find an honest, hardworking company.
