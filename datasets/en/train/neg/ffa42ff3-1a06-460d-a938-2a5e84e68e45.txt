Service is beyond sub par.  Brunette waitress who appears to be pregnant acts like taking your order is inconvenient.  My food sat in the window while the cook rang the bell over and over and she walked up and yelled "how many times are you going to ring the bell". 
Not surprisingly food was lukewarm but not poorly prepared.  Feel sorry for the kitchen since cold food and long waits clearly aren't their issue.  Several people in the bar were overserved to the point of a drunken stupor (illegal in Scottsdale).  Fight almost broke out between two men next to me.  

Needs real management.  Likely a candidate for the show Bar Rescue.
