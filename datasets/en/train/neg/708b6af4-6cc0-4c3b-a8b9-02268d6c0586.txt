Banfield is okay for routine check ups for maintenance and preventive care. That is why they offer a "wellness plan". When it comes to your animal getting sick, I would go elsewhere. It should not be called a Hopital. The doctors are there for profit only and do not show any care for your pet. The vet techs care, but the doctors don't listen to them. This place is lacking ethics when it comes down to making important decisions when it comes to your pets health.
