Went here with a group of 7 people. tried the pho and it was really SWEEEET, to much sugar & skimpy on the thin steak. I've been eating Pho for years & I've never left a place feeling so darn thirsty....MSG anyone!  Spring rolls...Welted lettuce & really oily noodles plus the peanut sauce was NASTY!! So waterd down..EWWW.. But the straw that broke the camels back was when they charged us $2 for chilli oil. We spent over $70 & bought bobas, which those were awesome in the place...WHO CHARGES FOR CHILLI OIL!!!?? With all that said, there are much, MUCH better pho restaurants in the valley....But then again, this is just my opinion.
