YAY! Scratch is the best! They have such yummy pastries and if you want to do a ladies that brunch day then say no more this is the spot to go!

I love the light items on the menu and always could find good brunch choices. Also the French/chill feel with the chalk wall and also the framed magazines on the walls is great. In Scottsdale I think it is one of the better less crowded spots that ultimately has better food than R&R or other brunch spots.
