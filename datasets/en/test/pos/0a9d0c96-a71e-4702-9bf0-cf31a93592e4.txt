I have been a part of the Simply Dentistry family since day one.  The staff there is amazing.  Now I am not one of those people who does not like to visit the dentist office.  I have found Dr. Tran to be one of the kindest and most knowledgable dentist I have ever seen.  

I have heard horror stories of people who visit the dentist and get "up saled" but I have not found that to be case here.  

The whole office is eco-friendly and is decorated in a very modern style. 

I am not sure if other dentist offices allow you to watch TV while getting your teeth cleaned but I am able to put on the Game Show network (which doesn't work to well to yell out the answers) but its still great.
