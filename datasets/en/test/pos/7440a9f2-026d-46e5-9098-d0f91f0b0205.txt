I have had my fair share of burgers and I can confidently say Delux has the best burgers in the valley. I have heard their paninis and salads are great, but if I'm going to Delux, I'm ordering the burger. 

I have been to Delux several times and their extensive beer selection, creative drinks, and consistent great service makes their experience just that much more enjoyable. 

There are hundreds of reviews, so see them for details regarding the atmosphere and specifics, but I can reassure you their burgers are the best. 

Brett is the most attentive, pleasant, and knowledgeable server I've had at Delux (July 2010).
