Tried this place out a couple weeks ago with my Fiancee. She is Vegan, I am not, but I'm very open to meat alternatives. We both really enjoyed our food. We started with the spring rolls, which had an excellent dipping sauce. I had the Jasmine Ice Tea that had a great flavor for an unsweetened Ice tea. My fiancee ordered the Sweet and Sour "Chicken" and really liked it, which is good as sometimes she does not like the fake meat. I ordered the Spicy Cha Cha, which is breaded soy shrimp. The breading was well seasoned, crispy and not greasy. I used the spring roll dipping sauce for the shrimp and would recommend getting a dipping sauce with this dish. All in all it was great experience. My fiancee's only suggestion is the have more veggie dishes not based on fake meats.
