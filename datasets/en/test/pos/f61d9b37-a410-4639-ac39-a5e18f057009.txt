Truly a special dining experience.  Spouse and I got to try each other's "tastes" for an interactive evening.  Our salad courses couldn't have been more different, but equally interesting and tasty.  Main courses as well.  I can't recommend any particular item because the menu is not set, but I can suggest trying the duck confit if they have it.
Bring a good attitude to the table and you will be rewarded with top flight food and service.  First time was so good we might go back tomorrow.
