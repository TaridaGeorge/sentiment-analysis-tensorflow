What do I dream about when I'm back in NYC? I'll tell you: the supremely delicious banh khot that's made to perfection at Little Saigon. I've never had anything like it in my life, and I only wish I didn't have to wait for summer vacation to enjoy it again.

I've loved this Little Saigon for years: it's a charming place, the people are fantastic, and yes, there are many other things on the menu that are superb. But the banh knot has captured my heart!
