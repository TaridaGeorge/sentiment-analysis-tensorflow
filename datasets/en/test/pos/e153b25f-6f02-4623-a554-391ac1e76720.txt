I ate here a couple months ago and I still think about the food, so I decided to add a review.  We tried nearly every small plate on the menu and the standouts were definitely the Soup Gyoza, Sweet Chili Wings, and the quail, which doesn't appear to be on the menu anymore.  I enjoyed Sens, but it was very small - this is an upgrade, even if it felt a little too hip to take my parents (we took them anyway).  I've seen complaints about the staff, but we had none, so maybe we got lucky.  Based on the food, I'd recommend it regardless.
