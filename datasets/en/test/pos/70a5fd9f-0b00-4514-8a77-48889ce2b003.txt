I really enjoy Pizza Picazzo.  I think the food is wonderful.  The gluten free pizza and pasta's are really good.  My family can eat from the regular menu and I can eat GF without worrying about getting ill.  GF is pricey anywhere I've gone.  I always take half home and get two meals out of it to offset the price.

The ambiance is really nice too.  

I have gotten several varieties of pasta and pizza and tend towards the southwestern flavors as I'm also intolerant to pork products.
