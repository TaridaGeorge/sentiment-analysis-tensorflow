I've used Gerald Sanchez, The Pool Steward, since I purchased a new home with a pool. I never owned a pool before, so I didn't understand what needed to happen in order to get my new pool "up to par" and maintained the right way. The Pool Steward educated me on how to maintain my pool and took care of all my problems. He was very knowledgeable and very capable. 

I would recommend the Pool Steward to everyone I know with a pool. He really cares about each pool, as if it were his own.
