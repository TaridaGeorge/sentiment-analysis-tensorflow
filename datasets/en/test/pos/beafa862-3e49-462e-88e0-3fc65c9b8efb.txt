First and for-most... Thank You Georgeann's dad! Probably collest guy ever! He took us all out to the most amazing dinner ever here! 

Everything we had was amazing! We first started off with the seafood tower that was insane! Oysters, crab, shrimp oh my! We then all ordered what cut of steak we wanted, and the most delicious sides ever. Crab stuffed mashed potatoes, need I say more? I finally understand the meaning of "melt in your mouth good!" My mouth is watering as I write this. 

I may never have the opportunity to go back, but I want to make sure to recommend City Hall, to anyone and everyone that is looking for a fantastic meal that is gonna cost you a bit. More than worth it!
