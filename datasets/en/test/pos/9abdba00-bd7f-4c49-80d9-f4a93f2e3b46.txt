Just went there tonight, it was great, chic restaurant, great service.
The Veal was really good but the dessert part was the best, had the Tiramisu, just wished the portion was a bit bigger but it was probably the best Tiramisu I've ever had.

Also, if you're planning to get the whole roasted chicken, beware, it is a WHOLE chicken but very good though.
