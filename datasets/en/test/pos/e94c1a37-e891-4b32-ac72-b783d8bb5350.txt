When you absolutely have to have seafood, this is the place. I've eaten here many times, and have never had a bad meal. Excellent service. Great ambience. If you go for the bar scene, be aware that it's DARK in there. If that's OK, you'll like it. Great wine list! I have not been back since the chef moved to Eddie V's new operation at the Waterfront (Wildfish...which is also excellent, by the way), so I can't say what, if any, impact that has had on the food coming out of the kitchen.
