Awesome happy hour!! The drinks are great...even the basic margarita is delicious! Chips and salsa are fresh! Carne asade tacos that I had we're very good and would definitely have them again.  The service was pretty incredible considering the amount of people that were on the patio.  The patio is so pretty with the lighting and water flowing around you.  Nice that there is such a great place for even local Phoenecians to hang out at!!
