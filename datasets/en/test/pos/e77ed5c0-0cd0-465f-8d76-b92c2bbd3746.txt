Ya know going to the dentist can be intimidating, but I have to say, MY DENTIST Dr. Bradley Brittain, makes it a positive experience. He will explain his treatment plan and YOU take it from there. Our family sees him on a regular basis and we have great dental care.  It's a very happy office.  The staff know their patients who are always greeted by name,  We like it there.
