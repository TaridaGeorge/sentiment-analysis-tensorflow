My family is from Israel and over the years we've enjoyed a lot of fantastic Middle Eastern food. Eden's Grill has some of the BEST in town. Authentic, reasonably priced, and made with love and tradition. I've never had anything there that I didn't like. This one of my favorite places to send people.
