I went in here while waiting for my reservation at the pizzeria. I ended up buying 2 bottles of wine and a $40.00 dollar dog  collar! The wine was less expensive! This is a very cute high end grocery and the desserts are so good I almost dropped dead! The peanut butter pie is to die! The parking sucks but you can valet if needed! I have never had bad service and I am not a high end kinda of person. I am from Indiana for Gods sakes! I have had always respectful and polite service!  I like this grocery, its cute and Phoenix needs this place!
