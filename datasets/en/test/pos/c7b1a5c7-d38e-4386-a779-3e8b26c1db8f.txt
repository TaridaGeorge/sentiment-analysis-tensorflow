Big variety! They even have creosote bushes. If you have lived in Phoenix and had the privilege of knowing what it smells like after a good rain in the desert, you will appreciate this. The smell that is so unique to Phoenix rain is from the creosote bushes. It's incredible. I love it. I love it. I love the smell so much that I bought 2 bushes and have planted them at my home... Eagerly awaiting the next rain. 

The staff at Baker's are great. Very helpful and pleasant. You get the feeling that the employees love working there. 

GIFTS! They have pots, vases, lawn decorations, and of course plants. I recommend supporting our local nursery (and not the Big Orange box down the street from them) and giving the gift of life (I know cheesey, but plants are living!) for birthdays, Christmas, Kwanzaa, Easter, etc.
