Oh how I love this place. The food is fantastic and you diffently get plenty of it! This is the only place to go in Arizona for chicken fried steak. My girlfriend had the rib-eye lastnight and it was pretty good, but like I said this place is best known for the chicken fried steak and mashed potatos.
