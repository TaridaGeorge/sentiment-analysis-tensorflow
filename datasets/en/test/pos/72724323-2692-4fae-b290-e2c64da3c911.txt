What's that you say? A VEGAN going to a Brazilian Steakhouse? How can this be? 

Two Words: SALAD BAR! 

Set in a Fine Dining Atmosphere Fogo De Chao offers a Pristine Salad Bar fit for a Vegan Queen. Choices like Brazilian Hearts of Palm, Whole Shitake Mushrooms, Jumbo Asparagus, Whole Artichoke Hearts, Sun Dried Tomatoes, Butter Lettuce and the list goes on and on. 

Some of the traditional side dishes are also vegan safe like the fried bananas and also the fried polenta with no cheese. Both are very delicious! 

Trust me you wont leave hungry. I've been twice now and would gladly dine here again anytime!

P.S.  The staff was incredible, our service was flawless and, we were completely taken care of every second of our visit.
