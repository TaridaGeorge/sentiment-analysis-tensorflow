My kids (ages 6 and 2) love the pool and are more confident swimmers, thanks to the great staff & swim instructors at Hubbard Swim.  We switched them over to Hubbard last year.  The repetitive skills / lessons each week helps re-enforce what the kids need to master in each swim level.  My children are also very excited when they receive ribbons for completing various skills &/or swim levels.  This positive reward system has been a great motivator for my kids, keeping them interested in swimming.

I also find the online make-up scheduler very convenient.  Juggling three schedules is never an easy task, but Hubbard Swim has made this a stress-free process.  Even switching swim class days/times has been a positive experience, especially when our after school activities keep changing around.
