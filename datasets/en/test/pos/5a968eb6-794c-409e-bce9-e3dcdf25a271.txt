Stayed here one night while traveling to Phoenix for business.  What a cool hotel!  I've never stayed anywhere like this.

I didn't experience the 50's personally, but this place has really kept and captured that essence.  (And yes, it's been renovated.  This place was built in the 50's but it's not run down or anything like that.)

The room was nice, the pool looked great (never got to go...), the service was impeccable, the food at Zuzu was very good.  Old town Scottsdale is right around the corner, with great restaurants and bars.  What's not to like?
