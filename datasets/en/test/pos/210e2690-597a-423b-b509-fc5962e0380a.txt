Went back again last week and had their pastrami sandwich. It was one of the best i have had in a looong time. The meat was fresh and tender "none of that stringgy crap that alot of places sell"
Anyway the whole meal and side potato salad was top quality home made food that is hard to find anywhere around these parts.
