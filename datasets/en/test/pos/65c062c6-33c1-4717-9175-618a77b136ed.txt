Great selection for around the world. Diverse produce, meat and seafood.   All of the seafood had the country of origin. Everything was fresh, neat and clean. I can do all my regular shopping here, with the exception of toiletries.Only because I prefer my American scents, not for lack of selection. They even give you free ice to schlep your seafood and meat home at a decent temperature. 
I can't say anything bad about this place, except I would like it to be closer to my house.
