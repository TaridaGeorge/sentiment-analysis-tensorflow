This may be my favorite Chinese restaurant. I love noodles a lot, and these are quite good. Watching the noodles being made, chowing down on squishy noodles, sipping awesome fruit smoothies (try the Honey Peach, it's super awesome, especially in July)--it's just a really great experience overall and I never get tired of coming here. Even my wary-of-Asian-food mom and grandma love it here. I enjoy it a great deal and I'd say this is a very solid choice if you're in the mood for inexpensive Chinese food.
