Found this only thanks to my GPS - was looking for food on the fly of a healthy variety.    Sandella's manager that day was uber-courteous and happy to answer my questions about the origins/quality of their food.  

The buy most of their produce from local farmers.  Their whole wheat flatbread pizza was very satisfying.  I had a sweet/spicy Brazilian chicken pizza.  It was ready very quickly!  The manager apologized for not having organic, but pointed me to the nice organic lemonade in the cooler.  

I'm glad I found a guilt-free, delicious pizza for 6 bucks.  Stop in and give these guys a go!
