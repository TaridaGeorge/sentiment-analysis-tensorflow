I am loving Jamba Juice right now! I have been here a few times in the last couple of weeks and have loved everything I have ordered. I also like that you can add a boost to the drink to make it even more nutritious! The boosts include probiotic, flax, fiber, calcium, extra vitamins and minerals, whey protein, antioxidants, soy protein and an immunity boost! Both the juices and smoothies I have tried have been awesome. 
The staff at this location are great always friendly and fast.
