Took my grandmother here who was visiting from back east and we had such a delightful afternoon. There was a wine tasting that was fabulous. I actually bought a bottle from NC that tasted like tobacco (sounds gross but it was excellent). We sampled the watermelon beer, had a cappuccino which was excellent, and got a few salads and sandwiches for lunch. And of course we sampled ALL the olive oils. My husbands favorite was the chocolate olive oil and I liked the gourmet dipping olive oil.

It was way way too hot to sit outside but the grove of olive trees and picnic tables outside looked so inviting. I can't wait to return in the fall when it cools down!
