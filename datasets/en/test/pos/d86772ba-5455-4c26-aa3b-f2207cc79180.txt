Favorite wine bar I've seen in my life so far. The happy hour is fantastic any day ($5 glasses of wine?! can't beat that) Postinos is probably the main reason we didn't want to move away from Phoenix. It's a great date place with a great atmosphere. It can get quite crowded so, go early. But even if you have to wait, I still think it's worth it. There is no bad seat in the house. Parking can be annoying, but they do have valet. We usually parked on a side street near by (but be careful, some of the side streets you can't park on). Both locations are just as good. Bring one to Chicago please! I miss this place and will definitely be back every time I come back to visit!
