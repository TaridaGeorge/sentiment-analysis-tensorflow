I live across the street from this place and which I had gone when I first moved in.  I've been several times now and would like to consider myself a "regular"  I can come and and see Amanda and she knows exactly what I want.  THE CHORIZO BISCUITS AND GRAVY.  That stuff is amazing.  My last time there, the owner sat down with us and talked to us about how to make the gravy.  He clearly knows his food and loves what he does.  Kind of a random location, but def worth stopping in.
