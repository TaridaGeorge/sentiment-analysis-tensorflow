Working at a dance studio I can almost get away with just wearing Lululemon everyday, all day. Their clothing is the highest quality. I've worn my Wunder Unders at least twice a week for 3 years now and they still look great. If you can afford it do it and if you can't afford it do it anyway, like me!
