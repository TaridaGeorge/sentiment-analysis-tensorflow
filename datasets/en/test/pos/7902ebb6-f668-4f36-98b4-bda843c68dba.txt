I love me some Wildflower Bread Company.  Great Caesar salad and their soup selection is great, I would recommend the Broccoli Cheese soup.  This location is very nice, but I wish they had more locations, because I always have to drive to get to one.  The lemonaides are really good too and they bake their bread daily.
