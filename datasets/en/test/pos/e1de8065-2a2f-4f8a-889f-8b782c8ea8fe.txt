What a park! It could be a big league park. So spacious and clean.

Easy parking. I think it was $5 and there are people in golf carts carrying you back and forth. Everyone was really kind. We sat in the lawn and it was huge. You could arrive after the first pitch and still have room. The angled it perfectly, everywhere you could see.

Also, I was highly impressed with the presence of Diamondback players signing autographs and interacting with fans. (Giants really need to step up) If you are going to Spring Training make sure to see this field.
