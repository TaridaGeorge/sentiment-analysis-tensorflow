I adding this as a 5 stars cause Subway is a Subway, if you are into the subs they taste just as good as any other location, they are not greedy on meat or toppings and the 5 stars comes as this location is now open 24 hours!!! You are going to find people who dont enjoy where they work anywhere you go in the food industry.
