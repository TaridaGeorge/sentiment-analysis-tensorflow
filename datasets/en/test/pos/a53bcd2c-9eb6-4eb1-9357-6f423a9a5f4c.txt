Been going here for lunch 2 times day since I was turned on to the place sad part is I work in downtown Glendale but never went around the different neighborhoods to explorer! But back to this place, WOW great food and YES all the food is killer, don't go in there thinking this is the place for a light snack NO! this place feeds you well.

The staff AKA husband and wife are super nice and fun to talk with, don't forget to try one of there cooking classes too.
