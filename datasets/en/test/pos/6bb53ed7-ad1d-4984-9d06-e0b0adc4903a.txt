This is one of those places that need to be experienced first hand.  The atmosphere, food, drink and service are some of the best here in the Phoenix area.  I've only been to  the one here in Mesa, but hear the one in Tempe is equally amazing (just more compact).

Do yourself a favor though.  Wait to sit outside.  It can get kinda hot inside.  Otherwise, enjoy!
