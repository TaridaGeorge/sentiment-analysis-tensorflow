Went back last Friday night.  I really think Bobby Qs has some of the very best BBQ in town.

The ribs again, were amazing.  The shoestring fries and wedge salad were to die for.  And that corn on the cobb thing, amazing.  The Brisket was top notch and Delicious.

I had to bump it up a star because it is really very good BBQ and service has always (so far) been great.
