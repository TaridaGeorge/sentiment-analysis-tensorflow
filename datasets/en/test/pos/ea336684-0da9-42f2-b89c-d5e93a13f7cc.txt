I'll be very honest...the only reason I went here on a recent trip to Phoenix is because of Man vs. Food.

Having said that...the food I had was awesome!  I got the original Jewish Brisket Sliders and it is a Jewish guy's wet dream.
Three sliders made with Challah (nice!), deliciously tender brisket (nice!), crispy latke (double nice!), and an onion ring (chaching!).
All served with natural cut fries and some brown gravy.

The only way this would have been better is if it was served up by a half-naked Natalie Portman (you have to keep health codes in mind).

Can't wait to get back to Phoenix and go to Chompie's again!
