Baker Nursery is a Phoenix institution.  The original Mr. Baker is now 86 years old (as of 2008), and still lives on the premises, although his daughters and the other employees do most of the work.  It's frequently a busy place, but they always have time for a chat and whatever friendly gardening advice you may need.   The selection of roses especially (during the proper planting time in the spring) is first class.  The prices are somewhat higher than the big-box stores, but because the plants are well cared-for they are more likely to survive, and you can feel proud to be supporting a real honest-to-goodness family business that has been decades in the making.
