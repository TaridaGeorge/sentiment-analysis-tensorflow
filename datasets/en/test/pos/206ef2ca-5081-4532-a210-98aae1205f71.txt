The food at Village Tavern is consistently delicious, the service is quick, and the prices are reasonable.

It's a gorgeous steakhouse, (I suggest the Flank Steak) the wine selections are varied, and you can get a great Sauvignon Blanc or a Pino at a good price. 

Overall, I love this restaurant and will continue to go there until I have a bad experience, which I haven't had yet. LOVE IT.
