From the outside I did not know what to expect, but once inside you are blown away. This museum is much more than meets the eye and has something for everyone.

We did the Living Social deal to get a membership and on our first visit, even though we hadn't sent us the membership card yet, they still let us in no questions asked with our printed voucher. The museum was not overrun and there was so much to see. The gold panning was one of my favorite spots in the whole place and instantly made me think this would be an awesome place for our son's birthday, once he was old enough. 

Great spot for families and anyone who just gets a kick out of history and science, I cannot wait to go back.
