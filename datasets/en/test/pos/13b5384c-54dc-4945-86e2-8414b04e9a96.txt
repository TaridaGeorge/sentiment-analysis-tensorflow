AJ's is not for the cheap grocery visit, but it is a wonderful store.  The meat counter is second to none.  They are very helpful and everything is top quality.  My favorite thing there is all the prepared foods.  From the Deli Salads, Pizza, Sandwiches, Pastries and coffee this place is fantastic.

Things to Get:
  - Kobe Burgers
  - Veggie Pizza
  - Make your own Pasta on Thursdays
  - Deli Salads
  - Brownies
