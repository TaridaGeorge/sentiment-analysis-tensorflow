Quite simply, the best mens's haircut in the valley.  This GEM of a barbershop is nestled into a strip mall behind a Circle K convenience store.  You would only know about this barbershop if you happened to pass by which is unlikely given how embedded they are into Sun City.  Anyways, pass this one up at your own expense!  

The haircuts are all $10 and less, and the barbers are old-time pros that know their stuff.  JJ is the owner, he is the gent working the #1 chair when you walk in.  He does a great cut for adult and child alike and my son always asks for Mr. JJ.  

Robert is on the #2 chair, and he is a consumate professional barber.  He will send you out with a great haircut every time!

Go to save a buck or two, and keep going back because they rock!
