Maybe I'm completely biased because the people who own this place are friends of mine, but I think I'm being pretty honest. This is a great record and candy store with lots of odds and ends, rarities, and local art. My pal Stacy makes hand puppets and things for them and a couple other friends also make healthy home-made dog treats, too. A great addition to the Grandevelt block next to the Bikini Lounge and of course, the ever-wonderful Trunk Space. Go support awesome local businesses, guys!
