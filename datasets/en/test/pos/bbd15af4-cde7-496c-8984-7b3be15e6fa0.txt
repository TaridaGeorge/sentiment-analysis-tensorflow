Changing Hands is the ONLY bookseller I will EVER go to in this city. The staff is fantastic, the atmosphere is amazing and you will always get a great price. The events that they hold are unparalleled - I have met some of my favorite authors there. 

True Story:A few years ago, I was looking for a hard to find book, and had checked out B&N, Borders, Bookmans, and I couldn't find it anywhere. I walked into Changing Hands and asked for it. They  special ordered it for me and didn't charge me until I picked it up. Great, great helpful bookseller.
