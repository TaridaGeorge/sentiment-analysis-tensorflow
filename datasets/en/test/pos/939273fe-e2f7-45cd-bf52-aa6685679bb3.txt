This place is legit. Straight-up dive pool hall. And I LOVE it.

I came here with a friend for the first time last week to shoot some pool. The place was pretty busy and it seemed to have a good amount of regulars. One guy even offered to help us out since it was our first time there. Get here early if you want a 8-foot table. Best part - to get a rack for a table is only $3 for the entire night!

We showed up around 10 and since the tables were taken, we jumped on a 7 foot table and played a few. 

The drinks were good and cheapish and the bartender was really friendly- always adds a star in my book. 

I'll definitely be back here.
