Bamboo Cafe has some of the best Chinese food in the Glendale - north Peoria area.  The ingredients are high quality and the food is delicious.  I especially recommend the orange chicken which contains nice size pieces of white meat chicken with no gristle, fat, or access breading (like most other chicken dishes I've had at other Chinese restaurants).  The portions are large and the prices are great!
