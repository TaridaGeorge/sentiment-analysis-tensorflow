This was our second evening at Chelsea's Kitchen.  It was outstanding!  The tuna tar-tar was amazing.  We had the fish tacos and the scallops special - all perfect portions and cooked perfectly.  The staff at Chelsea's Kitchen is so pleasant - it makes the evening great.  We finished off the evening with the red velvet cake - what a treat.  Kate, the assistant manager, was gracious and remembered us from the last time we were there over 2 months ago.  Overall - an outstanding evening - great food - great friends - great staff.  Thank you Chelsea's Kitchen!!
