Oh PastaBAR - how I do love thee!

I had a marvelous pre-theatre dinner at PastaBAR last Saturday evening, and I wish I could beam myself there right now and relive the meal.

We started with drinks. Go for their daily infusions. I had strawberry, and it was delicious. 

Next, we shared their version of a caprese salad: Buffalo Mozzarella, basil pesto, heirloom tomatoes, anchovies. The mozzarella melts in your mouth!

For my entree, I had the Chitarra alla Amatriciana...guanciale, onion, parsley, hot pepper, tomato ... Yum! 

If you're in the downtown Phoenix area, please take advantage of this local gem!
