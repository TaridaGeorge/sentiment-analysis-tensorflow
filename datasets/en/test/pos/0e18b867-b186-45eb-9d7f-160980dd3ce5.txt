Went there as an out-of-towner and really enjoyed my breakfast. I had the pork carnitas skillet and it was delicious. After being disappointed with the carnitas at an actual Mexican restaurant, I was quite impressed with that skillet. I also took the recommendation with regard to the fresh baked raisin toast, and that also held up to the recommendations listed here. I tried a bit of the bran muffin and that too was to die for. I cant think of anything negative to say about anything during our visit. We even had a little laugh at the check that says "crakers copy" at the bottom. I'd definitely return and recommend this place to anyone for a delicious breakfast.
