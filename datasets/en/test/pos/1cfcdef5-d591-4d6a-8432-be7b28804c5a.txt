i didn't think my little red pickup would make it up the hill. it kept going up and up and up, and then....we were at the top! for the Yelp event!!!!

the restaurant was beautiful. all the food provided by the restaurant was excellent. my favorites were the lobster bisque and the scallops. the cheese station with various olive, artichoke, sun-dried tomatoes, etc was also very tasty. 

of course the name sake sells it all. stunning overlooks of the valley on this crystal clear night. fire pits dotted the patio area, with several seating areas to offer different options.

it was our first time here and we were thoroughly impressed!
