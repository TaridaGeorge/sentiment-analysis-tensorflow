This is my favorite fine dining in town.  I only go here 2 or 3 times a year because it's a little pricey for dinner, but wow, what great food!  Dessert is awesome here too, love the Sundae.  I just went here for my birthday last week and it still lives up to expectations although they don't carry my favorite anymore (double cut grilled pork chop).  They might start carrying it after they move to their new location though, here's hoping!  If you're looking for a classy place with great dinner dishes then this place is highly recommended, just please dress accordingly and don't try wearing a hat, not allowed!
