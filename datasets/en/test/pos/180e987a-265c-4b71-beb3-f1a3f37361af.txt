Sometimes I feel it is hard for a restaurant to meet up with standards that are set so high.  Kai was just named by OpenTable (FWTW) as one of the top 100 restaurants in the USA.  I've been to Kai a couple times since it open, but it still exceeds expectations on food, service and experience.

From the moment you arrive, the staff takes care to bring you along the journey with every attention looked over.  The view of sunset against the mountains sets the stage for food that is just incredible.  Plus their vodka selection might be the best in the Southwest.

When you want to have a special meal for special people, Kai is worth every penny and will be an experience everyone will remember.
