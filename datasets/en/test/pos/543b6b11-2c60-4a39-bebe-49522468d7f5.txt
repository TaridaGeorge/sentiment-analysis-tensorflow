Churn is awesome! Old fashioned ice cream parlor done right! I love the design, super fun! It is any kid or in my case big kid's dream to have a place like Churn right next door to Windsor. You can enjoy food and drinks and then walk right over to fill your sweet tooth craving after a yummy savory meal. Loved the choice of flavors, all very unique and delicious. The wide array of candy choices was definitely a hit for my kiddo. Definitely a fun spot that is MUST to visit!
