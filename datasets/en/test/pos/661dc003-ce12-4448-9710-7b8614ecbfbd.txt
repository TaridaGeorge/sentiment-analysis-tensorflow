Update: I was contacted by the museum regarding my visit and they cleared up the problem with the security guard. I was very impressed at the amount of care that they took in addressing my situation. 

I rarely attend museums, but decided to go because the girlfriend wanted to. I'm an acrylic painter and all the art on display was beautiful and varied. The building itself was gorgeous. The only problem I had was the security guards. We were constantly followed by a heavyset black man and stared at regardless of where we went. I believe in no way did we look suspicious, had the guest stickers visible. We were just two people looking at some great art. Yet, he was hovering around enough to spoil the experience for us.
