OMG you have to try the green chili shredded beef burritos!! Even if we don't have to stop for gas I have to stop for one of these! They are fresh and I think are homemade. They also have many other HOT items to choose from which look yummy but I'm hooked on the burrito :)

Bathrooms are generally clean, they have fun things out in front of the store to purchase for your yard which I love to check out while there. Employee's are always nice and happy to see you.  It's a great place to stop for gas or food in Gila Bend.

Oh and when I checked in I received $.10 off per gallon of gas.. which just makes it a better place to stop!
