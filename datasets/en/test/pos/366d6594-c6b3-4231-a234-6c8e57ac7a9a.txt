Five stars because: 
1. Way cheaper than AMC, especially Westgate. 
2. Seats are more comfortable, you're able to lean back much more comfortably
3. Souvenir cups and t-shirts make frequent movie going much more affordable! 
4. Harkins is a family owned Arizona business. Let's keep it local!
5. Staff is great; always smiling. 
6. Student price is still $5.50.
