I really enjoyed my first visit to Cibo.  I loved the location (as others have said, a converted house in downtown).  I have never had such good service...anywhere.  I drank a sip from my drink, it was refilled.  I was left alone to chat with my friend and no one hounded me to leave.  I really liked the pizza (I had the mushroom) and the house salad was delicous.  I normally am a ranch kind of girl and drown all my pizza and salad in it, but I did not miss it at all.  I scarfed up the bread, salad, and pizza without a second thought.  It lived up to the expectations set by all my friends that have eaten here before and raved.  So yummy!
