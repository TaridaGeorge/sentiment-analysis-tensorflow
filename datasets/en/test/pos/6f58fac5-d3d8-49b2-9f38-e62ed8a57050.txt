YUM!
The food here is amazing. True Italian comfort food. Generous portions at  great prices. I have used them for catering several times and have always had a positive experience, but my experience today motivated me to Yelp. A teammate called in an order for 14 people last night. I picked up the order and when I got to work, my teammate said we were missing food and utensils and had called to have it fixed,  so I had to go back. When I got back to the restaurant, the manager advised me that the order was correct, but because there was a miscommunication, she was going to make it right and provided me the food we "thought" we were missing (discovered it was indeed our fault, not RigaTony's). I really appreciate the staff going the extra mile to make it right! And lunch was wonderful! 
Thank you!
