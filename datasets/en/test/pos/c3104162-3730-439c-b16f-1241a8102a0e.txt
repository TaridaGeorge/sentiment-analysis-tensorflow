To start, I am a complete spaz about who I let do my hair! Most of my girlfriends out here go to Michelle at Choices Salon, so I gave it a try.... She was amazing! I got exactly what I asked for and the layers which I am normally too scared to attempt (since in the past they've been butchered) looked better than I hoped for! She is gorgeous and young, so you'll know it's her when you see the tall trendy brunette when you walk-in. On a side note, she's also the one who takes walk-ins if she's not booked solid that day! She's a definite asset to the salon as well bringing in lots of younger clientele!
