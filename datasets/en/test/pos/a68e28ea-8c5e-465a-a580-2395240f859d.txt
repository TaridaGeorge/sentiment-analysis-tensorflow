I went to this place for 3 days straight while I was in town a couple of months ago, and this has to be one of the best coffeehouses I've ever been to for sitting down and getting work done. There was plenty of room, both couch-style and worktable-style. Their kitchen was completely in the open, and they made a great strawberry salad with cheese and they had fresh quiche everyday. Lastly the music was perfect enough that there were tracks I recognized and some I didn't. I'm looking forward to spending some hours here next time I visit Phoenix.
