I had a lovely time here. Came at 4 pm when their off-hour menu was being served. R had the burger with pomme frites and I had the flat-iron with matchstick fries. It wasn't busy at all so the service was quite good and attentive. The food was excellent. The atmosphere was spot on and romantic in a non-gag way.
