Nana's Sandwich Saloon is an amazing place for great food. They offer fresh daily specials that you won't want to miss. I'm usually in Wickenburg during the day, so I miss the wine tasting events they hold every 2nd Wednesday from 5:30-8:30pm, but I hear they are very popular. Wickenburg is full of old west charm and it's worth staying overnight at the Los Viajeros Inn so you can take in the feel of Arizona's history and sampling the food at Nana's Sandwich Saloon.
