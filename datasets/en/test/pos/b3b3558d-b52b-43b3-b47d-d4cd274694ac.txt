Ok, ok....they earned it. I have explored most of the menu now and there is way more to it than just burgers. Chinese chicken salad, panini grilled cheese(!), grilled chicken panini, mahi mahi sandwich, Haagen Dazs malts, a few very good wines, fun beer combinations...all very bueno. 

Plus now that I'm part of a group of regulars (that happen to tip generously, which may play a part in improved service), we get hella good service from our regular cycle of about three different guys.
