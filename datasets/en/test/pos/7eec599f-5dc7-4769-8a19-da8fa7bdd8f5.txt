Great office.  Dr. Kessler does a very thorough exam, and I've never had a problem with my prescription.  I always purchase my glasses here, and all the girls are very helpful in finding me a pair that work for my "not made for glasses" head.  However, if you're one who wants to do it on your own, like my husband, they're respectful of that as well.

Frames are more expensive than the big box optical shops, but definitely a higher quality.  Or maybe it's just me that gravitates toward the more expensive ones.  Either way, I highly recommend this office.
