This is the place for me.  As someone who struggles with the demons of greasy and heavy fast food this menu has several light, flavorful, vibrant, and healthy options.  The flavor, execution, prices, and customer service easily exceed those offered by its predecessor, Paradise Bakery.

Wildflower has earned my regular patronage and allegiance and here are the primary reasons why.

- Reasonably priced and incredibly tasty menu.  Great dishes such as butternut squash ravoili, salmon alfredo, veggie sandwich.  
- Perfect place to help mitigate my guilt when I feel like I've eaten too many burritos or burgers.
- Free Wifi.
- Great breakfast menu. (Yogurt Berry Parfait is in a parfait class all its own)
- Very accommodating staff.  They aim to please and it shows in their appearance, demeanor, and efforts to accommodate any special requests you might have.
