First time - They asked if we had been there, guess the confussed look gave us away.  They brought sample cups; gave us a few samples each; walking us though the process. They were exceptionally nice and didn't make us feel like dummys. LOL

Great service! I got strawberry yogurt with fresh strawberrys and kiwi. SOO good!
