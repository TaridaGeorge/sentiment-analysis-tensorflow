OMG, this place is great. Its clean and organized. The produce look delicious and colorful. I found items that I would not have found any other store. I wished I would have came here sooner.  I will not be shopping here all the time, but for specialty items I will visit this place. Well reading through a review from an employee that works there.....this place sounds like a terrible place to work.
