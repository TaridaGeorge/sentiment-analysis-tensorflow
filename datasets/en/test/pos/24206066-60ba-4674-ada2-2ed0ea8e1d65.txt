This is an upscale burger joint. They start you out with some homemade kettle chips then you fill out the "build your own burger" checklist. Great location, great service, modern atmosphere, outstanding quality food, and really fair prices.

*Happy hour looks to be a bargain too - I shall return...

UPDATE - I have been back many many times now, and I love their weekend BREAKFAST! They have a Bloody Mary bar! You really need to try this!
