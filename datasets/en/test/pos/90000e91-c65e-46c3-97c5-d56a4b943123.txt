This place is a new gem in the crown of the revitalized Sunnyslope.  Unfortunately I missed this place when it was Bomberos but I'm happy I found it in its current iteration as it's pretty great.

Decor wise this place is super rad, completely redone and they open up the restaurant when it's nice outside (most of the year).  There's a huge patio out back as well!

The service was fantastic and the wine selection is great!

Ok, the special.  I hope that this place doesn't get as hard to get into on Mondays as Postino is on the nights they run their specials.  Flatbread pizza and a great bottle of wine for less than the bottles cost on their own.

You've got to try this place out if you haven't been here yet!!!
