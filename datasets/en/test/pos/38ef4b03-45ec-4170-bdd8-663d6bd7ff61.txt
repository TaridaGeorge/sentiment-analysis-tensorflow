Lunchtime Sushi!!!  And make sure to get there by 11a since some days (Thurs/Fri) they fill up quick. I probably get the sushi boat every time I go here for lunch. For $9.99 you can't beat it and it's has all the variety of rolls, sushi and tempured (I know it's not a word but I'm using it) goodies(jalapeno roll). It also comes with soup and a salad. The whole boat is large enough for two people... or one hungry person ;P I've been coming here regularly at least every other week if not every week for over a year. Never gotten sick or had a bad experience. Also - ask for separate checks up front - or you'll wait for them to separate the orders out.
