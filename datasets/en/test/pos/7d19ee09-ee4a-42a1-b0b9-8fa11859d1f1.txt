Because of all the places to eat in the Phoenix metro area, if you like to move around like myself, you sometimes forget about your favorites. 

It was recently my wife's birthday and we decided to return to Fleming's on Scottsdale Road. Are we ever glad we did!

The service was outstanding (always true at this location, not so much on Pima Road) and we both love the feel of a New York Steakhouse where their is just enough noise to create a din. 

The steaks were huge and mouthwatering, done perfectly to our tastes. 

The sides were large and delicious. 

As an added touch, instead of trying to tempt us with desserts we would never eat, our waiter brought my wife a chocolate truffle for her to take home for her birthday. 

If you want a special night out, you can never go wrong at this Fleming's location.
