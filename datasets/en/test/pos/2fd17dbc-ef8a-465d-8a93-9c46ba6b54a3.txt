An oasis in the desert!

I have been a customer at Ambassador Fine Cigars for the past 5 years and I can say there is no better place to purchase and enjoy a cigar in North America. The Staff (Nick, Del, Josh, & Grady) are extremely knowledgeable and willing to assist in locating the perfect cigar or accessory. Vartan, the "Ambassador" (owner) of this fine establishment is a one of kind host! His knowledge and style are world class. The spacious walk-in humidor has everything a cigar lover could dream of and more. If you are a cigar novice or want to learn about the fine art of cigar smoking the Ambassador family will take the time to answer questions and make you feel at home. We are lucky to have one of finest tobacconists in the world in our backyard. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the good life!
