Keith takes care of his customers, he is on time and I have had no real issues with his service or professionalism.  Takes care of the bugs the first time, but if you need it he will come and respray.  The cricket issue I had was bad, but now its good, no issues.  The price is right and the service is even better.  I would recommend him to all my friends.
