I have been eating here for years, just havent had time for a review. First off I L O V E that they have a drive thru, it makes it easy for me to call in an order and pick up during my busy lunch hour. Lunch specials are great and you get alot of food for your money. I usually get the chicken chow mein or the orange chicken. both are delicious. The egg rolls and wontons are tasty as well,  sometimes I get dissapointed with bad eggrolls, not this place :) Fried rice is great and they give you wonton chips with your meal as well. I have no complaints thats why I have been going here since 2007 and will continue to go.
