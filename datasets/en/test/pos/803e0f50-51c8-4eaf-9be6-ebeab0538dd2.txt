Being from the Bay Area (in CA), and being used to quite an assortment of ethnic foods, my expectations were not super high. I was very pleasantly surprised when I walked in and it *smelled* of Asian spices and Vietnamese food! My friend and I ordered lunch for ourselves (beef pho and the beef noodle soup), which was really good. We also ordered dinner for our families, since we were in town for the Lost Dutchman swim meet and wanted to expedite dinner after the meet. 

I got two orders of the pork/egg roll with vermicelli, I also got lemongrass chicken and the beef chow fun. All of which was great! Service was quick and attentive, food was delicious and reasonably priced! 

If you are in/around Chandler, and looking for some yummy Vietnamese food, I would definitely recommend this place!
