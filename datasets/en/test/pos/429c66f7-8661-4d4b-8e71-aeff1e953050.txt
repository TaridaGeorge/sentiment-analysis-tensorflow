This is truly one of my favorite stores ever.
I started with a headband. It's now my "lucky" headband, because the tag said so and because it actually stays on my head!! 
Then I had to get the outfit to match.
Then a yoga mat- the Align mat, finally a mat that is long enough for my tall self!
And I keep buying more headbands because just one is never enough...

I have to shout out to everyone who works here too. Sometimes I pop in often for yoga or run club or clothes and sometimes I hibernate in the ac, but every time I come, one of you wonderful people say hello to me because you actually remember helping me find a race outfit, or from coming to the fantastic free classes. That's customer service. If only other stores followed suit!
