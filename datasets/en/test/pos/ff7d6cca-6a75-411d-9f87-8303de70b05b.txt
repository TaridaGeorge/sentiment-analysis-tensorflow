I have been to Grassroots twice now and have enjoyed my dining experience both times. The atmosphere is great, very comfortable and relaxed. I like the community table and the bar area, it was very lively and upbeat. The staff is very attentive and they go out of their way to ensure you are happy and every need is met. The food is fairly priced and is very good. I had the ribs last time and they were great. The hamburger is very tasty as well.
