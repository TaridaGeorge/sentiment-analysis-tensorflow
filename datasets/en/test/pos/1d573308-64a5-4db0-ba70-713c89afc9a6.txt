I just moved to the area, and my first impression of Fry's was..wow, it's JUST LIKE Fred Meyer.  Of course, reading the reviews here I totally understand why... :)  Fry's is by far the best grocery store (or.."marketplace") in the area.  The sales are better than the other grocery stores, and the self-checkout is convenient.  The only thing I wish they'd change is to allow people to use coupons directly at their self-check terminal.  There must be a way?!
