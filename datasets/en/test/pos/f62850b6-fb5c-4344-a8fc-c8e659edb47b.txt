I went to Timo for the first time last week for Happy Hour.   I will definitely be back.  The service was excellent....Amy the bartender was extremely attentive and gave great suggestions.  The spinach pesto pizza with sun dried tomatoes and carmelized onions was off the charts.  It is an intimate lounge type setting, not too loud, great music and I cannot wait for the weather to cool off because the patio looks so comfortable and cozy with a few tables for 2 nestled in the trees....truly romantic.
