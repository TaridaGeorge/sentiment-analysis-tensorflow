This is another place I would go to all the time for lunch when I worked at Shea Medical Plaza. I know you probably think that is weird, but this Sprouts has an awesome deli and tons of things ready to go. I would also find healthy snacks and beverages that I could keep at my desk like whole grain pretzels or vitamin water. Gotta seem healthy when you work at a doctors office! If I had the budget I would shop at Sprouts all the time for all my groceries, but most of my college student budget goes to the ten for tens at Fry's. EH. 

Also if you are into organic beauty products Sprouts offers a ton.
