OH.MY.WORD.

I have no idea where to begin.  Excellent dining experience! Great food.  Matter of fact, the apps and sides were the star of this meal.

The Breakdown:

Apps: 
          - Calamari. The best I've ever had. Asian inspired acccents
                               melded perfectly, and the quantity was surprisingly
                               adequate.
      - Doz Oysters. Super fresh and delishious Malpeques.
- Wagyu hot rock. Oh so tender and flavorful as it should be

Entrees:

-Sauteed Gulf 
 Snapper w/ crab. Ãœber flakey and INSANE!

-Broiled
 Swordfish w/
 truffle fries.            Yada yada yada, super delish.

Sides:

-Truffle Mac 
 and cheese.         Holy tonail shredded control top pantyhose! Rich
                                 and decadent and ridankulous!
-Brussel sprotus. With BACON?! Need I say more?
