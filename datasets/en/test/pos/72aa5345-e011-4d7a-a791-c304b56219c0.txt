Taking a long weekend out of town, we decided to review Yelp to find a good place to eat breakfast.  I can't say enough about how wonderful our experience was at this out of the way cafe.  The food was excellent.  I had a chicken enchilada with Chile Verde sauce and a fried egg (not something I would normally not get, but so glad I did).  It was to die for.  You are seated outdoors in a picnic style setting.  Our server was Shannon and she was so friendly and helpful.  After we ate, we took a leisurely walk around the grounds to see the chickens and roosters and to look at all the of the fresh produce growing in their gardens. I can't wait to visit Phoenix again to stop at this gem of a restaurant.  Try it...you will be so happy you did.
