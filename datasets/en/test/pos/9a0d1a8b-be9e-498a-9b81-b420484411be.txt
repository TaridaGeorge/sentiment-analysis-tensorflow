Two words: Delicious Delicious. 

This is the perfecto Sunday brunch spot. I haven't been any other time, so this is from whence my rating comes. 

I've had the French Dip, Chicken Salad and triple meat pizza. All three were scrumptious. Not at all once, mind you. 

Sit outside, if you can. Dine slowly, enjoying the day. Watch the trolley past by. Look around - it doesn't look like Phoenix. On Sundays, it's almost a ghost town in that part of Scottsdale. Even better. If you feel like walking, go for it. There are plenty of shops in the area (including this amazing tea store) to venture to. 

I love taking all my visitors to this place. Not only do they get to glimpse Old Town, but they also get to drink Sangria or Mimosas while having an utterly satisfying brunch.
