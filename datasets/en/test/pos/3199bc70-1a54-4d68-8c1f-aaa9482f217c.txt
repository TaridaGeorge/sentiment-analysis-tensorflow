If once a year you decide to take your friends up on their offer to go hiking next weekend, don't.
I thought it would be fun. 
It wasn't.
I was sick at the first signpost...the one in the parking area.
It never got any better. 

My lungs, inflated for the first time in years with something other than weed and cigar smoke, were seizing up like an old whore.

My legs so jittery from the experience, caused my car to lunge back and forth on the drive home, as my jimmy-leg worked both the gas and brake simultaneously.

And my feet hurt so badly, I had to soak them in ice before going out that night.

I'll be back up there next weekend.
