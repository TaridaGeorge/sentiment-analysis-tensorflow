This place is great!!  Friendly staff and quality bbq!  This is real bbq, not the stuff they throw in an oven and soaked in Liquid Smoke.  Heck, the big honking smoker is right there so you can see the food come right out of it.  In addition, the Hawg Dawg, potato skins and nachos are all absolutely amazing.  Wash it down with a PBR in a can and I am a happy girl!  

As for the Illinois BBQ comment below, they aren't from IL so not sure what he's talking about.  Also, just for clarification, BBQ started in the South but not in the Southwest!!  This is amazing BBQ and worth the drive!!
