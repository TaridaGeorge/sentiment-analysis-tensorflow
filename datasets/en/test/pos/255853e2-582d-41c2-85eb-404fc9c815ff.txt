This is the best Buffalo Wild Wings I've ever been to!

We went on a Sunday afternoon for football, right before the Cardinals game. Now, anytime I've done this before at a different BDubs, I always end up regretting not getting there sooner because it's so full! But this place is like an undiscovered gem - there were actual open tables!

The service was par for Buffalo Wild Wings: nothing special but not disappointing.

The food was also par: great!

Go here for the football games before people discover it!
