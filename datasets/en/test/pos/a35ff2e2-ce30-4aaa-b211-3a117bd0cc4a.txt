I have taken my Corvette to get the A/C fixed and also taken my Nissan to get the tires fixed and I am yet to be disappointed.  Great service, friendly staff and they do the work in a timely manner.  Also last time I went to pick up my Nissan, I discovered that they can pick you up and drop you off if you live near the area, which I do.  Its a good shop and don't forget the coupons you get in the mail, I have saved a lot of money!
