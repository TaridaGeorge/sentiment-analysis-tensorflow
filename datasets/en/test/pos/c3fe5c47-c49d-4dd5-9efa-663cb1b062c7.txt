Seams To Be Alterations is fantastic and I am so grateful to have found it. I decided to give it a try based on the wonderful yelp reviews and was not at all disappointed! The service was very friendly, the pricing is a wonderful value, and the clothes I had altered ( three pairs of designer jeans shortened with original hem) were completed very quickly. The only other thing I could possibly want was for the alterations to have been done well....and once again I was not dissappointed....everything was perfect! I will most definitely be back.
