I was quite surprised with the previous reviews on rudeness, especially when i come from a city where rudeness is part of the everyday norm.  

Our drive thru gal was very polite and sweet, without being overly sacchrine-y or fake.  Servie was quick and they were patient AND polite when naming and explaning all the breakfast sandwiches to companion who had never had one. 

Drinks great, not watered down.  Would come back in a heartbeat
