I first learned of this 'hole in the wall' fabulous gem when I was taken by the hand there by a former love last winter.  I hadn't been back until a few weeks ago and I am still in love with the YUMMY YUM YUM YUM food and smoothies they whip up.  

While dining there they make me feel like a Goddess and will act as your 'date' if you go in solo or with another girlfriend.  It doesn't hurt to have amazing company and laughter while you dive into your California Club and inhale your Breakfast Buzz!  The oatmeal is something amazing and everything is simply tasty!

The price is nice and is someplace I would take the snobbiest "Scottsdalelight" for a pleasant surprise and an amazing meal.  The portions are sharable if you are watching your wallet or waistline!
