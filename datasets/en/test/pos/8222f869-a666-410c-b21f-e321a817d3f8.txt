This is going to be the place to go in Old Town.  I had a fantastic time last Saturday.  Thomas was excellent at the bar.  He recommended the Citi-Zen martini, it was perfect, I had two.  We only had appetizers since we had dinner somewhere else, but everything around us looked fantastic.  The couple next to us was visiting from NY and they had the scallops and the chicken, both looked and smell great.  We will definitely be back with some friends.
