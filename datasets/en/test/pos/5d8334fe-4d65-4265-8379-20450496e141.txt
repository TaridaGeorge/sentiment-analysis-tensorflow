I was given a "Runner Girl" necklace as a gift and it is my favorite piece of jewelry. Debbie is a great and creative artist, adding her own special touches to each piece.  I have since purchased another necklace for a friend and will soon be working with Debbie to create a very unique piece of jewelry for someone very special. 
If you are looking for something totally unique that you would never find in a store, Spirit Box is the place to go!
