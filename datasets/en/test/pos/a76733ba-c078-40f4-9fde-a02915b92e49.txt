At One Yoga took my level of practice up a notch. The number of classes a week and the times makes it easy for anyone to work into their weekly schedule. The different types of classes gets me in the door no matter how I feel that day. If I'm tired, the basic class is perfect or if I feel like I am wanting to challenge myself with a new pose, the power or Astanga class makes me feel like I have accomplished a pratice. I also see quick results with the workout. The teachers are fantasic and are willing to help you with poses. I love it there!
