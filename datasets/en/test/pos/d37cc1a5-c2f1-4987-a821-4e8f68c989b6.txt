We have been looking for a good Asian style restaurant that fit our needs since we have moved to AZ. We heard about Asian Island through a friend and we decided to try it. The not only had all our favorites, but the prices were reasonable and all the food was very fresh. Everyone was very friendly and the overall atmosphere was very comfortable. I would recommend this to anyone who loves Asian food. I will definitely eat at Asian Island again.
