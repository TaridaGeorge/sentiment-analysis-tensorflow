I've been coming to Thai Basil for a couple of years and have been searching Tempe for good thai food. This place is awesome. It's right across the street from my dorm, and their food is cooked to order. They are super accommodating to people's tastes and very nice. You can come in for dinner with a huge party and they will do their best to fit you all together. Their dessert of sticky rice is great, the pad thai comes in a huge portion and is fairly priced, the lunch specials are great. I would say this is one of my favorites in Tempe. Being Asian I like eating some genuine Asian food from time to time and this place is great! Their thai tea is awesome enough for me to stop by during the day and grab two for myself.
