Holy shit, this place is heaven. 

The menu is a great size, the ingredients were fresh and delicious, the desserts were awesome.

Since this is a stoner themed place, the decor and names matched. It felt so cozy and friendly and down to earth there.

I cannot wait to come back here and get another sandwich. If you're a local, you should visit and enjoy - even if you're not a stoner, it is SO worth it.
