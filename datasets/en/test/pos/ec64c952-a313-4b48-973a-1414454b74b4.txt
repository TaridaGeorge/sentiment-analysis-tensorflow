I am so, SO happy that there are local coffee places popping up near my work. Until now, it's been the 'Bucks, wherever you turn.

I always get my coffee to go, so the interior isn't really a big concern of mine. The quality of the coffee is, and here, it's always top notch. The staff is very nice too.

Other perks -- they have punch card, and discounts for ASU and city employees. I'm neither. But on occasion, I answer the trivia question correctly, and get the discount that way.

I also like the fact that they make an effort to be more environmental. For instance, they use the recyclable cups, and spoons, rather than stirrers.
