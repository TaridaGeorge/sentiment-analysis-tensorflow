Fresh. 
Hand-pulled. 
Noodles. 

Not only can you watch the chef create and pull your noodles a minute after you order your dish but once he's done it takes about 5 minutes for them to reach your table. I ordered the thick, fried noodle w/ vegetables and my husband ordered the same but with the wide noodles. The noodles have a great texture that I could best describe as being slightly firm with some pleasant chewiness. The sauce was well seasoned, light and flavorful.

The restaurant is clean and bright, the prices are very reasonable, the servings are huge, the staff are fast and friendly and most importantly? It's a short drive from our house. 

This was our 1st visit and we're already big fans. We'll definitely be back!
