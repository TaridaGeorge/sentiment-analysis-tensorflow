By far one of my favorite places in the world.   Just a little cash only hole-in-the-wall cranking out a plate of tri-tip and tortillas so awesome I'm drooling as I type.   The beef = great!   The tortillas = great! (even tho they're not homemade)  The beans = great!   Everything else great!  You should go. Go Now!
