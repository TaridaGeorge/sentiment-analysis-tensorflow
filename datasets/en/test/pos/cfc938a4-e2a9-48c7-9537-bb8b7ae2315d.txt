I think it's awesome that Vintage 95 only serves beers from Arizona breweries - way to support the local team!  When I found this place on my Yelp app, I naturally assumed I'd be getting some wine but I couldn't resist trying the Epicenter from San Tan Brewery, holy mackerel - is this a delicious beer! 

To eat - I had the Warm Brie with apricot, hummus, grilled flat bred.  It was an appetizer but it was the perfect size for a quick lunch time bite.  I can't wait to go back and try some other menu items and hopefully try some wines as well

This beautiful gem has my full endorsement and I'll be bringing everyone I know here, well... the well-behaved ones anyway.
