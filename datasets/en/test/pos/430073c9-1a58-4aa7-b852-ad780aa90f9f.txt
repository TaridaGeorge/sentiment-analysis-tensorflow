The Turkey sandwhich was one of the best i've ever had! D'lish is a hidden gem in Scottsdale! Very small, but cozy inside. I tried the turkey sandwhich, and had some ice tea to accompany it! By far one of the best lunches i've had! The service was excellent, I know I will be going back when I visit Arizona again.
