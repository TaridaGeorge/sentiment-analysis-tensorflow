This is my second visit to Sami's and I love it. I was here last week and had the original beef, and wow was that good, so i figured let me try them again. 

Today i had the Gyro and my wife had the salad and falafel(sp??), the gyro was absolutely delicious and plentiful, the yogurt sauce reminded me of being back in Chicago, that is really good. My wife enjoyed her salad, it was fresh and crisp, the falafel were very good. I am not sure what they should really taste like, but we will get them again. 

The counter girl was very nice and caring, I would defiantly go back to this place again. Keep up the good work. THANK YOU.
