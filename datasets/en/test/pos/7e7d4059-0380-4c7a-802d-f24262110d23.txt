What a treasure this place is. The Pasty is easy; they take amazing stuff and cook it in pastry dough. There's a big, big menu, and it's easy to pick what you will like. There's enough detail in the description that if you like the filling, you'll like the pasty. 

Great bar and lots nice salads and apps. Try the oven chips. 

Sit at the near end of the bar and watch them make these pockets. Amazing.
