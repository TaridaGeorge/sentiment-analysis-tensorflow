Love this place. It's one place in the valley where you can get decent Chinese food! I do agree with some of the negative comments concerning the owner. She is very rude! However the wait staff is friendly. The egg rolls are a little strange tasting. The orange chicken is yummy, the egg fu yung is wonderful and I love the egg fried rice. Great place!
