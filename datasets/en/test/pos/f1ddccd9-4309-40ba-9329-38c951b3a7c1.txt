I live in Los Gatos but spend time in Scottsdale. I gotta tell you that this place is fantastic and worth while visiting if you are up in the Carefree/Cave Creek area. The owner is the nicest person you could ever meet and her staff is very helpful. I love it and always stop by for @$$ kicking Hot Stuff!
