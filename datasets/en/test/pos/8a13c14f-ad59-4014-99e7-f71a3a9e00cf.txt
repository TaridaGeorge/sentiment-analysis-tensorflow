Woohoo!.  Yes, it is that good.  A trip to Melrose is not "just another errand."  Fantastic people, prices are as good as a corporate pharmacy, so many good points...but the best about Melrose is simply that they make you feel special.  That is enough for me!  One other thing...it "smells' like an ole-time pharmacy.
