So pleased with the team here at this location. Great servers with positive welcoming personalities and excellent service. We travel a good amount and find various Cracker Barrel's to dine at and we chose to return to this one three times. Who ever trains the staff here has a great approach because you see consistent employee service. definitely go back when we return to the Mesa area.
