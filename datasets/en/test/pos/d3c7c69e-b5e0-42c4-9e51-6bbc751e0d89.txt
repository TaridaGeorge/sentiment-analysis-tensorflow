The airport is easy to navigate around and...wait for it...free wifi. I'm not sure how all of you feel about not being connected, but I was in heaven when I realized that there was free wifi available at this airport. The downside is that you can't use it within restaurants. You have to be in the open seating area. Good on you Phoenix, good on you.
