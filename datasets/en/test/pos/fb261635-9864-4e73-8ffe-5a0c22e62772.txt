Great place to eat seafood, now i'm from Alexandria, Egypt on the meditteranean born and raised, so sea food is in my blood, i was very impressed with this place, the rockefeller oysters were great, and the atmosphere is very cool.

The place is a bit loud and busy but that just adds to the experience!
