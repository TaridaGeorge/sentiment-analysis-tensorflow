Went there to exchange/return a bag that we got for Christmas.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  Too bad we didn't see anything we liked, so they offered to give us merchant credit that we can use online or use it next time or if we see something online since we didn't see anything we like this time, that we don't have worry carrying the bag that we want to return back and forth.  Very nice, now that is customer service.
