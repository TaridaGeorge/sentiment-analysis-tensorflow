I feel pretty lucky to have found this place. As a recent Chicago transplant I had low expectations but must say this place does it right. Huge menu, lots of great choices.
I have only had a few of the sandwiches so far and they have both been delicious. The cheesesteak and the chicken parm.
Can't wait to go back and try more! 
If they start baking porchetta I might move in.
