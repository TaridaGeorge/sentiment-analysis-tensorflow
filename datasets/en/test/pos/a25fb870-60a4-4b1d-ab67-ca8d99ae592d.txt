Big juicy burgers cooked to perfectoin with Sangria, bomb beer battered fries, and even their chili is delicious. Their chicken sandwich is hot and juicy served on an amazing bun. I really think buns matter on an awesome american meal. I've been here many times and service is always fast and friendly. I love the ambiance and coziness of the whole establishment. You will always see a regular at the bar with a beer and a sports game on.
