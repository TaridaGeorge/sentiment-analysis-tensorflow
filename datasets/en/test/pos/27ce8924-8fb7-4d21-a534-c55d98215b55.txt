First off, realize this is not a pricey or dressy-type place, it is a casual, neighborhood restaurant! I've been dining here since 1991 and this place has CONSISTENTLY provided quality meals and great service. If you can count, that's about 22 years of good eats and affordable dine-out on a budget. The meals are authentic, no China Panda s***t here, no 'fusion' BS, either.

The chrysanthemum tea is excellent, and I recommend their bar if you're looking for a decent drink at a modest price. The layout hasn't changed since 1991, and I have reason to believe they haven't updated much of the furniture, but I go there to eat, not to gawk, so I'm good. I recommend this place to any foodie looking for a more exotic, yet authentic meal. Their lunch specials rock, unless you can do better elsewhere for six bucks!
