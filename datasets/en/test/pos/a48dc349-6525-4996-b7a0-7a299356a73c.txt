This place is fabulous!!!!!

What we had:
pulled pork sandwich, salmon special, salad with avocado and blue cheese, and chicken cacciatore.  We split a bottle of wine. For dessert we tried the carrot cake, homemade ice-cream, and lemon bar.
Everything was fresh and delicious!

The only thing that didn't work was the evenings signature cocktail- vodka, cucumber, and ginger ale.   Everything else was perfect though.

I can't wait to return!
