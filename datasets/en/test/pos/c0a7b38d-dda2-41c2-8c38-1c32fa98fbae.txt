We left the Cardinals game early so we could get a good seat and i am glad that we did. We had Josh as our waiter and he really knew his stuff and had a great personality. As always the beer selection was overwhelming but thankfully you can never really go wrong with a good waiter. I had the Cuban Dip, the sweet tomatoes and the pickles beautifully were beautifully complemented with the Au je sauce. My boyfriend got a half rack of ribs that literally fell of the bone with the first bite. The BBQ sauce was very tasty. But i think the best thing about the meal was the creme of corn. Neither one of us were a fan of creme of corn but this was magical. ;)
