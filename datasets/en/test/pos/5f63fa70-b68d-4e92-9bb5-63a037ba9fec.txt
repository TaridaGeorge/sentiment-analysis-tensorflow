If you've been to Jamaica and enjoyed the food, then this place is a MUST GO!!!  The food was great and even though the place is kinda hard to find (On Broadway b/w 16th and 24th), all you have to do is give them a call and they'll direct you.  They are cash only as some other yelpers have mentioned but I did not find the place dirty like some of the other yelpers.  

Bottom line, if you're craving some real island flavor  and you love Jamaica like I do....Irie Jamaican Cafe is definitely IRIE!!!
