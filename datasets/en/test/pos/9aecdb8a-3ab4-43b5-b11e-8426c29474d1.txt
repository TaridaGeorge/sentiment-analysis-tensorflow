Called the Scottsdale Az location from STL to send my son who works in Scottsdale a Birthday present. The person I talked to was so helpful in finding the right arrangement for me. It was delivered to my son's office and he was thrilled.  Beautiful, yummy  arrangement, and he was able to share with the people in his office.  Thanks so much EA..
