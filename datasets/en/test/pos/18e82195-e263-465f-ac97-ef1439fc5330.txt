It's a Waffle House, what are you expecting. Yeah, it's bit sketchy-looking. The food is always great and served within 15 minutes of ordering. Oh and need I remind you of the cheap prices. My husband will walk out of there spending less than 20 bucks and when we hit up WH we eat like it's our last meal. 

Can't wait to go back!
