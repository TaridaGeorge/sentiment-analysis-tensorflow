When I bought my house, I was told I would have to look forward to some major plumbing issues, which could come with a hefty price tag. I was quoted from another source a very high number, but am I glad I was referred to Hansen's Plumbing Service. They came in, scoped everything out, and gave me an honest idea of what I was looking at. They charged me less than some of the others, and didn't need to tear up my whole front yard like some of the others were suggesting. A year and a half later, no plumbing problems whatsoever. I highly recommend their services - they are honest, fair, experienced and skilled, something you don't find much these days from others in this line of work.
