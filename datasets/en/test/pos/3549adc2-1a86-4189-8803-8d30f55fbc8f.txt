I love this place, I worked here 20 yrs. ago when it was Resort Suites of Scottsdale. Only negative is the Graze restaurant, not a very good selection of items to choose from, especially when you are catering to families staying here, I tried only two items and was not overly impressed with food or prices, but I'm sure there will be those that disagree with me.  I especially love the staff, from Ben and Megan at the front desk, Nayda at the restaurant, Steve in Golf, Holly in sales and my all-time favorite is Birdie and her housekeeping staff.  We are here on the extended stay and everyone is just wonderful.
