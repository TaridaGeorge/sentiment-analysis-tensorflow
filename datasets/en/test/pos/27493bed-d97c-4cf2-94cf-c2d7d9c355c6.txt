Yummm! A quick salad  (my favorite is the Mediterranean) and iced tea on a hot day, it's always fresh and the staff is always fab! I still rate it the best lunch spot  on my list.

If your one to partake in dessert, try the delicious chocolate cake.  It's even better than it looks and it is beautiful!
