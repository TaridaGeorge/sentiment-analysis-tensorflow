Yelp, get with it, please....Checker on 7th St is now O'Reilly & that's who I'm trying to write a review for.....thanks! :)

In any case, I came in to the 7th St location today as my battery was sputtering & on its last breath and that's where I'd bought it previously. Sue was the employee helping me & was patient enough to look under several different phone numbers to see if my battery was still under warranty. It wasn't (groan in my head, money signs in front of my eyes) but she did me a solid & applied it to my case so that instead of paying $100 for the new battery, I was only out $60. 

Beyond her willingness to help me, she was friendly & quick. I definitely recommend this location to anyone looking for help who's car savvy and maybe not so car savvy (me).
