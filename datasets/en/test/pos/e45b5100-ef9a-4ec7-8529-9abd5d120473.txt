My friend Dhargya called last Friday evening, he was tired and hungry from his work at the Hotel Valley Ho.  We walked in and were immediately taken care of as we bellied up to the wine bar.  he was in the mood for a burger and it didn't disappoint at all.  He ranked it up there nearby Delux burgers.

I had a chance to see the Happy Hour menu and it is the best in Scottsdale!
Draft Beer - $3 , Well Drinks - $3, Wine by the Glass - $5 

There are a number of Food selections for $3 and Bruschetta!

I am looking forward to tasting everything soon.
