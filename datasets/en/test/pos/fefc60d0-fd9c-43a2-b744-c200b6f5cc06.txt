ya know this place is so good, and so unassuming it's a great find.  the food is awesome.  i really enjoy the curry potatoes ....  i've had the mushy peas.  both excellent.  and as far as the pasties i am trying to get thru the entire menu.  and i have not really been disappointed yet.  some i like more than others but that's not changing my review in the slightest.  i've been to both locations and they are very different in scope and appearance but the food is the true star!  the vindaloo is spicy and delicious.  i've had the royale w/ cheese and it's awesome tho it might give you the meat sweats !  chicken pot pie....  bangers and mash...  all really good and such a low key cozy spot.  i'm craving one now...
