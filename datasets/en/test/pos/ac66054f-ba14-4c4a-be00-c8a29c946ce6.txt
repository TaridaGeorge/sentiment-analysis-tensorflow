Clean place, friendly people, great prices (the top level pedi package is $45).  I described the design I wanted for the manicure, and the artist immediately knew what I was talking about and pulled up an image on her phone to show it to me (burberry).  She did a great job creating the look I wanted.
I finally found my mani/pedi home.
Bring cash for the tips.
