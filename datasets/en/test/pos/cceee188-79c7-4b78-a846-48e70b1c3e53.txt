I love love love Baskin- Robins. Again another place i grew up eating ice cream at ever since in Elementary school so definitely over 15 years.  I love their two scoop ice cream sundaes with whip cream, hot fudge, almonds and cherry.  I typically always chose chocolate chip.  They make it super fast.  So if you ever want just regular ice cream and not yogurt i would go here.  I've also purchased ice cream cakes for birthdays and they are sooo good.
