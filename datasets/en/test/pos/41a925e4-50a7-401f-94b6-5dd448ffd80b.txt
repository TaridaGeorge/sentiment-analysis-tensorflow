I just don't get those who would rate this place with less then 5 stars. That is simply injustice to the place, to the fans of Bianco and to the extraordinary FOOD being served there!
You are getting a sandwich with old world brick oven wood fire cooked bread and local organic ingredients for $8 dollars and you are complaining about the cars passing by outside!!! And you are in the middle of the desert! Give me a break!
