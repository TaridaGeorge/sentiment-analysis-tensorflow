Ryans is a such a great find! They have animal products for such a cheap price and the more you buy the more you can save! There is a minimum 25 dollar purchase but i always....ALWAYS spend more because there is so much stuff for such a good price. The place is setup like a warehouse..because it is....and isn't the prettiest place I have ever shopped but for the prices..you deal.  I keep coming back!
