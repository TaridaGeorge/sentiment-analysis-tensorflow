Meat is MURDER!!!!!

Sweet tasty tasty murder, and no one knows how to prepare a grilled burger and make the tastiest fries around like In-N-Out Burger.

The drive-thru line can be long a lot of the times, and for good reason.  Of course, the thing that differentiates their long drive-thru lines is that they actually move rather quickly so I never mind waiting for all that grilled goodness.

The only thing that could make their burgers better is bacon but that's like saying the only thing that can make something wet is water.

Bacon or not, everyone should pay homage to In-N-Out burger =)
