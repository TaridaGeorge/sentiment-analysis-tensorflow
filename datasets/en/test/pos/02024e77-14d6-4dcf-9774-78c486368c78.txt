This is a review for the Birthing and Family Suites.  My wife and I just had our first baby.  We stayed there for 4 days and 4 nights.  This place is great.  The care and attention they gave my son and wife was top notch.  The staff is incredible.  From the nurses to cleaning staff..... everyone was so FRIENDLY.  

Though the Shea suites are known to be nicer, I hear the personnel is not as personal.  

I strongly urge you to have your child here.
