Excellent Place for anyday casual dine out or the bar.  Lively atmosphere, excellent service and Die for menu!

I love their openers- there is a huge variety to choose from. Great chef's specials and very nice cock tails! We had some fun cocktails with mango flavor, black cherry mojito and martinis. They have great lunch specials as well. Menu has everything from wok, sandwiches, burgers to shrimp/veg pad thai or fried mahi mahi. Good options available for vegetarians as well ( I liked their garden burger)
