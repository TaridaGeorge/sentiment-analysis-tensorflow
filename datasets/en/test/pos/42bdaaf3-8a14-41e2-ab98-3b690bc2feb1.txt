Everything is still great there AND- they've lightened up on the Debit thing- no more odd restrictions when you pay.  That's gotta be better for business all the way around.

A few more tidbits o' info:  the sausage is homemade, so don't hesitate to get a sausage pizza; a slice of cheese pizza is sublime, needs no toppings at all; the 4-cheese pizza is dreamy, order one; try a pizza with pesto, mozarella and ricotta, you'll weep it's so good.  Cheese steak sandwich is worth a repeat visit as well.
