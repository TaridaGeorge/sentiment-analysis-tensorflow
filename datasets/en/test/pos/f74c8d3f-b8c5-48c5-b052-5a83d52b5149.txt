This is a beer hound's hang out. Pizza is good, made fresh and tasted like it. Staff is nice, but seem to know less about the beer than the customers (I was served by reletively new employees). The ales brewed here are notable; I like the strong belgian the best, but the Coconut Stout was worthy. I was blown away by the collection of bottled and canned beers available in their cooler and they do not take themselves too seriously, their beer is listed alongside of all the many guest beers on tap. They have lots of taps to chose from, with a third of them hoppy beers. If this is not the best Brewery in the Phoenix area, it is close - I highly recommend it to all.
