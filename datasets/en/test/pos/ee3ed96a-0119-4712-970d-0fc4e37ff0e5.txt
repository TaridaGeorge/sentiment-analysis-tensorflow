I took a chance and stopped by Party Nails for a mani/pedi. The prices were consistent with every other nail salon in Arizona :p but Al did a great job on my nails! He took his time on both my feet and hands and we actually had a really good conversation about the Royal Wedding and working out. Before i knew it, my nails looked amazing and I appreciated the friendliness of everyone in the salon. I will definitely come back!
