This resort is by far one of the nicest resorts in the Phoenix area.  The rooms were very spacious and very upscale.  The rooms were also extremely clean.  Since this resort is located on Camelback Mountain, there are breathtaking views of the entire city, especially at night.  The restaurant, Elements, was delicious.  I personally had the Duck, and I am not a food critic, but I thought it was fantastic.  The customer service was beyond exceptional and everyone was very willing to help out.  I stayed only one night but I know whether you stay one night or several, your experience at Sanctuary Resort will be amazing.
