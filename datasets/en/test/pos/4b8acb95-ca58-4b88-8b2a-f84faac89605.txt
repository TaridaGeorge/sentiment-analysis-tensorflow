Finally, some good food has shown up in this location. Their pizzas are great, especially the veggie pizza. Amazing soups and salads. This establishment is a welcomed addition to the area, and I do hope that more people find out about this place. 

The ingredients are fresh and are locally grown, and it shows. They have a great selection of libations if you enjoy a drink while you dine. The live music is absolutely amazing (the name of the gentleman I saw is escaping me at the moment). I will be going back very soon and very often.
