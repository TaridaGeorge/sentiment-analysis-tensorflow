This place is amazing. Certainly has a spot on my list of all-time favorite restaurants. Decor is amazing. The open kitchen concept really works here. Server was incredibly knowledgeable not only about the menu, but also the origins of the food and cooking methods.

The food blew us away. Had the Kobe dumplings and Miso soup to start. Tremendous flavor. The Mushroom "risotto" is a must try. Everything was delicious and we tried several dishes.

Although very appetizing, don't expect a plate full of food. This restaurant actual serves food equal to one portion, not three like you see at most restaurants. And because of that, I imagine some may see Roka as too expensive for the amount of food served per dish (unless you have a Groupon)

Nonetheless, this place is a must-go. We will be back, many many times.
