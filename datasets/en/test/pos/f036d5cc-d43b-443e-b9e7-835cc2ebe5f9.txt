OMG I wish we had gone here a long time ago.  This is an Italian restaurant/sports bar combo that fires on all cylinders.  Service, menu selection, food quality and quantity...all top notch.

The burger sliders were to die for, along with the sweet potato fries.  How many sports bars offer sweet potato fries???  

Can't wait to return and try the pizza or calzone....
