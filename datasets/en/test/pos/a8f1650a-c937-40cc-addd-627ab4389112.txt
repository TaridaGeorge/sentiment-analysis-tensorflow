My husband and I love Nello's pizza! Not only is the pizza wonderful but well, I'm a big salad person. I love the fact that you can actually take home the salad dressing you had eatten that night on your salad. Everytime we go there I always pick up a bottle of their house salad dressing- it's so good! 

I just wish they would deliever- if they did deliever all the other pizza places we use would go to waysid and mind you, in this house we are very picky about pizza.
