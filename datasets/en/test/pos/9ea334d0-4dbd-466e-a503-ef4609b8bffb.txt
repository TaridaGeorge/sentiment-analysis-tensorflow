Out of all of the botanical gardens I have visited thus far, I'd have to say this one is my favorite. 

It's unique and is filled with tons of native plants. On top of that, we were able to see various animals roaming around the gardens. Definitely a neat place to visit.

Make sure you come here either early morning or late afternoon because it can get extremely hot and arid. It pretty much became unbearable for me to walk around in the scorching heat.
