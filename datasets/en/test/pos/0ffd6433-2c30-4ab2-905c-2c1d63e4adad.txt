I can't recommend this place highly enough. It's small, smells a little musty and has a bare concrete floor, and none of that matters. It is the Mecca of soda shops.

They have row upon row of sodas, organized (loosely) by flavor. There's a row of colas, a row of root beers, a row of fruit flavors. There's a giant glass-fronted refrigerator in the back, where a wide variety of their products are available to purchase already chilled.

Want Mexican Coca Cola (the kind actually made with sugar)? They have it. Want four different kinds of diet ginger ale? They have it. Want enough energy drinks to keep you awake through finals week without drinking the same thing twice? Yes.

Other than soda, they have ice cream, candy, tea and flavored syrups.

Go there! Taste the yummy!
