yes Costco is terrific for stocking up the fridge or freezer with chicken, salmon, yogurt, cereal, and snacks. On the holidays, I do enjoy the apple pies and pumpkin pies. For the home, laundry detergent, etc.  What surprised me is that they have a great selection of vitamins and supplements: fish oil,  daily multi vitamins, calcium magnesium zinc, and b12. I use to spend a colossal amount of money at hi- health and gnc until my doc said to me that the quality of the expensive brands are no better than the generic brands. saving money is cool.
