The husband / wife / dogs are knowlegeable and friendly... they will continue to offer tons of advice if you keep asking.

Exotic varieties.. they also had the same brand (Dave Wilson) and some other unique variety of the fruit trees found at Bakers.  I kept staring at a 3 variety peach tree w/ low chill hours, but alas we already picked up our trees a few wks ago.

Good luck to our baby avocado tree, and I better not catch you Yelpers picking the fruit off (in a few years)!  :D
