Best arabic food. I visited this place while on was on a business trip to Phoenix. A buddy of mine said to try it and boy was I glad we did. Shawarma beef and chicken tasted like it came straight from the home land. Very tender and full of flavor. Wish I lived closer to this place. I would eat there every day.
