I have watched up close and person the career of this great chef. This restaurant is wonderful. It is everything that you think it should be. It is homey and comfortable. The food is high quality but not pretentious. The sauces used are a perfect compliment to the featured items. The preparations were delicious. Prices are comfortable. Maybe it is the little things that make this a great regular dine out spot. The water at table side is RO and wonderful. The wines by the glass are well assorted and affordable. Servers were well trained, efficient but homey. If you are looking for that place for the regular night out this is it.
