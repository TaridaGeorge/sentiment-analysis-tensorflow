Notice to restaurant staff: If you screw up and order, just quickly do something to make up for it.

Cornish Pasty prepared a cheesesteak pasty when we asked for a Mediterranean chicken. You know what the server did? She noticed the order was wrong and pre-emptively had the cook make a Mediterranean, then delivered the cheesesteak to our table, free of charge. 

That kept everyone in a good mood so we could enjoy our other pasties and buy a few more Kilt Lifters. Everyone wins.

Note: The lamb vindaloo pasty is very spicy, so be prepared. My girlfriend adored the Lovely Bit A Salmon pasty. And don't skip the garlic fries.
