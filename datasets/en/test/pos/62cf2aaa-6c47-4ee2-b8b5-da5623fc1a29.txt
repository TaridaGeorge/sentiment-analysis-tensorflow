Cant say anything but great things about this place. I am new to AZ and was driving around looking at things and came across this little place, after deciding to stop and give it a try i must say this is the best place to eat i have found in the 4 weeks iv been here. the food is amazing, the service is stupendous, and my 8 year old loved watching them make the food through the plexi glass they have in front of the kitchen and stove area. We have been looking for a new restaurant for family dinner night and i think we have a winner.
