One of my favorite bars in Phoenix!  How could you not LOVE this place!  It's so awesome inside!  Gary and I were bike riding downtown a few months ago and stopped inside for a little day drinking and a rest.  They did such a wonderful job making it look like the old location.

My first trip to Chez Nouz were with out of town friends from Chicago.  I had just moved here and they wanted to visit and I didn't know where to take them.  We had dinner somewhere downtown and we asked where we should go.  This was one of the places she recommended.  We were super happy we went.  

It was the best martini I had since leaving Chicago.  We got totally wasted, and I'm not actually sure how we made it home!  That's how great of a time we had.  And I've been going ever since.
