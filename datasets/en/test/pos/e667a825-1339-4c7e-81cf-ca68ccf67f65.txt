I decided to have my 16 year old Heeler cross put down at home.  I cannot imagine euthanizing a dog any other way.  Dr. and Mrs. Fixler could not have been more caring, understanding and professional.  Their service really helped us through a tough time.  When the time comes, do yourself and your pet a favor and call Dr. Fixler.
