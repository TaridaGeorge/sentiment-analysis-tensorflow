Probably the best burger in the valley. Not a fancy diner so this was right up my alley.  They have a pretty good selections to choose from (beef - chicken) and assortment of deep fried foods, of course. I usually go for the double with american and onion rings. But their fried mushrooms and equally amazing. Bring cash. No CC accepted here.
