Oh JC Penney, how youve evolved.

Love the new look theyve given to this location. Items are easy to find. You wont see many sale signs as theyve switched to "everyday values" pricing. Things here are very decently priced. I personally love the Worthington brand, theyre great work clothes (stylish, yet durable). You can have things shipped to the store from their website, the pickup process is also fairly easy.

The staff here is very helpful, and you can almost always find someone to help you in any section. 

This location doesnt have the bedding and housewares sections, theyre located by Sears in the JCP homestore.
