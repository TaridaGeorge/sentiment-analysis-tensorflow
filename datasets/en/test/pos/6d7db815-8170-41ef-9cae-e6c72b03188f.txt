Uhm, I've never used the words hip and trendy in the same sentence as the word pho before, but this PHOnomenal restaurant, true to its own tootin' is a downright hip and trendy pho restaurant! There, I said it. The place is immaculate. Never taken a date to a pho restaurant before? Here's your chance. Affordable eats, chill ambience, and did I mention the food? Totally up to par. It's like going to your favorite hole in the wall vietnamese restaurant with the yummy food and foregoing its tacky decor. Ta-da! Pho Ao Sen AZ.
