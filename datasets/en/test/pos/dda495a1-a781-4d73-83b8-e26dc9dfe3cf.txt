Have to admit, didn't have high expectations of this place going in. Good sushi is hard to come by in the west valley But it blew me away. Not only are the prices low, but the sushi is actually really good. Great happy hour menu everyday from 3-9:30ish. Lots of discount rolls too. And it's CLOSE, for us Goodyear/Buckeye folk. 

Stop in soon. They're expanding their dessert menu w mochi. Stay away from the water though... they need a filter! :-) I am looking forward to going back.
