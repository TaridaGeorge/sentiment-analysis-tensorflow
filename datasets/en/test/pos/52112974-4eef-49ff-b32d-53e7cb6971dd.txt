Green is under new management and has aquired a totally new design since it was known as "Veggie Fun".  Gone is the kitchy decor - it's new, hip facelift makes it a place that you aren't afraid to bring family or friends.  A rotation of artists are now featured with their art on the walls, so there is always something new to see.

The food is generally good, but some items are a hit-or-miss.  I highly recommend the Mongolian Beef and a vegan soft-serve cone for dessert.
