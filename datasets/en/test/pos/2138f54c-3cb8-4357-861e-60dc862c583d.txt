A small storefront and easily missed but once you enter, the atmosphere is great. And the food was absolutely incredible, we had the Cochinita pibil and the torta de filetito and they were both amazing, perfectly spiced and flavored. And the flan was excellent as well.

Highly highly recommend Barrio Cafe and I plan to go back at the earliest.
