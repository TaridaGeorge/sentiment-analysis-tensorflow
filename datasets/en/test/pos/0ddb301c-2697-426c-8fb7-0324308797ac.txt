I lived in Italy for awhile a few years back and have been searching for great gelato here! Thank god I finally found it! Not only is the gelato amazing but the owners are all so sweet and you can tell they put a lot of love into their work! Thankfully I don't live to far but too those who do... it's definitely worth the drive!! Nocciola was always my fav in Italy and still is here :)
