This place is great. Each dish is carefully made and they always make sure the customer is happy. Top shelf drinks, food, and staff... But more importantly the atmosphere. Shelly our bartender/waitress and all the staff members are so nice and attentive. I cant say enough good things about this Lounge!
Simply put, if you get a chance to go, go. Just. Go.
