To date this is my favorite place for a burger! Being from the midwest and growing up on beef, it has been hard to find a great burger out in AZ.  Enjoyed a great bottle of wine (suggestion from the staff), sampled 3 different burgers (to get a real taste for the place) and all were DELICIOUS!!!  Truffle oil fries and sweet potato fries with a root beer float for dessert......it doeesnt get much better than that!!!
