I can't believe I haven't been here before! I loaded up on lots of organic produce for a lot less than I would have paid at the grocery store and I got to feel like I was in a little European town at the same time. My friend and I had planned to to a drive over to Sweet Republic for some ice cream afterward but, lo and behold, there was a Sweet Republic truck at the market! 10am isn't too early for ice cream, is it?
