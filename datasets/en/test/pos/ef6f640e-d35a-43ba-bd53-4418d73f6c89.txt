normally, I hate chain restaurants. This Outback is the exception. I order their kid's meals to-go for lunch pretty often and Andrew is the best thing that could have happened to this Outback! And Angelina :)

One time, I was waiting for my to-go order to come while making calls for work when I realized almost an entire hour had gone by. I called just to get an update, not to complain or anything (thankfully I wasn't in a hurry).  The manager apologized and I guess something happened in the kitchen? I don't remember but when he came out with my food he didn't charge me and told me that he was going to take care of me the next visit. I was shocked!!! He did not need to do that but it was definitely something that set this chain above the rest.
