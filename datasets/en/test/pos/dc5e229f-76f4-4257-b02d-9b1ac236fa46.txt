I have dined here twice and both times it has been excellent.  So far I have tried the Jamaican Jerk and Bali Island chicken rice bowls, and both were very good and flavorful.  The portions are plentiful as well. The interior is beautifully decorated and has a wonderful relaxing feel to it.  The patio area is clean and inviting as well.  The staff is very friendly and helpful and they come around at least once or twice to see if you need anything (extra sauce, to go box, etc). My only regret is I wished I had tried them out sooner!
