A gift certificate I received last summer initially lured me out of North Phoenix and into A-Peeling Faces in Chandler. One facial treatment and a light lactic acid peel later and I was hooked. 

I've been making the pilgrimage to see Darla every 6 weeks ever since. She creates customized skincare plans and I've noticed a favorable difference in my skin's appearance and texture - I have even been able to stop wearing foundation! 

I've looked at other aestheticians' pricing and A-Peeling Faces is very reasonable. Darla's soft touch and proven proficiency gives me supreme confidence to leave my face in her hands.
