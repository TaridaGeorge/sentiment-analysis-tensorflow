AMAZING & FUN atmosphere.
Not only do they serve one of my favorite beers(Strongbow) but the food is truly delicious.
We originally stopped in for some live music, and found that not only did we love the music, the decor, the drinks and the food but the people are also fantastic! 

Love this place -everyone should definitely try the curry, oh and the fish and chips with malt vinegar. 
Dont forget to stop in on a day they have live music!
