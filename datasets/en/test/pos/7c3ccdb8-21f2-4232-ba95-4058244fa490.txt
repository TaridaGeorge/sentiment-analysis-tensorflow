I really miss this place.  I've stayed at quite a bit of "top-notch" "resort" hotels in phoenix and nothing seems to hold up to such standards or please me as much as this place did.  Even my husband (who doesn't care for anything fancy) recalls our wonderful stay and wants to go back for a getaway!
