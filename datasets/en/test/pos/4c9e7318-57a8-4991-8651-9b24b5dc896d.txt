After staying Carefree for the month of April ,2012 I looked for a barber shop and have to say that this is one I would love to bring home to Boston.Dave gave me two cuts in April, he is just  an excellent barber and very reasonably priced. I usually go to my barber every six weeks or so.But I had to have one to go!!!!!!! Thank You Dave ,and hope to see you next time I am in town. Five stars and two thumbs up, Mark
