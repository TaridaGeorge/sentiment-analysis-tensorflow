Great food. The concept was a little different i.e. standing in line to order and getting your food while you wait but it was pretty cool once we figured out what was going on. Everything is served ala carte so you just pick and choose what you want and they give it to you. They don't have plates. Just sheets of stiff paper that you eat from. That was a little different too. However the food was outstanding, the service impeccable, the atmosphere was fun and casual and our total bill for two out the door was a paltry $25.00! Oh and you don't have to tip because you do all the work! 

We will definitely be back.
