I took a friend here the other day who claims 'no one can make it too hot' for him; he ordered the red curry and they made it 'tripple hot' just for him. 

I watched closely as he took every bite.....is that? is it?? yup. Those are tears....and then, the sniffles began.....and then the stealing of his wifes mildly spiced food and more and more sips of cold water.....yes, I believe, I actually believe...he has been conquered and will PERHAPS gloat no more.....

....and for THAT (besides the yummy, delicious food and GREAT service), 
Yuphas deserves 5 stars :)
