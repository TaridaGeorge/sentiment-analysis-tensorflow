I went to the melting pot for the first time for valentine's day with my boyfriend.  It was delicious!  Our server was incredible.  She was very attentive to our needs and made us feel like we were her only guests that night.  I noticed the manager going to every table and thanking them for choosing the restaurant.  Talk about personalized service!  They have these special enclosed booths that have a curtain.  It is defintely a romantic spot.  You have to have the artichoke dip.  It was the best I've ever had.
