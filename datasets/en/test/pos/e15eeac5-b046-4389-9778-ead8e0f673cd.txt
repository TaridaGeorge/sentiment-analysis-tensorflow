Oil change was complete in a surprising 10 minutes, the staff was very professional and courteous, the waiting room was tidy and well air-conditioned, and they gave my car a thorough vacuum and window wash.  They did run through their usual upsell drill, but I have never had any oil change or car repair done where whoever it was, at Jiffy Lube or not, didn't put me through the upsell drill.  They honored my $13 off coupon (got mine in the mail).  This particular Jiffy Lube is a newer location, and feels more clean and inviting as a result.  Also, the location seemed less busy than others (or perhaps I just got lucky on timing).  I'd recommend this location!
