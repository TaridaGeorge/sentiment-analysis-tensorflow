This amazing gelato shop is tucked away near the Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Arts and well worth taking a short walk to get to.  As others have said, the portions are generous and the owners allow you to mix flavors.  I had the cappuccino and salty peanut flavors and it was a spectacular combination.  Either could have stood alone but mixing it made it all the better.

The staff (owners) were very friendly and attentive, offering samples of every flavor.  The prices were reasonable: small is $3.50; medium is $4.50; and a large is $5.50; and included tax in the price. Indoors seating is fairly limited but with the park a short walk away and Old Town nearby, we took our gelato and enjoyed the beautiful surroundings.

Highly recommended.
