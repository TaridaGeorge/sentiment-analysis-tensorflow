Incredible food. If you don't try this place for lunch, you must hate eating well. I went here for the first time last week and got a salad with beets; a server recommendation. Not the type of thing that I'd expect to have a What About Bob moment over, but I did. The saltiness of the prosciutto and the sweetness of the (roasted?) beets was fantastic. I've been thinking about this salad ever since. If only this place was closer to my house!
