I have been here a million times since it opened. I am never disappointed! It is a great place to try out different quailty beers. If you are into bud light PLEASE STAY AWAY! 

My husband and I typically go once a week to sample the new brews on tap. We definetly have some favorites, but it is fun to try new ones too!

The staff is knowledgable and super friendly. They are excellent in matching beers to your what you like. If they can't find anything in Taste they can easily go next door to Tops and continue the search.

Another great thing is the bar mix that is complementary. Not many places do that anymore. Also you can bring in from Thai Basil or the pizza place next door if you want.

If you have not been you need to go!
