I love this place. The atmosphere and culture at Guido's is on point, right down to the people that frequent the place. Don't be surprised if a regular sparks up a conversation with you. 

The food was excellent. The deli salads, particularly the Greek Salad, are a favorite as well. 

Local, Fresh, Fun, with a deli full of meets and cheeses to take home.
