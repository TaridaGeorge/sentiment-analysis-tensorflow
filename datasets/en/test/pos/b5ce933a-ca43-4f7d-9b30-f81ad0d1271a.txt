This place is near my work so I have come here quite a few times for lunch.  Since it takes about 25 minutes for your pasty to be made I call ahead and tell them what I would like and then it is ready when I get there.  Just a tip for those who do not have a lot of time at lunch.  They also have the option to order them half-baked so you can pick them up on your way home from work and complete the baking at home to have them for dinner.   This place has awesome tasty pasties and they are very affordable need I say more?
