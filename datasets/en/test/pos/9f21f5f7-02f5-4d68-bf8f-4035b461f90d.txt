I called ralphs about 2 weeks before my event. The gal said that her boss would call me for more information. He called the same day and asked a few questions. The next day he stopped in to meet me and make sure about the directions. He stopped by again about 2 days before the event to check that we were still good. GREAT FOOD!! Will absolutely use these guys again and will recommend to others! Thanks Freddy for all your help and work :)
