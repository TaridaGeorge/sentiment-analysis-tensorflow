I have visited the Advantage Urgent Care Clinics in Metro Phoenix multiple times and have been thoroughly impressed with the professionalism of the staff and the high quality of doctors that see patients. The owners of Advantage Urgent Care are dedicated to the highest level of medical care and have received multiple awards for their success including the 2009 Phoenix Chamber IMPACT Award and the Comerica Bank Companies to Watch Award. Their web check-in makes it a 'no wait' situation to see a doctor. Highly recommended.
