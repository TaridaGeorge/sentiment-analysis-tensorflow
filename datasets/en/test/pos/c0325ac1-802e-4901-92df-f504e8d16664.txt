This place gets 5 stars for the pizza and service once inside. Yes, it is a long wait, even if you get there half an hour before it opens (as a party of 2, we arrived at 4:30 one day and were seated at 6), but Bar Bianco next door is excellent, and the pizza always tastes better after a wait. I have eaten pizza in Italy, where, granted, it is very good, and I grew up in New Haven, CT, pizza center of the U.S., and I can say that Pizzeria Bianco is definitely one of the best in the U.S. The crust is the gem, thin enough for the thin pizza lover but also doughy somehow. I've had 3 of the pizzas, and recommend the plain margherita most. The servers and staff are all great as well.
