What's not to like about this place?  This is the place to bring the one you love and watch the romance sizzle.  This is the launching pad to a very special evening.  The food changes with the seasons, the service is attentive and their wine pairings are spot on.  Sitting in the gazebo under the grape vines cannot be beat.
