I am incredibly excited to have discovered this place. I've spent years searching the valley for what I considered to be "coastal state grade" sushi, and I believe I've found it. The quality of the fish  that is served in the sushi is incredible. It actually has some structural integrity!! For those of you who eat sushi, you know what I mean. This stuff isn't slimy at all. It is extremely fresh! They also have some pretty incredible beers available. I was stoked to find some awesome IPA's, and to find out that they frequently bring in new ones. Fellow hop-heads will sympathize with me on this. I highly recommend this place if you enjoy a nice, strong IPA and some quality sushi!
