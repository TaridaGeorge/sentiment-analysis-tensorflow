First timer right here, yep it's true.  I have been planning on making it to Fez for a long time and last night I finally did.  I am so in love.  The sweet potato fries are a little piece of heaven, the mustard pairs perfectly with the cinnamony sweetness.  Then, when the Fez burger arrived, it was so good that I had to stop myself from making love to it right there at the table.  I'm not kidding.  I also tried a bite of my friends shrimp kisra and that was delicious too.  I'm starting to wonder if there are any bad choices at Fez. 

Atmosphere, ambiance, decore? Sorry, I never looked up from my burger long enough to notice.   But in all seriousness, that rocked too.  I'm so lovin' it.
