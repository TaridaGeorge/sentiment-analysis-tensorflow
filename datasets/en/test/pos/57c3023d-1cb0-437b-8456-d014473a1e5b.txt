I know I just wrote a review for this place, but I just discovered even more to love about it.  I had known about their  quiches and pastries and went to go get some with an iced coffee on Sunday morning.  What do you know, they offer a real breakfast as well on Sundays from 8-12!  

I forget the name of the dish I had, but it was sort of like a frittata with sour cream and fresh salsa.  It was awesome.  And it was only like $5 and came with rosemary potatoes.  Mmmm.

I brought my dog with me and they were super cool about it.  They brought the food out to me in the courtyard and even brought a milk bone and bowl of water for the dog.
