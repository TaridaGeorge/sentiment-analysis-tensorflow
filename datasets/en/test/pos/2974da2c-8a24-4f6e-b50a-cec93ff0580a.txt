In a few words, I am in love with Green. My mom is vegan, and I am recently vegetarian, and it has been pretty easy for us to transition. However, it's been super difficult to find great vegan-friendly restaurants. Lo and behold, we found the most amazing place ever...45 minutes away from us :(
Anyway, Green is incredible. I've had almost everything on the menu at least once, and I'm just such a fan. I prefer the mock-meats to the tofu, but the tofu is really great as well. I haven't disliked anything I've had yet.
Of course, don't go in there expecting it to taste like typical food. Green serves the absolute best vegan/vegetarian fare I've ever had. And by now, I've had a lot. Were it closer to my mom and I, I think we would go there every single day.
