WOW ... what a refreshing change ... great pizza!
Tons of places in the valley serve up pizza, Jimmy & Joe's serves up PIZZA. There is a reason they have been rated the No. 1 pizza joint.
Starts with the ingredients, sauce with a nice zest to it and absolutely delicious cheese. A simple menu too ... but main offering is pizza.
No pretense, no flair ... just awesome pizza. Want a real challenge?
Take on the 24" Big Jimmy, you will need an extra table and more plates.
One key to their success and popularity is their neighborhood approach. Stop by and talk to the owner Terry - you will be well fed and leave with a new friend. Kudos.
