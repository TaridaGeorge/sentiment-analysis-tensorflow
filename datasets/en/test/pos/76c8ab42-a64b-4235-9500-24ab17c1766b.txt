I gave LGO a 5 star despite a few of the customers having 'attitude' AKA that 'I'm (wanna be) rich and I'm better than you' but that's NOT the eatery's fault.

The chocolate puddings are def good along with their black tea. The service could've been better for reasons other posters noted. 

The above stated: I'll go there again.
