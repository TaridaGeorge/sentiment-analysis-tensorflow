This is my favorite place to hike in Phoenix. It offers everything. The summit trail, which is very popular is 1.2 miles up one way. Its not for beginners! There are steep portions along the way but its an excellent trail to train on for long hikes such as Grand Canyon.
  What is helpful for some is there are four stone benches along the trail which you can stop to catch your breath and continue. The last part is like a natural stone stair stepper!! But once you get to the top, the view is so worth it!! I love this trail!!
