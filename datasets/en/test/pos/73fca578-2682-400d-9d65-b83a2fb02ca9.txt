Arrived at this place and realized this was their soft opening.  We were excited to see another pizza place in this location because the other two had failed and all I can say is WOW.  We ordered the honey hot wings.  They game out piping out from the fryer with great flavor.  We ordered a large pizza with pepperoni and sausage.  PERFECT CRUST, wonderful fresh toppings and Delish fresh mozzarella cheese.  This place is awesome!  Tons of tv's, great customer service.  We will definitely be coming back here!
