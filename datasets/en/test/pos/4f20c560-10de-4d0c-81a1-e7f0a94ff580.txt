This club is nice.

There's basketball that is surrounded by a well planned floor.  I see this as Gainey Village 2.0 - a slightly better version.

They work out rooms are designed for each purpose (cycling and Yoga with others I haven't tried).  They yoga room has stars in the ceiling that sparkle.

Such nice improvements to the pool area, upstairs lounge, locker room and cafe where they merge it with the atrium area.  If I retire ever, it'll be here.
