The best and most efficient workout I've ever done- hands down. When I first moved to AZ, I found Tribal Crossfit and felt very welcomed by all the coaches and cross-fitters here. Jake is very friendly and knowledgeable when it comes to cross-fit. I liked how he was always engaged during the workouts by giving out pointers on my form, tips, and encouragement. Unfortunately, I decided to pick a gym closer to where I was living in Tempe. A properly equipped Crossfit gym. Great Coaches. Great people. I Highly Recommend!
