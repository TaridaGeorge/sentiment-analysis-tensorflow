Happy Hour, Happy Hour, Happy Hour! 

I cannot stress this point enough! A friend and I got 5 appetizers, 2 sangrias, and a slice of buttermilk pie for $35! 

Menu highlights: 

The chips and guacamole: This appetizer comes with three side salsas and a big helping of the smoothest guac ever! The chips are perfect as well! 

Buttermilk Pie: You will die when you taste this, I literally want to lick the plate after I've finished the pie. 

The mac and cheese (the actual name escapes me): Green chili cheese and noodles, need I say more? 

Sangria: I consider myself a bit of a sangria connoisseur, and they have some of the best I've tasted. 

The atmosphere isn't bad with the dim lighting and all, but I could do without all the Arizona nature porn on the wall. But for cowboy chic food what can you expect?
