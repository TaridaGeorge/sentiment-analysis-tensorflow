This is a short one since it's not based on much. My boss brought these bagels in this morning, so I didn't experience the exceptional customer service that other reviews mention. I have no idea how clean the place is or if the location is any good. I do know that these bagels are great. I picked a sesame bagel which was particularly dark, toasted it and added some light plain cream cheese. Delicous. (And I usually have a policy against lowfat dairy!)
I'll have to go check out the place next time I'm up there.
