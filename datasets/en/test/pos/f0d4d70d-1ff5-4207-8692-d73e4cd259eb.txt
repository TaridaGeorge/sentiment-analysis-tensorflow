One word: Andrew. 
He is AMAZING. Did a top notch, stellar haircut for me in 1.5 hours. My daughter sat on my lap (she is 7 months) and we had a great time chatting with Andrew and the other hair stylists! My do is fabulous. He did exactly what I asked him per the picture I brought in. I will be back!
