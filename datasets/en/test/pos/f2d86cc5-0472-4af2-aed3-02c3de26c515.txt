The BEST dog park in the Phoenix, Tempe, and Scottsdale area, hands down.  My dogs think this place is like Disneyland, they get so excited as we're pulling into the parking lot. The dog owners here are pretty attentive to picking up dog waste. I have found that to be a big problem at a lot of other dog parks. My dogs never want to leave this place, they have so much fun playing with the other dogs in the Active Dog area. This park is very well maintained and they have three different fenced in areas. Only two of the three areas are open at any one time, so that they can rotate the play areas and let the grass recover.
