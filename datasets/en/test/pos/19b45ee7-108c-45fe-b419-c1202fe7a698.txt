Don't forget the green! 

I am never disappointed when I come here. Yeah I know the wait can be long, and the service can take a while... But it's definitely worth the wait.
I love the ambiance of this place, it's fun and creative, not to mention ...green. haha. 

I usually get the Griefo, with honey mustard and all the veggies. or the Thai Stick, "naked"... The white widow is delicious too. 

Their "munchies" are the best of the best, my favorite is the one made with fruity pebbles for the one with peanut butter captain crunch. 
I know I'll always be a fan of this place. I just love it. :D
