Environmentally responsible french eatery. Slo-food (regionally sourced ingredients), and the pastries are great also. Relaxing vibe, patio seating if you bring your dog. Always a treat to eat here. I regularly order the Croc Monseur, but had the special today which was equally delicious. This place is about high quality and sustainability, not size, if you are looking for flavorless monstrous portions this is not that place. I dont always fit the pastries and macaroons into my diet, but when I do they never let me down!
