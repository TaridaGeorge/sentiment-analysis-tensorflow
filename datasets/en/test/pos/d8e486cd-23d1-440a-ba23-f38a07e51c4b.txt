Absolutely great homemade flavor -- no canned or frozen stuff used here.

The green chile (con carne) and red chile (con carne) have a mix of both pork and beef chunks submerged in delectable sauces all made from scratch.  You can get red or green chile burros, tostadas, tacos, etc.

They even make their own refried beans on site.  The fresh salsa is the best I've tasted and goes well with all their dishes.

You'll be amazed at the flavor and quality of their food.
