ALWAYS love my US Airways. Who can argue with the great first class service in first class and when you have had 3 jack and cokes and you ask the stewardess for another one and her question is, "Are you driving?" to which I very politely responded, "No, Im flying!" 

She lost it laughing and brought me another jack and coke. I tipped her $30 as I got off the plane for her sense of humor and keeping me happy. And no, I wasn't driving, my hubby picked me up at the airport. 

AWESOME FLIGHT!
