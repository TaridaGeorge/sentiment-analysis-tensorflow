My nieghbor and I purchased the alley behind our houses.   We needed someone to come out and remove the gravel and level the area for irrigation and so that we can also fence that area in.  We had several different companies come out and give us estimates.  Ryan was the most reasonable estimate.   He was honest and came on the days and times that he said he would be here.  I have recomended Ryan before and will do it again.
