We were in Scottsdale with friends for Mem day weekend and ate here on a busy Sat night. I had a FAB lobster, hub had meatloaf and both friends had a fish dish.  I loved the lobster. A good time was had by all. Great food, Great service and the manager sat with us for a few minutes and was super aware of what was going on in the dining room. GO HERE if in the area.  Kudos to you, chef Eddie!
