I have been taking my black lab to the grooming salon at this location every month for several months to get a bath and furminator treatment. A couple weeks ago I took him in and they told me they had to rush becuase they were closing (it's a 3hr process and they scheduled him 2hrs before close). Within a week he was smelly and shedding like crazy, when usually he goes a month before this happens. I went in and spoke with the store manager on Friday evening, Saturday morning the salon manager had called and scheduled my dog for a free appointment that evening. I was thoroughly impressed with the handling of this situation and they will definately be keeping my business!!
