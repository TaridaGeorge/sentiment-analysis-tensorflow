This is THE neigborhood spot!  We love, love, love everything about it.  It's been open a year or so, and we already have those cozy warm feelings like it's our second home.

The cocktails, the fish sandwich, the peanut butter ice cream at Churn -- heaven everytime.  The staff is beautiful, yet unpretentious...a delightful combo!

As a side bonus, I stopped by last week and asked the manager if they might be interested in making a donation to our school's fundraiser.  I'm sure they get a million requests, and I was happy to get a call back 48 hours later that the gift was ready.  A great restaurant that also gives back to the community.  Bonus points!

Go, go, and go again.  If you live within a few miles, hop on a bike and cruise down.  Makes the peanut butter ice cream not so sinful. :)
