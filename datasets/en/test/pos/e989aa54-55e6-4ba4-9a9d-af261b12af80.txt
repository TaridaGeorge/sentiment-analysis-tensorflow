I still like to stop by every time I'm in downtown Chandler. It's so nice to take a stroll after dinner and get a refreshing light dessert. The creamy pecan or Mexican chocolate ones are good palate cleansers after a few beers at San Tan, too.

They do take credit cards now, fyi. They have one of those fancy "square" thingies for the ipad. They also now offer a variety of fruity drinks, some of which have no added sugar so that is great.
