Went to the grand opening this morning. It was a great experience. Love to see the healthy items on the menu and their website offers Nutrition Facts for all items so if you are going to splurge you know what's involved. The person who helped us, Joshua, was very friendly and he had been there since 3am this morning.  Clean, upbeat vibe, great for Ahwatukee!
