I can't imagine it better.  Always multiple friendly faces to greet you, and excellent service.

The onion brick is a must.  I've never been a fan of cornbread, yet I can't stop eating theirs, it's so delicious.  The BBQ is always perfect.  The sides are awesome - great beans, great coleslaw.

My daughter ordered the kids pizza - not expecting much, turns out is the best kids pizza I have EVER encountered.  Great presentation on a square piece of butcher block, and it was really good! 

We all eat ourselves into a food coma, we can't even touch the cute doughnuts at the end.  I love the atmosphere and lighting as well.  I'd like it to be my living room...dinner's ready....
