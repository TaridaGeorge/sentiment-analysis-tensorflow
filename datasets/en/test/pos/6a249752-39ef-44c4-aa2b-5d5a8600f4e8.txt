they have so many more flavors than jamba juice! i don't get why jamba doesn't have a complete list of ALL the flavors they ever had. thats why i love robek's. a different smoothie for every mood!  AND their smoothies are healthier too! it is a pit pricier than jamba, but was always a great treat! i wish they had robek's in san francisco!!!
