Unity offers everything a church should offer.  They provide uplifting inspirational Sunday messages that always seem to hit home for me.  Reverend Maraj teaches these lessons with passion, humor and eloquence and always in a manor that easy to remember and to reflect on.  

Unity also offers courses to work on spiritual practices from meditation and yoga to relationship and financial matters.  Every month a new list of courses are out or book clubs or community related events like hiking, golfing or picnics.  Unity offers everything you need to find balance and spirituality in all areas of your life.  

Some super cool unity "features" are their labyrinth for mediation, their serenity courtyard and the very well stocked bookstore that offers all areas of religious studies and beautiful gifts.  

Unity of Phoenix is one of my favorite places in Phoenix.  It's a feel good place.
