I just wanted to give an update on this company. I tried to do some different programming on my pool pump. Needless  to say I screwed it up. I called and spoke to the owner, he sent Geoff out the next day to redo the programming. I have found that Companies that are established want to keep customers happy. I will only use  companies that have established reputation. There prices are fair. There work is excellent. Just remember you get what you pay for. I am happy they are close by. And willing to help. Just to let readers know that new pump has already saved me at least 25.00 a month on electric.
