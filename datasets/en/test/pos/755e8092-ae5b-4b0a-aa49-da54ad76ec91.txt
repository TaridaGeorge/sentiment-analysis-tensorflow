Dined here 4 times. 

This is a Downtown Phoenix highlight.  The menu exposes Asian/Japanese flavors in small plates and bowls ranging from curried mussels to mint-lime beef carpacio that a great Home Cook can't duplicate.  I've never had a bad taste here - drink and food included.  The semi-exposed kitchen allows for sounds and smells to reach your table.  

Please Have - Hot & Sour Soup. 

Staff is good.  They get your food quickly and correctly.  

* For those that are turned off by the terms "hip" and "trendy" -- don't go.
