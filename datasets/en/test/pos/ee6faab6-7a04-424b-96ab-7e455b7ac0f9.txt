Great service and a great selection of frames.  I used to always go to Eye Masters but I wanted to see what Oakley and Ray Ban offered which Eye Masters doesn't carry.  At Horwitz Vision Center they even seem to have a better selection of frames that Eye Masters does carry such as Nike.  The staff seems very knowledgable and is always helpful.  I was very happy with the prices (with my insurance) and selection as well as the quality of follow up service since my purchase.
