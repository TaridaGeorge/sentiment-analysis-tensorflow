I had an issue with my power steering pump slowly leaking.  At least three other repair shops I went to told me that it needed to be replaced for about $400; so I let it leak and filled the fluid occasionally.  Went in for an oil change at Oasis and they told me about the leak and said they could rebuild it for $150!  It has worked fine ever since.  It is so refreshing to find an honest repair shop.
