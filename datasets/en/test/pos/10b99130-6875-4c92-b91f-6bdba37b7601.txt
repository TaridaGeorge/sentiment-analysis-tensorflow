Food this good should be illegal.  Prices are shocking.  I suggest starting with one of their amazing martinis or mojitos to reduce the pain of the bill.  We were a large group and had two tables out on the patio.  We had a variety of selections family style.  Highlights included the braised beef spring rolls with coconut sticky rice and avocado cilantro fruit salsa, short ribs, plantain fried rice with avocado salad, cuban bbq chicken, and calamari salad.  Dinner ended with a huge dessert platter.  The Cuban opera cake was nothing special but everything else was heaven.  DO NOT miss the Asian Pear Bread Pudding.  Loved the presentation of the dessert "sushi".  Service was good.  Decor and atmosphere were excellent.  When you are in Phoenix or Scottsdale make sure not to miss this spot!
