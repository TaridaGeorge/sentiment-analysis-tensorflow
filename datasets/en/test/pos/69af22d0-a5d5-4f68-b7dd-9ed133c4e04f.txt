I love this ballpark for Spring Training! An abundance of beer choices, plenty of food and the only thing I would add are more bathrooms...even though for once, the line for the men's room was longer than the ladies! HA! We always sit on the lawn which is a party in itself...and nicely put in the AZ sun.
