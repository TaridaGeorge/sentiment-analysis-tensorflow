This Starbucks is always so darn friendly! Never a bad service!

What can I say? I'm a repeat customer. Why? Well, not only because they're darn friendly! Also because they offer more than coffee! Their coffee is great and all, but I really enjoy trying their panini's and refreshers. Yum!

I am amazed at how consistently happy and courteous the customer service is here. Is it like this at all Starbucks? I may never know. I like it too much here to try anywhere else on purpose. 

I've been to other Starbucks and the service varies. Here, it's awesome all the time! Not only are their cold green tea Refreshers refreshing, so is the service and atmosphere!
