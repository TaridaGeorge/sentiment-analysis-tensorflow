Great placeto eat.  Atmousphere is nothing fancy but the food is awesome. I have visited several times and each time seems better than the last.  Skip the first couple pages of the menu and jump to the back.  The first few pages are the americanized dishes.  The back of the menu has the more authentic Asian dishes.  Dinner sets offer a fantastic value and lots of food.  Great place for family style meal with large group.
