I've had 3 dentists in my life. 3rd has definitely been the charm. This location is not near me by any means, but I'm completely content with driving out of my way to have Dr. Reese Turner be my dentist. 
He is very professional, does not push to have things done I am not comfortable doing, keeps me informed of everything I need done and the process in order to do those, and his chair side manner is top notch. We went through 3 crowns until we were both satisfied with how it fit in my mouth and I was only charged for one. I feel confident I'm in educated, caring hands that's not out to rip me off. 
The ladies up front are always friendly and helpful as well. If you're looking for a dentist, stop your search and go here.
