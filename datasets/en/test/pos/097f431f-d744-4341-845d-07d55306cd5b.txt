Great collection.  Beautiful grounds.  Helpful docents (try and get on a walking tour it certainly adds to the experience).  I couldn't be happier with the Heard and the way they approach the subject of native SW cultures.  I am also happy how connected they are to the current cultures and issues facing native peoples of the SW.  It is not a large museum, and you can easily pound it out in 2-3 hours depending on your level of interest.  I also enjoy hanging out in their courtyard sipping a cool drink from the cafe.  
Highly recommended if you are in the PHX area.
