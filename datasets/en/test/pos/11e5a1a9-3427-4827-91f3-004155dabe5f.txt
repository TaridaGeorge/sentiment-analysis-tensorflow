I have been going to see Dr. Downs for quite a while and my neck and back problems have improved immensely. I had a reverse spinal curve that has almost healed completely thanks to the adjustments, stretching machines, take home products, 8 minute massages, and now recently trigger point injections. I highly recommend Mountain Vista....Great customer service and great results!
