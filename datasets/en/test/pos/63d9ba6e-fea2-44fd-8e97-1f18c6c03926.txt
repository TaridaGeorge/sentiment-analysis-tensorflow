Market Bistro is a great place for lunch.  The have a "create your own" salad that is like a salad bar except with really fresh and  unique ingredients.  You choose up to 7 and they tooss it for you. Try the house Balsamic... is os fantastic.   You can top you salad with pesto chicken, marinated tri-tip etc.   If salad is not you thing they make excellent sandwiches and pizzas to order.  You can sit inside or outside.

The only downside is that it can get busy at lunch time but just get there a little early!
