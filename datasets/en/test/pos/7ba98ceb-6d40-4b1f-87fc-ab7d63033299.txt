Great ambiance, fantastic service and yummy food.  The restaurant is dark and enchanting with sparkly chandeliers.  nice place to go for date night.  We sat next to the stage where they have a live band playing on the weekends.  Had the pretzel & fondue~yummy, chicken salad and fiance had the burger with havarti cheese & bacon.  the burgers and sandwiches come with fries and they are thin, crispy and addicting!!!  I'm not a burger lover (aside from an in an out plain burger) and i loved his burger.  delish!  will come again for sure and i'll order the havarti and bacon burger.
