beautiful setting with a great view and great atmosphere. definitely high end and maybe a little overpriced, but it's worth it every now and then, even with the ocassional snooty people around.

we've been lots of times, and i have never been disappointed by the food. service has been slow on occassion and not always friendly, but never rude or lacking. 

the filet mignon is fantastic! (well, was.. it's been a while since i was here last). the chicken dishes are kind of boring and my mom's had stomach upsets a few times, but she's ridiculously sensitive, and otherwise, this is a really nice place
