40 thumbs up for Ticoz!!! I have always loved the food but have never actually been in (I tried it once when someone got take out from there for an event) BUT that all changed last Thursday when my wonderful hubs threw me a fab surprise birthday bash at a private room there!!!

I was amazing!! the room was great, spacious yet cozy, the food was DELICIOUS as expected!! and the specially ordered cake was amazing! special props to Holly the chef who even came in to say hi!!

The wait staff was super attentive and took care of me all night. A fabulous time was had by all 20 guests hence the 40 thumbs up!!
