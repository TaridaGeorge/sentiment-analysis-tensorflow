Beyond frustrated with Mini of Scottsdale, I came to EuroTechs upon recommendation from someone very knowledgable in Mini's. 

**Jerry is knowledgable, honest, quick, and affordable!**

He's got a great work ethic, & it is evident that he loves what he does. My repair was rapid & the list of items that should be repaired soon-ish was reasonably priced. And for any items I didn't understand, he took the time to explain so that I could actually comprehend what was needed (or not needed) for my Mini. 

A++ service!
