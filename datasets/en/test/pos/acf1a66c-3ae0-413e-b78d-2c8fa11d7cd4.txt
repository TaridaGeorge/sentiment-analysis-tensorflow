Mmmmmmmmmm, deliciously tasty food, excellent service and good fresh orange juice. Very generous portions as well I could not finish the pancakes they bring with the omelets. The atmosphere was fun and friendly and the wait was only about 15 minutes at noon on Saturday which was amazing. They do serve things quickly so its good when you're hungry you dont have to wait too long to eat.
Would recommend to people visiting and who want somewhere nice, affordable and tasty to eat.
