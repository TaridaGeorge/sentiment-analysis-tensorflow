I went a few nights ago and the whole experience was great!! The place is nice and clean.

They offer several flavors to choose from, probably at least 10 or more from tart to peanut butter. Then a huge array of toppings. Where to begin?

That was my problem, I felt like a kid in a candy store, literally.  lol 

Eventually, after serious deliberation I made up my mind with peanut butter yogurt topped with M&Ms and Reese's.....YUM!!! Worth every calorie, which I hear isn't to bad since the yogurt is low fat. Heck Ya!!!!
