Even this place is owned by the same owner who owns Stingray . . . can you say that quickly 3 times?? I love this place cause it has a much more casual vibe and service is always quick and good here.
I love their happy hour menu with their $4 sake infusions.  I can get away with spending $12 for 3 rolls of sushi plus $4 for a sake infusion and be completely satisfied.  $16 . . . can't be beat!  My fav of the sake infusion is the pomegranate . . . so delicious and potent.  Be careful how much you drink because it tastes like juice with a full punch!!
I also like taking my 5 yr. old here for their happy hour.  The waitress is always super friendly to him.  Fabulous!!
