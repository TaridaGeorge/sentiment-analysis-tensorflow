Of all the Schlotzsky's in the Valley, I like this one the best.  Don't know if it's location or franchisee or what, but their prices are cheaper and always delivers a good sandwich.  Nothing beats the balsamic and hot sauce they have on the side.  The Original is great and the Reuben ain't half-bad either!
