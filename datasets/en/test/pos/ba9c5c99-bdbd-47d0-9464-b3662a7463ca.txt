I have been to three different car stereo/alarm shops looking at alarms and other "goodies" for the vehicle.  Of the three, this place has one thing that is very unique - Experience with Fords and the Sync/MFT (My Ford Touch) System.

Speaking with James, the installer, is definitely NOT a waste of time.  The guy knows his stuff so well that I am personally making sure he's the only one touching my car when it comes time to upgrade my audio.  

I like the patience displayed while I am checking equipment out and answering questions.  Additionally, I also like the cleanliness of the install area.  I am definitely looking forward to having them install my "goodies".
