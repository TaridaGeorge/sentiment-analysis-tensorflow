I have never had a bad experience here.  Yes you will wait at the week-end but the food is worth it.  cash only should not be a problem - they have an ATM inside.  No cell phones - makes a refreshing change - it is all like going back in time - including the decor.  Servers are great.  Food is fantastic - love their ham and eggs and chocolate chip pancakes - not had better anywhere else !
