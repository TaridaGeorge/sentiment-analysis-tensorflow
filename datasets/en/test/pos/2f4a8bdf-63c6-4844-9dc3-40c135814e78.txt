Great, authentic Chicago-style pizza by the slice or whole. You can also get New York style pizza. This is a small, quint eatery with only 6 stools to sit. It adds to the authentic nature of the concept. 

Chef Anthony also happens to be the Executive Chef of The Venue Scottsdale - it's cool how he can go from upscale plated dishes to easy, simple Chicago favorites. 

This place is even open till 3 a.m. on Thursday-Saturday nights for the Old Town crowd. 

This is a can't miss!
