It's disappointing it took me years to finally come across Orange Table. I've been here twice and the past few weeks (before the weekend crowd rush) and have had two fabulous meals. I highly recommend the green flannel if you are into jalape√±o (it's very mild). The monkey cakes are also some of the best pancakes I've ever had. The only downside is the tucked away location...I'd go here over breakfast club anytime.
