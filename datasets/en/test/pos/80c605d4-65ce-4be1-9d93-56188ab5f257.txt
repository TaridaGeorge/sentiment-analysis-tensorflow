I wanted to try something new.  This was the only restaurant busy on a Tuesday night at 730.  I figured it must be good if people are willing to wait instead of going to eat elsewhere.  I asked the server what their secret is.  She said good food, good prices and good service.  She described it perfectly.  While I am not usually into chain restaurants, I was pleased with the food, prices and service.  The BBQ salmon was good. The cornbread is a must try, as is the mashed potatoes.  It is also fun to sit at the bar.
