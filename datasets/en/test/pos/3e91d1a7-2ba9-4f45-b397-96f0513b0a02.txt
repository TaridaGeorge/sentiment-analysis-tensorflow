still lovin' it.

the frozen mini pizzas are pretty good. and 3 for 5 it's a pretty good deal.

i have never really been disappointed here. never. i guess i just don't care about the anti-union labor employees. they are super friendly. one offered to throw away my empty coffee cup, another offered to go get me a bag of ice, and another even bagged my haul. 3 different employees mind you. so i guess it's come a long way from there only being 1 employee in the whole store. so i hope some of you weirdos who complain about that come back.
