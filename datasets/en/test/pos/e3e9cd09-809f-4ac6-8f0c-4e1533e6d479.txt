Awesome & best sushi place!
Our favo is viva las Vegas roll, kaizen saviche in non veg; veg tempura in starter, veg tempura roll in veg-sushi!!! New cherry Bellini rocks too ! We tried sake, pinapple appetizer last time, which was ok, not as great as ones written above. Overall fabulous food, drinks, and amazing service.
