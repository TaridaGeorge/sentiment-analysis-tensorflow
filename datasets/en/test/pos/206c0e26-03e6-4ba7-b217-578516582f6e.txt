This place is awesome! Great for groups, just make sure you don't have any underage people with you, they are sticklers about it. And if you do, they will stick you in the nosebleed section. They have a lot of top performers here and the drinks are nice and strong. The food selection is good too and pretty good quality. They do have Dom PÃ©rignon at a decent price for those of you that want to go all out!
