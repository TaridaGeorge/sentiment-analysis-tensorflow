Although the stores that would most match my decorating style at Kierland are Crate and Barrel and Z Gallery I love indulging in the crazy interior designs at Artafax. Very modern and very out side of the box is what best describes the items at Artafax. Really great store to get a unique gift for a friend. Check it out! You may not buy anything but trust me you will be amused and inspired. 

One thing I did buy from Artafax: cheap red wine chap-stick :)
