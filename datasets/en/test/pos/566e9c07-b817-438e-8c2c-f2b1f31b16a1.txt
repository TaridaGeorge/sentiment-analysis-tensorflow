I have never stayed in a nicer hotel room.  Full-size stainless appliances, granite counter tops, the room was laid out well and efficiently right down to the tv that swiveled between bedroom and living area.  And I don't know that it was a coincidence that the placement of the mirrors in the sleeping area and bathroom allowed you to see the TV from the bathroom sink.

This property offers a discount for Mayo Clinic patients and for $89 this was one of the best deals I've ever encountered for a hotel stay -- it also included a full breakfast!  We didn't get to use the shuttle but I would certainly consider it if I went back.
