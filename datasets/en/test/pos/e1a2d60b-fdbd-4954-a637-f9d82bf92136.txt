My husband found this restaurant online while looking for Thai restaurants in Tempe/Gilbert area. We decided to check it out. I had the drunken noodles with chicken (mild spice). OMG!!! Food to die for! My husband had the BBQ chicken (hot). We then split the Thai custard absolutely wonderful. i would highly recommend this place! Definitely worth the  price. We will be returning again.
