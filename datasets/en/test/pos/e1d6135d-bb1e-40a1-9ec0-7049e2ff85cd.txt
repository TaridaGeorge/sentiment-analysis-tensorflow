An indoor outlet mall with many brand name stores?  Yes.  Going in to many of the stores, I realize there are really good deals here at this mall.  The mall might not be as fabulous as the Biltmore or Scottsdale Fashion Square but I'd come to here to get the job done when it comes to buying, not window shopping.
