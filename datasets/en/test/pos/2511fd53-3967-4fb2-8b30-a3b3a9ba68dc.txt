Went a couple months back on a Sunday evening while on business in the PHX area and thoroughly enjoyed my experience. Decided to go to Baratin based on the online menu but stuck with my decision when I showed up and saw something different in-store.

Glad I did. Small, cozy place with attentive service and great, reasonably-priced farm-to-table fare. I don't even normally like meatloaf, and the meatloaf sandwich I had at Baratin was grade-A stuff. Sat at the makeshift mini-bar type thing and ended up enjoying a conversation with the man manning the kitchen. Butterscotch pudding was superb, and the local canned beer I had wasn't bad, either.

Baratin seems like it'd be the perfect place to drop in once every couple months with a significant other.
