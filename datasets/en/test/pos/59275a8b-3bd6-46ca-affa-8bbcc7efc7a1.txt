My friends and I usually come here for happy hour, which I think they are pretty much famous for.  Food are good, especially the crazy boy rolls.  I am not too much of an alcoholic, but I would recommend the sake bomber since you get more bang for your buck.  Another good thing about their happy hour menu is the cost.  You pay $5 for 1 roll.  Where else can you get a regular sized roll for only $5. I believe they have 2 times each day for their happy hours: 3-5p and 8-close.
