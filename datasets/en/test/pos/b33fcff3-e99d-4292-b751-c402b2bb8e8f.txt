Southwest blows its competitors so far out of the water I actually feel bad for the other airlines.  
1. Of the countless times I've flown with them, my flight has been delayed only twice and both times less than one hour.
2. NO BAG FEES.  
3. Nine times out of ten the lowest price.
4. Killer customer service, laced with sarcasm, veiled cynicism, and high efficiency.  I love it.
5. They never give me an inquisitive look when I order a cocktail on the super early morning flights.  Thank you for not judging me, SW Flight Attendants.
