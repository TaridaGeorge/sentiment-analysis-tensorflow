I. Love. This. Place. :)

I spent a good amount of money there, but on a wide variety of items:

*foot-long wooden leaf ashtray with green-painted porcelain veneer
*5-inch-long black cigarette holder(with rhinestone studs!)
*square, metal, yellow-and-black subway-style wall clock
*ADORABLE 19th century re-print (cartoon) of 2 cats(caption: "Isn't it nice to be in love?')
*vintage 60's/70's(hard to tell because the style is so classic) floor-length, cream-colored, scoop-back, sleeveless gown(only $25!)
*vintage black negligee with lace bra cups($8!)

also--on the counter, they have a basket FULL of vintage airline and hotel matchbooks for 50 cents each...that's what I call 5 different kinds of AWESOME :p

and...I'm sure there was more, but...wow! I have to go back to soak in the rest of the store--it's fascinating :)
