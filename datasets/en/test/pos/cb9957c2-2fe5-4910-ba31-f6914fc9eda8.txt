I want to set up a bed in the corner here and just eat my way through all the different breads please.

First off, let me say-- they have the yummiest LOOKING foccacia bread for only $3-- available daily, I asked.  I am so going back next week and buying one.  

We also sampled some Olive Oils-- they were all delicious!  $13/bottle but I think worth it with those tastes-- I want the Asiago Olive Oil.

Everything about this little market is just precious- adorable- and sweet.   I've purchased fresh rolls and loaves of bread from here and served them at dinner parties- they were perfect!
