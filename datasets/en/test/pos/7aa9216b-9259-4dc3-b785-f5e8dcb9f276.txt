My parents and kids choose this place to celebrate my fathers 60th birthday. We came here expecting some of the best burgers ever and they delivered!!!!! We also ordered their specialty steak, Amsterdam pasta, an amazing BLT & lobster mac n cheese. It was awesome!!! Aside from the food, they had great service and a trendy decor. This place was worth the trip from SoCal. Looking forward to coming back, next trip to phoenix.
