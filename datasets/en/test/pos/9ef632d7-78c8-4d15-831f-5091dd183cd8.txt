Pretty much my favorite sandwich place to eat at in Mesa!

This is how it should be done - great fresh food, great customer service, modern hipster ambiance. I LOVE IT. The end.

My favorite sandwiches are the grilled veggie and goat cheese and prosciutto and fig jam. Actually, everything is good here. Seriously. 

Also, try the coffee! The coffee probably doesn't get much play there (Mormons), but it is excellent. 

Well done. I always make it a point to hit up UP if I'm in the neighborhood.
