Shoutout to my boy Chris B. for telling me about this spot. He was right - this place is terrific. 

I've only been once so far, but am already conniving a plan to return! I went with a friend and shared food so I got to try 2 things. Traditional Burrito + bacon, and Breakfast Club on wheat. I truly enjoyed both. Hit the spot without over-doing it and making me feel groggy. 

To wash it down I had a dirty iced chai - one of the best I've ever had. I recommend it. Next time I'll listen to Chris and get the "Buzz" which is "patent pending" and per C.B. "one of the best inventions of the 21st century"... I know what you're thinking, and I was afraid too. Hence why I went with the chai. Next time - I'm buzzin'!!
