Not only does Palm Valley have a great course  (my daughter plays and practices there with her high school golf team), they have wonderful food and facilities for a wedding!  Our wedding is booked there for March and their coordinators and chef (LeAnn and Anders respectively) are amazing people!  The staff is friendly and very accomodating.  I can't wait to write more once our special day arrives. If you are looking for a reasonably priced and beautiful spot for a wedding, this is your place!
