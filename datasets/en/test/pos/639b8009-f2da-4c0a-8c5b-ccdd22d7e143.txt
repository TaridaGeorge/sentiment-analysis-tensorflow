Wow, this place really exceeded my expectations. Excellent, amazing, wonderful pizza!!!!  I would say it is right up there with Pizzeria Bianco, but without the wait.  We will definitely go back soon.

The Beet salad was delicious and perfect, and we had the margherita pizza, which was totally amazing.  Love this place!!!
