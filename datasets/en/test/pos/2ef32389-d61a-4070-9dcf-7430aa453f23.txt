Great little frozen yogurt place! The place was super clean, and the staff very friendly.

I got the raspberry-pomegranate which I highly recommend if you don't like flavors that are overly sweet. There are tons of toppings that you can add, including tons of freshly cut fruits, and also the typical candy/nut topics.

The berries and kiwis go great with the raspberry-pomegranate!
