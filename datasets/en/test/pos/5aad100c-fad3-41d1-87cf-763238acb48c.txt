I gave Fast Track full points because of the very cheap rates and excellent customer service. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. They literally pick you up and take you to your car versus making you drag your luggage around the parking lot in 110 degree heat looking for your spot - which I liked allot. The bus that takes you to the airport also drives over to your car to pick you up which I thought was also nice. 

As far as the rates, a tip: 
Go directly to their website for cheaper rates. We originally scheduled through some other website and paid an extra $3 per day. Still reasonable, but one of the staff members let us know that we could save a bit by going directly to the site. 

Thought it was great! would definitely use again!
