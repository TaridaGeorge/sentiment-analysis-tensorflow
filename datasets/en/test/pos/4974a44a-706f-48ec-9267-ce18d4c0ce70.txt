Hands down the best ambiance in Tempe. Amazing food... although at times it isn't as memorable as others. Friendly, knowledgeable staff. Great menu and winelist. 

When you're at Tricks you forget you're in the desert. The serene atmosphere, beautiful shade trees and twinkling lights set the backdrop for a truly romantic and special evening. If you want to impress, Tricks wont let you down.
