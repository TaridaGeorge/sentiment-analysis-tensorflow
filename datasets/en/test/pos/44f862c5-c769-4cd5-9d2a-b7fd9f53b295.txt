This is the first place I'd go whenever I got my allowance if I was a kid living near by!  

The shop is adorable!  The space is very tight but its crammed full of old toys and candies that I'd never seen in years.  They have cookies, brownies, some bars and of course the ice cream.  The pricing doesn't seem outrageous either - a 2 scoop order is just 3.25 or so.  You have the option to upgrade to waffle cone and add toppings which increases the cost a bit.  They also offer coffee and some drinks.

Love the pricing, love the goods, and love the toys!
