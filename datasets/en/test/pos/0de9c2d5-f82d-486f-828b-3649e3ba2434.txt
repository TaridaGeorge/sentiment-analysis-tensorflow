My fiance and I really enjoy this place for happy hour.  The appetizers are half off and are good for the most part.  The pretzel fondue and sampler are really good, but the chicken fingers look like ET's fingers.  The drink specials are really good, the mixed drinks are tasty, my fiance loves the Rancherita.  We've always had good service and seem to make it in there at least once a month.  Also cool that you can get Best Buy Reward Zone Dining points there.
