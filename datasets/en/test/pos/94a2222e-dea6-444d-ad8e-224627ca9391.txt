If you are ever in Arizona stop by this restaurant you will not be disappointed.

They have excellent food from greens, fried okra, fried chicken and red beans and rice to banana pudding.  The servers were excellent they are continually at your service.  The owner and manager also walks around to service your needs and to greet you personally.

We decided to go to the Phoenix location because we wanted to make sure that we were getting the authentic flavor of Soul Food and we loved it.  The drive was worth it from Scottsdale.  

Remember is you are ever in Arizona particularly Phoenix or Scottsdale stop by Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles.  We will be visiting them again within the next few months.
