Fresh ingredients, friendly service, clean environment

the food here always has a way of helping me feel light and weightless even though the portions are extremely big. Everything i've tried has been delicious and up to par with the ratings this place gets on yelp.

I have yet to try any of their desserts though but trust me, it was really hard resisting the temptation of their display case. Cant wait to go back and recommend it to anyone!
