The flavors at Yogurtland are hands down the best when it comes to Fro-Yo. They are spot on not kinda like but spot on. The tart flavors are that perfect balance of sweet with just the right about of tart and the more complex flavors such as chocolate or pistachio aren't to shabby either, They have a good assortment of toppings and so far are the cheapest per ounce (about .37 cents) than any other Yogurt Arizona location I have visited. It also doesn't hurt that they are right next door to Sprinkles Cupcakes.
