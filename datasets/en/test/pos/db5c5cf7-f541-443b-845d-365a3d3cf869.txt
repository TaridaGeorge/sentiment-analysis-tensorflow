First of all, I must say Sushi is my favorite food. I have tried not all but most Japanese restaurant in town. This would be the best of all among others, although it might not be perfect each time but their food is fairly consistent. 

Fish is fresh, the rice cooked just right. Place is a bit small but they are usually not that busy.

I will vote this best of Japanese restaurant in town and I will recommend everyone to try at least once.
