One of my favorite lunch spots.  Again, a family owned restaurant that I absolutely love!

This is the best Greek in town!  It is authentic, inexpensive and tasty.  It makes that Big Fat place look like Olive Garden. 

My favorites are the gyro feta pita, the hummus, chicken picado pita (add feta), the french fries are probably the best ever, the dolmades are little bites of sunshine.  The portions are huge and they are always generous with the feta (and the onions - who eats that many onions anyway?!).  The onions are easy to pick off though...

They have the best fruit salad bowl I've ever had!

The owners and the staff are the best!  I just wish that I could convince them to open for dinner and for the weekends.  

Plus, I always feel safe with all of the cops who eat there!
