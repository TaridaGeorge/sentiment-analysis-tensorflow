We love Joe's. It's a great place to dine with kids cause you can sit outside under the big tree on picnic tables. I have been several times. I love the burgers and the bbq chicken pizza is very good. I think they grill it cause it had like a charcoal flavor which was different but good. 
My wife loves the Onion rings and fried green beans. The atmosphere is awesome. Nice area to get refills on drinks and condiments. The bathrooms are even cool, so check them out even if you don't have to go. Close to the 202 yet you feel like you are out in the country.
