Outstanding in every way!  The pretzel bread is out of this world.  I don't think better bread can be had.  It is beyond amazing.

The food, service, wine and ambiance are all fantastic.  This is the sort of place that defines Scottsdale and helps me understand how bad dining is in the East San Francisco Bay.
