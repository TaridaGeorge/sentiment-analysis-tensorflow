Had lunch today... wonderful crepes stuffed with filet mignon. Nice wine selection and service was terrific. We didn't need it, but couldn't leave without trying the lemon creme brulee. Wonderful! Very nice casual atmosphere.
The food poisoning review is shocking. If you don't hear from me our crepes "stayed down" just fine:)
