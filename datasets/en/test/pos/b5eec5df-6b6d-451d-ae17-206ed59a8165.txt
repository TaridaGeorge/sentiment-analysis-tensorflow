Wow. 
This is like a Fry's Marketplace infused with everything that is good and expensive at other gourmet grocers. 
I've never seen so many different exotic fruits. Dragonfruit, anyone? 
The bakery inspires the 5 year old in me to say "Gimme, gimme, gimme! All that is chocolately, glittery, pretty goodness!"
Food allergies? Rest assured, you will find a wide selection of soy, dairy, gluten, and whatever else is popular these days- free food.
Enough kitchen utensils to please Emeril.
Wifi of course.
Covered parking, now you're just spoiling me rotten.
Fry's low sale prices-am I dreaming?
I have to stop in every time I pass by, because even when I don't know what I need, this store has it!
