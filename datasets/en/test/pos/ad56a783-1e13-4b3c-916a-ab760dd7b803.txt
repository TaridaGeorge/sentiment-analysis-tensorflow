I know for a fact that Gelato 64 is made fresh and lives up to its boast of 64 different varieties of flavors from your standard chocolate to the obscure ancho chili chocolate, which by the way, is very good...leaves a kick in your mouth once its gone down.  I like to think of myself as a gelato connoissieur after having been to Italy 5 times so this is as close as you're going to get in the Phoenix area.

You can sample as many flavors as you like and the prices are reasonable given the large portions that you get.  The place is clean and spacious and the staff is courteous.  I highly recommend that you come check this place out.  I do every time I'm back in Phoenix.
