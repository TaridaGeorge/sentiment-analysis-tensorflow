I live within biking distance to Z's Greek and nothing is more rewarding than their chicken pita (I add feta cheese and cesar dressing). Wasn't sure how good their food would be considering that lot has changed names more than a Shaq, but after eating there once I've been going there at least 3-4 x's a month. Z's is a straight up Booyah
