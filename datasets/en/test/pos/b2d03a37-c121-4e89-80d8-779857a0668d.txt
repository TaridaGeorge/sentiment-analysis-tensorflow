We got married in the amphitheater and it was beautiful, intimate and perfect! Pictures turned out so pretty too, one of the prettiest places in AZ! It only cost 800 and we did the ceremony only. We had about 100 people there, they said it could seat 125 but I think it could seat a lot more as the crowd looked scarce at our wedding. They did a great job, ranging from arranging everything to the day of the wedding. I don't really have any complaints. Main thing is that if you are walking down the trails get ready to get your dress very dirty. I wish I would have bustled it or had a carpet down.
