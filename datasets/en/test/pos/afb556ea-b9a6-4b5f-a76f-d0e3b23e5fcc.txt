The mainstay in my drinking diet.  This bar boasts a very diverse crowd of people.  Super fun to be really drunk at.  Pee on the blarney stone around the back.  The crab cakes are delicious.  Any drink you want, and they'll make it strong.  A huge hipster dork scene.  I have to say, if you are from out of town, go here on a Thursday or Friday.
