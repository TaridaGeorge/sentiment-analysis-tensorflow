I am addicted to the #12.  I'd like to try more stuff, but am not familiar enough to know what to order.  But the #12 or #14 are so awesome.  I go at least twice a week...It is what is is;  Vietnamese, clean, and delicious.  You don't have to have formal service and white tableclothes to serve awesome food.
