Whitey's Auto Repair is a fantastic example of what every auto repair shop should be.

Scott the owner is is awesome. He is helpful & will do what needs to be done to help you out. I've had an oil change & my serpentine belt replaced. The price was fantastic & it was done really fast.

I am so happy that I have a trustworthy place in my neighborhood that I can take my clunker to. :)

You should call Whitey's Auto if you ever need a mechanic, so you don't have to take your chances with some of the shady shops we all know are out there.
