dear switch,
  thank you. from the bottom of my heart. for hosting a crowd of rowdy drunken and often shouting yelpers to your oh so generous weekend brunches.
i hope to make this a weekly ritual, wherein i pay my respects to the patron god of the aztecs and their sacred drink the bloody mary; poured into a massive carafe, garnished with celery and made from the fresh innocent virgin blood of pubescent spanish girls. on behalf of my yelp crew and im gonna go ahead and say all of the phoenix yelp community: thank you, you make sunday/saturday mornings a happy blurry drunk driving fun day that i cherish!
