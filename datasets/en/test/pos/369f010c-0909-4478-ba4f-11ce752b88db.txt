This is a warm and caring Ballet School, where each student is given individual and loving attention.  The location couldn't be more charming...a beautiful dance room, a gorgeous wooden floor, and windows looking out on a garden setting at The Lakes in Tempe.  I enrolled my grand-daughter and to her delight, she got to dance in the Nutcracker at Symphony Hall.
