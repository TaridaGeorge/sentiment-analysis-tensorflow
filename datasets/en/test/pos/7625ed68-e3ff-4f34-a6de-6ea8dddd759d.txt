Since my last review, I've been to this place several (maybe 20) more times. They have live music (with no cover) on Thursdays-Sundays, which has proven, without fail, to be very entertaining. 

They also have free wifi so you can bring your laptop and get some work done while you eat. The place is generally very quiet on weekdays during lunch, so it's convenient to sit in a booth and actually get some work done. 

Really can't think of a negative thing to say about CKs. Actually chose this as a venue to throw my boyfriend's birthday party on a Saturday night. Can't wait!
