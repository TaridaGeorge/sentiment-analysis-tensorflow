My boyfriend had this delivered to his place in Tempe one night when we returned from Casey Moore's and he ordered me some sort of turkey samich with avacado and bacon. I must say, that was one of the most delicious subs ever... not just because of the circumstances but because it truly was amazing! The delivery guy was there quick and friendly. I will be visiting soon!
