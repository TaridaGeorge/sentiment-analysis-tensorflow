If you are a cigar smoker then Goodfellas Cigars is the place to be! 

They have a great spacious lounge with modern furnishings. The owner is a great guy that really knows his cigars, customer service and how to run an outstanding business. 

The prices are very reasonable and they have a great selection of cigars, humidors and  products. They even have hard to get cigars and they are the first in the area to carry some rare or new cigars. 

They have events quite often that are always a great time. There is a poker room in the back, humidor cabinets you can rent as a member, and plenty of tv's and chairs to hang out in and catch a game.  

Walk in for the first time and I promise you, you will always be coming back to pass the hours before you even realize it.
