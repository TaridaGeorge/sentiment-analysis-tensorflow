Always exceptional service and food. The Caesar salad is great, and the New York steak is always a winner. It can get a little loud, but that all depends on the crowd that is there -- small, intimate booths are available, but there is a fairly large open area as well.  As for the bar, the drinks are poured string and there is a large selection of house drinks and wines. They treat kids very well, but this isn't the place to go for a $5 kids meal.
