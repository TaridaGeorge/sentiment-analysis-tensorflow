Wish whey were closer to my house. We drive over a half hour at least once a month for the pizza. It's unreal! Everytime my father in law comes into town he goes at least three times for pepperoni pizza, well done. He says its the best pizza he has ever had (and he is a self proclaimed pizza connoisseur) You have to try the spinach salad too. The mozzarella and bacon are awesome but the vinaigrette dressing is the best part. Please move to Gilbert!
