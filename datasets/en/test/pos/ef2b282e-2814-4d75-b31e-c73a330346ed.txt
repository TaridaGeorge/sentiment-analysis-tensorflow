This Mastro's was recommended to us the first time we came to Scottsdale 10 years ago.  Now we MUST dine here every time we visit.  The bone-in ribeye is the best steak I've ever ate.  And even the vegetables are supreme.  For an appetizer, try the snow crab - it is out of this world.  Make no mistake, you pay for this type of excellence.  But it is well worth it.  Per the General Manager tonight, the Chicago location will open early fall.
