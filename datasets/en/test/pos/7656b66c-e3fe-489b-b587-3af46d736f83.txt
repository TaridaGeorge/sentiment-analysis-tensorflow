LUV this place!  We only live 10 mins away, but luv to stay here in the hot summer months - it is a toal get-a-way for a couple AND their kids! There is an amazing FREE kids club (i don't think i have come acorss any other one in the vallye - usually $45 for a 1/2 day - this is free - full day, full of activities AND a teen room as well.  Dive-in  movies fri & sat eves.  We always up grade to a casita - a full living/dining/patio/bdrm.  We barely see the kids during the day (club) and at nite there's the pool/movie.  If we want to exp. a late nite bar (rose - amazing patio) or dinner alone, we order a movie for the kids to watch in bed.  Will be back again summer '09 :-)
