I've been here for breakfast, lunch and dinner and everything I've had was amazing.  I have at least had bites of their chorizo nachos, their salmon omelette with a side of squash bites, their peach pancakes, their chicken alfredo pasta, their veggie burger on an amazing pretzel bun, and their regular cheeseburger.  all were delish! my favorite drink is their swirl -- the margarita with frozen sangria
