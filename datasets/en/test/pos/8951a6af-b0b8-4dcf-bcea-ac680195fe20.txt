Placed a second order.  Same timely delivery, same bag of treats and another pet magazine with the order.  Got some ear wipes, as Tallullah suffers from ear schmutz (technical term for the condition), and they make it super-easy to keep her hears clean and sweet-smelling.  C'mon, people!  I KNOW I'm not the only one who smells my dog's ears on a daily basis...
