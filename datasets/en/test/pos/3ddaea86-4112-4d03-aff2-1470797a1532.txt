the best nursery i've been to in phoenix, and also a scenic place to visit (for phoenix). i lived in CA for a while and got spoiled by the overflow of nurseries and all of the varieties of seedlings, native plants, and (organic) seeds i could find in that state, specifically for vegetable gardening, but baker at least covers the basics and sometimes goes beyond. the staff is quite knowledgable. the seedlings and mature plants i have bought here usually seem to be much more hardy and less disease prone than the ones i impulse buy (against my better judgement) at the home depot down the street.
