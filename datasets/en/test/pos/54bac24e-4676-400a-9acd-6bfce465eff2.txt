What can I say? How sweet it is to have this amazing resort within 5 minutes of home. My wife and I could not get out of town for our anniversary due to work stuff, so went with a little staycation. Had a GREAT time and felt like we were hours away from home!
Ate dinner across the street and chilled at TAPS for a while. Great place to grab a drink and some light dinner. 

Will return often!!
