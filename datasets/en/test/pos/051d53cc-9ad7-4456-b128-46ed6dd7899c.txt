A definite hit with our party of 9. Seven hungry minor leaguers were well fed and sent back to the field happy.  We'll hit this place again next spring training.
I looked up the other reviews first and the steaks were cooked to perfection, delivered at the same time no small feat for large groups.  Twice baked potatoes were very tasty.  The service was very attentive and helpful, even with our two Dominican players and their limited english.
