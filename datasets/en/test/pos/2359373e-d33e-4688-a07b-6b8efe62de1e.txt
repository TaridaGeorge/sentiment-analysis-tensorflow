I love this stadium.  Their tailgating policies are very reasonable and parking staff are very helpful and friendly.  Adding to that, the people behind the food counters were probably the nicest of any stadium I've ever visited.  It is a very classy venue; it's obvious this stadium treats their staff with the utmost respect and it shows.  Can't wait to go back next yr!
