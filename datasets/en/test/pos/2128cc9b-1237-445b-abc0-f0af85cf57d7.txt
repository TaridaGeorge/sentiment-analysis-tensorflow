Let me clarify.  It is NOT the best pizza I have ever had (shocker, I know).  But as far as $5 pizzas go (and even most quick take out places, i.e. Dominos, Pizza Hut, Little Ceasar's), it is definitely one of the best!  Being so close to ASU's Tempe Campus, the location is perfect.  This is a great place to grab a cheap bite to eat (for students or staff).
