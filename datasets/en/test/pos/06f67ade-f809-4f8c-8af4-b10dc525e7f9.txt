I've been here twice now, and this place continues to exceed all expectations! The Butterfish Tataki appetizer is amazing and the scallops appetizer was the best scallops I've ever had! The robata grill items are also fantastic. All the vegetables are great, but the lamb is beyond incredible. There's nothing like it. The sushi is fantastic, and the sushi chef was kind enough to accommodate my husband's request for a chirashi bowl (bowl of sushi rice with assorted sashimi), which was not on the menu. Their Blood-Orange Margarita is fantastic as well. The service is extremely good - very attentive, thoughtful, and knowledgeable. This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Valley and I'll definitely be coming back as often as I can!
