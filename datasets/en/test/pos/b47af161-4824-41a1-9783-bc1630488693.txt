Love 24 hour fitness! Very clean and they are always cleaning it.    The best part is is classes ,so many to choose from. The pool is very nice and i have even taken the water aerobics class. It is fun even with the older folks.  The instructors never push you more than you should do. There are locations everywhere,so if you don't have time to go to the class in your area you can travel to another for the class you want. LOVE ,LOVE ,LOVE the sauna and steam room . For the price you cannot get a better deal.
