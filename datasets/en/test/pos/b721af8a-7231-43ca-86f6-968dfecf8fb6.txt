We got the signature pizza which consists of fresh spinach, tomatoes, and garlic and it was fantastic.  the sauce was flavorful, the pizza was seasoned perfectly and i have to say that i was impressed! the only thing i may do differently for next time is to ask for the pizza well done.... i usually do this to all pizzas just forgot this time.   We also had it delivered, during the NBA playoffs, and it arrived in about 35 minutes, right at half time; so timing was perfect!!  It showed up hot and delicious which says a lot about their delivery service.  Well done, I def recommend to others.
