The Dirty Dogg is a hoot!  First, check out the website to get a sense of what it's all about: http://www.dirtydoggsaloonaz.com/.  You need to see if it's the place for you.

Basically, you have a bunch of barely clothed bartender gals serving up drinks and dancing on the bar.  And they are not the only ones involved in the antics, believe you me.  

After the drinks have been flowing for an hour or two, some girl full of liquid courage will get up on the bar to dance with them.  And it you let the gals, they'll cut off your underwear. 

Wear the clean stuff and get there early!  This place gets PACKED!
