Rage Cycles is a truly world-class bike shop.  Peter and his crew are true experts at all things bicycle.  They are patient and knowledgeable in a way that other bike shops simply aren't.  When I came to them with my custom project, they readily embraced it, and became an invaluable resource in my quest to build the perfect bike.  Their level of expertise is apparent, and sets them in a class above other area bike shops.  If you are looking to do anything special or tricky, these are your guys.  Highly recommended.
