Yummy!

Visited my sister who lives in PHX this past weekend and we tried out Spinato's after looking into a nice restaurant near her house in Ahwahtukee. This place had excellent reviews and was Italian which was what we were craving. We tried this out and was really happy with the food. They had an excellent children's menu that came with a gelato after which kept our children happy. They even gave us a toddler t-shirt for them both, it was really nice! Our server was very prompt and the service was great. The pizza was one of the best pizzas I've ever had. We will definitely be coming here more regular when we visit. It's delicious!
