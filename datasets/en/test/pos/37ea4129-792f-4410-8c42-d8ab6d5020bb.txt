Weekend brunch @ Ticoz was one of the best brunch dining experiences I have had in a while!
Service was stellar, atmosphere was heavenly, & brunch (I had the Eggs Benedict) the best I have ever tasted!
BTW, I travel 80 % of the year and eat out across the country...
Ticoz Resto - Bar, I will be doing again before I leave Phoenix.
