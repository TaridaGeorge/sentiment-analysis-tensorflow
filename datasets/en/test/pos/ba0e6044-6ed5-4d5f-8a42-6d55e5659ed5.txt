Yup  this place is the gold standard for Gelato,I have to say  I love the authentic flavors and  homespun feel to the place.  I had Nutella which tasted like Nutella in a sweet cream base , very  tasty. The youngest had 
Vanilla Cruch with "waffers" in it, she did not care for it. I also sampled Pistachio which was completely worthy of me revisiting to sample. 

Downside --Parking  is unbelievable . the lot is tiny for three places to share and on a Sunday afternoon all the places  are using the spots. 
Also this isn't really near any of the places I venture.How will I find excuses to stop here?
