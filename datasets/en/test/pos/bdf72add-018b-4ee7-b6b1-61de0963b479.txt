Been a constant customer of their delivery service as I work in the AirPark. The food from Meatballz is as good as it gets. I usually order the Anti-Pasta Salad which has everything you can imagine and then some. Also their sandwiches are to die for. The owner, Mike, is a very friendly Jersey guy who is always friendly and totally on the ball. Good to see that there are business out there that want to see you to keep coming back!
