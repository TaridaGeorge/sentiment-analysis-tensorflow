Every time I'm in Phoenix, this is a regular place I visit. I love it so much, I have regular cravings for their gelato...and I've been to Italy! Gelato Spot arguably has the best gelato outside of "The Boot." I've also been to the Scottsdale location, which is also a great place to get a few scoops and chill with your friends, but Greenway is my usual stop. 

The staff is super friendly and happy to give you as many samples as you need to decide what flavors you like best, and despite the frequent summer crowd, somehow we're always able to find a comfortable seat in the house. My only complaint is that they don't have any in California. Gelato hits the Spot, so check it out when you're in town!
