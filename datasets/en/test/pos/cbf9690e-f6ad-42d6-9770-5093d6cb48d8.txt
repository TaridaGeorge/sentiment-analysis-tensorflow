Really nice!  I'm new to the area and I stumbled upon them.  They are fast and not very expensive.  I was a little turned off by the number of really old men working there, but they had their regular client list.  It was like one side was "old men" hair stylists and the other side was the "young girl" stylists.  The two sides didn't really associate, which I found rather weird.  But, none the less, a great hair style at a great price!!!
