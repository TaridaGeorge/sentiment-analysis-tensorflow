OMG! I cant believe I waited this long to go here! I was thinking it was going to be just some little store.. this place is huge, well for a spice store. They are well focused and of great quality! The staff is so friendly and helpful.. I did get to bash them both as neither had tried the Buttermilk Ranch mix! 

They were closing for the night so I didn't get a chance to thoroughly scour every inch of this great store but what I did get, amazing! Try the smoked paprika, oh yeah! 

Oh they also had French lavender.. I see a cheesecake in my future.. now if I could only convince the Mr to make it for me! He is a pastry chef after all!
