How refreshing it is to find an honest, upstanding, kind, and VERY generous business.  Well, Harvil Auto Body is just that!  Tim Harvil, his son, and the other gentlemen at Harvil replaced/manufactured an aluminum tab that held a silly non-essential plastic guard underneath my Lexus IS that the Lexus dealership wanted to charge more than $3,500 to replace the whole sub-frame, which was not at all damaged or structurally compromised.  My hat's off to these fine gentlemen!!  Thus, if you ever need auto body work done, there is no question that Harvil is where you should take your vehicle.
