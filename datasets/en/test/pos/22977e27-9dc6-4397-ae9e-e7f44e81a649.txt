We LOVE everything about this restaurant. From the oysters to the cocktails to the lively bar crowd to the jazz music. It gets busy, especially on the weekends, so I highly recommend making a reservation. Their regular menu is a tad pricey, but the food is always fantastic so it's well worth it. We caught the tail end of happy hour the other day which is a great deal so I recommend checking that out.  Eddie Vs is always at the top of our list when going out for a special occasion.
