How about a second five star review for Barry's Capezio?

My wife went here recently to get dance supplies for our daughter.  We are familiar with the Capezio name as we went frequently to their store in San Mateo, CA when we lived in the SF Bay Area.  Service here was as good as back home--very friendly and helpful.  Plus, they weren't pushy to try to get us to buy a bunch of stuff that we don't really need.

If you're looking for dance clothing/supplies in this part of the Valley, this is the spot.  Highly recommended.
