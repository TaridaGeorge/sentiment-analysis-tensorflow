I am SO sad that Lulu's is closed. Lisa by far made the best cupcakes. I would drive from the west valley just for those treats! I watched her on cupcake wars tonight and it just validated how awesome she is. I think it is ironic that Candance Nelson is a judge on that show, when her cupcakes are so lacking quality. They taste like a cake mix cake. NOT anything extraordinary for the price. Lulu, I hope you can come back.... I miss you! :(
