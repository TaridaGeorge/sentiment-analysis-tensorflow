This place is awesome! Thanks for the find yelp!!! Been here twice in the past week and had great food both times. This is real food prepared by a real chef, not prepared crap that just gets heated up in a microwave. The baked brie was delicious, however the oven broke today, so we went with the stuffed mushrooms which were also damn good. I had the spicy shrimp in coconut risotto the first time in, and dijon gniocchi this time. Got to keep coming back as the menu changes seasonally. 

Cant wait to try the pizza next week!
