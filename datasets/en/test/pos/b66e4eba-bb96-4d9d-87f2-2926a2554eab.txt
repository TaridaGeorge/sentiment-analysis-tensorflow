I love this store. Great employees, fantastic service, and free smartwater. :p

I go to this store quite often, considering that I'm an Apple fan, and even waited in line for 16 hours, in order to get the new iPhone 4.

Once, I went to the genius bar and asked what they could do about the palm rest of my macbook, which was breaking, and they said that they'd fix it. I gave them my number and they said they would call back as soon as possible. The next day, they call me and say that it's ready. I go and pick the macbook up, and to my surprise, they replaced ALL of my casing when the palm rest was the only area that needed work. very nice people working there that really care for your products. Would definitely recommend.
