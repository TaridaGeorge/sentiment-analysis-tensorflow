Has grown in popularity.  

My kids love this place and have lots of fun making their own yogurt treat... honestly I would not eat one of their concoctions as they are usually unique mixes of cereal, fruit and gummy bears.

That is the magic of the place- an infinite mix of possibilities.

My wife usually take the kids here after they do something awesome and they love it.

They usually rotate a few different flavors and give free samples.

Highly recommend- watch for post dinner crowd as there are few seats- but a must try.
