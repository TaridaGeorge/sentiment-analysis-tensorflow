These guys are the best. NEVER more than a few minutes wait to be seen and as others have said, both Dr. Salek is patient and kind and will take as much time as you need to answer questions for either parent or child. 

We've been going to the Mesa office for years and just recently had to call on a Sunday. The answering service was similarly kind and Dr. Ciminello called back in less than a minute, was thoughtful, generous and patient. Put my mind at ease and was great. Every thing you'd want for your child. Yay for the awesomeness that is Pueblo Peds!!
