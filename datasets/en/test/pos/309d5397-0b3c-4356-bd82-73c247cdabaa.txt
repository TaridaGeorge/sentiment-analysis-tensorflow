The McDowell Preserve (Gateway Access area)is one of my favorite places to hike. There are an infinite number of loops ranging from 1-2 miles, and for those ambitious people, 10+ mile loops.

The most popular trail is the Gateway Loop, which starting from the Access area is about 4.5 miles. There is a minor elevation gain/loss, and for the most part is very flat. 

The trailhead has cold water fountains, maps, usually a park ranger, plenty of parking, and restrooms. Be sure to get a map - it helps, and bring plenty of water. Unlike Camelback, you'll never have to sit and wait for a parking spot.
