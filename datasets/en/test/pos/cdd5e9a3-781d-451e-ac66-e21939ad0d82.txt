Amazing food!! The chicken salad and strawberry lemonade were particularly wonderful! The portions are fairly large and the staff is super accommodating. As an extra bonus they have free chips and homemade salsa which is delicious! 
There is free one hour public parking under the condos behind this restaurant on 5th and Maple:)
