Holy Mother of Jesus.  I had been to Phoenix before and saw the mountain from across the valley.  Meh.  Sure, it looks kinda cute from over there and makes you want to get closer to take a little snap shot.  Go to the base of the mountain and stare in amazement.  This thing is a beast.  I've been to the Tetons.  I'm been to the Rockies.  Maybe it's the fact that this thing is in the desert.  Or maybe it's because it's covered with cactus.  Or that it's standing alone.  I don't know, but it's stunning.  Stupendous  Stupid me, I didn't bring sensible shoes.  So I wasn't able to make much of a hike, (or at least that's the excuse I'm using).  Maybe next time.
