This is my favorite auto repair shop ever. I have a 2003 Corolla with 160K plus miles and really don't aspire to spend a lot of money to keep it going. Andre has very patiently and inexpensively nursed it along without going out of his way to find excuses to bill me for repairs. I am a cynic by nature and consider going to an auto repair shop akin to visiting a dentist, so Toyoworks has been an incredibly pleasant surprise. I may just keep the Corolla to 200K miles simply because I trust these guys. I highly recommend this business.
