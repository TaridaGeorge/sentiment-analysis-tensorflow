This wouldn't be 5 stars if it weren't in the airport.  However, for an airport restaurant, never had better service and a fresher salad.  After a day's worth of travel, it was a pleasant experience to be helped and served by the staff and Olive & Ivy.  For instance, sitting at my table but I didn't have a drink and a young lady came by and asked if I wanted water...  with a smile!  She genuinely seemed happy to serve the customer!  Server behind the counter was just as helpful when ordering.  More than willing to change my order and make the already-made salad exactly the way I wanted it.  I will go out of my way to eat there again if I'm in the PHX airport.  Thank you!!
