This is an appropriate place to go if you want to feel good about yourself.  You spent the week eating fast food, speeding down the highway, and leaving the lights on.  Now Saturday has arrived and you can BUY LOCAL and tell all your friends about it.  I'd be lying if I said I wasn't guilty.

In all fairness, this is a pretty cool market.  You can pick up a huge variety of produce along with some prepackaged awesomeness.  There's little more I love than buying a bag of delicious banana chips for a dollar.
