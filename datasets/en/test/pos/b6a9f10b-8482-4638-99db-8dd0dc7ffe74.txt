I am happy to report that I love Costco. They have a terrific return policy, they have a great selection of foods (lots of specialty foods already made) and have great stuff for parties, good prices on most stuff, nice flowers, and terrific hors d'oeuvres on Saturday and Sunday. Membership is well worth it especially when you wanna buy electronics and return X Boxes for the newest version   :O
