I hang my head in shame that I did not make this my go-to Teriyaki joint sooner. 
I knew of it, I remember eating it at the Matsuri Festival years ago, but for some reason I just did not bother to stop into the restaurant.
I'm so glad I did, I now make the drive down Central ave at least once a week to get my fix.  Food is fresh and plentiful. Staff are insanely nice. 
And they don't mess around.
You will literally get a PILE of chicken in your bowl. Delicious, hot, steamy, falling-out-everywhere chicken. A mountain of chicken, if you will. 
I hate that they're not open on the weekends, but I just couldn't bring myself to dock a star for that.
