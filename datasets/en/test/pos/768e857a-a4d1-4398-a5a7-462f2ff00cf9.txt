ZuZu is one of my favorite places to go for a cocktail with friends late in the evening after dinner. Spacious with a large variety of seating options, Cafe ZuZu is a fantastic throw-back reminiscent of the 1960's with an attached retro motel to boot! While I admit I have never eaten their food here, they have a fair selection of delicious cocktails and other assorted adult beverages that warrant multiple visits so you can try them all. Do yourself a favor gentlemen and toss on a skinny tie and a slim suit and enjoy drinking in the type of establishment one might imagine John and Jackie Kennedy would go to if they were still with us!
