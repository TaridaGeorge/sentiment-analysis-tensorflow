Thanks be to Yelp that we found Vermont Sandwich Company. Tucked away in a neighborhood strip center is this fine local gem.

The entire experience is exactly why I love local and Yelp. As we walk in I become overwhelmed by the menu so I ask what I should have and minutes later the owner is still talking about the sandwiches and how everything is made there, etc. etc. Great to hear the passion!

Then out comes the Long Trail for me, the Green Mountain for the Mrs., and a surprise Fluffnutters for the kids. You see, we didn't order anything for the kids, but he brought it out "on the house". Great sandwiches for all!! The owner again comes out and hands us a wet cloth to clean up the kids as he must have seen us scrubbing (or trying to scrub) the marshmallow off the kids.
