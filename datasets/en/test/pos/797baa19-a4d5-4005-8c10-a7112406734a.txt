Reeeeeally like this airport- probably the most efficient airport I've been to considering its size.  The lines for check in are very time-effective if not non-existent. Go upstairs and security is usually a breeze!

Yoshi's is delicious for quick, fast-food style asian cuisine ( Noodles with broccoli and chicken is da bomb!) Plus, you can access all of the other concourses and there is quite a few tequila hang-outs and sports bars along the way.

Only thing is parking is EXPENSIVE (went on a trip for 9 days = $90!) I guess most airports are but I'd recommend trying to use one of the remote parking lots (3rd party) or have a friend drop you off :)
