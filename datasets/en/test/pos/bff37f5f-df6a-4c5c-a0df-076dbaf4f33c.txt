Went for breakfast on Saturday at 10:30am. Expected a long wait but got served within 10 minutes. Service was excellent and food was yummy. I had an omelet with bacon and Swiss which was excellent. My wife had Benny Florentine and enjoyed it. My son had a breakfast burrito.  Would definitely return. Recommended if your in Scottsdale AZ and want breakfast to check this place out. They did have outside seating for those who can't eat without their dog by there side. Canine friendly.
