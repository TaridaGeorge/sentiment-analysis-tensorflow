Omgosh. It has been a while since I came to this location. It has been remodeled and the ambience when you walk in the door is amazing. The waiting area is like a lounge space in a club or bar. The upgraded bar is almost swanky. 
As far as the food, I always rely on old faithful. Medium wings and a 1/2 order of Aussie fries. You can't go wrong. They did have a special for a 3 course steak meal for 11.99. 
I just took a sip of my Wallaby Darned drink, frozen daiquiri peach flavored and it was only 4 bucks.Yummy.
