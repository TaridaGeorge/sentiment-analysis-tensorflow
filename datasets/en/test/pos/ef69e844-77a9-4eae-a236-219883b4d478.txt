We've been coming here for about 8 years, and we love it!  This is by far the best Indian food restaurant I have eaten at in the US.  I try something different every trip, and the food is always fantastic.  The service is great as well, the place is warm and friendly and inexpensive.  Try the Indian plum wine...great stuff!
