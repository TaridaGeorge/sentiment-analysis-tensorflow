The check engine light came on in my Toyota so I called Fletcher's after reading review on Yelp. Matt answered the phone and told me to just stop by anytime and he would reset it, because my gas cap wasn't tightened. I went in later that day and he remembered my call and immediately went out to the parking lot and reset it. He said I owed nothing. I couldn't have been treated better. They earned a new customer.
