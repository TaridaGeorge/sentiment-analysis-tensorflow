What a wonderful surprise for lunch today!  This place is just beautiful and we were able to sit out on the patio for a fantastic lunch!  We both had the jardin sandwich - zucchini, sun dried tomatoes, brie and pesto.  It came with a side of green beans, carrots and cauliflower mixed in a wonderful mustard sauce.  The inside of the restaurant is so cozy and quaint as well - lots of wood and chandeliers above every table!  I highly recommend this place.
