I go to Blue Fin for lunch with friends almost every other month.  Locally owned and the little Japanese lady (we call her "mama" san) thanking everyone for coming and making sure your cup is full is awesome and one of the main reasons I keep going back for more.  Food is great for Japanese fast food.  I just tried their coconut shrimp and it was awesome!  If you are hungry try the terriyaki chicken , rice and salad combo, yum!!
