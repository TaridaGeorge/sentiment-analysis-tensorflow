This studio is hip, clean and altogether great looking.  There's a nice selection of goods and the staff is both friendly and helpful.  The studio is large and comfortable with a mirrored front wall and a rustic brick side wall.  There are private rooms for independent or small-group practice and massage is supposedly going to be added in the immediate future.

I'm relatively new to Yoga, having only taken classes intermittently and never in a real studio.  UY made me feel comfortable from my first class and left me wanting to return.  There are all levels offered and even the beginner classes leave me feeling refreshed and invigorated (and, yes, sore the next day!).  There are a lot of options in Yoga studios but Urban Yoga should definitely be on your list.
