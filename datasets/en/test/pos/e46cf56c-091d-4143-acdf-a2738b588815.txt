Monday night is reverse happy hour! Starts at 8pm. You get a bottle of wine and choice of 4 bruschetta for $20! The burrata, bacon, arugula and tomatoes  and the warm artichoke spread are to die for! Outstanding! This is definitely a place to go! One thing that was a little annoying was how loud it is in the restaurant, but the great food outweighed the noise.
