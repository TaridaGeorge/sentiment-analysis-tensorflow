This place is hands down my favorite family restaurant! The Pork Ossu Buco is amazing, the meat falls off the bone. The buttermilk chicken is the perfect blend of sweet potatoes, gravy and chicken. 

Not to mention they have a cool bar and a great patio. They have plenty of margaritas and Mexican beers to choose from, my favorite is the "Margarita Chingon" made by Kenny. 

Nobody in the neighborhood can beat this place, nobody!!
