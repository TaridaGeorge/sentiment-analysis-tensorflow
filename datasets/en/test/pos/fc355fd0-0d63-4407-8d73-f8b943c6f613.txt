Good burger. Got the basic cheeseburger, it had two patties not sure if that was an accident. Burger was yummy. I ordered via the website and picked up in 7 minutes. They wait to cook your fries when u get there. Fries were also yummy and fresh. Fries also were a good serving size. I was not able to eat all of my fries ...but I would bet two to three people can feast on. I was surprised by how expensive a burger and fries was but I was satisfied by meal. Five guys is good but only slightly better than In-out. I think that for the price, I would go to  In-bf out over five guys.
