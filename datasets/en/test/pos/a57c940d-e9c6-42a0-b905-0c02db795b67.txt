Dear Fry's Employee that works behind the pastry counter,
I'm sorry I drooled on the window by the caramel apples. It is one of my few (okay, many) weaknesses.
Sincerely,
Tasia
P.S. You're smart for having a window as a shield for that reason.

This location has everything! I believe this is their Flagship store for the Southwest. Not only can I valet my car for free, BUT I can get it washed while I shop! It sometimes makes me feel like I need to dress up to go grocery shopping here, but then I remember I used to bag groceries here when it was Fred Meyer and I get over my weirdness. Sushi bar, Starbucks (thanks for not helping my addiction), wine concierge, lots and lots of cheese, amazing fresh bread stand, etc. Seriously, you need to give this location a try, you won't be disappointed!
