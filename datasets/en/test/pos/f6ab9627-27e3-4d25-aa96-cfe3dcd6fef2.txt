Stopped in here yesterday and to be honest wasnt able to get exactly what i was looking for (a 6pk assortment of chocolate beers) but I was helped by a great employee who spent 10minutes waking around the store helping me find some other great options...including a 12pk of seasonal Pyramid brews that was only 6.98. AWESOME. anyway, great experience, will def go back.
