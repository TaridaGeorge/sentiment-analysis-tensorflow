This store used to be the only one in Arizona but this year there's another one open up in Glendale.  Nice store and friendly employees, me and my kids have spend countless hours in this store and not to mention spending a lot of moolah as well :-) Two months ago I bught myself the Green Grocer and then last month it was discountinued. So glad that I pick it up before it went out of stock. They do have some nice PAB but it would be nice if they bring it some new parts every now and then. Overall, I am pleased with this store and give it a 5 stars!
