Excellent! I'm a starbucks junkie and I was looking for a place to stop and dink coffee in Mesa while I waited to go to work.  Talk about a score.  

First off, the bagels are 99cents and they are really good, secondly the wifi is free so I was able to browse the internet without hassle, third, the small coffee was like $1.39, and fourth the decor is nice and they have a flat screen tv so you can get the news while you sit.   

The location is downtown Mesa so it has that historical feel.  They also serve breakfast and open at 7am.  Compare that to the money I used to waste at Starbucks every morning and you just can't beat it.
