My husband and I went to Talavera at the Four Seasons on our honeymoon. We were staying at the hotel and this was the only restaurant in the surrounding area. It was SUPERB. Everything from the bread, to the salad, to the appetizers, entrees down to the dessert was impeccable. When the waitress found out it was our honeymoon, she had the chef make us not one but TWO different personalized desserts to celebrate. It was a beautiful night, we sat outdoors and there was a roaring fire as well as heat lamps (it was November, so a bit chilly but beautiful). The food was outstanding, and the service was great. Can't wait to go back!
