Great food, great service, fantastic atmosphere. This place is busy for lunch and busier for dinner. You can't go wrong ordering just about anything. A personal favorite for lunch is the French Dip. The salmon was outstanding. Try the side of Mac and Cheese. It's the best I've ever had; white cheese, and creamy but not very thick.
