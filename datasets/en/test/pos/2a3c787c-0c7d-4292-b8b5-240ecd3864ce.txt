I LOVE Star of India. I have been there three times, and every time, the service and the food were spot-on. You absolutely cannot beat their buffet. They have a huge spread with tons of vegetarian options-- there's something for everyone. On days when they don't have the buffet, they also have a sampler platter on their menu that is good. The buffet and the sampler are great introductions for people who have never had Indian food before. Their vegetable samosas with yogurt sauce are my personal favorite. This is a great restaurant for both vegetarians and omnivores alike.
