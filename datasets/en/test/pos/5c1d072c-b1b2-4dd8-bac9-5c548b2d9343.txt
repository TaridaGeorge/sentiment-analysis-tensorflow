This is the best food I have had in a while, so good!  I had the BLT with veggie bacon and it was awesome and totally satisfying.  My son had the humus and veggies, which he loved.  My husband and mother in law had the vegie burger, which they did not rave about, but said that it was ok.  It is a very cheery interior and we saw some other families come in and dine as well (always good to find more child-friendly places).  This place is truly a gem, will definitely be back!
