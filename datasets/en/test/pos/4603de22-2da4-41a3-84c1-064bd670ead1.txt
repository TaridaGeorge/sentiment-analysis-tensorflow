I've been to this place probably 30 times and it never ceases to have the tastiest drinks and friendliest bartenders in all of Scottsdale. Meredith, Steven, Fernando and Mike will make you a consistently delicious drink each and every time no matter what your taste buds crave! They're also hilarious and will have you smiling through each tasty libation. Be sure to check out the black raspberry martini and ask for the limelight. Feeling hungry? The chicken lettuce wraps are amazing. You won't be disappointed!
