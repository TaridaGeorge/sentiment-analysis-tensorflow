Japanese chefs, top notch sashimi, affordable neighborhood sushi place! 5/5

I'd lived in Japan before and this place can beat those in Tokyo! If you go to Hiro, you have to order their sashimi. We always order scallops sashimi, yellow tail, salmon, toro sashimi and uni (sea urchin)! Their rolls are amazing too. All sashimi comes in a big-fat-lap portion! Very fresh! The service is great too.
