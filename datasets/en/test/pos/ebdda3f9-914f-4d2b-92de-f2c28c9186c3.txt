The ultimate java drive through joint! Coffee is aromatic and sturdy. Much like my Aunt Miriam in Berkley. Staff is SO friendly and accommodating. I've never been inside, so as far as I know they are only torsos serving me. I've had the breakfast burrito and it was perfect for eating in the car. Yes, I was driving and eating. Bad driver! Bad! At least I wasn't texting! A couple of times I've had our dog with me and they always throw in a Scooby snack for Emilie. This is the obvious alternative to Starsucks. And if the line gets too long, they come out in person to take orders and get your morning liquid bean fix started!
