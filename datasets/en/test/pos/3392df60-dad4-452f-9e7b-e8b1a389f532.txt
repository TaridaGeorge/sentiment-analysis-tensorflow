I totally disagree with the 1 star review. I'm scratching my head at how anyone would give this place only 1 star. I've been here a handful of times, and even a few days ago. It's just gorgeous. I LOVE the whole modern, yet lush green look here. Floor to ceiling windows, the best location, good views, and its such a relaxing and urban vibe. Personally, this is my dream home/condo. It's walking distance to the fashion square, the theatre, several restaurants, waterfront & spas/salons. What else do you need? 
Give me a couple years and hopefully I'll be living here very happily.
