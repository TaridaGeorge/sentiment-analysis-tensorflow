I stopped eating hamburger meat a little over a year ago. I really miss cheeseburgers. 

Q: What's a girl to do??
A: Go to In-N-Out, and order a 'grilled cheese, animal style'. 

I just found out that you can basically get a cheeseburger without the beef patty. It comes with lettuce and tomato,(in my version, they held the lettuce) 2 slices o' cheese, grilled onions, slathered in their awesome sauce.  Yay! It really tastes like the cheeseburgers I remember.  

If that sounds good to you, you can order 'animal style' fries, they come loaded with cheese, onions and the sauce.  Freakin' delicious.
