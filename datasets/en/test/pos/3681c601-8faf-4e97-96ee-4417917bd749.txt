Amazing pizza! I would have to say the best pizza I've ever had. I never really had real pizza until this place. Maybe, I thought I had, but once tasting this pizza I realized that I hadn't. A friend took me and my wife to this place and told me that they actually are from New York and they were first having trouble getting the pizza to taste authentic when they first got to Arizona, but they found out it was because of the water here. So they actually used purified water for the dough. It just shows you the detail that goes into making their pizzas. They can even tell you what wine goes with which pizza. pretty cool.
