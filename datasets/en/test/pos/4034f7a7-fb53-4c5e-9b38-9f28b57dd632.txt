This place is the real deal.  I have been back twice now.  Once for dinner and once for lunch.  The food was amazing again!

The open-faced pork loin sandwich was just HEAVENLY!!!  Thick cut multi-grain bread, mashed sweet potatoes, braised greens, topped with 5 thin cut slices of pork loin covered in some sort of gravy brought down by angels.  A side of quinoa salad topped off this lunch.  Just check out the picture.  Nuff said.  HEAVENLY!!!
