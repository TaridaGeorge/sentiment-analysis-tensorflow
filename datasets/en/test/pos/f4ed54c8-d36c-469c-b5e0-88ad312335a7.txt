Staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about products. I had my dog groomed by Caroline and she was great! She was very good with my girl Minnie and she was much better here than at petsmart, where she had been groomed previously. They had great baked treats- I got her a little dinosaur cookie that was very cute! And all pretty inexpensive. I paid less for her grooming here than at petsmart. Plus the groom was only an hour and a half! Plus they have incentives to keep coming back, which is always a plus.
