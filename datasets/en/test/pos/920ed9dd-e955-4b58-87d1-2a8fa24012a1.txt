Huh, so I've never reviewed the Roo?  Well, now seems a good time.  

Helpful hint:  First Friday is not a good night to check out the Roo for the first time.  Thankfully, I've been here a few times before last night, so the cramped sweatiness didn't sway my opinion.  

This is probably my favorite "house bar" of the area.  I love Lost Leaf, but I think the Roo gets a slight nod because of the beers on tap (lots of great microbrews) vs. bottles & cans at LL (also lots of great microbrews).

My advice is to check this place out on an off night or get there early on a weekend night, or else you'll be standing the whole time.
