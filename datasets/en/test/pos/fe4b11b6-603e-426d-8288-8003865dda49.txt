My wife and I dined here for our 10th anniversary.  I was impressed from the moment we arrived at the door.  The staff asked our names, and nobody forgot them the rest of the evening.  We were addressed by our first names, and the service was impeccable, attentive, yet not intrusive.  The food, though, stole the show.  It's everything you've seen on all of the Food Network shows, and then some.  The complexity of the tastes and textures was so varied, and perfect.  The progression of the courses and the pairings with wine were amazing.  I'd go every weekend, but it is quite expensive.
