we went this morning (Sunday) with the 2 kids (2.5 and 1) out to eat for the first time. Kids were great, service and food were also awesome! We had the california eggs benedict and  waffles, both were great. My eggs (over medium) were a bit under cooked and still way juicy but that`s how everybody does it, not a big deal to me, I ate the whites. Service was prompt  and courteous. If any other reviews complain about value they should just not be eating out, average prices here.
