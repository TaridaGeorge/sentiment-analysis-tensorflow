Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!!! This is a great local restaurant that you should experience. The staff is wonderful and friendly, the setting is quaint and the crepes are to die for. I had a breakfast crepe and e en though it was pretty filling I had to order another type of crepe just because it was so good.
