Lovely little restaurant, terrific food. I had the soup/salad combo with Chipotle Chocolate Soup and the Sunflower Salad. The Soup was divine, with a blissful mini corn-muffin as garnish. The salad was pretty and just the right size. I splurged and got dessert, caramelized bananas over rice pudding which had luscious burnt-sugar bits floating in a buttery, sugary sauce poured over a not-overly-sweet rice pudding.

Mmmmmmmmmmm.
