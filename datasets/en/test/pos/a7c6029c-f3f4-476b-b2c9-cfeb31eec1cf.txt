What a fun place.  We came here on a Thursday and were lucky to get seated because pretty soon it was PACKED in here.  Good service, nice clean building, cool paintings on the wall, attractive people everywhere and just an overall fun atmosphere.  Order a bulldog to drink, but don't get the tacos.  They were weird.  I also came here on a Sunday and it was crazy.  It started to get crazy around 3 or 4.  Pretty soon people were dancing on tables, Mr T look a like was walking around pouring milagro down peoples' throats, beach balls flying etc.  My friend who just moved here from Seattle couldn't believe it.  He said it was like when he went to Mexico on vacation.
