Are you kidding me?  OMG.  I am not a frequent giver of the 5 stars.  Sooooo delicious.  By far, my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale.

For apps, a piece of cheese and the radishes with local honeycomb and butter...ridic.  I wouldn't shut up about it.  For entrees, chicken, salad, and pasta with duck confit.  Amazing.  For sides, brussel sprouts with bacon, broccoli, and rutabagas with ginger creme fraiche.  All interesting flavors with excellent preparation.  For dessert, chocolate cake with toffee, blood orange sticky cake, butterscotch pudding, ginger with some sort of quats.  Soooooo freaking good.

Friendly, attentive, and appropriate service.  Great atmosphere.  Lively and nice, without being too loud or too stiff.  I could go on and on.   We will be back!  This places lives up to all of its accolades.

LOVED IT!
