Let me just add a "me too" to the list of those who just love this bookstore.  The eclectic selection of books, the wonderful staff and authors that show up to talk makes this a wonderful asset to all of the East Valley.    One thing everyone should do is sign up for the email list so they don't miss anything that happens at Changing Hands.
