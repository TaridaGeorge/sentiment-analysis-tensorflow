I ate here the other day and thought it was great, I will definitely be going back.  From the other reviews maybe I'm biased since I'm a guy. I had a chicken pita and tried my friends gyro and thought they were both very good.  I didn't find the fries were overly greasy since the little paper sack they came in soaked up some of the oil. I even really liked the fake cheese sauce that came with the cheese fries ( sue me! ). I found the interior very clean for a small "greasy spoon" not as dumpy as you would think.  The staff was very nice and my food came out lightning fast.  For a quick lunch I highly recommend it.
