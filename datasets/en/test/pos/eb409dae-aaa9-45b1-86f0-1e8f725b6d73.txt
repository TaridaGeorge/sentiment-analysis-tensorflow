This place has the BEST PANCAKES I have ever had, IN MY LIFE. 

It would be foolish on your part to not make it a point in your life to eat ANYTHING here. 

Eveyone that I was with enjoyed their meals. Well, we more than enjoyed our meals. I don't now that there is word for how much I loved my pancakes.  They are absolutely massive and delicious. The edges are a little crispy. They must cook them in some type of magical laboratory... with butter. 

The other people I was with had a BLT and a grilled chicken sandwich. The BLT was certainly not skimpy on the bacon and the chicken in the grilled chicken sandwich was moist and delectable. 

Go to Otto's now. NOW I tell you.
