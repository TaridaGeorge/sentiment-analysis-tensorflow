Sometimes you have to give a restaurant a second chance.  We ate here years ago when visiting the area and thought is was OK.  Since moving to Chandler last year we have been back several times and have been very impressed with both the food and the service.  Our waitress, Tabitha, mentioned that they have had a "renewal" of sorts around new items & new chef.  I cannot go to this restaurant and not order the southwest fried chicken, which is one of the best plates I have ever had anywhere!

If you had a similar experience a few years ago, you might want to revisit Santan Brewing Co.  Also nice that we can bring our little silky terrier to the patio.
