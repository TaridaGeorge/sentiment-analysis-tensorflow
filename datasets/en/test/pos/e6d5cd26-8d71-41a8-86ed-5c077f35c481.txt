I went in on New Years Eve.  Walked in with my flat tire, the associate came around the corner and took it, repaired it in less then two minutes and I was on my way.  Associate was hospitable and quick.  Just the way I like it.  

FYI: I couldn't help but notice that they had a large selection of bikes too.  When I'm due for a new bike, I'll be sure to check this place out again.
