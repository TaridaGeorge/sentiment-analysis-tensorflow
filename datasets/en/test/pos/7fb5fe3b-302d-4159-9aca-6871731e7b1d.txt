Excellent, authentic soul food.  This restaurant is an old Phoenix institution and a hallmark of our city's relatively small African-American community. If you can't guess it already, you'll figure out why it's called the "Golden Rule" cafe when it comes time to pay the bill. My cholesterol level can't afford frequent trips to this place otherwise I'd be here far more often. The gravy is yummy.
