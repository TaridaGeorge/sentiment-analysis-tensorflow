This was a great burger experience. I had he bbq bacon burger and smash fries. I called in the order and ate most of the fries on my 10 minute ride home because I was afraid that thy would be nasty cold. I was wrong! My fiance had the sweet potato fries. They were still yummy once we got them home. I have driven by this place many times and will be back soon!
