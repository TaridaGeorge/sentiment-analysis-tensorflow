I agree with a couple of earlier reviews... This is the AZ State Fair, this ain't Paradise Valley.  What a ton of fun!! We went twice this year!! I haven't been to a fair in years, and this is my first one in AZ.  We went once on a regular Friday night, then went back to catch Nas in concert.  Both times it was a lot of fun.  Plenty of games, rides, things to do etc.  We went zip lining!! Glad I didn't drop my flip flops on the people dining on some of the finest turkey legs in all of AZ.  I'm a huge animal lover so I hate the animal attractions but just look past it and have a good time.
