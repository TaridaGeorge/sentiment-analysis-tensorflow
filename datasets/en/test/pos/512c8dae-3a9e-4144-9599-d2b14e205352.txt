This place is awesome. Such a beautiful desert property. The best part is the awesome LAZY RIVER. Nothing beats relaxing in an intertub with a cold beer in the hot Arizona sun.  

I got upgraded to one of the two story Casitas, which was fantastic. So huge and nice. 

This place is great for families, but people of all ages can enjoy it. 

The only thing thats overpriced is the food, but welcome to all hotels.
