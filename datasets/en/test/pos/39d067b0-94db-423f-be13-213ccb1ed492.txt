I can always count on the doctors at Warner Vista Animal Hospital.  They often get me in same day when there is a serious issue with one of my dogs.  I never have to worry about being charged too much or for unnecessary things.  They are up front about the costs, what is crucial vs. might be a good idea vs. not needed.  My dogs have seen all of the doctors at one time or another, and I recommend them all.  I love that I can get medications from that office as well.  I would continue to use Warner Vista Animal Hospital even if I moved.
