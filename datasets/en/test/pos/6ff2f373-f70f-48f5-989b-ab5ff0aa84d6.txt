Love it! Best veggie sub EVAR! The staff is super friendly, always singing along to the music playing, and enjoying themselves.  They always make my sandwich the way I ask. Everything tastes fresh and delish!
My one complaint - delivery.  We live LITERALLY 1 1/2 miles south, basically in a straight line, from the store.  They will not delivery to Scottsdale. Totally lame.
