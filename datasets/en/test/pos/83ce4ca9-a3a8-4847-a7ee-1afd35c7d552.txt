I gotta admit, I didn't think I'd receive very good service by the looks of this place when I first got here on a lunch break. It was super packed and I knew I needed to eat pretty fast since I needed to get back to work asap. I was greeted and sat immediately, and ordered the yellow curry lunch special. They serve a complimentary soup (tom yum) for all meals I guess, since I got one.. but the entree came out ridiculously fast. It was running on fast-food time, but the food tasted like it took a while.. quite tasty! It hit all of the curry flavors of spicy and sweet very nicely. The price was decent and I even had delicious leftovers to take home.
