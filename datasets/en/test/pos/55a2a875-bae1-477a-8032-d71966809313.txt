Yes, it is in a strip mall. Don't let that fool you. This is some downright good food with affordable prices.  Even though service was very attentive the waitress apoligized for taking so long. She must have high standards because like I said service was fast and attentive.  The chef came out and asked every table how their meal was and chatted with everyone a little bit.  The food has a French flair and to it and the chef is from Paris.
