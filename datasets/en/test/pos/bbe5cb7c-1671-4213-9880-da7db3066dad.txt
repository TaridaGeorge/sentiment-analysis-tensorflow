Triple Sports is a great place for first time triathletes and for the pros. Eventhough the selection might be a bit smaller than the other major Tri Store here in Scottsdale I prefer Kara's and Brian's store. They give great personalized service and really are there to help you and are not trying to sell you the most expensive stuff or stuff you don't need ... Brian did a bike fitting for me the other day and did not smirk at all at my not so professional / no so multi thousand dollar bike... There was absolutely no attitude or "intimidation" like I have seen it in other stores before. Besides doing a great job with the bike fitting Brian also gave me a much needed pep talk!  Check out their web page. It's very informative and helpful and shows their passion and humor for Triathlon!
