I am on a personal mission to try every FroYo, Frogurt, Yogurt Trough, etc. in the valley.

This is our latest discovery.  I'll fast forward to the encounter at the register.

Cashier:  "Total is $6.87"
Cassie:  "Are you sure you didn't leave mine off the scale?"
Me:  "Wait, it's Valentine's Day.  This is a sale, isn't it?"
Cashier:  "Nope.  We always charge $0.30/ounce."
Me and Cassie:  "God d******."

We prefer the self-service Frogurt stops, and this one has 12? flavors, making it the top of the chain in that department.  Also, the vast mixins are a real turn-on.  And when a place has high quality, high quantity, and is charging 25% less than competition, what isn't to adore?

Yogurtland beats them all.  Nuff said.
