Excellent restaurant. Very classy and wonderful selections. I would recommend it for families and dates. It was slightly loud though but that was the only negative. We had a party of 4 and everyone was thrilled with their food. Prices were in the $14-$30 dollar range and seemed reasonable. Use a restaurant.com gift cert for an even better deal.
