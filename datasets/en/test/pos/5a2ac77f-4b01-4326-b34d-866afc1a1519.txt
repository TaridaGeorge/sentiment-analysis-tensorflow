Wow!  Sampled the ravioli and meatballs during Yelp's Ultimate pleydate event.  I wanted more and will make my way to the restaurant to fulfill my desire.

I didn't wait long to go to the restaurant after trying the samples.  Went the next night.  We ordered meatballs and the stuffed ravioli as well as a pizza topped with artichoke and garlic.  Everything was very fresh and tasted wonderful.  The manager and our server, Ivan, told us why: They make everything from scratch.  Even the mozzarella is in-house.  This is not your typical pizzeria.

We had the cheesecake with strawberry sauce and it was VERY good.  Rich and the sauce is, again, made from fresh ingredients.  The menu has a number of items we want to try and we will be returning to do so.
