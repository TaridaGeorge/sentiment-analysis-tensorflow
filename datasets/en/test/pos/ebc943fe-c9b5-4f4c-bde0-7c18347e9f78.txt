Love it here on Saturday for lunch and a bit of sports!
Wings are delicious... just cant beat the great atmosphere. Location doesnt hurt either :)

Happy Hour prices are really great, and the service is great. Food delicious.
Best thing is not only are they accomodating to big groups but there is no bad place to sit in this place- great to watch any sporting event.
