I love this place! Abdeen's has amazing Egyptian food at affordable prices. The restaurant has no license which means that we can bring whatever we want, BYOB style. Tonight they set a few hookah pipes in the parking lot and before long a dozen people were socializing. It is my find of the year in the 85306. Check it out, and have a delightful meal.
