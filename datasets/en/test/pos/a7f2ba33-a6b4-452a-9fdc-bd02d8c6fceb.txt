Love Zia Record Exchange! I can kill so much time in this place. It's a pretty eclectic store. They have an awesome selection of new and used cd's, LP's, video's and other items related to music (and some not related). Very friendly staff that's always willing to assist. I know that I can usually find what I'm looking for in either new or used music at the lowest prices around. I can spend hours (which I have) just browsing through this place. Stores like this are far and few now, so help support you local chains such as Zia.
