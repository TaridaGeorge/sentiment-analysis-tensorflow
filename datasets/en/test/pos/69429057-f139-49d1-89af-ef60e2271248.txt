I have used these guys twice and both times were excellent. The first time another company had quoted me $2500 for a repair. I called these guys and talked to the tech on the phone and he didn't believe the tech fromt eh other company did any real troubleshotting. American Air came out late that night and found the real problem and it ended up only costing me $400. 

Defintely the most knowledgable, trustworthy and honest AC company i have dealt with. I will always recommend them to my friends
