This gym has everything I need...if only I could step it up so that I actually see results! Great price, no contracts. Love the new open area. The Jacob's Ladder and the Stair Stepper tried to kill me -- but it's all good. Both are perfect for my marathon training. Love that I can run a few miles along the canal nearby before I do core. There is a Tanning section as well...I've spotted a few 'Magda' looking creatures from 'Something About Mary'...not a pretty sight. Thank God I naturally have a beautiful year 'round tan. Amen!
