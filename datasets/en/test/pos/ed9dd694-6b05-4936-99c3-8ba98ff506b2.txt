We dine here about once a month, and have for years. Love the food - the oysters Michelina are so so good (especially with her homemade bread to sop up the sauce) and the pasta is fresh and lovely. It's a small place and has been at the same location for something like 20 years, so the decor is slightly dated but we go there all the time for the fabulous food and wine. Brad is awesome as host/waiter/bartender, and of course we alwasy enjoy a visit to our table by Michelina's herself, which is always a nice touch.
