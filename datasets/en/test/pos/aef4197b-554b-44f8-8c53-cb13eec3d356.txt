Finally had a chance to try Iruña.  If you go through my old reviews, you'll see that Sol y Sombra was my absolute most favorite restaurant in the Valley until it abruptly closed.  This made me muy triste.  

Sol y Sombra 2 - aka Iruña - is just as good.  Most of my favorite dishes and cocktails made the leap from NoSco to OTS thankfully.  So did most of my favorite employees...and they remembered me!

The ONLY negative thing I can think of is that they got rid of my favorite dessert - the baked apple.  Eating it was like going down on an angel.  Put that back on the menu!
