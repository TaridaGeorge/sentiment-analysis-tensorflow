I never knew how great Arizona could be until I visited my brother in Tempe last week.

Changing Hands is fun, I ended up spending around $25 for a used book, a cute bookmark, a plush hamster, and some cards with cupcakes on them.  

They get major bonus points for carrying nifty tools such as the spaghetti fork that twirls for easy eating.  If you need to write thank you cards they have a great selection to choose from.

My cashier was very nice, and the atmosphere was comfortable.  I think some of the customers had been setting up camp in there for most of the morning.  The best part is you don't need to worry about packing rations since they have a cafeteria attached to the store.
