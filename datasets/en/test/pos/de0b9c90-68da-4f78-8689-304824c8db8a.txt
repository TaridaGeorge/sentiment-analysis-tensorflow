Thai restaurants seem to be popping up everywhere but this spot is really the best. The staff is extremely friendly and even during peak lunch/dinner hours they ensure drinks are never left empty. 

The food is crazy delicious. The thai basil pork is one of my favorites or the seafood pad-see-ew (also great with chicken).
