This will be my new lunch time hangout!  The Lodge has a nice variety of food.  Something for everyone.  We had Potato skins as an appetizer with a terrific cheese dip.  For lunch we had a  Viena Polish Sausage with caramelized onions, taco salad and chef salad and fries.  Everything was great.

The service is fast and friendly.  

I love the atmosphere.  It reminds me of a fishing lodge in Canada or Alaska.  Very comfortable, TV's on the wall and a pool table and couches in the back.  The music is eclectic, playing one great song after another from many eras and genres.  Just a great place to hang out!

The prices are very reasonable as well.

Already looking forward to my next visit!!!!
