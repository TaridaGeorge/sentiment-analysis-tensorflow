This is a great place to take out-of-town visitors.  Just be prepared to take a nap afterward...all of the fresh air, beautiful scenery and delicious food makes you sleepy!  The ambiance is unique; it's all outdoor seating at picnic tables under pecan trees.  Your meal is served in a basket and the food is very tasty.  You can buy fresh vegetables, unique gifts or go for a stroll through a botanical garden.  I highly recommend dining at The Farm at South Mountain!
