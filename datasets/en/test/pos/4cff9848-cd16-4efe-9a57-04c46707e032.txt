Yay Food Truck Fridays! 

What better way to supplement your hot dog of awesomeness than with super-delicious artisan ice cream?

My friend and I tried out the Arizona Medjool Date, Cinnamon, and the (something alcohol? not sure, can't remember) pear sorbet. 

We are big (ok, getting a bit too literal here) fans. Loved the cinnamon especially.
