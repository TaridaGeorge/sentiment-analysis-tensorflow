I have to knock this up to 5 stars and give you all a recommendation for your visit...

GET A SUNSET RESERVATION!!!

The first time I went, we had a 9:00 reservation because we made it on the same day.  This time, I called about 2.5 months in advance in an attempt to make a sunset reservation (in a booth) as a surprise for my boyfriends birthday.  It was perfect!  I couldn't have orchestrated the evening any better.  We got there at 7:30 and as soon as our celebratory cocktail hit the table, the thin blinds rose and we had an unbelievable view-it was almost too perfect!  I also made a better choice for this order and went with roasted chicken served over truffle macaroni and cheese.  It was to die for!
