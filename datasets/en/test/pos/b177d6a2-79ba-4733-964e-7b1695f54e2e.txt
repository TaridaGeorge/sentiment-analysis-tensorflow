Last Chance is the place to shop for fashion on a budget----it's a ton of  name brand items returned from premium stores at unbelievable discounts. Sometimes there are masses of people but--you can always come home with something awesome---if your eyes are pealed. It's nice to have a couple key items in the wardrobe. Research the styles and brands that suit your aesthetic and happy hunting :)
