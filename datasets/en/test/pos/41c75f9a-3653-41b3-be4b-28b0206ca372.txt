I eat breakfast there EVERY WEEKDAY.  The food, service, personal attention makes this the best stop of the day.  Food is very consistent and priced right.  Eggs always perfect.  Coffee served in thermos pot.  Time from order placed to food served is almost immediate.  Have never had anything but great experience.

John, Stacy, and all the crew will pamper you.
