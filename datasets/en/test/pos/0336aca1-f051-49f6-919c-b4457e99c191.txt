I am writing this review for one reason only - the Deconstructed Fish Tacos.  I am in LOVE with them and when I say LOVE, I mean obsessed.  

These "tacos" are ready to be assembled when they come to your table with a thick, steak-like, grilled white fish, corn tortillas, salsa, black beans that actually taste good and a slaw....this slaw is what makes the dish.  It is comprised of edamame, corn, cabbage and who knows what else, but The Vig has hit it on the head.  

Now The Vig has been a neighborhood staple for years, a great place to drink and eat on the patio and meet friends for a game, but with this new menu revision, I am just loving the food.  Great job!  Now if they would just redo the dessert menu, they could have 6 gold stars...
