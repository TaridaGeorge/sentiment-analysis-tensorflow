We attended the first Friday in May,(had never attended before) The coffee was perfect! The chocolate cookie was the right texture with my coffee.  When we attended we had the pleasure of listening to music by two wonderfully talented women. 

The area is beautiful, I had no idea that down town looked and felt like a small town. We loved it!
