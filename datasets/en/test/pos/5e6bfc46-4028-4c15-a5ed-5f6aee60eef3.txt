if you are sick of quizznos, subway or any other sandwich chain place i would check this place out... there sandwiches are very good and different than what you will find at the other places... i always get the hot ham and cheese (it also has sprouts and mushrooms on it)... one of my friend swears by the chicken parm sandwich but i have not tried it yet... but if it is a late night tonight, you know i will be hitting it up tomorrow...
