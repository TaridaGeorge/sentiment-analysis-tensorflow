I went to this place for an emergency haircut and colour. Was a bit trepidacious but need not have worried. Miranda is a real professional and I got a fabulous haircut and highlights from her at a very reasonable price. I only wish I lived in Phoenix so I could go to her regularly. Her prices are really good and her color expertize is superb. Go see her you will not be disappointed!!
