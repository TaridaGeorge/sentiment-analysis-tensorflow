Perfect price, perfect service, and you can bet I'll eat here again! Had the Gyro Burger because it was on special, but I could not have picked a better start to this place. Made me realize there's more to burgers than some of the other places in the area. 

Fries were on point and everything on the menu seems amazing. I mean, mini corn dogs, really guys, thank you..Plus, any time you spend more than 10 minutes to decide what to drink, it's not really indecisiveness, it's exploration. I can almost guarantee that there's 30-40 that you've never even seen before.

It's no wonder it lead the charts while searching for a local burger joint...
