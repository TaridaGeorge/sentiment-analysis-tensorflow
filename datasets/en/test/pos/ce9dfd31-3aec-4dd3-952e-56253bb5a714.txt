Ive eaten here several times. Great Food!! As for the reviews I see from a couple of  people saying its too pricey, all I can say is Huh?!! Its a lot of food for not a lot of money.  If anything, the prices are like that to keep the cheapies like them, outta there.  If youre complaining about the price of a pizza, maybe you should go through the pizza hut/ taco bell drive through next time. You can get a whole pizza and feed a whole family for around 20 bucks. Not a bad deal at all. I'll be back again really soon!!! 
Oh, and ask for Nicole. She was fantastic!!!
