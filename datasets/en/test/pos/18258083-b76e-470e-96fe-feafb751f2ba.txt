The Tom Kha always brings me in, then I have to stay for the drunken noodle and a Thai tea! The restaurant is pretty tiny and you can sometimes hear awful karaoke from next door, but the food is worth it. I resorted to Thai Rama once when my Thai craving hit and they were closed, never again...the taste does not even compare. It's never been busy when we go in, so if you're looking for a new Thai place give it a shot; I would be heartbroken if they went out of business.
