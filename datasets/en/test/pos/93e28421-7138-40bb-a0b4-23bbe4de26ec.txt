I had a super wonderful experience with Trish, who gave me a great pedicure and a full set. She magically turned my cracked and calloused dino feet into sparkly and soft fairy feet!! Woohoo!

I always think that the experiences we share at the salon is the biggest part pf being at a salon. By the end of my appointment I felt like I had known Trish forever... I was ready to go have a sleepover at her house with all of her rescue dogs!!! I felt happy and taken care of. You walk into this salon not just as a client (for me a stranger as well) and you leave with hugs and new friends :)
