Love it!!! I lived within blocks of this restaurant for over a year before I tried it, which was my mistake.  My friends and I have a theory that they drug their food because it is so addictive.  Their Green Curry is heavenly and I go back & forth between getting it with Chicken or Tofu.  The Thai Basil is good too.  Try the spring rolls. The take out portions are not skimpy, and the veggies are always fresh & perfectly cooked. This restaurant is one of my favorites.
