Had a wonderful dinner on a Thursday evening. My wife had the pasta with meatballs. My daughter had the Lobster Mac-N-Cheese. She enjoyed it very much.

I had the Seafood Linguine. The pasta was made with squid ink. It was black and was incredible. You need to go and try this dish. That is the dish I will have next time we go. Don't let the idea of squid ink throw you. I does not taste like you were sucking on the end of a pen. It adds a subtle sweetness to the dish. Try it and let me know what you think.

Great place for pasta downtown.
