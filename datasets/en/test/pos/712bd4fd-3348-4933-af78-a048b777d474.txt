this is an annual running event, to get folks to 'resolve' to embrace a healthier lifestyle. only 5k, it starts and ends in papago park. a short jaunt through the park, onto the canal, then turn around and head back the way you came. 
quick, easy, and it starts at 9am so you don't have to get up at the butt crack of dawn, and over by 10:30am so you have the rest of the day to enjoy. 

they have TONS of free raffle prizes along with tasty goodies from sweet tomatoes restaurant. plenty of parking, free long-sleeve t-shirt (i guess not technically free since you pay for the race), and just a good crowd. 

every year, early january.
