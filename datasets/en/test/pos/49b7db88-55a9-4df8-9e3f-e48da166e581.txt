This place rocks, great diner with great food.  It doesn't say Mike & Ronda's but rather just "The Place" and it doesn't do it justice because it is much more than just "the place".  I had the chorizo plate and my brother had a sampler plate of every meat they have to offer.  The eggs were great, the hash browns were perfectly crisp and flavorful, the tortillas were fresh tasting and my brothers bacon was awesome.  I will definitely come back.  It doesn't look fancy inside but it is pretty large, I can imagine this place getting busy on the weekend but I usually avoid crowds when I can.
