We enjoyed New Years Eve at Beckett's. I had the Special which was an incredible Ribeye Roast and my wife had, as she always does, a Chef's surprise. Being Vegan I request, when reserving, that she be served a vegan meal and leaving it up to Justin to prepare. She has never been dissapointed. Service, ambiance, food quality, beverages, all without fault. Thank you for maintaining your level of attention to customer service and your commitement to quality. There are many restaurants in the Phoenix metropolitan area that one can choose to dine at. I cannot name one, where I would rather go, knowing that I do not stand a chance of walking out feeling dissapointed.
