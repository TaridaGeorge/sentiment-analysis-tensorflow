Awesome food, atmosphere, bartenders, sweet as sugah bull riding operator. They give you free cotton candy (how nostalgic) if you hang out for a little bit and then stir up the inner cowgirl and get you to give the bull a shot. This place is always a good time with a great staff. One of my favorite spots in Old Town! Go for happy hour, its even better then!
