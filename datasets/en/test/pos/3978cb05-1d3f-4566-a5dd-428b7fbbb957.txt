This place is a favorite of mine.  The crowd here is very chill and friendly.  I have met some of the most fascinating people here.  They also provide good entertainment.  Quite a few local bands have made their way to the small corner stage. And Sunday's open mic always gurantees a good time. This is an all around great bar and definitely worth checking out. Its a great place to get drunk, but it is still fun if you decide to behave yourself and stay sober.
