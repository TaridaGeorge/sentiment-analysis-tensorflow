They have 64 flavors and a lot of the flavors rotate out.  I had the blood orange flavor and boy I missed blood oranges.  They have the classic flavors like the straciatella, but then they break out into other flavors you don't really come across too often like the black sesame, red bean, and lychee.  They even have a Ferrero Rocher flavor.  If you have a palette for something sweet or something with more substance, you're able to find what you're looking for here.

Gelato 64 come to Chicago!
