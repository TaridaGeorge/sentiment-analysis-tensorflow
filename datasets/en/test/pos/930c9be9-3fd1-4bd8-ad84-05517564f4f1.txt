Better than any Starbucks u can get the staff is very friendly and it was located just steps from my hotel which was a plus they also have great ice cream that they sell until 2 in the morning great drunk impulse buy what sold me was the ice cream "samiches" made with freshly baked chocolate chip cookies definitely will be a regular stop on my future trips into town
