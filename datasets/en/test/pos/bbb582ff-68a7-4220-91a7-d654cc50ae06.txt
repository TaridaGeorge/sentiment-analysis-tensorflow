I love this place.

Where else can you get a cheap ($3-$4) Vietnamese sandwiches in Arizona? There are a bunch of chains in California, but this is the only one in AZ. 

I usually get the combo or the BBQ pork sandwhich with a Jackfruit smoothie. (Delicious!) 

I give 5 stars for the value and taste alone!
Plus they got a lot of seats and make creme filled custards and other Asian bakery items.
