I had one cat, and I liked her a lot. I started to feel a little bad though because she was alone a lot. One day my wife talked me into driving to the humane society "just to look". I now have two cats and I like them a lot. The Arizona Humane Society was professional, courteous, and I had a great experience with them. We were given helpful ideas for every aspect of introducing a second cat to the home and drove away feeling confident, and the fact that Sherlock was covered up to five hundred bucks for an initial checkup was a huge bonus, we actually found a new vet because of it. I will recommend the humane society to anyone I know looking to adopt a friend, it's awesome.
