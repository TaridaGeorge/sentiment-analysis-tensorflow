"So Jimmy, tell the class what you saw at Sweeties!"

"OK, well, I saw lots of candy. Old-timey candy and cool candy and neat candy. Lots of it. Real lots."

"And I saw people walking around with baskets and talking about candy. And talking about candy when they were little.  And talking about what candy they should get for their kids."

"Oh, and I saw Turkish Taffy, Maple Bun Bars, Fruit Stripe Gum, Moon Pies, Cherry Mash, Mary Janes, Valomilk Candy Bars,Sen Sen Packs, Goo Goo Clusters, Squirrel Nut Zippers, Flipstick Lipstick, Licorice Pipes, Zero Bars, Twin Bings, Look Bars, Abba-Zabba Bars and U-No Bars.  And that was only a little of it.  And lots of other stuff."

"Teach?"

"Yes Jimmy?"

"The coolest teacher ever would take her class to Sweeties."

"Would they?"

"Yes."
