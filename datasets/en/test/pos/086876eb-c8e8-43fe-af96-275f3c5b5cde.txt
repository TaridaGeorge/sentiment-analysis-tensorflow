very pleasant experience, I'm not one to review hotels unless its a resort. staff was attentive, pleasant and knowledgeable. Kate at the front desk, was the star of my visit. She knew exactly where to point me for food, and keeping my down-time between meetings occupied. I live in scottsdale, but came down here for meetings so I stayed downtown a few days. Great experience, thanks Kate!
