I went to Loving Hut's grand opening on Sunday the 19th.  They prepared a variety of food for us to sample, and it was delicious.  I especially liked the chow mien and the fried "shrimp."  The Pink Lady was also good.  I think it is a mixture of cranberry juice and soy milk with crushed ice - very refreshing!

I have been waiting for more veg options on the west side, and I will definitely be going back!
