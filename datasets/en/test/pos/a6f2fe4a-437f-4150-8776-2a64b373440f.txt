So not vegan or vegitarian but had to try this place.  Good prices, around 6.50 a plate and very sizeable portions. I had the Golden Roll Vermicilli and boyfriend had the Hawaiin "burger".  I really enjoyed my dish but bf not so happy with his,.... i think because he knew it was vegan tho! Loved the interior, real bright and clean.  Entire menu is vegan and they promote a green way of life.  While waiting on our food to go they were kind enough to give us each a glass of a new smoothie they were testing out.  Loved it. Would go back for that alone. Tasted like Jamba Juice but knew it was better since vegan! Deff going back. Nice menu variety as well...only downer is hours. Monday thru Sat 11am till 9pm and CLOSED on Sundays
