Hot damn, this place is good. It's a beautiful location, relaxed yet small interior, and an amazing place to dine outside when the weather cools off. Servers are always knowledgable  and friendly, and the food... oh the food! Everything is to die for, especially the foie gras, mussels, and the veal cheeks.

Go! You won't be disappointed.
