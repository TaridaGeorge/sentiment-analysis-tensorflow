Hands down the best Thai food in phoenix. Hubby says it's the best Thai food he's had since coming back from Thailand. Amazing service, quality food, and good prices. We go here a MINIMUM of once a month, usually twice- and we only go out to eat on saturdays.
The Pad Thai is to die for, and their fried bananas and coconut icecream is amazing.
