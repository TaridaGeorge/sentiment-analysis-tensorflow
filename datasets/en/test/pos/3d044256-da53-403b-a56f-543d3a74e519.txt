My cousin and auntie were here visiting from Michigan.  My mother and I searched high and lo for an Eastern Europe restaurant and we found it.  This has got to be the best place in Arizona.  It didn't appear from the outside, but once you stepped in, It's very clean, newly remodeled.  The waiter was very kind, but what do you expect, it's Eastern Europe :)  Definitely would go here again!
