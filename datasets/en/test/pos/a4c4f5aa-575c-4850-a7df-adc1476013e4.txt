Awesome service, good food, excellent drinks!  
I've been coming here for 15 years!  They do not skimp on alcohol when they make yr drinks.  That is the owner's policy :)))   He has locations in downtown Phx (Hanny's), in NYC ( Bar 89) and in Milwaukee and I hear Berlin, Germany.  
They have excellent martini's that are filled to the top of the glass.  The mojito's are the best next to being in Miami and ordering one.  The food is good and can be shared in most cases.  
The ambience is always amazing and the art work changes.   It can be tricky to find so def use Yelp and map it.  When you walk in you'll be transported to a high end NYC, LA, Miami type of venue.
