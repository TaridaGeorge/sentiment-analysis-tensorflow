I moved to AZ about five months ago and have had two tragically bad haircuts from two other "salons." 

I wear my hair in a short pixie cut and it's very hard to find someone with the skills to do it right so I don't  end up with a mans cut.

I found Epic Salon here on Yelp and decided to give it a try.

I could not be more pleased.  My appointment yesterday was with Chey and she's wonderful. 

I am very exacting when it comes to how I like my hair cut and am fluent in industry terms so I can articulate what I want.

Chey listened very well and understood what I wanted. She totally delivered. 

I am so very relieved to have found her.  And at $26 (cut only, no blow out) it's a real deal.
