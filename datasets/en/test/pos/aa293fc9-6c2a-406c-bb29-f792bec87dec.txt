Saturday night, 6PM -  Immediate seating, drinks quickly brought to booth.  "Jen" was our server - great service and personality.  Explained the different sauces to us and had chips to taste all.  $6 call drinks (that's nice) but then we're not at Firebirds.  Dave's is a nice roll up your sleeves and grab a paper towel rib joint.  The ribs and sides are wonderful (who can eat a whole slab?)  It's a go-back-to place for sure in Chandler.
