This is the definition of a hidden gem! Nestled in a strip mall, this cute little place will leave you delighted and stuffed! 

The extensive menu offers heaping portions and endless options. I've had their eggplant entree, greek salad, artichoke dip, pizza, etc. and I have no complaints about a single one of them! Everything is fantastic! 

I even took my incredibly picky parents to this place and they've been back 4 or 5 times...now that's truly telling of the place.
