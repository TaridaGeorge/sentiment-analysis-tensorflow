The salon at Lifetime Fitness is awesome! I didn't even know it was there until a friend recommended it. You don't even need to be a member however they will give you a day pass to use in the Fitness center before or after your salon experience. 

The salon is super clean and the staff is friendly. Carie has been my stylist for my last 3 appointments. I highly recommend her. She did an amazing job with my hair (cut, color and style)
