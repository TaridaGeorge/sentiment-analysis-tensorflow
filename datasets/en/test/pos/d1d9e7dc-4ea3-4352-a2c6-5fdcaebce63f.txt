It doesn't get to much better than Fez, great atmosphere, great food, reasonable prices, good service.
The best part is you get to pretend you're in a metropolitan city when you're there. 
Fez is one small step in the right direction for central Phoenix, someday there might be dozens of restaurants like this one, but for now enjoy the original.
My favorites are the lamb kisra (its hard to get lamb these days), and the bleu cheese balsamic burger. Bring an appetite!
