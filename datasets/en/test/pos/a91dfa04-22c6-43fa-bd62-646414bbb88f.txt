Went last night with a table of 6. Had a great time -- got to sample several different pizza's and were impressed by the quality of ingredients used in the toppings -- I loved the sage and sausage combo, and that fact that the pepperoni was actually spicy! Can't say we were blown away by the crust, but it's inauspiciousness allowed the amazing toppings to shine.  

We were also impressed with the remodel of the space, in particular the desire to stay true to the mid century bones of the space, while adding a modern, yet organic edge. I loved the reuse of the salon chairs as bar stools, and the vintage photos of the salon next to the washrooms... 

One last thing, not sure it was intentional or not, but we enjoyed the $7 pitchers ($2 pints) of PBR -- it brought back fond memories of college.
