As a true Chinese grew up in Taiwan, I know what Taiwanese foods supposed to taste like. It's here. The owner is a native Taiwanese. Not like other Chinese restaurant, the owner make the special ingredients everyday herself. 

The price is good and reasonable cheap. There is no better place to taste the traditional Taiwanese foods. My favorite dish is the spicy noodle.
