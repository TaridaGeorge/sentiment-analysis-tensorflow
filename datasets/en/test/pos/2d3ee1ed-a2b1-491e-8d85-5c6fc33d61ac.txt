I enjoy the beef chow fun and the honey walnut shrimp.  Taste like I'm back in San Fransisco so I would say pretty good Chinese food in Arizona :)
I like the fat noodles, lots of meat, strong flavors, and great portions.  They use onions and yes I do like it since it adds flavor to the dish, I just don't eat all the onions.  Only thing let on the plate is some onions after I'm done with it.  
If you want good Chinese food in Surprise this is the place.
