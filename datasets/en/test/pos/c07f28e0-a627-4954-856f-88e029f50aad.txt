This is a huge upgrade from my experience at the Chandler location!  The people working here are so friendly and helpful.  They make sure you leave satisfied and no ridiculously long wait times (This is why I love all things Scottsdale).  I had a continuing issue with my laptop and was fed up.  Needless to say, they fixed the problem permanently!  Shoutout to Justin (my Q-boro homie), Adam the manager and Otthman(sorry for the spelling).  You guys are the bestest! :D
