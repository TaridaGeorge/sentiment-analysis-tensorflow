the guys that work there all do amazing work.  my tattoo came out better than i hoped (as simple as it was).  

they have a nice set up, each artist has a good amount of space within their sections.

it's clean.  felt very comfortable in there.

and they entertain you.  movies playing on tvs all about the place.

i will certainly get more work done here.
