Last week I was farming since the break of dawn in South Phoenix and starving for a huge & hearty breakfast. For $3.41 I got a bag of warm tortillas, endless salsa, rice, beans, small side salad and tons of eggs with ham and veggies, huevos con jamon. Ranch Market, how I love you! 

Plus they have an amazing array of prepared foods throughout the day.

Grocery shopping there reminds me that this land is in fact Mexico. I dont think I could love this place more.
