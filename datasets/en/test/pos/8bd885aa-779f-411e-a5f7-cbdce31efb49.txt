Yogurtland continues to leave my palate pleased. What sets Yogurtland apart from the rest for me is the fact that they consistently change out their flavors and add entirely different ones to the mix, not just varieties of chocolate. Recently, I've seen Oatmeal, peanut butter and jelly sandwich and pumpkin flavors come to the store. I didn't entirely trust the peanut butter and jelly but I absolutely loved the Oatmeal and pumpkin flavors! The chocoholic in me always needs to add a little chocolate to it as well. 

Yogurtland has a wide variety of toppings to choose from and they do an excellent job of keeping the area clean. The pricing is about standard for the yogurt and I just wish they would provide smaller cups...maybe one day!
