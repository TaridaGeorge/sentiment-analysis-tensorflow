So we have Violet. She was truly a puppy stray that we picked up in Claypool, Az.  With Mange. Nice, huh? Dr. Shure is so good with her..she loves him and let him pull...are you listening? PULL A TOOTH with no sedation. He knew it was wonky and would come out easily and he didn't even freakin' charge us for it. WHO does that? 
GO. Go. I send all my clients there and they're all satisfied.
