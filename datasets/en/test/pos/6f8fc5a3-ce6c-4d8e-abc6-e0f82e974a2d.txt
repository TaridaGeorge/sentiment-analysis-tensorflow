Dr. Perno and his staff are the best I have ever experienced. I went in to take care of 6  teeth that all had multiple cavities. He was extremely gentle, and I never even felt the needle go into my gums, let alone anything else. Not only did he do satisfactory work without causing me any pain, he also gave me tips and hints as to how to better care for myself. 

I felt that he truly cared about me as a patient, and left feeling like I had known him my whole life, even though this was my first time visiting. I would recommend him to strangers and family members alike, and will continue to use his services for as long as I can afford it!! Thank you !
