A guy at work has brought these donuts in several times.  I usually pass on the sweets but they are really out of this world.  Best donuts I can remember having.  Take that as you will as I'm no expert on sweets but I stand by saying these donuts are absolutely delicious.  Good thing this place is way up in Anthem and not next door to me.  I really wish he'd stop bringing these in already.  Just had a buttermilk donut that was decadent, sweet, sugary, and fresh.  If you like donuts you should try it.  If you dont like donuts you should try it.
