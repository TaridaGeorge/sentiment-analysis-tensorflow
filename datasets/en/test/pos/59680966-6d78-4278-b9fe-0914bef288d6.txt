Hands down my favorite place to get sushi in the valley without breaking the bank. But wait, what if you don't want sushi? They have something for everyone. My friend says the burger is delicious, but me, I'm here for the underground sushi. 

Pro tips: go during happy hour, 3 to 6:15 Monday through Friday and all day Sunday. Also sit at the bar, the bartenders are more attentive than the girls working the floor.
