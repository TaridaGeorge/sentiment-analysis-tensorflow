I love Bob Lachniet and the folks at Fitness 4 Home Superstore. I've purchased a True Treadmill and a recumbent bike from them. They are great to buy from because they know how to fit the exercise equipment to my body. Their equipment is top notch and really lasts. They really know what they are doing. It's also great that my personal trainer highly recommends them. I tell anyone looking for fitness equipment in Tempe, Scottsdale or Phoenix to see Bob at Fitness for Home Superstore.
