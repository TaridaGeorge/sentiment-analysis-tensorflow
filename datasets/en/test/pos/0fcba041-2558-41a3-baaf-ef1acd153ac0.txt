I love this place. The beer is plentiful, the girls are pretty, and the food is delicious. Nothing beats coming in and getting three giant pretzels for about a dollar each. The service was excellent, Lissett and Marleena  (I made sure to get their names just for this article) were both very helpful when it came to my beer selection, plus they provided plenty of entertainment for my friend and I. The patio makes for a great spot to drink and socialize. Thank you Mellow, I had a great time!
