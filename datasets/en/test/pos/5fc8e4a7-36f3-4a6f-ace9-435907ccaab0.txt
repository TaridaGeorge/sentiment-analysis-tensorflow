Firesky Resort and Spa is my home away from home. As a bride who had her wedding reception here, I am familiar with the outstanding service provided. The Firesky staff gives you the personal touch you look for in customer service. I love the ambiance. Prepare to be immersed in a cool modern tropical atmosphere. We refer all of our out of town guests here. The rooms are comfortable. We love catching a drink or two here as well and sitting by the poolside. I can't wait to go back again.
