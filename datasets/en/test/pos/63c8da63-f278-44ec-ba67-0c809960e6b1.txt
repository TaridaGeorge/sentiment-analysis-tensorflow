Whats not to love about a breakfast place thats always crowded every weekend? For starters i have to say DO try their protein pancakes.....they are out of this world, and their skillets are almost as good as mine...but thats another story.
We only had to wait about 10 minutes, which was good considering the amount of people they had in there. The service was quick and pleasant. 
I know consider myself a US egghead!
