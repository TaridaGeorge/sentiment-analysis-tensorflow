My wife and I were both very impressed with our first visit to Latitude Eight. The decor is simple and elegant, and the service was outstanding.

I had the ginger chicken stir fry. It was full of flavor and not spicy at all. I particularly liked the black mushrooms and miniature corn. I tried a bit of my wife's banana dessert, and it was the perfect finish to the meal.
