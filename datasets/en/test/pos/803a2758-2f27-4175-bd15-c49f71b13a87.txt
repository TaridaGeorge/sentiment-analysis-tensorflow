Another great meal and a new beer discovered back in the wine/tapas area. I love that they're knowledgeable about what they're pouring, not just pulling whatever name somebody grunts and points at.

I've eaten from every one of their "stations" now, and love them all. It sounds odd meeting someone for lunch/dinner at a grocery store, but hey, they get over it.

I usually take a load of groceries or other shopping stuffs (they have a lot more than just food) home with me. I live a fair distance away, which is a shame or this would be our regular store.
