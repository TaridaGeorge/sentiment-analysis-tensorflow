WHAT A FIND!
I hope I never need a repair again, but If I do, I know where to take it.  I had cracked my screen on my iPhone 4s pre-coffee yesterday and noticed them after stopping at Dunkin Donuts and just stopped in.  CJ was honest, attentive, quick and his prices were more than reasonable. iFix really saved the day!
