The Mama Spinato's Signiture pizza is the most amazing pizza I have ever had.  I don't even put it in the same catagory as regular pizza.  We can order peperoni pizza or what ever from any place.  But the Mama Spinato's Signiture pizza is speacial, it's like hambergers vs steak.  I love pizza but this place takes it to a whole new level.  Lucky me there is one by the house and by my work.
