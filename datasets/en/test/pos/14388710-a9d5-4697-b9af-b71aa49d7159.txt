This was pretty much the first business I had the chance to experience when I came from CA to check out this city 
This hotel is a lover paradise. If you can afford few nights in one of their casita I believe you will share some happy stories with you grand children  about the time spent in paradise.
By the way the spa and restaurant are also institutional in the city.
