I met a friend here for brunch and it was absolutely delicious.  I highly recommend the Matador.  Things I would never have thought of to combine but it was absolutely delicious.  They also have a great bloody mary bar for only $5.  I would highly highly recommend this place. You can sit indoors or out.  They have misters so even in the heat it didn't feel that bad.  The servers were attentive but not in your face so we were able to sit and talk without feeling like we were being pushed out.  

Parking is difficult but they do have a free valet.
