I've gotten several piercings here and every time they've been great.  This is the only place I would ever get pierced and I recommend it friends all the time.  They have a bunch of jewelry options and I love the sea salt spray that they have.  The staff is very knowledgeable and super nice.  After one of my piercings I went into a pool before I should have.  When I went back because I was having a problem with the piercing they knew exactly what was wrong and how I could treat it.
