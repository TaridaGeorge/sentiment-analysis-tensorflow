When I got to Scottsdale a couple of my art pieces needed reframing. Took them here and Michael the guy at the framing department helped pick out exactly what worked. Love that guy and love my art even more now that it looks so fab on the wall. Will do more framing with Michael at Michael's. PS no relation to the store.
