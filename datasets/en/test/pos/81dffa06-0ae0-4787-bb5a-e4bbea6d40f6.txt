Best restaurant food in Phoenix besides Wild Thaiger. Expensive, but worth every damn penny! I went for a lunch date with the love of my life on the recommendation of fellow Yelper Michael B. The taco plates were so huge, we could have ordered one to share and both left full & happy. The $11 Guacamole is killer.
