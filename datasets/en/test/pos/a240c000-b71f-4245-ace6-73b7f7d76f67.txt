Delicious! I got the tea sandwiches, strawberry mousse, and chocolate cake here. I am currently eating my way through them all and was so impressed that I decided to put up a yelp review during my lunch break!

The mousse is sweet, with a delicious layer of spongy cake underneath, and the tea sandwiches are absolutely perfect to go with a cup of green or black tea.

The packaging that my cakes came in was beautiful, and service was very Japanese (which is good!).

Next time I am in the area, I will definitely try out the other types of sandwiches.
