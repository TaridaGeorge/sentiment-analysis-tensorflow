What hasn't been said about Matt's???  It's great food and the folks that work there are as friendly as they can be.  Get there early or you'll wait.  Every time I bring the two year old with me the staff goes out their way to take care of this Daddy on a date with his daughter.  Hog and Chick is the staple and the hash brown taste like they've been cooked in a pound of butter.  Be still my beating heart... Eat any more and we'll see that.  The Missus had the pancakes and they were also great.  Fresh ingredients abound and you syrup isn't flavored corn syrup.  Real maple syrup!!!  A true Phoenix landmark and place to eat
