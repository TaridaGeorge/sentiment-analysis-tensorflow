Brisket and ribs, brisket and ribs, brisket and ribs.  Did I say brisket and ribs?

     As a certified BBQ judge, I am very picky about my BBQ.  That having been said, I have traveled 20 minutes each way many, many times to eat here.  As you might guess my favorites here are the brisket and ribs.  Both have a very nice texture with enough smoke flavor to make any BBQ fan happy.  For the sides I will normally get the mac & cheese and the sweet potato fries.  Both are real palate pleasers.
