I love the ice cream here! Course, I've never seen baby roaches, thankfully. While the place isn't spotless, it is clean. I love the decor... very charming, and the employees are always friendly. I've had shakes and sundaes here, both have been very good. Also, they sell "pup cups"...a frozen yogurt treat for your four legged kids! My dogs love these pup cups, and at $1.25....it's a great treat for them when it is so hot out! And it is a local store...so all the more reason to support it!
