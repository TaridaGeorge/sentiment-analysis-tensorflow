christmas night.....and thank goodness they were open. 
we orphans were done with holiday drinking and celebrating and not wanting to cook, we perused Yelp for thai places open on this wildly popular holiday and Thai Elephant arrived!

i ordered the Pad Se Yew with tofu. it was as expected....deeeelicious. i love the flat rice noodles and egg. they were just the right amount of texture and the tofu was very nicely cooked. the wife had one of the fish dishes at a Level 4 spiciness....hot damn! literally! my boca was en fuego! but it was delicious with the cruncy beans and mushrooms. we also had the masaman curry (also very hot but superbly rich and creamy) and a sweet potato appetizer. 41 bucks for all 4 plates. 

delicious and fast.
