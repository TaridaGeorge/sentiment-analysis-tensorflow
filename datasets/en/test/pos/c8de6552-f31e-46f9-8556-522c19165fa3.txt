Scramble is a breath of hip air in the otherwise mundane north valley.  It adds a bit of flare with it's college hip atmosphere (although at times thrown off by the families and senior citizens, but hey....they're all cool too!) into the border of Sunnyslope and Moon Valley.  The food is a wonderful fusion of classic/southwest and it is all as healthy as it can be (come on, how healthy can sausage and loads of butter be?).  If you sit out on the patio, your reward will be a beautiful of Sunnyslope with the mountain preserve as your backdrop, and a nice sunrise to lighten the whole thing up if you make it early enough.  Definitely one of the best breakfast/brunch places in the North Valley.  Hopefully this catches on..............
