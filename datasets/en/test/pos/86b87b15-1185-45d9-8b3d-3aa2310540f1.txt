I knew I had to try it when my Jimmy John's loving friend squealed with excitement, "Move over Jimmy's, Potbelly is coming to town!" So when I drove by it unexpectedly while looking for some dinner, I made a u-turn on Camelback and pulled right on in. 

I only have two things to say about my experience:

1) Great customer service. Everyone is so darn nice I'm scared they might be pod-people.

2. Delicious. 

Potbelly Sandwich shop, good food made by people who might be aliens.
