Durant's is classic Phoenix and I am a fan of classic Phoenix.

I love that it's been there forever (since 1950, to be exact). 
I love that you enter through the kitchen (if you know what's up).
I love the steaks, the martinis, the manhattan clam chowder, and the oysters.
I love the service by a waitstaff that has worked there for 20+ years - they are on top of your order, attentive not obtrusive, and very knowledgeable about the menu.
I love the old-time decor & feeling - dark wood and red banquettes.

I do not love the high prices, but I am not surprised by them. However, if you order smartly, you can easily keep your meal under $40.

Open note to Durant's management: can you please get some new booths in there??? The existing ones are old and saggy....
