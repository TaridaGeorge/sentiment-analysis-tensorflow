Amazing. This event was amazing. This was by far the most organized event I have been to in a long time. Kelly and Tracy knocked the socks off of this big time! :)

And excellent job to all the bakers that participated. Every cupcake I tried was delicious.

Thanks to everyone who worked so hard to put on a great day for some great charities.

I can't wait until next year.
