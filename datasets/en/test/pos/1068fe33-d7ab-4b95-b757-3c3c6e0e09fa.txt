The best vet clinic in the state! Dr Holmes and staff are truly amazing.
My pets always seem to get sick on the weekend and I go into panic mode.
I have pet bunnies and no emergency clinic will see them.
Dr Holmes has returned phone calls on the weekend, late at night and even met us in the clinic on a holiday! 
An amazing caring person and extremely knowledgeable doctor.
The entire staff is just great.
