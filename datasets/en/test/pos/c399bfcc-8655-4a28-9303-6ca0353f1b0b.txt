Awesome, awesome, awesome! My mom and sister and I were on vacation in Phoenix and happened upon this place. I am so glad we did.

The drinks were amazing, the lamb appetizer to die for and the trout was unlike anything I have ever tasted.

Our waiter was so attentive. I only wish I didn't live a plane ride away.
