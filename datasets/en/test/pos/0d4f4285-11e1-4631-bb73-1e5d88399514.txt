I recently spent the better part of a week at the W Hotel in Scottsdale.  Of course I picked the coldest few days seen in recent years in Phoenix!

Very happy to find that the "hotel restaurant" was Sushi Roku!  I'd been there once before in LA.

Some highlights....

-- very creative, out of the box options
-- extremely knowledgable wait team
-- impeccable service


A few of my favorites that our group enjoyed....

1.  Black Truffle Tempura Handroll 
2. Filet Mignon wrapped Asparagus
3.  The triple desert sampler (chocolate "lava" cake was awesome!"

While it wasn't cheap -- it was well worth the cost.  I knew it was pricey when I walked in, but the amazing menu, outstanding wait staff, and quality make you forget about the price!
