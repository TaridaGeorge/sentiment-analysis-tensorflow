I have been to this restaurant many, many times, esp. since I have the Passport Unlimited card, which gives me the two/one deals.  I've taken out-of-town guests there as well as I've gone with family and friends.  This place cannot be beat.  It isn't what I would consider a Mexican food restaurant, which is what I like about it.    I have never been disappointed in any of the dishes I've tried.  The wait staff is friendly and professional.  The ambience is perfect in the fact one can actually have a conversation without having to talk louder over the din of other diners.
