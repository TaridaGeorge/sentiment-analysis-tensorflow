When we arrived we were told the wait would be about 45-60 min. Rather than give you one of those flashing plastic discs they offered to text us when our table was ready. After barely getting drinks at the bar we had a table ready-which only took about 10 min! 
Our server was very friendly and made recommendations from the menu-which were great! We weren't looking for full entrees, just something lighter. So she suggested the pretzel bread fondue and something from their antipasti menu. I had only heard of the pretzel bread appetizer......now I know why the legend lives!!! It was amazing! 
She kept our water glasses full, which I always appreciate, and we had a great night.
