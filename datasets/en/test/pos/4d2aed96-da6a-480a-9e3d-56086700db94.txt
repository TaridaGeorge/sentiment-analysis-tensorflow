I really liked this place.  They are honest and kept me updated as my repair was in progress.  I brought my husband's mercedes there to fix the broken bumper.  I had taken it to three other body shops (including the dealer) and they all said that they could not repair the bumper, it had to be replaced.  Well, Andy's said they could repair it, quoted me a price much less than the cost of replacement, and got me right in.  They were very knowledgeable with the mercedes, but I saw all different makes and models there.

The manager was very friendly and helpful.  I will definitely go back in the future.
