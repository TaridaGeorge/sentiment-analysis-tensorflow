So simple... so authentic... just the type of place to make you feel like you're back in Germany --- that is, if you've ever been to Germany.  If you haven't, check this place out and you can pretty much save a trip over there.

It's hard to go wrong here.  The food is classic German --- sausages, kraut, schnitzels, etc.  Oh, and don't forget about the tall glasses of beer that you can drink in the beer garden!
