Forefathers is definitely our new regular treat. From "one nation under God" at the door, to the "Ultimate Sacrifice" wall, everything about this neighborhood spot represents the awesomeness of America. The awesomeness of opportunity, capital and making a kick ass cheesesteak thats better than any other west of the Mississippi River.
