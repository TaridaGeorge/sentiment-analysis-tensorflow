There's a reason Oregano's has an hour wait on a regular Monday night:  awesomeness.  Luckily, it's almost never as long of wait as they say, and you can always relax and enjoy a beer or cocktail while you wait.  Our last visit was a party of 4, and we only waited long enough to have a single round before being seated (which is not long!).

Oreganos is just a fantastic overall value, and I've always had great service and food.  They've done whatever it takes to achieve the magic formula of restaurant success, and maintained this over a number of years.  

Parking can be a bit interesting for this location, and if you don't want to wait I recommend arriving outside the 5 - 8pm dinner rush.  The only other advice I have is the cookie Pizza is worth saving some room for!
