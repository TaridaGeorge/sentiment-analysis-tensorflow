I've been here twice for breakfast and once to buy a pastry to go with the Starbuck's I got across the parking lot. I ordered the Big Breakfast each time, which is spectacular. Everything on the plate was fantastic. I had fried eggs once and then scrambled. Both were cooked perfectly. The mushrooms are otherworldly, and I'm not a big mushroom fan. The pastry I tried was a chocolate croissant. It was like eating butter flavored air infused with chocolate. OMFG!
