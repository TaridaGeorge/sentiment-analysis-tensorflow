The tires on my nearly new van were getting low and I had no problem taking it in here to have them checked and filled even though the tires didn't come from them.  Then, when I was getting ready to drive home to San Diego with a van full of stuff making it extra heavy, I stopped by here on the way out of town and they very nicely checked all my tires again to make sure everything was at the right pressure before the long drive, making me feel much more confident when I set out.  They fix flats for free if they're fixable even it the tires didn't come from them, too!  Great place!
