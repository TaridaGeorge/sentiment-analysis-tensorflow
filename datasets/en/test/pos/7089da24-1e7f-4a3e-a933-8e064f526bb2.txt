Yes, the coupons convinced me to give it a try too :-) The brakes were squeaking and I knew I needed new pads so I decided to give them a try. The service was prompt, courteous and they didn't try to sell me anything I didn't need. Once they had the car up on the hoist they took me in and showed me the obviously worn pads and got my approval before fixing anything. 

I opted for the Ceramic pads and I would highly recommend them. No brake dust, no squeaking, longer wear and not much more than the Asbestos pads that come with most cars. 

I take my car there for all my routine maintenance. Good service, honest and a fair price.
