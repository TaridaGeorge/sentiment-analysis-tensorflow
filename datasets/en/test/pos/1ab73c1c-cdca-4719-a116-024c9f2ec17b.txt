This place knows how to compete with the Pizza big boys.  Next best thing to Pizzeria Bianco.  Fantastic crust, homemade ingredients, just all out great!! Bruschetta is amazing also.  I do recommend lunch though.  Dinner crowds can be very busy and forget about getting a table during an event in Glendale.
