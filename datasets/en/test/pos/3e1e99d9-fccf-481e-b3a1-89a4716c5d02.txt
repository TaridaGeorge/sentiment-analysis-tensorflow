First time being on a dairy farm so I don't really have anything to compare it to but we went there for a birthday party this past weekend and it was a lot of fun!  The folks there were really friendly and I think the kids had a blast.  There were animals to pet and we all got to go on a hayride around the farm and checked out the cows.  Learned that cows have to be pregnant in order to produce milk.  *duh*
