I love Souper Salad!  It's not as awesome as some of the other salad joints, but its half the cost as many of them and it's got all the regular items I expect - two lettuces, spinach, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc. plus 3-4 soups, baked potatoes, bread sticks and more.  This location is still a favorite with the super high ceiling.  It's showing it's age (needs to be repainted) but I'm here for the food!
