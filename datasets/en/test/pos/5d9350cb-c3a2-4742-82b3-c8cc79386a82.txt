Dec 1st: Duane comes through again....  The hot water tank in one of my rentals went and I had to order a new tank at Lowe's. Duane was kind enough to pick up the tank in Gilbert and take it up to the unit in Scottsdale, install it and finish the deal. He is dependable and straight forward and I confidently refer him to my fellow Yelpers!
