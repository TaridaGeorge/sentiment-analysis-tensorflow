This is just some good home cooking, and it's in a HOME! This converted farm house is such a great place to visit with the family. Have some simple (amazing) food, sit down and relax in the park-like setting, walk around the farm a bit then top it off with a perfect coffee from "The Coffee Shop" at the end of the property. All in all it makes for a great day out.

BTW, I can't get enough of that meat sampler plate. Mmmmmmm
