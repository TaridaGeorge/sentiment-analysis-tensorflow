We've been to several froyo places around town and this is by far one of the best ones.  Lots of yogurt selections and a TON of toppings selection.  I don't ever remember paying $10 for 2 froyos before so we either got more than usual or their price is more expensive than others.  

The taste was excellent, too.  Tasted how froyo should taste like and not mushy.  As I was paying for the yogurts, I noticed Sirachi hot sauce and asked the cashier why it was there.  Apparently people like to put it in the mango yogurt.  What?!  I doubt I'll have the courage to do that.  Maybe when I get pregnant again.  Haha.

GREAT place.  You definitely won't be disappointed.
