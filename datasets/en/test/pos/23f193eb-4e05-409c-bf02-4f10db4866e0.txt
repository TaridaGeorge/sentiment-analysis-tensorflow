I love Walgreens because it is always open and almost always has what you need; maybe not everything you can think of, but everything you actually NEED.

This particular location gets a bonus star for Van Morrison's moondance playing over the PA system and for carrying a line of candy that claimed to be healthy :)  And it had the couple of sundries I actually needed to pick up, too!

Extra bonus star for a smiling and friendly cashier - not always the norm for Walgreens back home.
