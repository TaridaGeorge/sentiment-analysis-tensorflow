The Blooze Bar is a great place for music and good times! The staff is always friendly and the bands are always rockin'! I love the Blooze Bar and I highly recommend going! The bathrooms are clean and there is HOT pics on the inside of the stalls! The owner is top notch and one of the most down to earth people you could meet! The Blooze Bar is a great place to have a few drinks or stay for a live show!
