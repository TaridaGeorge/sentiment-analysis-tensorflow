This will always be my favorite Chinese Restaurant!  Hello, $5.00 lunches on Saturday's???  I AM IN!

The service, food and ambiance is always great.  The waitstaff work their tails off to get your food out to you as fast as they can.  The salad dressing is made fresh everyday and is the best dressing I think I have ever had.
