Bacon wrapped hotdog in the softest, melt in your mouth bun.  Pull a U-turn and do NOT pass this place by!   My bro-in-law whipped the fastest u-turn in a mini-van as we drove by and I was describing a Sonoran hot dog to him.   Not even kidding. 

Bring cash.  Order two. Get it with everything (unless you hate onions like me, then just go right ahead and leave those off).  Don't forget to add avocado sauce.   

Take 'em to go or enjoy them on the tables and chairs in the parking lot. 

I have taken out of town visitors, family and gone on date nights here.  You can't say it's not an authentic and memorable experience, that's for sure.    So glad Nogales Hot Dogs is just down the street from my house!
