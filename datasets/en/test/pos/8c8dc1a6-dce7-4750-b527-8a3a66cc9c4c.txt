Wow.  That's all I've got to say really.. other than GO!  

There isn't anything negative to say about both of my experiences here!  I love the pizza, love the people, the desert is to DIE for, and the service is stellar! 

I started off with Sweet Potato Fries, which sadly had some spice on them that I didn't enjoy, as quickly as they saw I wasn't eating them they removed from the bill and offered any other appetizer for me.  I decline and waited for the pizza to arrive.. 

Wait the 45 minutes, get the deep dish, and be in heaven!  I'm a classic Pep and Cheese guy, but saw a number of others with stuff in them that looked equally delish.  

Finally, do not leave without having the cookie desert, it's phenomenal!  I'd fly back to PHX just for this cookie!
