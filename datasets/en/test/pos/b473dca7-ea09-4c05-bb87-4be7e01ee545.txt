Great food, comfortable atmosphere.  Been back several times...the Vegan Nosh and veggie tacos are awesome.  Their number one dish is the Butternut Squash Enchilada...very good , but a little dry.  And, the specialty drinks are yummy--try the elderberry margherita.  The setting (at Southbridge in Old Town Scottsdale) is trendy, yet casual...the service is always fantastic.  (p.s.  The menu offers a variety of gluten free dishes).
