sayyyy waatttt?!?! five stars??? yessum boys and girls, this little joint is this shit and i am in love!

Loved everything about my experience with Genghis. Atmosphere, service, the food, prices, drinks...  you get the picture

$1 sake..And $5 sake bombers..Thank you Genghis.

To be able to create my own bowl with all the veggies, meat, seasoning and sauce i wanted it just put me on cloud nine. It's great because you go can go back time and time again and never make the same bowl twice. ( i want to go right now, who's down???)

Perfection is the formula when me and Genghis Grill combine. scrumdiddilyumptious.
