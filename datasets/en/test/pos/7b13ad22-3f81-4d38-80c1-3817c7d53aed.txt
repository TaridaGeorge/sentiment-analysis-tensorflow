Great 50's diner! We went for breakfast this morning before our roadtrip back to CA. It was packed (as expected). We were sat in 15 min. 
Service was fast, friendly and this staff WORKS! Everyone was constantly on the move. 
Food was served quickly! We ordered the Cali omelet and the French toast. Both were flavorful and completely devoured!
It's cute, kitschy, and your typical 50's diner. However their tabletop juke box selection is more extensive than I've seen anywhere else.
I'd love to come back again sometime for that middle-of-the-night belly bomb! Stay tuned...
