Love the central location in Old Town. The place is clean and quite for the most part. They have a decent book/movie selection and what they don't have, you can try to reserve it or get it from one of their other branches or from the Phoenix library or even from some of their online libraries. You can get their e-books sent to your Kindle. Parking is easy since there's a garage. In the garage are the book return bins, so that makes returning things after-hours easy as well. The staff is helpful and nice. It's a nice place to come study or just hang out and read.
