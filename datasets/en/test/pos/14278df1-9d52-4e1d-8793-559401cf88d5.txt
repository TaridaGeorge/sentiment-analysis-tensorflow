We had a great experience here. The restaurant was extremely clean, which is a major plus. The food came in big portions, but did not leave me feeling weighed down or sleepy after. Everything looked, smelled and tasted great. They presented the food very well. The service was good. We had the server come back and check on us about 3 times during the meal, which made it convenient.  The only problem i had, was eating pho on a hot day. 116 degrees!!! But i guess that was my fault. It was air conditioned and i was still sweating!
