The owners of this restaurant did such a great job! The space is very well used with an open feel. We had the burrata for an appetizer - it was delicious! The grilled cheese salad was a hit, the halibut perfectly cooked and delicious and my club sandwich was awesome! GREAT on tap and bottled beer collection as well. For Scottsdale the pricing was right too. I look forward to returning to the Praying Monk!!!
