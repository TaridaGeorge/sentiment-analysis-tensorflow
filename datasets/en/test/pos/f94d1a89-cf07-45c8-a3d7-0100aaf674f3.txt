Oh Zipps, how I love thee!
First tried a Zipps about a year ago and now whenever I'm in the Phoenix area, I seek them out. Awesome happy hour and late night specials, every game you could want (ask and they'll put on whatever you want to see), and I've never had bad service. Some even run shuttles to and from spring training games.

Back to Bethany Home. This location is supposedly the newest. We sat in the dining room and it probably had 12+ tvs.  We ordered some appetizers and they came out quickly. Decided to stay for dinner and everything was correct and tasty.  Parking was a little tough here.  And there was a patio that got a little busy once people got off work. 
I'll miss you Zipps! Til we meet again...
