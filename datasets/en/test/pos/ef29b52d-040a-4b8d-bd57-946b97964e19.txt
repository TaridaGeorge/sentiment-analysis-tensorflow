Honestly, I think the best part of Pride is the Parade, and that's not just because I'm a cheap bitch. This year, it flowed very well. And there seemed to be a much smaller group of fag-bashers this year. Humf! I packed a hammer and a staple gun for nothing, apparently.

As for the actual Festival, it was pretty solid. The musical talents were fierce. The various stages are awesome because they seem to have a flavor for most tastes. I especially liked Guyton Maurice.

Phoenix Pride keeps getting better every year. Soon, we may have an event that rivals some of the other major Prides.
