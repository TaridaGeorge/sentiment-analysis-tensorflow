This is now my favorite place to get coffee in the Phoenix area. The brew tastes great and is fairly priced. A large latte is 4 bucks. The best part about this place is the atmosphere. There are a lot of 20 somethings that regular here with their iBooks and headphones, but there are still just as many people socializing. It is crowded, but with lots of good seating. There is an area with great comfy chairs and leather couches. There are also ample tables to keep your laptop on. The walls are littered with interesting local, contemporary art. 

Half the time I'm here I take my headphones off because I enjoy the music they play so much. They even have a pitcher of free lemon ice water. :)
