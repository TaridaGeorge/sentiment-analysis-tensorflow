I LOVE Oregano's!!! We usually get the thin crust pepperoni pizza and some medium wings. Now I love spicy wings but The hot ones are wayyyyyyy too hot! Like hurt your stomach hot lol but the medium wings are so good!  Also, my favorite is the Pablo Picasso salad! Omg it is to die for! I love the light chipotle dressing! And the junior salad is huge for one person...I always share it with my mom when we go! Also, you have to try their cheezy garlic bread...pair it with marinara and you're in heaven! :]
