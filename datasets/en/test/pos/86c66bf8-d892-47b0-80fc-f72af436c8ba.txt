I was in Phoenix for a conference and there were three of us who stopped by for lunch. 

I had the open faced crab sandwich with sweet potato fries - yummy!  One of the others in my party raved about the macaroni and cheese. She said it would be a must for anyone to try. 

We did not have anything negative to say about our visit, and would recommend it to anyone.
