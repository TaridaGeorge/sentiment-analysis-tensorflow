Very cool place... great food!  Beautiful restaurant.  Great bar area.  we had very good meals....just a tip... split everything.  If you buy for yourself,  you'll never finish.   The soup is for two and the sides are for......   a small family. The entrees are Enormous.   The Drinks are the stiffest ever 3/4th's booze 1/4th mixer.  seriously they bring the glass to the table to show you that there's pretty much nothing but alcohol in your glass then throw in a splash of whatever you want.  And the glasses aren't those rinking dink rock glasses!  they are the kind of rock glass you could barely palm.  Gorgeous people everywhere.  What an awesome ambiance!!!!!!   top notch!  loved it!  It's the kind of place that can make you happy.  go with friends and party!  wait staff was the best!!
