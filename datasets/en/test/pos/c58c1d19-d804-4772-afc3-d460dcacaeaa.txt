There is not one bad thing to say about Mastro's. From the service, to the beverages, to the menu - everything is top notch and classy. They say it is an "unparalleled dining experience" and they are not lying. 

The ambiance in the place is wonderful. 

I've been there a few times and have tried a few things. I always get the Filet because it is as close to perfection as is humanly possible. The steaks come out on scorching hot 400 degree plates and are placed in front of you with sheer decadence. The mashed potatoes are incredible. The Lobster mashed are the greatest thing ever. The mac and cheese is to die for. It is the perfect blend of cheeses and creaminess. The asparagus is perfectly scorched (in a great way). You will not regret your choice.
