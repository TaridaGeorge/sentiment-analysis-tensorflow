Yummy! You have to have a serious appetite to finish a plate from here. The half omelette is bigger than any full I've seen. And someone at a table near by got the pancakes and they were huge! There was 4 of us that all ordered different things and everyone really enjoyed their meals. I ordered the Denver omelette and the ham inside was soooo good. Very juice and tender. Cute little place inside to. Diner feel for sure.
