WOW.

Wow, wow, wow. 

Not only did I have the best fish tacos here, but the service was fantastic. And for a native Seattleite to compliment a seafood dish in the southwest??? Unheard of.

It was Californian halibut, and served with goat cheese (a unique combination I never would have thought of) on the tastiest mini corn tortillas. Throw in that the fish was seared and then grilled, and the plate is served deconstructed, so you assemble each delectable bite yourself....Mmm!

Our waitress (also, impressively a Seattle native) was sociable, funny, and completely on top of things.

And the table by the window, looking out to the hotel's pool, golf course, and distant mountains was gorgeous.

I couldn't have been more happy with my lunch here.
