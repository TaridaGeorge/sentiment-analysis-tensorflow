We absolutely LOVE this pizza! The thin crust just melts in your mouth and the cheese is delish. We order the double cheese, fresh tomatoes and basil, but the white sauce with chicken and roasted red peppers is pretty awesome as well. Every time we are in Arizona we can't stay away from this place and everyone we've taken has really enjoyed it as well. I think the Scottsdale location has a much better atmosphere, but the pizza is consistently good at either location.
