Have been coming here nearly every Friday since we moved here in August.  Being from Seattle and having traveled to Japan, I'd have to say...pretty good sushi especially in the desert.  The staff is great, service is quick, and prices are reasonable.  We usually get the tempura, and I'll have 1 sushi order and I am stuffed.  They also have happy hour which is a great deal if you can get in before 6.  We subscribe to their Red Mask Rewards card and have already received our reward!
