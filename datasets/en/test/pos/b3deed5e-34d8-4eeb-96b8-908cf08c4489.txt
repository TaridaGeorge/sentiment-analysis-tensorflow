Was craving Teriyaki chicken with white meat and brown rice....for some reason that's hard to find. I was so happy to find a Samurai Sams some what by the house. Its near an industrial area so its hard to see it...use ur gps or keep your eyes open. Food was great though and fast. Not so fast though that you knew they "warmed up you chicken in the microwave" fast though. It was cooked to order. The gal at the counter was great too. Very friendly! Always a plus. So food and service are great. Ill go back!
