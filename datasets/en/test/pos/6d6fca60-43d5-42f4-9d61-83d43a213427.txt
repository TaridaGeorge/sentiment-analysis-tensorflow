I have to give them 5 stars. Even though they can be a bit over priced at times, they do have sweet deals and sales often. 

Plus, the guys that work here are super friendly and pretty knowledgeable. It is a family owned store with a good appreciation for customers & customer service. 

It is conveniently located in the Fry's shopping center too. And when it comes down to it, GNC has quality products that I trust.
