Luv, luv, luv this restaurant!  Fresh food, great atmosphere, friendly service!  Luv the choice of seating in this very clean and colorful establishment!  We visit every time we are in town, especially when they proudly display their "March Madness".  Thanks to Guy Fieri for highlighting Joe's Grill on DDD!
