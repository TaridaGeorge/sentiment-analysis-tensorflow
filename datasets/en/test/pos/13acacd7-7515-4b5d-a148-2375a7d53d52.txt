I'm a tourist in Scottsdale and I love Pinnacle Peak Patio Steakhouse.

I felt like a real cowgirl eatin' meat after a long day of doing cowgirl activities on set with the Bonanza cast. I miss Little Joe. He was a cutie.

It's still warm out so we sat in the backyard with live entertainment from a real cowboy singing cowboy tunes plus some Tom Petty and Elvis.

The food is basic but the meat is well done. I asked for a medium rare filet mignon and that's exactly what I got. Plus I got a potato, mini corn on the cob, salad, cowboy beans, and wheat bread. 

I'm still full four hours after dinner.
