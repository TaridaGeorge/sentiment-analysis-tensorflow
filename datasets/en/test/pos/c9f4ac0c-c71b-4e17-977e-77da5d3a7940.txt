All i can say is good things about The Apothecary Shop.   If you visit a Holistic Doctor, they will send you to one of these types of shops.   Yes they do take insurance, but everything is a little higher.  It is located in an area between Doctor offices. A big one is the fertility Clinic. Which sends a lot of buss. their way. Loads of parking, and it is a healthy alternative. Please give it a try.
