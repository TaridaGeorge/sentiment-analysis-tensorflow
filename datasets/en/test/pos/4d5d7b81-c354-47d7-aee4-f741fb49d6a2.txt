I got beautiful extra long stem roses from Pj's and they lasted for more than a week. I also 2 friends who have used Pj's recently and were very pleased with the flowers. They do great work.  I follow them on facebook and they post pictures of the arrangements that they do.  Beautiful artistry.  I recommend Pj's highly.
