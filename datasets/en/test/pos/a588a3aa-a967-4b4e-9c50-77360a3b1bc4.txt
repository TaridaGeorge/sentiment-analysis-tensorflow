This is the only place in town that starts making my coffee when I walk in, because they know me.

I love that.

It would be better if it were a gym knowing how I like my coffee... 

PS these doughnuts are the freshest and most yeasty flavored doughnuts you'll find on the west side.

Say hi to may for me.  :)
