Stayed at the Camelback Inn for our wedding anniversary and ate here for dinner. Had our restless toddler with us, and the service was still great.  Food was excellent, the popovers were tasty as usual. Husband said his cowboy steak tasted like a finely ground hamburger and one of the best he ever had.  Loved it here.
