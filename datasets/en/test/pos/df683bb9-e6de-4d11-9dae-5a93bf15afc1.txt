We like to go to Thai Dressing (formerly Thai Pots) for lunch. Their green, red, yellow, and Panang curry are to die for. Our favorite dish for takeout is Baking Seafood Curry. The food is very good. The service is very friendly and authentic. We love to support locally owned / run businesses. Thai Dressing is one of them!

Note: they have moved to a new location in the same plaza (2820 S Alma Sc hool Rd, next to Big 5 Sporting Goods).
