after reading the reviews this morning I decided to try her out since I am not a fan of talking on the phone (I just turned 30 today and I still don't like talking on the phone ) I decided to stop by the place and the first person to greet me was Laura ... she squeezed me right in for a brow tint and shaping and she did such a lovely job!!!! I have super light eyebrows and all the little hairs that normally go unnoticed to others (but not me!) and she got them all!! she is super sweet and I will DEFINITELY go back to her again!!!
