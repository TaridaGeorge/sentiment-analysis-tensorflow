Had a great time dining with my sweetheart @ the bar last night. We arrived at 6:30 and had several spots at the bar to choose from. The service from Josh the bartender and the rest of the staff was prompt and impeccable. My build-your-own pizza was better than anything Bianco's could imagine. The Catcher In The Rye cocktail was delicious. We occupied our spot for a good ninety minutes and never felt rushed. Thanks for a wonderful night Parlor!
