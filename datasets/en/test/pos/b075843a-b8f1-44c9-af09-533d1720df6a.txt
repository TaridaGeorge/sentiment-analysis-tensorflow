YUMMY! I think this was the best sandwich I have ever had. When I walked into the restaurant with my stroller, one of the workers asked if I would like to give them my order at the table instead of waiting in line with the baby. Score! Anyone willing to make my life easier at this point earns major kudos from me. I ordered the roast beef sandwich, chips, and a large drink. I also orders an Italian sandwich to-go for the hubster. The sandwiches were huge--all for $13. The hot peppers, which is what Potbelly is famous for, really make the sandwich heavenly! The peppers give the sandwich a little bite. SO good! Well Potbelly, you are my new go-to place, replacing your across the street neighbor in my weekly repertoire!
