This is my favorite restaurant in the Valley. Every time I go out with friends we hit Stax. The food is great, one of the bartenders is hot! Haha, and the atmosphere is great. I never see crowds when I go in, and during the afternoon after lunch, you almost always have the entire place to yourself. It's a great place whether you have two people or ten!
