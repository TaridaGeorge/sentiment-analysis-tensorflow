Insurance is a fickle thing. One likes to complain about the expense when it's basically not doing anything then complain it doesn't do enough when you actually need it. This was me, last month. But then something odd happened: My insurance started working for me. Imagine that?!?! 

While my car was being repaired, I was able to get a rental car to fill in for my vehicle. Initially, I thought the $30 daily allowance wouldn't be enough to get me into a horse and buggy, but this location really pulled out all the stops and landed me an awesome rental--a new Chrysler Sebring. With heated leather seats. And satellite radio! How I wish I didn't have to give up that car. It made the return of my vehicle bitter sweet.
