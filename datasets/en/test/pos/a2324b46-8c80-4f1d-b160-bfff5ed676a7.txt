Handmade popsicles done extraordinarily well. An amazingly cute concept...a Popsicle shop located in one of the hottest places on Earth. The staff is always warm and welcoming, and patient as you go through the menu (and learn a little Espanol in the process). 

My favorite is the mango con chile. Spicy and sweet with fresh chunks of mango. A perfect treat on a hot day. My kids love the fresca con crema (strawberries and cream) or the mexican chocolate. A new one I tried today was the lemon pie...a take on the key lime with a graham cracker crust layer...spectacular!

I read some reviews complaining about the price. We spend $4 on coffee drinks every day, so this treat seems about right in the grand scheme given the homemade natural ingredients. Bravo to this local gem!
