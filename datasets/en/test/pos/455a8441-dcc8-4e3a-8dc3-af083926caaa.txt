Greatest dive bar ever!
Their Christmas decorations rival that of Coach House but without the Scottsdale crowd.  
You can find every type of person hanging out here.  
The staff is friendly and they pour heavy (but not too heavy). 
My friend said to me a few months ago, "I found the greatest dive bar ever you have to go to called the Swizzle Inn!"  I replied, "It is the greatest!  I've been going to the Swizz for years."  Maybe I should have shared the info sooner?
