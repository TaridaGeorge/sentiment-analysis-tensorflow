Once again, Maestro's doesn't disappoint (same fantastic experience as the one in Vegas).  However, once again, I leave with the stomach gurglies because of how rich the cream is in their dishes.  I had to have the truffle gnocchi again because it's SO good.  

But, damn, it's worth it!  It has to be said that, even though I ordered the petite filet medium rare, and I ended up with one that was medium/medium well, it was still seasoned very well.   I think I just ended up with someone else's order (there were fourteen of us).

The bathroom attendant in the women's restroom is a hoot!  She's worth a visit in, and of, herself.
