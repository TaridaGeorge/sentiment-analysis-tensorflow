My favorite place in the Valley! Whether you are there to drink wine or eat dinner this is the place to go. The servers are friendly, the food is delicious and the wine divine. They change their wine menu just enough to keep it interesting but not enough to be overwhelming. The bruschetta board is amazing - order it. Their sandwiches, soups and desserts are delicious. I do not have enough good things to say about this place!

Only two negatives - parking can be difficult and overcrowding can be an issue inside. So if you go on the weekends make sure to go early or be ready to stand and drink wine while you wait :)
