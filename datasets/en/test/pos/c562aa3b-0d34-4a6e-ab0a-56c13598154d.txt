I had dinner with my wife and another couple 2 weeks ago.  It was my first time to this restaurant.  I was very impressed!  The service was excellent, they waited on us very well and the groceries they serve were outstanding!  You don't have to worry if the food is too hot or not spicy enough.  I really like spicy food, but our friends wimped out!  The dishes come family style so there is plenty to eat.  They staff brought us some different spices to try instead of cooking it into the meals and everyone was happy.  Get your friends together and check it out!
