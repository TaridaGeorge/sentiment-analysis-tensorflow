After reading some great reviews about this place I had to try this place out.  First off you are going to have to wait awhile but it is worth the wait. For appetizer we had the long cheese bread which is so good, and the pizza is out of this world, you have to go with the thin crust, did not really enjoy the chicago style, the pizza is freaking tasty.  Then we topped it off with a pizza cookie, that things is so good. If you want some really good pizza and don't mind the wait then you have to try this place!
