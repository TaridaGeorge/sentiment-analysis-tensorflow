My AC was starting to blow "not so cold" and with this summer being particularly brutal I needed a break! On the advice of a good friend I took my car to Travis at Brake Masters (I thought they only did brakes). He was over-the-top professional and courteous and I was back to ice cold air in less than an hour - the price was very fair.
