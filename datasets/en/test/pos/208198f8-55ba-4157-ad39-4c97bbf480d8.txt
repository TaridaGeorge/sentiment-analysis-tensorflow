The 5 Stars let you know where I stand. Uniquely awesome sammiches on crazy fresh Umbrian-style bread. You cannot go wrong.

So just a tip:
keep calling and checking to see if one of the following is the market sammich that day.

 - crumbled sausage and melted mozzarella

 - pulled pork

 - pulled lamb

 If it is one of the above, in that order, drop whatever you're doing and get there as fast as you can. Also, do not ignore the market focaccia. Even if it just looks like a pile of veggies on a sheet pan pizza, it is fantastic.
