I first stumbled upon this place during a First Friday excursion and went back again in the middle of the week. Both nights were completely different, but neither sucked. Just a great old tiki bar off by itself with drinks that practically cost pennies. Can anyone argue with that?

So a lady owns the joint? During First Friday, an old guy told me that he owned the Bikini Lounge after patronizing it since the early 70's. He gave me the whole history of the place and the surrounding neighborhood, and how everything changed once Interstate 10 was opened and Grand Ave. went through a long period of decline, before more recently going back on the upswing thanks to the artists moving in. But through all of the neighborhood's phases, the Bikini Lounge has stuck around as Phoenix's premiere dive. And that alone kicks ass.
