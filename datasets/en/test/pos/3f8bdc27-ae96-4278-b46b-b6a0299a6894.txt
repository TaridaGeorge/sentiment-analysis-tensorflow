Friendly employees and high quality products.  They have smaller sized samples of their products here so you don't have to fully commit to a large bag of food before finding out if your dog or cat likes it.  I picked up some Acana grain-free kibble and a sample of Nature's Instinct raw chicken, and they have a frequent buyer program where you get 1 bag of food free for every 12 (I think) that you buy.
