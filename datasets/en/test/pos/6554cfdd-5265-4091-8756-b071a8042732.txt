I have some different vehicles to be taken care of , 2 old Landcruisers - 76 and 84 and the guys were able to fix problems that other could not even diagnose.  These are real mechanics - not parts changers.  They also have of the computer wizzywhatzi (term of art) to take care of my new vehicle too.

On a side note - they also have WiFi - cool.
