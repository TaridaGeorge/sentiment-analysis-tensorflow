I have been going to this place for about 4 years every now and then since it is within short walking distance to where I work, and it is a delightful lunch place. I hardly ever get there pizza, I usually get either spaghetti and meatballs or caesar/chef salad. The salad's are delicious.. simple healthy and have lots of meat. The spaghetti is one of my favorite's! definitely get way more than you can eat more of a meal for two. I look forward to trying other things here also especially the lasagna, and all the staff are super friendly.
