My boyfriend and I have been here more than a dozen times and, I must admit, we've ever only ordered one dish: the signature Thai Basil (with either tofu or chicken). It is our favorite Thai takeout in downtown Phoenix. SO flavorful and I love the spices. I should say that I like spicy food and I still order this mild. The "medium" level of spice varies a lot--sometimes it's a good spicy and sometimes it's a mean spicy! Yes, the service in their little mom-and-pop-esque restaurant is a little slow, but they're always super nice, and that means more to me than fast but impersonal wait staff.
