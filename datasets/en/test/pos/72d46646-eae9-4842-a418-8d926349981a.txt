I've travelled out of this airport for quite a few years now, and it wasn't until a recent trip that took my through Jersey that I came to truly appreciate Sky Harbor.

Being the hub for one of the largest and fastest growing cities in the nation, I am suprised I haven't experienced more delays than I have.  The only times I have experiened a noticeable backup at security is when it is to be expected (holiday weekends and such) and even then I have been suprised a time or 2 at how efficient it was.
