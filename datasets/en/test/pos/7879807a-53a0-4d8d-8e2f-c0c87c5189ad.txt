I love this place, we have had many great dinners here over the years. I think only once was i kind of upset eating here. It had nothing to do with the food or service, it was the crowd! What do you expect though? Even a Japanese tour bus stopped by and all were very pleased with the menu and food. I am in the Bay Area and the owner always recognizes us and comes over to chat. Also I love the saltwater tanks with the exotic fish swimming around.
