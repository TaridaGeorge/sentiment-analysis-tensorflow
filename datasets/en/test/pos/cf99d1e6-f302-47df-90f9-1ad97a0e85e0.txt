I just began taking yoga classes with Gilbert Yoga and I am in love. The enviroment is soothing and relaxing, my instructor Lisette is amazing and the pricing is just right. Currently I am taking the pre-natal yoga class, but plan on continuing here once my baby is born. By far the best studio I have found in the east valley.
