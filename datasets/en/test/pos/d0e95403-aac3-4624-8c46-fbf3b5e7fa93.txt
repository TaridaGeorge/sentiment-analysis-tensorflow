I have a hard time reviewing a place that is not even a month old yet.  Definitely not enough time to get into a rhythm...  Of course there are going to be plenty of kinks to work out and after talking with one of the owners for awhile I definitely think he is up for the challenge.  
I really enjoyed my evening here and can't wait to come back to see how things are going for them.  All of the British recipes on the menu are family recipes and honestly the best Shepperd's pie I have ever had. I cannot wait to return and try the other items on the menu.
