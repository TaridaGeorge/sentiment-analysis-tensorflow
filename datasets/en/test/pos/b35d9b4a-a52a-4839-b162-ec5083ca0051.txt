Perfect for Lunch!
-completely different atmosphere than Thai Basil.
The food is consistently good and the decor reminds me of the Gourmet Ghetto Thai restaurant (Thai Rama) in Berkley CA.

I'm a tom-ka-tofu/gai connoisseur and I have to rank their Tom-Ka as one of the best. They slice the tofu very thin and it is a delight with a side of rice that turns into 2 meals. 

The pictures below don't do any justice to the presentation and this is one of the cleanest restaurants I've ever been in.

Don't waste $ at Denny's get a much healthier tour de Thai.
