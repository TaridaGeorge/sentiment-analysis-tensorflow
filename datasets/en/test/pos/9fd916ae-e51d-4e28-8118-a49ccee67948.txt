I love this salon!!  Clean, vibrant, busy and everyone is so friendly and genuine.  Laurie Roth is the BEST for awesome cuts AND color...hard to find that in just one person.  Her rates are great, and she is very knowledgable and passionate about what she does...and that's why I will be back again and again.
