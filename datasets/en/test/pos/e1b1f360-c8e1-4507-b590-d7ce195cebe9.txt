There's nothing not to L-O-V-E about this place (well, maybe the bill but that's out of the subject :)

It has been hard for me to fall in love with a restaurant here in AZ, but City Hall has never let me down.

The shrimp cocktail is awesome. The size of the shrimp is kind of scary, I wouldn't want to cross paths with them while swimming in the sea!

The shrimps are super clean, meaty, tasteful and the sauce and horse radish is awesome. Great starter.

I had the Argyle pinot noir which was pretty good.

I also ordered the bone-in filet which was delicious, tender, cooked to perfection (which is hard to find).

If I had to criticize anything, I would like to have a little more of light (just a notch).
