I debated the number of stars, back & forth... 4 or 5.  Finally, I decided on 5.  You can't beat the bang for your buck!  No frozen patties, here, just thick, juicy, hand formed patties that were soooo tasty.  I had the Fat Ass special for $7.50.  That's a double burger with cheese & bacon, all the fixins, onion ring/fries combo, and a drink.  Seriously... you can't beat it.   I only wish there was more seating to eat in.  I will definitely go back!
