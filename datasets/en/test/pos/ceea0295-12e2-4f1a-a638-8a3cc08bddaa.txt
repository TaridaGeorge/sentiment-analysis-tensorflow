This is my current first choice in eateries.  The spring rolls are made with rice paper and such an array of fresh bite sized vegetables, it melts in your mouth, and there are so many different kinds, ave price 3-4.00.  Did I say they are HUGE?  It's a weight watchers dream.  Everything on the menu that we have tried has been delicious and presented beautifully.  The sauces accompanying each dish are always intrigueing and tasty as all get out.  The best thing of all, though, is the Ginger Creme Brule.  Wow, sir.  It doesnt get better than that.  If you like Viet food, Thai food, or just plain fresh, good food, then this Vietnamese restaraunt should pique your interest.  My goal is to try everything on the menu.
