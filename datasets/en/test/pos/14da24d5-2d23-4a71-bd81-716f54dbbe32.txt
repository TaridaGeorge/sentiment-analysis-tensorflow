This is a casual wine bar with surprisingly good food.  The place is small and dimly lit -- very cozy.  The bartender/ waiter suggested a cabernet from Spain? which I thoroughly enjoyed.  I also had a chicken panini with sweet potato chips.  The food can take a while, but I realize that this is a bar, not a restaurant, so it is OK.  And the sandwich was really good!  Bottomline, Centro is a quiet/intimate place to relax and catch up with friends.
