My parents and my sister and I went to the Art Stoll last Thursday and after we had had enough of that, we needed some desert and the closest place we found was the Sugar Bowl.  We had found the place while on our way to dinner a few days before.   Anyways, the deserts we had were amazing.  I really liked the brownie ice cream, despite the fact that they had ran out of whip cream.  While there weren't a lot of dishes that didn't have some sort of nuts on it, I and my family were certainly were satisfied with the choices that we made.  Wished we could have ordered some fries afterwards though.  Definitely will go again when in town.
