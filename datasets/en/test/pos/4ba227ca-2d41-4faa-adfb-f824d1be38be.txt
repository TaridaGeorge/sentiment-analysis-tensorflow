I was craving for Pho and wanted to go somewhere else in Chandler other than Saigon Pho. (will try Cyclo and Anise soon). 
My first impression when I walked in was: clean, modern, and the staff was friendly. 
My order came quickly. The person waiting on us was prompt, friendly, accommodating, attentive....ok, cute too! The Pho was very good!

Overall, my experience was great and will be coming back whenever time permits
