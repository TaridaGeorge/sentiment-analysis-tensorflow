I can't believe I have driven past this museum a million and one times and never gone in. Just FYI its free on Sunday's in July. 

You want to get out of the heat? You want to do something inexpensive with your family? You want your children to learn something about the culture of Native Americans? This is the place for you!

I brought my son here Sunday before last and he had the best time! There is a ton of puzzles and hands on crafts. Stories and artwork to satisfy the most curious minds. The grounds and architecture are beautiful. I will definitely be back here with my son this summer! 

Good, clean, family fun!
