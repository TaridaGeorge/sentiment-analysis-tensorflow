I looked for a hairdresser when I first moved to Ahwatukee. I saw a lady in a shop and I loved her hair. I asked her who did it and she told me about Kelly. I made an appointment and have been going ever since. She is an expert artisan and listens to make sure she understands what you want. I have had many compliments on my hair since going to her. You won't be sorry!
