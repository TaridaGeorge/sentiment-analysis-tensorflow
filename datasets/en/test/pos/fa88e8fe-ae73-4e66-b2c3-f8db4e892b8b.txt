Wow, what a cool place! Retro and vintage furniture mostly, but all sorts of other stuff as well, including some clothes, paintings and various knick-knacks and collectibles. Thanks Nadia, for your excellent first review, which I happened to catch that same day, just as I was heading over to the general area, so I decided to stop by on my way home. I'm so glad I did - I found the coolest old bookshelf for only $60. I also picked up an end table for $12. Unbelievable prices! And so much cooler than that crappy generic euro-trash stuff I'd been thinking about buying from IKEA. Couldn't believe the great values. With the frequently rotating stock, Michael Todd's will definitely be a regular monthly stop for me.
