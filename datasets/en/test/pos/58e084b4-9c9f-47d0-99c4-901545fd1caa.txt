This hotel was way better in every way than expected. I stayed here 4 nights as it was very close proximity to my son's home, who I was visiting. Free breakfast, free happy hour, popcorn, and cookies, make you feel like you're getting a lot for your $!  Their hotel shuttle also will take you anywhere w/i a 3 mile radius, and also to and from the airport. Really nice touch. 
I would highly recommend this hotel for budget traveling, free perks, friendly competent staff, and clean spacious rooms. 
Way to go HIE!!
