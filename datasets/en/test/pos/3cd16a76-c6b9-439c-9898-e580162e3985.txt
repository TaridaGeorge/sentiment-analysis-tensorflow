100% love this place. I've been three times, all when passing through Phoenix, and I will be surely sorry if this place ever changes. I appreciate their choice to use fresh, wholesome ingredients, and their food is delicious. Amazing hash browns, fresh juice, homemade preserves, great bread! Everything is tops. The only bummer is that it's always packed, but I don't hold that against them.
