Dragon Palace has become our go-to place when the family is itching for some Americanized Chinese food.  

Like other Yelpers have noted, it's tucked away in a very diverse strip mall.  Yes, it's slightly ghetto, but I live down the street so I'm not scurred.

The servers are *very* attentive, almost aggressively so (not necessarily in a bad way).  They get the food to the table quickly, and I've never had anything that wasn't good.  The banana/honey wontons are amazing!  

A bonus is that my picky eater always finds something that she likes here and she finds herself trying things she wouldn't normally try.
