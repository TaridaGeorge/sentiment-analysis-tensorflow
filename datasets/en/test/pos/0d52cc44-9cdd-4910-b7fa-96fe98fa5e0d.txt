This arena ROCKS and so does Ice Hockey...I only wish the arena would have been built more central to everyone in the valley...I fear many lazy people will never take the drive to Glendale to support this team sport...and it is to their detriment, as Ice Hockey is one of the most fun spectator sports there is.  The name of the arena lacks imagination to be sure, but the sport has much to offer.  I hope Phoenix will get behind hockey and keep it in the valley.
