I LOVE this place I go every Wed night because they are open from 4 ish til prob 7 or 8 pm anyway I am really liking the food from One Windmill Farm lately and also Double Check Ranch. It is sooo satisfying to support these local farmers, get fresh food, be healthy and yea just amazing! Everyone is so friendly and you will learn a lot about how the food is made and interesting stories about the farmers... oh be aware they are out to make a buck so if you bend to peer pressure easily you will end up with ten tons of food going home! ;)
