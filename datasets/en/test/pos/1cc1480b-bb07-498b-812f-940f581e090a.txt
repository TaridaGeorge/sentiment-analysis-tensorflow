WOW!!!! As you can see i wrote a review here before and i gave it three stars and said the customer service was horrible. Let me tell you i had to pinch myself!!!!! I came here to try this place again and the young lady actually said hello!!! The atmosphere was calmed down a bit. When i used to come here the employees usually didn't give me time to order so i had to blurt out whatever came to mind. This time i and them took time. And also i asked them about the volcano slush and they said whats in there.So i got my drink and it was DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!! ill say keep it up Boba Tea House and i WILL be back for more!
