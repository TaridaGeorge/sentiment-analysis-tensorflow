This place is located within Walmart's parking lot. It opened up last week, about a year after Panda Buffet open and closed its doors within months.

They have a lot of great items to choose from and everything is very good. I have to say this is one of the best Chinese buffets I have tried at this price! I have been here with several different people and each one of them raved about how much they liked this place. 

The price for lunch is $7.99. It's a great price especially considering the selection! It's a big place with a nice clean and relaxing atmosphere.
