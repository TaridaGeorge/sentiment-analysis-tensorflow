Thai Elephant is my favorite place to get thai in Tempe. Expect your standard thai classics with a few twists here and there. There's also a full bar with signature cocktails, try to pomegranate martini, its amazing! I usually go with Elephant Broccoli, which can be prepared with chicken, beef or tofu. Spring rolls and tempura vegetables are awesome as well. 

Service has never been a problem for me, and we usually go during dinner time. Servers are always precise and prompt. Prices are fair and the quality is excellent. Desserts are tasty, try the coconut ice cream is there's any left.
