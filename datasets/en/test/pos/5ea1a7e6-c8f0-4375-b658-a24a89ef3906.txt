I try and make a stop into Just Relax every time I'm in Scottsdale.  I stay right down the street and its very convenient.  I stopped in twice over this last trip and was very pleased with the service.  $25 for a 45 minute foot massage is unheard of and I highly recommend Annie.  Don't forget to tip!  They work hard!  Enjoy!
