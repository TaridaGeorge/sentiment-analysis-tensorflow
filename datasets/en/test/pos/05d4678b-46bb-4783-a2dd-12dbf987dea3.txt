This place is one of my favorites it is so good! I would love to drink boba tea every day if I could. There is only one location I know about  and it is kind of far from me but I am glad they are still in business every time I go they seem busy.
I love the taro-almond milk slush. The big black tapioca balls are the best but so is the royal milk slush and the lychee. It's hard to choose my favorite since everything they have is so good. It's so nice that they seal it up for you too so you can take some home and refrigerate a drink for later.  
The people working here are always nice and helpful. I would recommend this place to anyone. :)
