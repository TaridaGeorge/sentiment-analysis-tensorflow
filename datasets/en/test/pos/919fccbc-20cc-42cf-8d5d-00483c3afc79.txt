Love love love Tryst.  I've been there about 6 or 7 times now and I'm never disappointed.  The food is good - always.  And it's consistent.  The service is nothing special, but it's always efficient (which is what I need at lunchtime).  They are now open for dinner as well.  I recommend the sweet potato tater tots - great to share as a side dish!  Also, the Kahlua pork sandwich is spectacular.  I'm sure it's on the more fattening side for lunch - but worth the calories and just hit the gym that night.  Their salads are also top-notch!  They have a nice outdoor space, so you can also get some fresh air at lunchtime.
