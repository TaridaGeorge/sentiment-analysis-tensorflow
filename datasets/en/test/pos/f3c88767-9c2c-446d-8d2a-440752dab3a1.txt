I love the decor....clean, modern with a creative flair. The service was fantastic....informative, friendly and not in-your-face. The food was AWESOME! The best crab cake I've ever had! I've had better ceviche, but that's ok. The burger was nice and juicy, tender on a brioche bun. The small plate of bread with the white bean puree was full of flavor as well. We will definitely go back! Need to try the desserts!!
