Definitely pricey, but everything we had was well prepared and very tasty. It is in a strip mall that locals would probably pass by for this caliber of restaurant, but don't be a geographic snob, Razz's is wonderful. I have to specially compliment the service - Paul our waiter managed to be on top of every need while being unobtrusive - a service level I usually only see at Ocean Club or with a waiter in a tuxedo. I read the other reviews and would disagree that the service was bad (which can fluctuate on any night) but the kitchen odors were periodically stronger than should be expected... they need a new vent fan! The baked cheese appetizer was divine and highly recommended. We would definitely go again, and as local restaurant snobs, that's saying a lot - the competition is fierce!
