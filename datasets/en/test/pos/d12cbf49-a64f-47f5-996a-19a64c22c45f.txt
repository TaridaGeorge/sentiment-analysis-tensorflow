Excellent selection of Belgian biers, one of the best I have run across.  It even beats John's grocery in Iowa City, Iowa which is tough to do.  

The store is a bit cramped and crowded, but that is part of its charm rather than an impediment.  Excellent selection of micro beers from around the country and I have always found everything to be fresh and tasty.  Definitely a great beer store, especdially for Arizona.  Knowledgeable store help who are friendly and beer advocates is a welcome change.
