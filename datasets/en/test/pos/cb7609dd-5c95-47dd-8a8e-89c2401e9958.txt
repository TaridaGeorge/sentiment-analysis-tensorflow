I can't believe I forgot to review Kai! We had our anniversary dinner here and it was lovely. I won't repeat what everyone said, food was delicious, service excellent. 
My only negatives don't affect my rating: First, we were sitting next to a group of elderly diners that were rather loud and discussing the surgeries of their friends. Not something we were interested in hearing while dining. I was glad they left before us. Second, while the plates were beautiful I'm not a huge fan of "deconstructed" food presentation. 

Expensive, but worth every penny.
