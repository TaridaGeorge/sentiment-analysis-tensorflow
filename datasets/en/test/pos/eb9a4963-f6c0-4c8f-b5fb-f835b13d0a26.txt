I really loved going to HAUS when it was in Biltmore but now that it is in the Camelback/Central plaza, it is way more convenient for me to go and look at stuff that I can't afford.  

I love their baby section.  If we ever decided to have a kid, we would totally register for everything they have here.  Just an amazing selection of stuff.

Their kitchen items are all really cool but so pricey.  $40 for a single ice cream dish?  Wow!  Not today.

This place is a really good place to find gifts for people.  Not everything is expensive but most of the furniture is and it is too bad because I really want all of it.
