I LOVE THIS PLACE!

OK so you want to know why?

The staff is wonderful and they are as friendly as it gets. 
The sushi chef is a wizard and everything he makes will melt in your mouth. 
everything is so fresh and carefully made . They could use some help on the lack of decor but when the food is this good its obvious where the money goes. personally i love their small salad its $1.00 and the best dollar spent i say, this ginger dressing is home made everyday and sold for $3.00 . This place is a mom and pop gem. i suggest this place to any sushi lover.
