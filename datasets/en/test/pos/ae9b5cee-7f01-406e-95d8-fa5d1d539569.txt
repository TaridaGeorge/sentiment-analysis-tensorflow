This place is so stinking cute, you should definitely pop by. I was lured in by the smell when I was in the area on a Saturday morning and was greeted by the owner and her lovely daughter. This family is so sweet and they let me sample a few flavors. I've been to other gourmet popcorn shops in NYC but this was the first I've seen in AZ. 

They had tons of crazy flavors like Strawberry and Blueberry Mojito. I ended up buying two medium-size bags of Caramel and Garlic Parmesan, under $10 total! Definitely recommend.
