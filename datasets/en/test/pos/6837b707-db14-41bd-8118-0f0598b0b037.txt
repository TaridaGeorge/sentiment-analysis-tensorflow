Just an update, my wife has also started really enjoying this place.

The shocker to this is that she is a vegetarian. She loves some of the side items (Waffle Fries, Mac & Cheese, Corn Bread, etc.)

She will meet me here for lunch on occasion. I convinced her to try a tiny bit of the pulled pork, and surprisingly she said the flavor was very good.
