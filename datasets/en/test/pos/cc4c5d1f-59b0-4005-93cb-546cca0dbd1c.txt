A friend of mine -- a good friend, obviously -- brought over a box of Honey Moon Sweets petit fours, eclairs, mini-tarts, etc. and an apple streudel to a get-together a couple of nights ago at my house. 

I hadn't had anything from them in a while, and the goodies were even better than I remembered. Not too sweet, but you definitely knew they were sinful. And they're colorful and beautifully made; very artistic.

I had a ton of food and threw quite a bit out, but there was not one Honey Moon Sweet left at the end of the night. This place is a real gem. It's the perfect place for those extra-special sweets.
