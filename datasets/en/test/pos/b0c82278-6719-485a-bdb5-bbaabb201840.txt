Sweet baby Jesus/Krisha/Buddha, whoever! I love this place. Their approach is modern,  but the flavors are classic. I don't know how to express this, but their food tastes...clean: Fresh, bright, quality ingredients. They take pride in what they do here.

I eat so much from Thai Spices, that it hurts...seriously. But I can't stop eating.

Anything is good on the menu: Really
Mango Sticky Rice - A+++ (Creamy, sweet but not too sweet, with tangy mango)
Lemon Fish - A (Light bright and flavorful)
Pad Thai (Best I have ever had was here)

I am going to stop writing since I am slowly entering a food coma.

OH and remember, when ordering Medium is Thai Medium!
