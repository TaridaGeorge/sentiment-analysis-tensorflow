After going to a different urgent care and actually getting worse, a friend recommended this one, which is practically next door to me, so score one for location.

Staff is super friendly and professional and there wasn't a long wait at all.

The Doctor was awesome, really spent some time getting to hear what was really going on, making the diagnosis and getting me the treatments I needed.  

While I hope I don't need them often, this will now be the ONLY urgent care I go to.
