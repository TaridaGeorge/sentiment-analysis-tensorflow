Every single time I go to this place, I walk out of that beautifully transformed post office and just think, "wow, that was perfect." 

I have continued to bring friends and family there and Postino always exceeds the "talking up," I do beforehand. With a knowledgeable staff, great food and comfortable ambiance, Postinos hits it out of the park for being one of my all-time favorite restaurants. 

Great Job!
