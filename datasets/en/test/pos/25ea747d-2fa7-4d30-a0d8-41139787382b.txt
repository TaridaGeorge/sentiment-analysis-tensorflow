One of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale. Ambiance is amazing, food is consistent and wonderful and service is stellar.  Perfect for all types of events.  Corporate dinners and wedding rehearsals.  Love their Seabass and the Ahi Poke is  perfect.  Desert Selection is amazing.  My personal favorite is the Butterscotch pudding made with Dewars Scotch!!  Key Lime Pie is great as well.
