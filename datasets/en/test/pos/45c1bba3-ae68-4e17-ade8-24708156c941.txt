I have been to this Arcadia location a handful of times. Each time I got the same thing because on Monday, and, I believe Tuesday nights, they feature what is probably the best deal in the world. For $20 you get a BOTTLE of wine, your choice, from a long list, and a large plank of four different sets of specialty bruschetta. The ambiance is upwardly-lounge-casual; perfect for both a date night or meeting friends after work.
