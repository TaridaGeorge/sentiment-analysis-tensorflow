My family has been going to Jana's (the Phx location) for years, so I decided to stop in today. 

First of all, please know that Jana's is a European deli and bakery. They have absolutely wonderful and traditionally made favorites. Their Polish sausage is absolutely WONDERFUL! My favorite pastry is the Kolaczkis. They are perfectly flakey and moist at the same time. Their food brings back wonderful memories of my Polish grandmother! 

Thank you Jana's!
