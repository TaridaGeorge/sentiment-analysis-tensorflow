This always has and always will be my favorite bar and it is also a wonderful restaurant.  I'm not a bar person - especially not these days, but Casey's holds a special place in my heart.  I think that it has to do with the outdoor patio.  I love the space.  I like the trees and shrubbery.  It feels quite homey.  I've ordered many salads, sandwiches and burgers - and have always found the food surprisingly good.  From appearance, it doesn't look like that kind of place can put out such good food - but they do!  I suggest a late afternoon stop by for early dinner and beer.  

Great place!!!
