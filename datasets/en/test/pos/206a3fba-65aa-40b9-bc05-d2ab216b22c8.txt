I cannot write enough praise for FireSky's services.  The resort and its staff provided for the best wedding I could have imagined.  The setting is beautiful, something easy to see, but it was the personal and special touches from each and every staff member that really made the weekend.  They brought us champagne, our hors d'oeuvres, and any drink order during picture time after the ceremony.  They (on their own) reserved a special bottle of scotch for my husband during the reception.  They ensured everything ran smoothly and according to what we wanted at every turn -- but not in a way annoying at all.  

Everyone I meet since the wedding has complimented the location, the staff, and, most of all, the FOOD.  Cannot recommend highly enough for an ideal wedding location.
