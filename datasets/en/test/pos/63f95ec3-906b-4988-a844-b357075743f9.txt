My dog has had chronic ear infections for over 10 years which is very common for her breed (Cocker Spaniel mix).  Despite trying many different oral and topical medications, I was unable to find a vet that was able to cure her until I met Dr. Dawson.

Dr. Dawson put her on several medications and also put her on a hyper-allergenic dog food to test her for allergies.  Within 2 weeks, my dog was cured!  She has more energy than she has in years and no longer scratches her ears constantly.  It's as though I have a new dog.  

I couldn't be happier to have found Dr. Dawson!
