Seriously love this place and it's dangerously close to my apartment.  Nice, bright space usually packed with high school kids and twenty somethings. They have an ample selection of tempting flavors and toppings.  

Beware: there are carob chips and chocolate chips, spoons are labeled. I made the fatal mistake of mixing these up last week.  I'm currently in full swoon for Georgia Peach, Lotta-Chocolate and Blueberry.
