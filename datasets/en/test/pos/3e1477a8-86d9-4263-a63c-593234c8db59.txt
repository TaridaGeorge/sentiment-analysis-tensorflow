I started going here due to a friends recomendation 4 years ago and quickly brought my wife and kids. They are simply the best dentist office I have ever had. They are always great with the kids and very friendly. There's a TV at the right height for you to watch while your getting a cleaning. Every person that works there is genuinly friendly and fun to chat with. I highly recommend them.
