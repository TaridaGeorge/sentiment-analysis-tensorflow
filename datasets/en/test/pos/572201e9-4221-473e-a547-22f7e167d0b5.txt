I went for dinner on Friday night and remembered how much I love this place. The staff recognizes us and is really friendly and accommodating. The inside has been cleaned up a lot recently even though the shopping plaza itself is a little run down.

My faves are the spring rolls and bun. I tried the family style lemon grass chicken this time and it was fantastic! Just spicy enough to give it a nice flavor, but not so much that you burn your tastebuds off.
