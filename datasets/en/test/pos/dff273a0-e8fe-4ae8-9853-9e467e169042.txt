Really.... I want to write a review, but Lauren V said all I wanted to say.

I loved the light and mirror effect room.  I wasn't sure I would call it art, but it was cool as all cool.

The charred wood installation piece is fantastic to stare at...velvet rope and all.  I can't say I blamed the kid, I would have loved to run through it myself.

They seem to get some of the greatest traveling shows -- the Secrets of the Forbidden Palace, the Rembrandts, there was an impressionist one, Ansel Adams,Curves, the evening dresses, the Himilayan Art, Degas....

It's large enough that you can spend hours there, but broken up into sections so you don't feel you have to do it all.

I hear they show movies there too!

Tuesday afternoon/evening = free!
