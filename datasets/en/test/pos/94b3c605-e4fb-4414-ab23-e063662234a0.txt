Finally went to Golden Spoon last night... it lived up to the hype! 

The flavors I got were cake batter and strawberry (yes, they let you do a two flavors, for no additional cost!) and they were delish! I ordered the small size, and was unable to finish it - so you really do get a lot for your money.

The service was great, and they let us sample as many different flavors as we liked, and even gave some great suggestions of combos. We'll definitely be going back :)
