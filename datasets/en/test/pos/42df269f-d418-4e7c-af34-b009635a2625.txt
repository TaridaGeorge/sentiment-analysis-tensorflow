Love this place. Food and drinks always delicious. I live closer to the Uptown but like this one better. Awesome atmosphere- perfect for a date, girls happy hour, or meetings with clients. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants. 

The patio is awesome and super relaxing.

Always good looking people at both locations!
