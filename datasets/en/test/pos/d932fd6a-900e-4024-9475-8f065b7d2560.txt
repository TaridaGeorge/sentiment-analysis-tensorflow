My daughter and I go here every Thursday. We always have the Cheese and Chocolate dinner. The price is very reasonable and the waiters, especially, Izzy, are great! They prepare the fondue right at your table and they will replenish the dipping items as often as you like. Try the cheddar, garlic, and beer sauce for the cheese portion and the half milk, half dark chocolate for the dessert part. Best dinner in town.
