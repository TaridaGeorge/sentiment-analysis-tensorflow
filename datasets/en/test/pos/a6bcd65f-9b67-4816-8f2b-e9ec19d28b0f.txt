I had the opportunity to personally train with Shauna and she's truly amazing. She listens and is very helpful in making a customized work-out plan based on your goals and needs, which is amazing for an out of shape guy like me. What I truly like is she is not intimidating and she challenges you to be your best. I love her upbeat attitude and her passion for fitness and health is inspiring. 

I wish she was still here in California! California's loss is Arizona's gain!
