While most Targets are EVIL (in a good way, for having all kinds of cool stuff), this store takes the cake and is SUPER EVIL! I love it. I think the grocery and extra space has something to do with it.  

Typically I am an average and reasonable Target spender (think I will spend $50, but spend $75 without really knowing how I did that).

The grocery area is Ok, but is lacking in choices -- high on the store brand-Archer Farms label, but low on healthy low-fat and premium name-brand items.  The rest of the store is high on other items -- featuring a number of clothing and housewares that wouldn't be featured at regular Target stores.  It's clean for now and like every other large store in the world, features a Starbucks, but will probably be trashed next year...lol.
