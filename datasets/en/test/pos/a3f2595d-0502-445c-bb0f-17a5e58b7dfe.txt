Great little place, very nice folks.  Fresh bagels every morning from her cousin's bakery.  I love my scrambled egg & feta with lettuce, tomato and diced pepperoncini on toasted everything bagel with my iced coffee (ok, actually I never make it out of there without having a 2nd iced coffee).

5 stars for being within walking distance of my house at Dynamite & Alma School.  My morning ritual has become walk 2 miles there, breakfast then walk home in time for work.  Wished it opened a bit earlier than 7AM.
