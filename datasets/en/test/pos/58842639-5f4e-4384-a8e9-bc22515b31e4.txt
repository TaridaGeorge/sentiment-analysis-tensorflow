Great beer selection. Love the Orange Blossom! After one or two of the deliciousness of the Orange Blossom, I'll get bold enough to venture to a Guinness or other darker beer, lol. 

I've always sat at the bar so can't confirm or deny service issues at the tables. Ne er had an issue at the bar though. 

Love stopping by for one or two and then filling up my half-gallon to take home! :)
