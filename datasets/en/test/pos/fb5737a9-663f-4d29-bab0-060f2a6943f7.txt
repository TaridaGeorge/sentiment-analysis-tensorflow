An absolutely wonderful establishment! 

It's the perfect place for all types! 

If you like to sit at the bar, the bartenders are knowledgeable and friendly. They offer a full menu at the bar as well. The happy hour is arguably the best in town. 

If you prefer to sit at a table you will be graced with an attentive server with an exceptional knowledge about the cuisine, cocktails, wine list and much more. 

I suggest Citizen for small or large parties. If you call ahead and need special arrangements they are always accommodating. 

Personally I love sitting at the bar, grabbing a Bijou from Thomas and enjoying some of Bernie's Mac'n'Cheese. 

But in a larger crowd, Gary is always wonderful at coursing our dinner and making sure the group has enough to eat and he always sneaks in a few laughs. 

Overall I love CPH! And you should too!!!
