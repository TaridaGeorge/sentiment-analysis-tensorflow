Dude. King size beds, full-blown kitchen, two TVs, more couches than I know what to do with, FREE HAPPY HOUR Monday through Thursday, FREE BREAKFAST every morning, central pool and hot tub, free wi-fi...need I say more? 

Of course, I bill my stays completely to my company. It's pretty pricey if you don't book way ahead of time, I'm sure (my corporate travel lists it at $160/night), but if you find a sweet deal or can mooch off that corporate card, BY ALL MEANS DO IT!!!
