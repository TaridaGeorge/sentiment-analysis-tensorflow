Solid experience from a typical brewery. I have been to BJ's several times now, usually after eating somewhere else in the Desert Ridge area. The typical visit usually includes drinking their blonde concoction, and watching sportscenter. The food i have eaten there was really good, including a chicken pasta meal that is one of the best i have ever had. Its 3/4 restaurant, 1/4 bar with tall ceilings and no smoking. Other than good food and drink there is not much else that separates BJs from other breweries, but thats ok. You will find a mix of adults and families before 10, with mostly adults in the bar after 10. Not much on the singles scene, so bring a crew with you!
