I stopped by Wednesday to see the new restaurant that was opening soon officially this Friday. OH-SO nice. The tables were spaced nicely and the bar is cozy. The great staff made sure I was well taken care of. I loved the menu selections. I shared an appetizer of gnocchi and anti-pasta, mmm. When I saw the shrimp risotto on the menu, I knew that would be my entree. So delicious and filling and yes left overs to savor the next day. They also have a great wine selection. Try the heavyweight red blend and discover a lost friend. It is my new GO-TO spot. See you there.
