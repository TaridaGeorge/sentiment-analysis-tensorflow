Small but clean little shop. The entire staff is super nice and friendly. The nail technician I got was a little hard to understand but I didn't mind because she did exactly what I asked for and my mani and pedi both came out great.

Not a huge selection of nail polishes but they have a good selection of colors that I'd actually choose to have painted on me. Pricing is great. It was $30 for a mani and pedi. I got charged $5 extra for french tips which is pretty standard everywhere.

I definitely will be back.
