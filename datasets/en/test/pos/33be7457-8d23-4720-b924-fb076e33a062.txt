I had an amazing facial here! 
The space is clean, inviting and relaxing. Park in the lot south of the building, it is less crowded. 
After an hour of pampering my skin was glowing! 
They offer many of different services including laser treatments. I will be back for some more aggressive treatments to fix up my flaws (not that I have any)! 
Anyway, the staff is very professional. 
Before or after your treatment go next door for some great Thai food!
