Cheap, extensive variety in produce! This is bigger and better than Ranch 99 as it even has imports from Latin America and other Asian countries! 

We bought a bunch of new stuff to try, as I sipped some yummy boba tea! We're going to come here more often as it is a boon for vegetarians with delicious fake meats, and fresh tofu!
