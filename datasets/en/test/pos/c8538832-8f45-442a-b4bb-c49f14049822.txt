I have been going here as long as I can remember all the way back when I was in high school and the place has not changed. The pizza is the best in Glendale! Although I have not had anything else from here it is still the best place to gran a bite to eat. They serve pizza by the slice or a whole pie if you want the portions are big not like some other pizza places kids will have to cut 1 slice in half just to be able to pick it up, the price is comparable to the hut about 19$ for a large, but I mean large!!
