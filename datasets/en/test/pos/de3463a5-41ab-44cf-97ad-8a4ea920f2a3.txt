This place is just amazing.  The owners know their stuff and provide such a personal touch to your drink.  The beans are roasted and bagged there.  You can literally buy a bag of beans that was roasted that day.  This was such a perfect addition to the Queen Creek Olive Mill experience.  I can only think of one other coffee place in Arizona that can compete with their espresso drinks.
