Great little Chinese place. Staff is great and so is the food. The prices are comparable to panda express, but your getting a much better quality of food. You can see them chopping vegetables in the kitchen, which is always a good sign. I ordered, went to the bathroom, and when i came out the food was ready. This place is pretty legit, its a nice find
