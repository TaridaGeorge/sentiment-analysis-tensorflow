The pizzas here are excellent. It's REAL pizza and what you should expect a pizza to taste like. I hosted my fiance's birthday here last year and we all had a good time. Love the outdoor seating and the decor. One complaint is that a homeless person wandered into the outdoor seating area and the waitstaff let her hang around for an HOUR! They gave her water and she sat down by the fire and they never asked her to leave. It was really awkward and uncomfortable and the guests at the birthday party were weirded out, as was I. Still giving Cibo 5 stars because the food was impeccable nonetheless.
