Good stuff.  Stopped in for lunch yesterday, and picked up a roast beef sub and a turkey sub.  Both delicious.  Just what I was hoping for...authentic Chicago-Italian taste and presentation.

 Also picked up a couple cans of ground tomatoes and a jar of hot giardiniera.  Always good to have the former on hand, and the latter...yeah, I love being able to add that to my sandos at home.

Marinara looked good, salads behind the counter were beautiful. Dry goods/foodstuffs were exactly what I was hoping for...pasta, sardines, clams, EVOO, etc.  Was stoked to see that they stock '00' flour.

A deli that's done right.  Will be hitting this on a regular basis.
