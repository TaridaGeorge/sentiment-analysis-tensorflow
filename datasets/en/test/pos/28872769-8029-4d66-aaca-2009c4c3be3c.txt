Even though it has been a couple of months since I first visited Sierra Bonita- my meal is still fresh on my mind, I cannot wait to go back!

I started my meal with the green corn tamale-amazing! Seriously, I could of eaten 5 of these. The sauce made the whole experience. I followed it up with the Atole Pinon Hotcakes and was not disappointed.  The hotcake was lighter than I thought it would be but full of flavor. The husband the swordfish which was a catch of the day special. 

Our service was prompt and the atmosphere allowed us to occupy a table for an extended period of time and catch up with friends in between bites.
