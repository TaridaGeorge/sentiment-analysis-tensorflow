Yup it's confirmed... Rigatony's is definitely a 5!  We had the sweetest waitress Nancy.  This time we went for the Chicken Florentine, Eggplant Parmigiana & the Carb Smart Chicken Linguine.  Everything was delicious!  Just found out they have a punch card so I will definitely be making some use of that!
