We have been a few times and this tucked away little treasure never disappoints.

Great service, very attentive to our requests (close the door, dim the lights, etc).

Joe the owner monitors everything very closely....food, staff, customers dinning experience.  He also come at the end to allow you a chance at winning a free meal.

Alcohol is a bit pricey with $15 for a martini and $8 for a shot of Baileys.  Food and service....atmosphere are a definate 5 stars.

If your looking for a local spot for great Italian....this is it.  Reminds me of NY.
