I don't think there's a better seafood or steak place in the city. 

If you're undecided on what to try, consider... 
Any size fillet, oscar style 
Chilean sea bass 
Salt and pepper tuna 
Diver scallops 

Pair anything with the mac and cheese or mushrooms.  Sides are meant to be shared 

Start with tuna tartar or fondue, and end with the peanut butter pie 

OP's wine list is very nice, but I think everyone should try a pinefin on the rocks at some point.
