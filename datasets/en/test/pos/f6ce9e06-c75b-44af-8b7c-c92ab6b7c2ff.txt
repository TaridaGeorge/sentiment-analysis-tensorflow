Went in for a straight razor shave, best of the best.  Not even a nick, smooth as a baby's butt!
I will definitely return here for another shave!

Must mention, after calling several other "Barber" shops in the EV, this is the only one that still offers straight razor shaves.

The shop is inside Chandler Fashion Square, upstairs next to Sears.
