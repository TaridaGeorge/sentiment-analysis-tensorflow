I went there last Wednesday as part of a corporate event, and I loved it!

The food, service, views, and ambience was impeccable.  Starting with the views first, we sat inside the restaurant right by the fireplace/window that separated us from the expansive patio that overlooks the city.  I can't think of a more romantic setting.

The food really impressed me.  I had the dry aged filet mignon.  The filet was amazing -- great texture, tender, and savory.  And the mustard sauce that accompanied it made a delicious piece of meat even more amazing!  I also had the lobster bisque and the rainbow tomato salad with mozarella.

All-in-all, I'm a big fan, and I highly recommend it to anyone.
