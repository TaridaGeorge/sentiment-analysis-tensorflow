I went to roaring fork for a Sunday night happy hour with my husband and had a great time.  I had a glass of wine $5 and my husband had a mojito $5.  We spilt the happy hour cheese burger and guacamole, both were yummy, but we regretted not ordering the happy hour rotisserie chicken. It looked delicious and was a nice sized portion! I'm definitely going to go back and give it a try.  You have to sit at the bar to get the happy hour prices, but the ambiance there is just as nice as sitting in the main portion of the restaurant and the service was still very attentive.
