The pizza, to die for! The sauce is perfectly spiced, the crust, especially when they throw a slice in the oven for you to re heat quickly, crisp and yummy.. This is my idea of pizza heaven. They place is a little shabby, and the people running the joint a little aloof and kinda like they are from another planet, but the pizza is really good. If you are ordering for carry out, call a bit more ahead than you want, I have never not had to wait while picking up the pizza..I am not a fan of the steak sandwich, skip that one. Go for the pizza!
