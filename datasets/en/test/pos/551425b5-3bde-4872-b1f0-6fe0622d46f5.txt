This place gets 5 stars for their bacon cheeseburgers. My fellow office mates and I try to come here for lunch once a week. They grill your hamburger to your liking and also add a special seasoning that is totally delish.I choose the pepperjack cheese to add a little kick to it. When they serve my burger to me I can't get to the condiment station fast enough. I pile on the jalapenos, pickles, lettuce, and tomato. I usually can only eat half a burger....but I can't stop eating this one. It is sooo dang good!
