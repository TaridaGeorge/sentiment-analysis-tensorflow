My dog seems to always like going here to be groomed, which is as good a compliment as I can give.  The owners are always very friendly and Bailey looks like a show dog when they get through. It's a bit of a drive for me now, but I would't consider taking him anywhere else at this point. I have never had to board him I have only had the grooming services, but if I had to leave him to be boarded I would.
