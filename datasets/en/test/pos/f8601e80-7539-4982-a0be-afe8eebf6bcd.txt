I have been going to Grassroots Kitchen & Tap since before they officially opened: my wife and I wandered in during their soft opening. The staff is attentive and extremely friendly, and the owner remembers our names and details about us ( we only go in maybe once every month of so). My favorite item on the menu is the Pork Chop. Rarely do you run into a restaurant who doesn't overcook the pork chop. I found their thick cut pork chop to be extremely juicy and have a very nice smoky flavor. I have tried the majority of items on their menu and have found them to all be extremely flavorful and worth the money. I have yet to be disappointed by any visit.
