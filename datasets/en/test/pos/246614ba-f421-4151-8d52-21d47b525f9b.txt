I came here on a whim, ha, but seriously, I was on my way to another nail spot that I actually dreaded going to, and I was happily surprised to come upon Whimsical Nails. They were not busy and took me right away. The best part was they were clean and the nail polish was in great shape (not a huge selection, but appealing). They were also very friendly!
