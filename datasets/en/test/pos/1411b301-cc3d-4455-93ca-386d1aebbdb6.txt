I feel very lucky to have found Liz from EK Tax and Accounting.  I have fought for 5 years to find a good CPA and finally I have found her.  She is everything I could hope for in a CPA.  She does very thorough tax planning which has saved me TONS of money already this year.  She is very timely with responding to requests.  She looks out for the interests of the business.  I feel confident that I am getting the best tax advise that I can get.  I can't say enough wonderful things about her.
