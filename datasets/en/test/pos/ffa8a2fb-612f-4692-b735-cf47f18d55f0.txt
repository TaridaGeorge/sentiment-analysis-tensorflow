Went to Postinos with our Light Rail Pub Crawl group and was highly impressed with the service we received from the staff at postinos. It's rare when a restaurant is able to provide seamless service for this large of a group, but the staff works well as a team and it shows! They got us seated and fed right away. All the food was delicious and great for sharing! They had a $7.50 pitcher of hoegaarden special that was too good to pass up. I highly reccommend this location as good place for groups.
