Great area to go thrifting and find unique items!

Also home of Glendale Glitters in December. Imagine Zoo Lights meets a small city. There are magic shows, live bands, Christmas movies, and lots of yummy food all surrounded by beautiful lights in the Glendale Square. 

To hot to walk around in the summer but come fall step back in time and find some awesome antiques!
