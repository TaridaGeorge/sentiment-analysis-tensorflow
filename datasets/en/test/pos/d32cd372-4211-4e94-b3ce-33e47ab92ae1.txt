the hubby brought me here for valentines day this year and it was delicious! the popovers are to die for... so crisp and fluffy!! they even give you the recipe on how to make them at home. Havent tried it but i will one day :) it was pretty busy and we were sat at a table about 15 minutes after our reservation time. we each got a steak i cant remember the name on the menu but i think i got the kobe steak and my hubby a ribeye. we both loved the steak. would definitely come back
