I come here all the time, I get the Tonkotsu ramen with extra noodles.  The people are friendly, the service is outstanding and the ramen is delicious. I like how they let you add as much spice as you like (I like it VERY spicy).  The whole place has a cool vibe to it--I think since its so close to the university.   Keep in mind I've never been to Japan, also I've never had Las Vegas or Hawaiian ramen, but I really like the dish here.

Go here!  Its one of the few places that I recommend to my friends consistently (other places being Oregano's, Cartel Coffee, 4 Peaks, etc.)
