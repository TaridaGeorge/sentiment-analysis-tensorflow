Wow, without a doubt one of the best place for pizza in the world paired with great wine and also awesome service. With the brick oven that carrys the pizza through the cooking process and gives it that elegant flavor, you can not beat grimaldis pizzeria. My wife and I go to this pizzeria almost every friday to catch up with friends and have that great feeling of being home and also feeling like you are wanted. We plan to keep going to this place for years to come based off food and service.
