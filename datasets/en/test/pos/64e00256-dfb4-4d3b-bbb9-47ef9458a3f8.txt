Went here for the first time, after years of wanting to check it out.  It was our "It's a boy" celebration for my husband and myself.  We were placed in a little private booth with a curtain. Our waiter explained everything wonderfully, especially since it was our first time. We talked through the whole dinner about what a romantic experience this was. I do not have one complaint about any of the food, all of it, especially the desert was great.  We will be back for those special celebrations in our lives because we know this is the place to be :)
