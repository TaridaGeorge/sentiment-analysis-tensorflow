Stopped in for a first visit here today, ordered, & claimed a comfortable booth.  For this second visit to any Smashburger, I ordered a 1/2 lb. BBQ Bacon & Cheeseburger ($6.99), & Smashfries ($1.99).  Like the store on Baseline in Tempe, this one was immaculately clean & had staff members who were perky & eager to please.

Pretty soon my order arrived.  This burger comes with meat, bacon, cheese, & a little stack of crispy deep-fried onions, & you add your own ketchup & mustard (both Heinz, of course!), & your own salt & pepper.

With REAL metal tableware available to help manage eating this feast, both the hamburger & the fries were terrific.  The special "Smashfries" tasted like good pizza.  I really love this place!     :-))
