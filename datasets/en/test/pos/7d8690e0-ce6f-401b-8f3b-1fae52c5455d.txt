Fantastic mall! Every store is here...from Neiman Marcus and Gap to Sephora and Gucci- there is definitely something for everyone! 
It's huge though, so if you're planning on spending the day shopping, wear comfortable shoes.
Parking usually isn't too bad...you can park in the covered parking or try your luck searching for one outside of the department stores.
If you walk a little bit, you can now check out Borders, Urban Outfitters and more by the Scottsdale waterfront. 
The food court has pretty good options too, but I recommend you try out Tomatoes located across from Neiman Marcus.
