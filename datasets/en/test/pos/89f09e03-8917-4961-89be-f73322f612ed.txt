I found out about this place after we lost our progressive talk radio station in Sacramento.  I started streaming Nova-M Radio from the Phoenix station on iTunes and heard an advertisement for Copper Star a number of times.  When it became clear that I would be moving to the Valley I made it a point to come by this place.  I was SO not disapointed.  They have pretty good mochas and if you hit them at the right time they will have whipped cream infused with some flavoring....nice touch.  I can't say anything about their wi-fi since I don't have a laptop but just for the atmosphere and their support of good radio I have to max out on the star count.

Nova-M is dead but Copper Star lives on and rocks just as hard as they always did!!!
