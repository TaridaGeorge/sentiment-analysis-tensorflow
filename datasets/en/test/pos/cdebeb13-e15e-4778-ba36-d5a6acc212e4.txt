Fresh food made with free range, hormone and antibiotic free meat.  The service was good and the items we ordered (falafel wrap and chicken pasta salad special) was delicious.  The portions were generous, and the flourless chocolate cake was worth every calorie.  We ate outside, and while not a fancy patio, it was nice.  I'll definitely go back.
