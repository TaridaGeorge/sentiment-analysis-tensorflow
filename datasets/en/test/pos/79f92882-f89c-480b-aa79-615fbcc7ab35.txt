If you want some mass-appeal Italian food (a la Olive Garden), this place can't be beat. 

The best salad anywhere (and it is unlimited).  The bread (also unlimited) dipped into a mixture of olive oil, Parmesan, and Italian seasoning is delicious.  I am usually stuffed full of salad long before my entree arrives.  I have learned that it is best to just order something I want to take home and eat for lunch the next day.  

Some of my favorite entrees are the Cannelloni (if you are aren't anti-veal), Stuffed Shells and the Chicken Parm (sub Fettuccini Alfredo).

I haven't been to the new location yet and I can't wait to check it out.  Hopefully it is bigger because the old place was always packed.
