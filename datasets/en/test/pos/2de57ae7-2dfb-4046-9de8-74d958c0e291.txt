I have been looking for a mid-west style fast food restaurant with both Gyros and Chicago Style Dogs for a long time.

The dogs have the bright fluorescent green relish and the sport peppers aren't too hot. The celery salt is just right.

The Gyros are over-stuffed and ooze all over as you eat them but that is the way I like it!
