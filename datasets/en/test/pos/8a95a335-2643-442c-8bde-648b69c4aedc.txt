The best pizza period.  I have been going there for years, and for the current reviews from folks going there now (since they started opeing for lunch) and complaining about waiting...you have no idea.  I have waited for a table for three hours there before, and never regretted it.  What's to complain about?  There is an excellent wine bar next door!  If you want to grab a quick pizza then go to some of the "other" pizza factories.  If you want a good, handmade brick oven pizza, look no further.

I have never had a bad experience with wait staff, service, etc. 

If I could give this place 10 stars I would.

Go there.
