When it's hot it's hot. This place is my all time favorite Mexican restaurant!  I have never had a bad meal here. I absolutely will continue going back for the adovada (ribs or burrito) and the "kick-ass margaritas.
   Expect a very fiesta type atmosphere.The manager(or maybe he is the owner) is a great guy with a good sense of humor and friendly. This place is WELL WORTH THE TRIP,especially if you like hot food!  DON'T do like I did. The first several times I went here I ordered the same thing because it was so good. Since then I have tried many different meals and haven't been dissapointed yet!
