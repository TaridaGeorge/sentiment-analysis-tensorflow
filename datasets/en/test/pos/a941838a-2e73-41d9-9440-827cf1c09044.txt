This is the king of Ranch Markets- easily the best location in the valley.

The cream and cheese selection is pretty freakin' awesome.

The pan dulce selection is just as fun.

The cafe (not the restaurant) serves up good food pretty quickly.

The only crappy thing we've consistently experienced here is that the produce we've bought always goes bad very quickly- especially fruit.  Solution: just buy what you're going to use in the next day or two, because otherwise it's great produce.

The fun of the place is that the selection is great and the atmosphere is unbeatable as far as fun places to shop and pick up food!
