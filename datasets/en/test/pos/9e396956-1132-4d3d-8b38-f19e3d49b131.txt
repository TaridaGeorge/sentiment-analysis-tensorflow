I love Tott's. The atmosphere almost makes me feel at home and the guys always working the counter?-- An absolutely wonderful man who always talks to everybody and walks around checking that everything's okay. It's worth it to go just to see his smiling face! But then again, there's the food which is cheap and delicious. Right around Panda Express prices but so much better-- everything feels and tastes fresher and better. The veggies are crisp. The meat is flavorful and good. Sauces are thick and delicious. I can't stress enough that you should try this place. Don't go to Pei Wei. Support this guy and his wonderful Asian food.
