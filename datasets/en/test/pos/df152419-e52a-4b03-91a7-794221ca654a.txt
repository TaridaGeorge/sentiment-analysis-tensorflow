I love this place. 
It's cash only, but there is an ATM.
Once you walk in, the grill is usually cooking some hotdogs and the smell hits you right away.
They have all sorts of incarnations of hotdogs and have a great selection of condiments and fixings to go on top.
All the ingredients are top notch quality. 
I usually go with the Bratwurst, but you can't really go wrong. 
The onions and peppers are a great touch, with the sauce being the best part. I'm pretty sure they sell it by the bottle. 
The same guy is working away at the grill everytime I've been, and he is definitely the best at grilling dogs I've witnessed. 

*Mental note - Pick up a bottle next trip*
