I've been a regular at this Papa John's for more than 8 years, they have different managers every year or so, but they get to know you by name when you order every week. 

I love the pizza obviously, especially the crust. It's damn good pizza for the price. I've had pizza from a lot of places and I continue to return to Papa John's, I like it.

The pizza's at usually ready in 15 minutes if you pick up the order (I don't get delivery cause it's so close by). They like to have carry out orders in by 9:38 PM.
