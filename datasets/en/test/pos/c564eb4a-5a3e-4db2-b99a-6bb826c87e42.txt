I really enjoyed dinner at nobuo last night.  The restaurant itself is a historic home from the late nineteenth century so it has a cozy feel that you wouldn't get in a new structure.  The service was pretty good, I love that hipsters are bringing back the stache!  Anyway the mixed drinks were innovative and delicious.  I had their special pear/ginger drink and the cucumber shiso.  The food was very approachable and we were happy with all the dishes.  Some of the favs were the big eye special with onion sauce, the hamachi with grapefruit and avocado, and the oysters w uni.  The seafood was very fresh.  I rarely get seafood this fresh in so cal.  Very impressed with the quality and creativity for the price.  This is fairly acccessible fine food.
