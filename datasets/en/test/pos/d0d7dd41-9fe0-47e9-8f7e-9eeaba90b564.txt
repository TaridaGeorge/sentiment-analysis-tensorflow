We went here last week for a friend's going away party.   It is a small, Southern Indian/vegetarian restaurant just north of the 202 on Scottsdale Rd.  

The dosas for appetizers were tasty and very filling, and the entree, Gobi Manchurian, was amazing - I never thought cauliflower could taste so good!  We also had the bhatura bread, which was a large, light bread that could easily be shared between 3-4 people.  The food is also served family style, so it is easy to try multiple things and share with others.  As a vegetarian, I can't think of the last time I had so many choices!   We will definitely be back!

UPDATE 8/7/07:  I have relocated to the Bay Area and still haven't had Indian food this good in San Francisco or Berkeley!
