Vintage 95 has defined itself as a standout. There are many wine bars out there, but this place feels more warm and inviting than most. With a comfortable and relaxed vibe (and lovely live music), Vintage 95 avoids the typical pitfalls of an irritating and competitive wine bar scene. The staff go out of their way to make you feel at home. The wine selection is unique and personal (by-the-glass options frequently change) with a wide spread on price points. The food is beyond high-caliber with excellent plating and great seasonal rotations of a variety of proteins and greens. The menu is diverse enough to please any mood. Mike Wahlberg, the master chef behind the fun din, is a culinary gem.  Kudos.
