I had a new operating system installed on a old laptop that was destined for the trash. Mike (manager and co-founder) suggested an older version of Ubuntu be installed.  I picked the computer up the next day and he took the time to go over the basics and show me that it was working properly. Mike even gave me $50.00 off coupon that he applied to my bill.

These guys are fantastic and a locally owned and operated company. The sell computers and service them. Don't waste your time, money and energy bringing your computers for repairs to Best Buy, Geek Squad etc when you can get it done right at a reasonable price and keep the tax dollars right here in your own neighborhood.
