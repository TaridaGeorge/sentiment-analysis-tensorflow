I would like the welcome this place as my new favorite hangout.

They have good wine and beer at unbeatable prices.  They also offer beer to go.  Normally restaurants that offer beer to go jack up the price, they do not.  Some beers are cheaper here than liquor stores.

The food is OUT OF THIS WORLD.  I think the most expensive item on the menu is $8.  They only have pizza and sandwiches.  Their french dip is the best I have ever had.  I ordered it with onions and peppers.  The dip was amazing.

I've also had the chicken sandwich twice and it's to die for.  This place is worth your time for either lunch or dinner.
