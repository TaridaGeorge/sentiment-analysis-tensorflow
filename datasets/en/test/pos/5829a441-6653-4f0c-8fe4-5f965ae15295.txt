One of the best brownies ever. Period. And the chocolate chip cookies were awesome also.  I drove past this place since i didn't know what I was looking for.  Set in a small village looking area on the east side of the street, the building is small and well decorated.  The staff was very friendly and sweet.

The chocolate brownies tasted like they'd just been baked moments ago.  They come individually wrapped which makes it a great gift for others.  The cookies don't come wrapped but they won't last long after you take your first bite.  They do have ice cream and I was very tempted to have a sundae if everything else was that good.  I just might have to stop in this weekend.....
