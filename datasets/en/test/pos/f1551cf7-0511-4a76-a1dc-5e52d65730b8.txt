RING THE BELL!!  This place got out the world's LARGEST red wine stain on my IVORY Vera Wang bridesmaid dress.  It was an embaressing night to have to walk around looking like a stain all night but Bell saved the dress, not my dignity.

*** I am also taking my wedding gown here to get cleaned.  That is how much I trust this place.   Now I just have to remember where I put it.... hmmmm.
