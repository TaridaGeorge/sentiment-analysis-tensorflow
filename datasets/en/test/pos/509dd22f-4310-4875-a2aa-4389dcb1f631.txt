L-O-V-E IT.  Been visiting Picazzo's for over 7 years.  Organic, gluten free options can't be beat.  Great atmosphere and friendly staff make for an amazing experience.  Recommend the brie and roasted garlic appetizer - very tasty.  The Pasta and Pizza are all very good.  Signed up for the Picazzo's rewards card to earn discounts.  The owner takes pride in every aspect of this restaurant.  

Excellent choice for lunch, dinner, or HH.

**Update: This location has changed it's name to Buon Gusto Gourmet Pizza, the menu is basically the same!
