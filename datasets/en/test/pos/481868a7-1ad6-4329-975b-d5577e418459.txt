My review is actually of the Afternoon Tea and not the hotel in general.  Let me just say I am really a little speechless because the afternoon tea experience was amazing!

Jeffery, the tea extraordinare was amazing to us the entire time and we left with one of the best experiences.  So if you are looking for a place to spend a couple hours and want to try something new, try afternoon tea at the Ritz, it is amazing!
