I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet. I work nearby and frequent Jolta Java at least 4 times a week. Mostly for just Iced Tea (which is delicious!). I love supporting locally owned places and the staff at Jolta Java is why. They always remember who you are and what you like. When I eat lunch there they always ask how it is and for any feedback. 

My only suggestion would be more veggie friendly menu options! Even their caprese salad has buffalo chicken on it?? Their soups however, are FANTASTIC. I wish they served them on more of a regular schedule because I love the Jalapeno creamed corn soup but never know when it is being offered.
