My niece had her baby this morning at this hospital.  From my standpoint, I have absolutely no objections concerning the whole experience from the birthing center on the second floor to her after care room up on the third floor.  In fact, the staff was a little concerned that she wasn't calling them about every little concern that might affect her after having her second c section.  Having quite a lot of  prior experience with hospitals, getting five stars from me isn't all that easy but all went just that well today.

Concerning the hospital cafeteria, the patty melt was surprisingly good, I think.  The onions rings were surprisingly bad so unless they look really fresh and warm, I'd suggest staying away from them.  Otherwise it was a good experience as to eating in the hospital cafeteria.
