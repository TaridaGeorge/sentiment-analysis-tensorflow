Visited on Opening Night. I have to say it was a good first impression. Fun atmosphere, great food, tons of beers on tap and reasonable prices! Staff was friendly and helpful and seem excited to work there.

Do yourself a huge favor and order the pretzels with beer cheese to start. Soft croissant-esque pretzels dipped in a spicy pepperjack beer cheese, awesome combo!
