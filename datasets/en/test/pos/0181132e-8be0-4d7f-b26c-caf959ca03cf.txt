This place offers excellent Thai cuisine. They offer every dish in multiple levels (or degrees) of heat. I always get Thai hot, as I love spicy food, and they never disappoint. I've had terrible or mediocre experiences with some Thai restaurants in other cities, but this place is excellent. I recommend the signature dish, Thai Basil, as well as their Pad Thai and Red Curry. There are multiple locations, including Central Phoenix and Ahwatukee. If I have anything bad to say about the restaurant, it would be that the University location is pretty small and when the Fall or Spring semesters at ASU are in session it can get packed quickly.
