Crudo, Crudo how do I love thee? Let me count the ways:

Butterfish with lardo and lemon
Albacore with truffles, apples and black garlic
Squid Ink Risotto
Pork Belly enough said
Short Rib with root veggies

Each dish was amazing, an orgasm for the tongue. I didn't want it to end. I could have stayed and ate for hours. Charming building, awesome set up... And the cocktails, ohhhh the cocktails. The modest monk and daring dutchman were crafted to perfection. 

Cullen Campbell has done it again and having Micah Olson behind the bar was a brilliant combination. This place is a "must try" and reservations are recommended. Last time I was there I forgot to make them and the wait was over an hour (and worth every minute).
