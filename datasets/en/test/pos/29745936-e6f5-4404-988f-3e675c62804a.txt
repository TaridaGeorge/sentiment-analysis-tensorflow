I never have problems with Chic-Fil-A. Sometimes when they are swamped, they send the employees out to your car while you're waiting in line to show you the menu and take your order. A bit awkward when you're wearing your jammies, but still appreciated. 

I love their chicken club and honey roasted BBQ sauce. They never complain or state a limit on sauces, which is appreciated because my husband and I get different kinds. If I had kids, I bet they'd appreciate all of the events they do for family nights. 

The only thing I would suggest is that they fill their large fries more- sometimes I feel like I should just order the medium. 

Overall though great food (GREAT breakfast bagel) and fast, friendly service.
