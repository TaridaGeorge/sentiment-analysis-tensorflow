My absolute favorite coffee shop - I'm a regular!
Friendly atmosphere & staff, buttery fluffy muffins, ooey gooey danishes, tasty coffee, and support for local businesses and entrepreneurs.  The only negative for me is the mysterious disappearance of the corn tortilla bagel (much yummier than it sounds)!
