My husband and I enjoyed a splendid glass of wine here before dinner at Sea Saw. What a comfortable, cozy and quaint environment. It's almost lounge like. We didn't eat, but I was tempted by the menu. This place can be romantic if you want it to be, but you could also enjoy a group of friends here. We will definitely come here again...hopefully sooner rather than later. It's awesome to be able to sit at the bar for one glass of wine or settle into the plush couches for a few...or even an entire bottle.
