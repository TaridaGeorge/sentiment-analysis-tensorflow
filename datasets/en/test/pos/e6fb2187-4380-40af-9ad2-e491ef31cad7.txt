I would have to say this place is my favorite bar in all of the Phoenix area. The Tempe land mark which is situated in a cool old neighborhood, offers everything from Oysters to their famous strong pours. Be careful though, I recommend taking a cab or the light rail to this destination (no joke). Ask for Jimmy and you will see what I mean.
