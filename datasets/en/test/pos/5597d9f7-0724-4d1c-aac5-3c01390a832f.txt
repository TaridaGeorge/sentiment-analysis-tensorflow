I watched in awe as he carried my food all the way to my table and attempted to get the high chair for me on the way there. When I said "thank you", he said, "My pleasure."

I knew Chick-fil-a was "kid friendly" but I had no idea how easy they would make it for me to eat there on a mother-son date with my one year old. 

My hands were full with the boy and my purse so I was very glad for the help from my server.

Our chicken was fresh and hot and the fruit cup was perfect for my son to feed himself.
