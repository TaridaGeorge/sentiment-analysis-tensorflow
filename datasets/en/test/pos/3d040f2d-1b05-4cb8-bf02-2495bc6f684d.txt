Yen is the go-to place for Sushi in Arizona. Having been to quite a few places and also living on the coast, I can say their fish is quality. The wait staff can vary, sometimes it's excellent, other times it's not. I enjoy their Albacore and Red Snapper sashimi and their off-the-menu King Crab hand roll (real crab, woot!). If you enjoy quality sashimi, this is an excellent place. If you're into all the fancy mayonnaise-based sushi rolls, you probably won't notice a difference.
