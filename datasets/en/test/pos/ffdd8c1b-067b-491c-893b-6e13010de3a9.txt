I have been doing CrossFit for almost seven years and have been to five different affiliates which has exposed me to a lot of different trainers and training techniques.  I have seen good trainers and bad trainers.  Gilbert CrossFit has some of the BEST trainers I have ever worked with.  They take the time to teach you the proper way to complete all lifts and movements to ensure that you perform safely and efficiently.  I have seen excellent results in the short time I've been at GCF and I attribute this to excellent programming combined with an excellent coaching staff that pushes me hard during every workout!
