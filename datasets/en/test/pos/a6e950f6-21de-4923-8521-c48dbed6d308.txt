This restaurant knows exactly how to make your tastebuds dance.  The food was top notch and the service, impeccible.  The duck and foie gras...to die for.  Our server was so great and offered the perfect suggestions.  We had polished off our bottle of wine before dessert and I hesitantly declined an after dinner drink.  The waiter must of sensed this because upon my return from the ladies room to our table my husband informed me that our server brought me a complimenary drink.  

The ambience was romantic and I hope to return soon.
