I ordered a pasty stuffed with ground beef, French fries, onions, melted Swiss Cheddar blend, and it was DELICIOUS. They're so big, my friend and I (both of us girls) split one, so it was only $4.50 each. I also got the mushroom spinach soup, which comes with homemade (I think) bread and butter, and the soup was warm, thick, and not too creamy. We finished off with the Shirley Temple for dessert, an amazing toffee, chocolatey bread pudding that comes with a white cream you can stir into it. Restaurant is pretty dark inside, and they play loud Indie music, so I wouldn't go with a client or boss, but with friends, it's great. Just the right volume so you can notice the music, but still have a conversation.
