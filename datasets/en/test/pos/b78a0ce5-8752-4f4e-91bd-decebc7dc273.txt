We've been going to four peaks for some time now and we are never let down. The food is great, the service is great and the beer is wonderful as well. Pricing is normal, nothing outrageous. The Tempe location has a better atmosphere, simply because of the layout and all the brick, etc. The Scottsdale location can get very busy but you are waiting in less of a line than you would in Tempe and you can actually find parking at this location. 

I usually get the grilled chicken sandwich, it's great. I've had the jalapeño burger before, it's quite delicious too! The cream cheese and fresh jalapeños make it oh so good. Not to mention they have AMAZING chicken fingers here. I don't eat fried food often, but those chicken tenders tempt me every time. So so good.
