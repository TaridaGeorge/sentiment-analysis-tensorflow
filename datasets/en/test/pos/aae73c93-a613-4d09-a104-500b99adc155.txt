Hillstone = Houston's in a new swanky setting. 

You can walk inside through the awesome patio complete with a fireplace and heaters. Even though it was freezing outside, I think the patio was actually warmer than the restaurant. 

My mom and I sat at the bar. I was happy to see the Hillstone menu is pretty much the exact same as the Houston's menu except they now have sushi. And if that isn't crazy enough, the salmon roll my mom had was actually amazing!

I had the veggie burger, like I did pretty much every other time I've been to Houston's. Don't get me wrong, I am a carnivore, but the veggie burger is so inexplicably good, I usually end up ordering it. I was also happy to see they still have the Thai noodle salad on the menu. Get it with steak and you will be happy.
