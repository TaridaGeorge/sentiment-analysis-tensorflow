Hair Affair is a cute little salon with a nice modern atmosphere. The stylists there, Susan and Fritz are both really great at what they do and have fun, warm personalities! Really easy to talk to. They have complementary drinks and a great assortment of chocolates and other goodies. 

I usually get my hair done by Susan and I've never been disappointed! I have really thick, crazy, frizzy hair, but Susan always makes my hair look good. Great hair and great service! Definitely recommend this place!
