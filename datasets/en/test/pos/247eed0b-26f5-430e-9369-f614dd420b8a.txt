I went to Alice-Rae earlier today to be professionally fitted and I got to say... I am glad I did. I've never spent $200 on bras before but it was well worth it. Julia was fantastic and helped me find several bras that fit beautifully. Well worth the money. 

Ladies, if you haven't had a professional fit you before, you need to. Thanks Julia!
