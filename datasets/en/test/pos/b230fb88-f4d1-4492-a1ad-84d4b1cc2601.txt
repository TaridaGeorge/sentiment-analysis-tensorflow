First, im from Mexico City, and i know the flavor of my hometown, you got it. 

We "chilangos" (ppl  from mexico city) love TTT, tortas, tamales, tacos, and this place have the best flavor, clean,  with memorabilia from the city all around the place, weekends you can enjoy a "toquin" music party, enjoy the food for long time, 

i will definitely recomend this place to all people who want to eat the real food from Mexico City....


Felicidades, excelente servicio y siempre muy limpio
