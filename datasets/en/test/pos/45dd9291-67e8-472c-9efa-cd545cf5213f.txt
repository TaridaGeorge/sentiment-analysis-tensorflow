This place is great. Service it top notch. Food is excellent. Rock climbing and hiking with Carey was a highlight - fantastic guide with a wonderful sense of humor. No reason you can't enjoy yourself here if you are looking for a beautiful setting with activities, or if you would just prefer to sit by the pool or visit the spa. Also received a great haircut at the salon. Don't look at the price tag just enjoy.
