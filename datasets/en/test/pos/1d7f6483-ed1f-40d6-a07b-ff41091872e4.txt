Had a great diner style cheeseburger today, and will definitely go back.   Tillamook cheese, lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, and thousand island style sauce.
The fries that came with it were what I would call steak fries.  

This was a take-out order via the livingsocial.com website. 

This was my first visit, mainly due to the name of the place...had always wondered if a "Mexican Hamburger" place would actually be good...
