Pizzeria Bianco is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix.  The menu is modest: half a dozen pizzas and a handful of starters.  Chris Bianco sources the freshest local and organically grown ingredients ( I have seen him at the local farmer's markets)  and a few artisanal ingredients from Italy.  The atmosphere is cozy, with a wood-fired oven as the main focal point in a rustic, brick-walled dining room.  
The pizza's are worth the wait!  I would highly recommend ordering the antipasto platter as well.
