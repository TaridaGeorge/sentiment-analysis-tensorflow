i'm not sure what the first reviewer was talking about. 

anyway.

this location is great for:

- men's and women's shoes
- friendly staff (the former manager, robin, was excellent.)

this location is not great for:

- a large selection of DVDs (unless you like the ones from the dollar store.)
- kids' toys

bathroom report: decent
