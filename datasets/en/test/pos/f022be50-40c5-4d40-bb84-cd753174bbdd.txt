Ok, I have tried nearly every cupcake place in the Phoenix metro area and this place takes the cake..no pun intended.  It puts Sprinkles to shame.  They are not too sweet and the frosting is perfection.  I have a hard time eating one, I always have to order more.  There are two cupcakes that are worth the trip to Gilbert, the rosewater and raspberry and the lemon lavender blueberry.  They will be the best cupcakes you will ever eat, I can assure you.  The owner doesn't make these two everyday but if you call ahead she will make them for you the next morning.  I'm not as big of a fan of the vegan cupcakes they make, as they can sometimes be inconsistent, but the traditional cupcakes are D-lish!  I always order a pomegranate iced tea to accompany my cupcakes as well.
