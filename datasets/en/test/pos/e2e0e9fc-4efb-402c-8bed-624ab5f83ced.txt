What a joy to discover Thai Lahna with my friend Keith Galbut who has been going here for over 10 years. I can see why. Family owned and operated - and everyone is very friendly and helpful. Of course all that matters is the food, right - and it's marvelous. We tried several dishes and all were well spiced and wonderful. Highly recommended.
