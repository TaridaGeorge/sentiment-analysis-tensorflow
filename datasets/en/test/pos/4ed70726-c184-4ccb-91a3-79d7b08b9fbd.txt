Great atomosphere, great food, great service. At our table we had the salmon, yellowtail, sand dabs, and scallops. Scallops & Sand dabs were out of this world. We're all on diets so we passed on the big yummy looking load of sourdough bread. (ahhh bread). Our server was cute, he offered to bring us Rye because I told him we were all on diets.  I dont usually get geeked up about salad dressing, but the basil vingeratte was really good! The sand dabs looked more like Patrole sole & had a yummy lemon caper sauce & my scallops were perfect.
