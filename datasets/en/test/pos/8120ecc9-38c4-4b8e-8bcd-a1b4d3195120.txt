Michelle, the owner was amazing! I was in a wedding and the bridal shop really screwed up almost 10 girls dresses! Mine was too big, not the pencil style and Michelle altered it to fit perfectly! I got so many compliments at the wedding! I now love the style of that dress...thanks Michelle! She turned everything around so quickly, she was afforfdable and super professional. I am wearing the dress in my profile pic, I am on the right.
