None of this is news.  If you want a dirt cheap meal that will make both your tongue and wallet sing, go to Pita Jungle.  I agree with previous reviewers, it is a stupid name.  Throwing that aside, this is on the short list of places I would agree to for any given meal.  By myself I tend to resort to  the Black Bean Burger, or one of the Wood-Fired Pizzas.  With the girl, our order of choice is the Hummus with Grilled Chicken, and the Fruit and Cheese Fantasia.  The latter order is a ridiculous amount of food at an unthinkably low price, which happens to be ludicrously tasty.  Pita Jungle is one of those few places where it is difficult to blow it, everything is good, healthy and affordable.
