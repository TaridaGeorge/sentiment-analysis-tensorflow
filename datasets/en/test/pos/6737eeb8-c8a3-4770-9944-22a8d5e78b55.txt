As a transplant from heavily asian populated parts of California, I assumed I had seen everything an asian grocer had to offer.  Lee Lee bested them all.  Their produce was diverse and inexpensive.  The Indian section rivals dedicated Indian grocery stores.  I wish I lived close enough to do my weekly grocery shopping.
