Not what you'd think from a hole-in-the-wall place. Great food, awesome customer service, amazing prices. Luu's stands out in a fast food environment with loads of competition who seemingly care only about your money. I've had several dishes here and they're always fast, fresh and delicious. I've been reluctant to give any restaurant 5 stars before, but Luu's is worthy of the rating. Great eats. Recommend the yakisoba with teriyaki chicken, or the teriyaki chicken bowl (served with sweet jasmine rice!)
