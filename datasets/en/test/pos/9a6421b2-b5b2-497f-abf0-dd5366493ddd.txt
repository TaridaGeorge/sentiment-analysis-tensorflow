Just found this place and have been eating breakfast here like 3 times a week. The staff has always been attentive and fun. It gets pretty busy on Sunday mornings, so expect a short wait. Good spot to eat on the patio and soak in the view of Camelback Mountain. Everything I have tried so far has been good, love the Joe's Special!
