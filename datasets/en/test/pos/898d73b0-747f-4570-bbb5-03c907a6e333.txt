This place is so sexy.

I actually spent my most recent birthday celebration here with some great friends because the days of parading around half-naked in nightclubs are a tad behind me now. 

They have an amazing drink menu here. The Moscow Mule comes in an adorable copper cup that makes you want to commit a small crime. I would also definitely recommend the St. Germain. It's a sweet martini, but one of the best I've ever had. This place also makes me want to buy a meat slicer and a slab of prosciutto for my own home.  

Hanny's is definitely one of Phoenix's finest gems. It has a great deal of personality. Drinks, food, and tunes are always fantastic. See you there!
