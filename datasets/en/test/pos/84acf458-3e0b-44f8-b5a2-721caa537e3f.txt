While I have never bought anything here, I have consigned clothing and shoes here several times.  I use this as my "fun fund" by always stopping by here with my clothes before I head off to donate them.  They tend to only take designer/brand name stuff, which makes sense.  You drop off your stuff, they look through it and tell you how many items they want to keep to sell, hand you a receipt and then come back a few months later (maybe sooner...depends) and pick up cash.  Gotta love it.  They are friendly and seems to be a well run store.
