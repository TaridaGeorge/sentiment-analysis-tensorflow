We love taking out of state guests to our neighborhood Cheers bar aka  CK's in Ahwatukee for the fabulous food and a nice outdoor seating area. The raspberry chicken is my husband's favorite and the burgers are excellent. For a nice family setting (no frills) with excellent food and service at a reasonable price, you can't go wrong.
