I am in love with OTF! It's seriously the best workout you can get in an hour. I love how it just flys by. It's similar to circuit training, but you wear a heart monitor and your heart rate is displayed on a screen. It helps to push me a little bit harder so I stay in the "orange zone" longer. The staff is also super friendly and very responsive. I highly recommend checking out Orange Theory Fitness! They offer a free trial class as well.
