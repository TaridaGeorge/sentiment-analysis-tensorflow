I had an easy time setting up my appointment. John said I could call the morning of and usually he'll be able to get my car done that day. He said it would take 1.5-2 hours, they were done in 1 hour 15 min, so that made me very pleased. He was clear on the pricing and after care instruction. He is a very knowledagble guy.
