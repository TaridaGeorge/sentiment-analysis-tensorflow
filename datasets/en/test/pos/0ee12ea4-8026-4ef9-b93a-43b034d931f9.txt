We have lived here in the area for over 40 yrs . this is the first time we have ate at PF Changs of Tempe.
We went to dinner at PF Changs of Tempe. Service was great. Our waitress was Missy Belard. The Mgr Maria came to our table 3 timees to make sure everything was good. Everyone was very pleasant and knew how to smile. The porportions were big. Took plenty of food home with us. Thank you for the great dinning experience.
