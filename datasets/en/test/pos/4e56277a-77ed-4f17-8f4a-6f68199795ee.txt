I have been going there at least once a week since they opened (for food and coffee) and the staff is always pleasant, the food is always good and the coffee is always terrific! Great atmosphere inside and out. So glad to hear they are opening another store at Scottsdale Quarter! Now I can finally get some GOOD coffee when I am in the Kierland area!
