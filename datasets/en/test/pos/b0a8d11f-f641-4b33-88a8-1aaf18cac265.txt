I had an issue with a sliding glass door that would not latch properly.  I tried several times to fix it myself, but was unsuccessful.  I called these guys and the gentleman who came out figured out the problem right away, repaired the door, and now it latches.  I was afraid I would need to replace the whole door, but they fixed it at a fraction of the cost.

I would definitely use these guys for any lockout or locksmith needs, especially aluminum sliding doors as not many technicians know how to work on these and actually fix the problem!  Great job!!
