Had dinner at Swtich on a Friday evening while I was in town visiting some friends for a long weekend.  It was a little chilly outside so we sat inside, but the outside patio looked amazing.  The inside of Switch was very modern and had a cool vibe to it.  I started off with a Red Switch Sangria Cocktail which was infused with Apples, Blueberries and Strawberries, and ordered the Fresh Mozzarella Salad for my dinner which included roma tomato, basil pesto, garlic croutons, olives, red onions, field greens and of course Mozzarella toped with a balsamic honey vinaigrette.  The drink and the dinner were quite tasty. Can't wait to go back when I visit Phoenix again!!!
