I love this place. I have been a customer for over five years. I bring my friends there to  show them a little gem in Phoenix. This is a very casual place where they remember you and treat you nicely. If you are snob this is not the place for you. 

The gentleman that owns it and the employees are simple adorable. It is like a family. 

One funny fact is that to use the restroom you have to go behind the front desk. The restroom is small but impeccable. I am very picky with restrooms. It is clean and that is what I like. It has not to be fancy just clean.

My favorite food is tabouli. The best in town. 

Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
