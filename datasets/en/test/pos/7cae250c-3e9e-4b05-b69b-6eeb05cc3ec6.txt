The food is great.  I attended the event, "A Taste of Cambodia"  put on by NAAAP Phoenix Chapter.  Arizona Asian American Association was there as well.  AAAA had their meeting there after the event.  You can check out the photos here: http://markzemnick.com/?p=381.  Photos:  Copyright 2011 Mark Zemnick.
