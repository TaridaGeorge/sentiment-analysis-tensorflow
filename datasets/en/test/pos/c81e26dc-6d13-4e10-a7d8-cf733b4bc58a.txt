Beautiful park in a great location. The park itself spans several blocks, with a designated dog park area, baseball fields, a soccer field, a playground, and a lake. The lake is well-stocked with fish. There are a few restrictions for fishing (like how many you can catch), but otherwise just go and enjoy! 

As a part of the greenbelt, it's a great place for a quick stroll or a bike ride. If you bring your pup, you will see plenty of other dogs at almost any time of day. The trail around the lake is 1 mile in length, and there are little fitness stations throughout. Great for a quick workout!
