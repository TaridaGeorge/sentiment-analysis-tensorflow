I ordered the Fresas con Crema (Strawberry with Cream) and Nuez (Nut Flavor).  The Strawberry Pop was milk based with lots of fresh Strawberries bits into it, the Nut one has a layer of Nuts all over the top.. Both Very Good!!  I wanted another flavor buts seems that they have seasonal flavors depends on what is more fresh and available at the moment than same regular flavors.. Both Pops were a lil under $6 - takes Cash.. Very Friendly Employee's and fun Spanish music in the background.. Very Clean too.. Would surely return and even get 3 pops next time!  Fun design, stickers on cover of sleeve and a bite mark on the edge of pop mold..  Located in nice Center a little hidden at end of center though..
