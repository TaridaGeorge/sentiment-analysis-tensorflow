I have been going here for a couple of months and love this place. She always takes her time to make sure she does a great job. Kathleen is so friendly and is like a psychologist and just listens to your stories and problems. After she has completed her work she always asks if you are satisified and always offers to put on more lashes if you are not satisfied (which never happens). Her prices are amazing and I would not go anywhere else!
