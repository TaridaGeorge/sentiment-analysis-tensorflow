Who didn't give Haji's 5 stars? They are mental.

I've been coming here for 15 years. I have never had a bad meal, and always leave with a smile on my face. Super inexpensive, amazingly tasty. Really. I wish the rating system for Yelp went to ELEVEN.

I now live in San Francisco and have for about year....you know, the San Francisco that is supposed to be one of those culinary-Mecca type cities? There isn't Mediterranean food in all of SF that is anywhere near as good for 3x the price.

Love the Haji-Baba. You simply don't know how good you have it.
