This place is amazing! 
The hubs and I are expecting our first baby and I was told this was the store to register at! I already knew this though, Ive been to many many baby showers and have always loved shopping at Buy Buy Baby over Babies R Us. BBB is organized in a way that makes so much sense. 

The man how helped us set up our registry was super informative and very helpful. the staff that we encountered along the way was very friendly and helpful as well, no one was ever pushy. 

I see a lot of trips to BBB in our future!
