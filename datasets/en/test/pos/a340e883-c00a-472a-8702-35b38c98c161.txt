I have yet to eat a bad meal here.  The food is great, the wings... get the Italian Gold. Sweet and so delicious.  Usually when we go, we get a 16" pie with a few toppings.  3-4 people can easily polish one these off.  Lately though we've tried their calzone, and damn is that thing big.  Filled inside with tons of great ingredients, comes out piping hot and a taste that will last for a life time.

If you still have room for dessert, I highly recommend their pizza cookie. Once you eat that, there's no going back.  You'll drown yourself in a chocolate paradise.

I love this place!

The ONLY draw back (but still gave it 5 stars) is that if you dont get their early, get ready to wait for at least 30-40 minutes to be seated.
