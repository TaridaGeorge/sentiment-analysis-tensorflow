This Subway has a drive thru so, as long as you know what toppings you want, you don't even need to get out of your car! 

Easy enough to get in and out of the location too. 

Personally, I like to hit them up for breakfast. I get the Western Egg White breakfast sandwich on a multigrain muffin. (It always cracks me up when they ask if I want peppers and onions on it, since that's what makes it a "Western" egg white breakfast sandwich -- kinda like asking if you want lettuce and tomato on a BLT...?) 

The coffee beats gas station brew and other fast food chains. Put them together and you've got a really reasonably priced breakfast on the go.
