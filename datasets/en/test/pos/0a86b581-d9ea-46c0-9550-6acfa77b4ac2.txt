I fell in love with this place! I had an eyebrow wax, mani and pedi. Wendy was my aesthetician and she was so great! Friendly and very professional. You could tell she was very knowledgeable and skilled at her craft. I appreciated her opinion about possibilities for treating my skin with regard to some new unwanted sun spots. I scheduled a peel with her a few weeks after my visit.
Cathy did my mani/pedi and she was awesome. She took great care and I truly felt she cared about the horrid condition of my nails. She was easy to chat with and I never at any point felt rushed. 
The salon itself was beautiful, very modern and chic. Add the complimentary glass of wine and it was great experience.
Thank you 20 Lounge!
