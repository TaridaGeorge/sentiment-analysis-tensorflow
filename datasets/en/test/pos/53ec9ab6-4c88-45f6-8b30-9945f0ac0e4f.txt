If you asked me to name all of the things I missed about Illinois, I might need two hands, but I'd have a few fingers left over.  Jimmy John's, however, would be one of those things I missed.

The employees are great- They're fast, they've got personality, and always have a smile on their face.

They make the bread fresh in the store; sometimes when they hand you your sandwich, and the bread is still warm from the oven?  That's the greatest.

Just hold the mayo (not a mayo fan)!
