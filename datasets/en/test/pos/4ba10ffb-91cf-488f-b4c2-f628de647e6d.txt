To be honest, I didn't really know what "Italian ice" was until I tried Scala's.  I had been imagining something like Hawaiian ice... roughly shaved, garish colors and flavors.  I was SO WRONG!

Italian ice is delicate, smooth and delicious.  I had the mint chocolate chip... sweet, not too minty and wonderful.  My husband had the root beer, which was awesome too (and would have made a great float with soft serve, which they offer as well).

If you are looking for a cool treat (and and a lighter, less filling alternative to ice cream) try Scala's.
