One of my favorite downtown stops. So many saki choices! The tapas are all great. My husband and I love every single menu item (and yes we've had all of them at one point or another). Bacon wrapped dates = perfection. Service is faster than any other restaurant we've been to downtown. Bartenders make excellent drinks and are very friendly and fun to be around. It  gets busy on Friday and Saturday evenings, but rightfully so, it's awesome! There's outdoor seating, indoor seating and tons of bar seating. Awesome and hip downtown hangout!
