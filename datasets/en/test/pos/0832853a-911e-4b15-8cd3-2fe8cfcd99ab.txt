It's official...I have now been to all 4 Valley Gelato Spot locations and have not been disappointed at any of them!  Talk about consistency...every single one tastes the same and that is delicious!  Great, relaxing atmosphere and a friendly staff.  My dog just can't get enough of the peanut butter...boy, does she love this stuff!  I have to admit I can't either...the Cookies & Cream and Pineapple are incredible as well!
