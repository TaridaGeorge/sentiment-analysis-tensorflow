I've been to this urgent care a few times and have enjoyed it every time I've been. The place is clean and organized and the Doctor and staff are great. Last time I was there I was really sick and they had a pharmacy where I could pick my Rx's up there instead of having to go to another place and spread my germs. I will be returning here the next time I need to.
