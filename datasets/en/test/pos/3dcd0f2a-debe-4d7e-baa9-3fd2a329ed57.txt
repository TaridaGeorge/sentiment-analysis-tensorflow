This is a great restaurant for special occasions.  Most recently I went for an anniversary, and the booth with a curtain was very romantic.  We decided to just get salads, and the cheese and dessert courses because those are the best parts!  It's also plenty of food without the meat course.  

I love the experience of fondue as well as the variety of flavors.  We paired our meal with a good wine and spent an hour and a half just enjoying ourselves.  

Good atmosphere, great food, friendly service... it's not cheap, but (again, for special occasions) the value is worth it.
