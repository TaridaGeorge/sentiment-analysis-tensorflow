Everything was yum here. Server was attentive even with a heavy crowd. 
Woodchuck was on tap. We splurged here in an over eating extravaganza.
Worth mentioning: Artichoke was hot when I requested it out quick. Now you think this would be the norm, its not. Usually everywhere ends up waiting til its cold to serve you the artichoke at least luke warm. 
We also had the mac and cheese (squared?) vegetarian style and it was really good!  Truffle fries: YES. Calamari was a hit, and my darling date enjoyed gardein chicken strips. 
My daughter (18mo) enjoyed her grilled cheese, fries and a cherry lemonade. 
The whole mean was yum. Glasses stayed filled. 
We will be back...
