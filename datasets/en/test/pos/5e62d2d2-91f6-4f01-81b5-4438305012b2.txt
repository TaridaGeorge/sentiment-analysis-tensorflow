I have always ordered take out and been very happy with the food and service.  Basics like the pad thai and other dishes, such as the seafood green curry, crab wontons, thai rolls, vegatable delight and salmon in green curry have all been winners.  

I have recommended SaBai to a few people and hope it stays around!
