Kale and quinoa  salad at the airport???? Yes please!

The helpful Southwest agent recommended that I run down to Terminal D to grab a healthy lunch. Apparently I don't strike people as the Pizza Hut personal pan pizza type. I digress.

The helpful staff patiently answered my OCD ingredient questions. My kale and quinoa salad was made with fresh sheeps cheese, sunflower seeds, red pepper, grapes and a lemon-pepper vinaigrette.  SO GOOD!

The vegetarian sandwich with harvati and goat cheese also looked delicious, as did a number of other menu items. I will DEFINITELY be back the next time I'm flying through Phoenix! 

Ready to sit through my three hour flight with my belly satisfied rather than about to throw up from a greasy food overload. I arrived at my destination feeling healthy and light!

Oh, and it's worth the walk down to terminal D  for sure!
