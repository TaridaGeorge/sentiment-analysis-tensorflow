I was first introduced to Green through a friend who had her birthday dinner catered by Green and later visited the Scottsdale Road location.  This was over 2 years ago.  Soon after, I learned that Green was opening a location just down the street from my home in Phoenix.  This is by far one of my favorite places in Phoenix.  I have yet to try everything on the menu.  The service is always friendly, the drinks are always refreshing and the bathrooms are always clean.  If you Like Green on Facebook, you can stay up to date with the specials that Green has to offer and at which location.
