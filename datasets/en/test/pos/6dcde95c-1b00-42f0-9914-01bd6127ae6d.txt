Who knew having a wider than normal head would create such problems in motorcycle gear shopping?  After trying on helmets far and wide from Flag to Prescott and up in Alaska - I read the reviews about this shop and made the trip down from Sedona.  It was worth the drive.  Got a great helmet, custom fitted cheek pads to fill the gaps and improve the overall fit, and a communications system installed.  All done with very personable, efficient service.   Thanks guys!
