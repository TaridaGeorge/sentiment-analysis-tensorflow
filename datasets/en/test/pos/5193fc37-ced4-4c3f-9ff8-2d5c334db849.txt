My husband and I have been searching for a good Chinese restaurant in the Phoenix/PV area for years. We have finally found it! We are now regulars. The food is fantastic - delicious with generous servings. The lunch combos are wonderful in taste, choice and price. The wait staff is very nice, accommodating and welcoming. The restaurant itself is very comfortable with large booths. The location is very convenient, and the parking is great. We couldn't ask for a better Chinese restaurant. We are forever customers! Love everything about it. Can't imagine anyone not  giving this fantastic restaurant five stars!
