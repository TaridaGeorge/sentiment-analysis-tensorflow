thhheee best Boba place i have yet to find here in the valley! Enormous amount of flavors and possibilities are endless if you get creative and mix some flavors... you can get it in milk tea form, slush or snow. Also i like that besides Boba they offer the little jelly things as well. they do have a couple snacks to grub on but the drinks are what dominate.

love it here just love it. I stumbled upon it by accident and i fell in love. You know what they say ...love happens when you are least expecting it and not looking for it. :)
