Tuck Shop is rad. The food is great. Laura the bartender is amazing and John the GM is pretty freakin' cool too. The Happy Hour is great with Four Peaks beer specials and my absolute favorite cocktail, the Vivian Ward (named after the famous hooker Julia Roberts played in Pretty Woman). You have to try this place if you're downtown, or anywhere for that matter. Don't miss it.
