What is this place?!!!! AMAZING. My boyfriend took me here and I was blown away. I spent the first 20 minutes ogling everyone's food. The best fried chicken I have ever had and the waffles are insanely delicious. I also love how they serve drinks in mason jars. 

The service is scattered as others have mentioned but everyone is really nice. Our food came out quickly enough and was perfect. 

This isn't a quick place to eat, set aside about an hour on a weekend morning. 

Definitely will be back and it's a shame I don't live closer otherwise I would eat here more often.
