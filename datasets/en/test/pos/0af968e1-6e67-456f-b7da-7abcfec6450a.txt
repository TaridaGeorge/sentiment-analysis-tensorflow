Changing Hands is the complete bookstore experience. What could you want from a bookstore? Well, I want free wifi, I want a place to sit and eat good food, I want all of the latest bestsellers, the classics, and maybe listen in on an ongoing presentation toward the back of the store. This place has pockets of dynamic systems operating between bookshelves. The employees are remarkably friendly and willing to help. There is sufficient book material here so there isn't a shortage of selection. There is a really nice cafe that is connected to the store where they serve decent food.

There's always a lot of events if you want to meet your favorite author who is coming into town. Lots of bargains. This place is very clean and has no weaknesses. Come to Changing Hands and you'll surely enjoy the experience.
