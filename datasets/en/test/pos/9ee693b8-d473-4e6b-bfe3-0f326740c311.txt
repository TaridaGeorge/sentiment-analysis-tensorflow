beautiful hotel, a lot of family noise by the beautiful pool
the room was huge and very nice, the air conditioner system wasn't the best but i would  recommend it, really nice people, entire staff from the driver to the bell boy and a great front desk crew, june 2011, and the continental breakfast was amazing amazing amazing, the best so far
