AWESOME! 
My husband and I lived in Tokyo for a few years, so our standards for sushi are rather high. We tried this place for the first time and immediately stepping in the door, I knew it would be good. From the welcoming "irashai!" from the sushi chefs, to the sound of Japanese banter from behind the sushi bar, and the Japanese customers, this is the real deal. The sushi was fabulous, with many exotic options that are just not found in very many places in Arizona. The sushi and rolls were fresh, pretty, and delicious. This is the best sushi I've eaten in Arizona and we'll be frequenting this neighborhood sushi bar often. I highly, highly recommend.
