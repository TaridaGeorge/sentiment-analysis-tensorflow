New ideas require old buildings and this is the perfect combination. 

I love being in this part of town. It's feels urban, and real. The old warehouses that still exist are beautiful and have so much potential to be something amazing. AmenZone is a perfect example. 

I've never worked out so damn hard in my life but you will not find any weights, benches, treadmills, mirrors or walls of TVs. After the first time I worked out here I went home and could barely walk for about 3 days. During the workout our bodies were moving constantly for about an hour (with a few much needed water breaks.) 

We used our own body weight and a tire to engage our muscles and minds in a way that I have rarely felt when working out. AmenZone has changed my life. I will be going there for a long time.
