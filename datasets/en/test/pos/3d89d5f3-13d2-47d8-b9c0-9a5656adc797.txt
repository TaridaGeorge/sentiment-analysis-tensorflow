First Time I went here the girls made my sandwich (blt) and it was terrible. It was so bad I didn't go back for weeks. I tried it again and got the boys that work at night to make me a club. It was amazing ! Maybe even better then jimmy johns. If you come for a sandwich come at night. The younger guys working are the A team!  Do not get a sandwhich from the ladies working there!!
