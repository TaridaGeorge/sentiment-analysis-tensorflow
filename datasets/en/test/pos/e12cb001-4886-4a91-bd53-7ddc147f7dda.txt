Nothing better than a spring training game watching the Giants with good friends!!  Good food (although a bit pricy, but that's to be expected at ballgames) and amazing weather.  Got a chance to meet Gaylord Perry and get his autograph!

Everyone's very friendly and lawn area is a gorgeous place to hang out at.
