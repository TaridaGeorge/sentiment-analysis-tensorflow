I love everything about this place. The Mediterranean Chicken Salad and Artichoke Pasta Salad are Amazing. What makes this restaurant stand out for me is the Tapas Happy Hour specials. The first place I've found since moving out here that truly understands what tapas are all about; cheap plates of finger foods -olives, cheese, hummus, croquettes- that are meant to be shared. I've seen far too many "tapas" restaurants that charge $8 a plate and lose sight of the entire purpose of sharing food and mingling with friends.
