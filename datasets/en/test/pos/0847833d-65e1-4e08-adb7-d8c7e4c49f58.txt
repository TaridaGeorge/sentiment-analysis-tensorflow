The best burger I have ever had!

Not really sure what they do to a simple hamburger, but I had to try it again just to make sure it wasn't a fluke. Seriously tasty hamburger.

And did I mention the shakes? Whoa!

I do have to stand in line most visits. However, even if the line looks long, it moves very quickly. 

The outside atmosphere is also one of the best points. It's almost like being at a picnic. Just wonderful outdoor seating, with lots of trees and people just having a good time.
