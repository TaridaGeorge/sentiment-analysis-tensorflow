Wow wow wow!! I can't get enough of Zoe's. 
The food here is DIVINE. Completely SUPREME. I love it. My faves:
-steak roll ups
-chicken roll ups
-the slaw
-rice pilaf
-hummus
-they have bomb iced tea.

Plus, you can order and pay for your food online, so if you want to pick it up you literally walk in, are handed your food, and walk out. So easy.

The people who work here are rad too.
