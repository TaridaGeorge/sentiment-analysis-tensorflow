I've been there several times and I don't have any complaints.  We've always gotten our food in a timely manner and it tasted good. Prices are reasonable as well.  I'm no connoisseur of greek food (or any food for that manner) but I did find myself craving a gyro from them on more than one occasion.  I found this place to be much better than another nearby pita establishment.  I'll be going back.
