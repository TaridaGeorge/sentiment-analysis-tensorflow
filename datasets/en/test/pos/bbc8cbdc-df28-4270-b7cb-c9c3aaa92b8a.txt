Thanks, Yelpers, for pointing out this local spot while we were in Scottsdale for our Spring Training trip. Reminds me a lot of some of our favorite ice cream establishments in Denver (Sweet Action, Liks, Little Man Ice Cream) - great quality, friendly people, and they're ready and willing to get you whatever taster you need. I loved every second of my visit to Sweet Republic!
