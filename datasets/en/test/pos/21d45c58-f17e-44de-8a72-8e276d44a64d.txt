I am not the best at surprising my lady with gifts for no reason, I always feel silly shopping in the ladies section at department stores.  So I was delighted to find this gem of a place right down the street from my house.  The owner Beth is great when helping me pick something that my lady will like.  The last time I was in I got her a purse and a really cute dove necklace that was made by a local designer.  The prices were very reasonable as well.  She also does spray tanning, not like my Persian self needs that, but my girl goes there now for her tans.  I love the bronzed look on her!  What is even better is now the owner know her style and is even better at helping me pick stuff out.
