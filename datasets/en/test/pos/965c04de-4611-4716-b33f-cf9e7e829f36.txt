A HIDDEN GEM in Scottsdale.  You have to almost search for the small wooden entrance door, and upon entering you almost feel like youve stepped into some sort of dungeon.  This place is all about wine.  They offer tons of different flights and yummy appetizer/finger food to go along with it.  The setting is almost like a dark basement, with huge plush chairs, and most of the light coming through the dark stained glass window.  This place reeks of sexy and would be a really impressive second date.  Its quiet and romantic and really unique.  Come if you LOVE wine.
