Jess was awesome! I have been searching the valley for a long time looking for the right artist. 

She is approachable, creative, and skilled. She did a great job on my new piece, exactly what I wanted.

The best part, My wife trusted her to get her first tattoo from Jess, and my wife is thrilled with the results.

Not only do I recommend Jess and Lady Luck Gallery, I would insist anyone I know to go see Jess and the guys there. I will be back for sure!
