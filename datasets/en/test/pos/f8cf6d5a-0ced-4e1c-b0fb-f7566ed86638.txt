I love Hob Nobs.  I've been coming here for years to do homework and study with friends while I was a student at Phoenix College.  The owner is really friendly, and so are all the baristas.  Since it is an old house, there are a lot of different rooms to sit in and study, and there are plenty of large and small tables in all of the rooms.  They have really good iced tea, and all of their coffee drinks are great.  I've tried a couple of their sandwiches and some of the sweets and they have all been awesome.  They even have bottled micro brews now, so I drive all the way from Tempe just to come here and drink beer and study.
