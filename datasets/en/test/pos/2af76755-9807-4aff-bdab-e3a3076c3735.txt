Always like this Macy's it used to be The Broadway many years ago. It was nice back then and it is still nice now.  Lots of parking and there is even covered parking in the garage ,great in the summer months. They carry a nice selection of clothes, jewelry ,cosmetics, and household goods.  The customer service is always good. So i really like them and give them a 5 star rating!
