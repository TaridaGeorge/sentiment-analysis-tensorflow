I frequent Indulge and have always been happy.  I never realized what the "& more" part of their name meant until last week.  As often as I go there I did not know they had a catering menu.  I had a small family gathering at my home.  I usually cook or someone brings pizza.  This time we ordered from Indulge.  We did the sliders, wings, salad and appetizers.  Even the leftovers are great.  If I lived closer I would probably eat there every night.
