I had my doubts.
Some family and I had found ourselves in Phoenix somewhat unexpectedly, and when looking for places to eat I turned to yelp. There appeared to be some doubt among my relatives as to the wisdom of trusting people on the internet.

This was not helped when we pulled up and realized that the restaurant is in a strip mall attached to a gas station. Luckily, we went in. We then spent the next hour having not only the best pizza I've tasted in AZ, but some of the most entertaining service of my life.

A real treat.
