This place looks deceiving, but the food is delectable!!  There are SO many options that you can't go wrong with.  Falafel, dolmas, spanikopita, shwarmah, gyros, greek salads, lentil soup... the list goes on!  We tried it once on a whim and were so amazed, we've been back many times!  It has yet to let us down, and the prices are fabulous for what you receive!  I recommend this to ANY Greek food fan!
