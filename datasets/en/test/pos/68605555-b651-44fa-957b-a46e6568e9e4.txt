I really love Sidebar and its random location (above Starbucks and Pei-Wei with the entrance on the side of the building). This is such a cute local spot with great techno/electro music and decor. I love the random cult classic/B-movies that show, too. The drinks are decent and if I recall, reasonably priced. They have appetizers, too, but I haven't tried them. I have been there a few times including New Year's for the upcoming 2009. Everytime, I have really enjoyed myself. There is a diverse group of people and I have never felt that people were snooty or pretentious. For me, those are HUGE turn-offs at any place. I can't say I would make the drive here if I didn't already live so close, but for a local spot, it is sa-weet.
