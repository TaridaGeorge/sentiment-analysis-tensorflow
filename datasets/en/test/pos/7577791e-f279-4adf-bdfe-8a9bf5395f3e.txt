Awesome disc shop! This is by far the best disc golf store I have ever been to. The people are friendly and very helpful. The discs are good prices and they have a great selection. Also if you get some new discs and want to try them out they are right next to a great course with some fun and difficult water holes. Now get out there and throw a disc!
