i like this arena. I went to see a Suns game and there was alot going on in the lobby, dancers, cheerleaders posing for pics, good beer stands, and the news or espn or something similiar is filmed in the back so you can get on tv if you want to stand behind them or just watch all the funny people cheering when the camera guy points and shines the lights on them. A very lively atmosphere and of course, the beloved Suns!
