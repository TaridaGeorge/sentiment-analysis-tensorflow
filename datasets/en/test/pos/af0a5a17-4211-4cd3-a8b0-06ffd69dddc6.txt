Love BWW.  Excellent wings... haven't had any service issues... 

Gets REALLY busy in the evenings.  I was surprised.

One thing that still irritates the crap outta me about B-Dubs is that they allow kids in the bar area.  To me, that's a big no-no.  I go to a bar to enjoy being WITHOUT screaming kids.  But this one isn't the only one that does it... I've experienced it at all of them.
