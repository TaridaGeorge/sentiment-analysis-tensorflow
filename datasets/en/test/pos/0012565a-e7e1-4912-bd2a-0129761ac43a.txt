Was time to have our heat pump serviced last week and I contacted John to come out to our home in Scottsdale. John completed the maintenance and noticed a couple of the electrical connections were corroding and that indicated another component was not performing optimally. John even took some photos to save me from having to join him up on our roof. I opted to have John make the repairs rather than wait to see if the unit would fail since that could happen on a hot day. John ordered in the inexpensive parts last week land completed the repair this Monday.

I highly recommend John.
