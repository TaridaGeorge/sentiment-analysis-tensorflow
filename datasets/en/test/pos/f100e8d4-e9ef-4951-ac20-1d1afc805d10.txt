I had been working out at a CrossFit Gym near my home in Orange County, CA for 3 months when I dropped in on North Scottsdale CrossFit in Scottsdale during a business trip.  

What a great community of friendly individuals who are pushing themselves each day to improve their overall physical fitness.  

The gym is easy to access and has plenty of space.  The class leader Kevin gave specific and tangible feedback on my form and encouragement on my intensity.  

It was such a great workout! I never get that on my own.

I look forward to joining them on future trips to the Phoenix Valley.
