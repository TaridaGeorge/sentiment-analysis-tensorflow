Love Gold Medal! We have been swimming here for the past three months and have seen major progress.  My oldest was afraid of water, he's almost ready to move up a level now and is much more competent and confident in the water.  My youngest was the opposite, not afraid at all and not able to swim at all.  Now she is more careful and is progressing with basics.  Love the "free class" offerings where they let you register for extra classes if there are openings that day.  Wish they offered a sibling discount, but it is worth every penny.
