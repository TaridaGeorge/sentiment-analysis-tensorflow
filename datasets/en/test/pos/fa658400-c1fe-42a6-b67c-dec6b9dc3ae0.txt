My first time here I probably spent an hour sniffing samples and making my selection.  I use their products daily. With any of the herb mixtures, and a piece of meat, you can produce a gourmet meal. I also like the Greek seasoning, Fox Point Seasoning & Garden Salad seasoning, sprinkled on my salad and drizzled with olive oil. My kids have to have the Pizza seasoning on a frozen pizza. I use the Sandwich Sprinkle on my homemade tortilla wraps. The Red & Green Bell Pepper flakes are great in casseroles. 
I did learn one thing from Penzey's- in the past, I used too little of the dried herbs per pound of meat.
If your little ones aren't in a stroller-beware, there's a lot they could get into.
