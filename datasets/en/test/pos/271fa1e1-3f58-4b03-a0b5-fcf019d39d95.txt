We go here every friday!!! Great food! Great drinks and hot staff!

This place is a party every time we go to eat.  Any plain outting becomes one of the funnest nights of the week.  

The sushi is amazing!  The rolls are amazingly, creative and refreshing to have something beyond the ordinary.  Even better when you get the bill and it is half of what you expected.
