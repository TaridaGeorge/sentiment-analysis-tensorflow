Talk about fresh food, and great prices, this place has it all.  When I first tried it, I was a skeptic, but then I had the food and I was greatly surprised by the good taste and quality of the food.  I suggest the Tri Star Mongolian, it was to die for!   Plus, the shrimp fried rice had plenty of shrimp, and was good in size too.  

I order from this place at least once a week, and I can make 3 or 4 meals from one entree.  

Try it, and you will be pleasantly surprised of the value and taste.  :-)
