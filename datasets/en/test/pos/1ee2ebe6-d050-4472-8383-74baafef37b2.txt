I love Sakana's, but I wonder if it is the good food or just all of the good memories that I have there.  It was a hot spot for my friends and I many moons ago.  I really had a nice time.  i like the intimate atmosphere and having tried sushi at Sting Rays, Ra, Kona Grill, Kobe, etc.....I think that Sakana's has always been the best.   

This is my favorite sushi restaurant.
