Very professional and knowledgeable about the industry. I was extremely impressed with the amount of flexibility and options they presented me when I explained the jewelry I wanted manufactured for my online jewelry business. 

I also appreciated that Oren, the owner whom I spoke with, didn't come off as a high-pressure salesman. He was very easy-going and I felt I was able to honestly problem-solve with him about how to maximize my profits with the budget I was working with.
