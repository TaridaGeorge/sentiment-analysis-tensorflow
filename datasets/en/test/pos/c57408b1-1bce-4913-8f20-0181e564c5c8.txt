A great date place. Atmosphere is nice and relaxed. The waiter we had was very helpful and knowledgeable. I had the lasagna which was very good but exactly what you would expect for lasagna. My girlffriend got the sweet potato ravoli which was amazing. We also got the tiramisu which was great. The only complaint I would have is that the bread wasn't very good. It just wasn't crispy or flavorful. Overall, La Stalla is excellent.
