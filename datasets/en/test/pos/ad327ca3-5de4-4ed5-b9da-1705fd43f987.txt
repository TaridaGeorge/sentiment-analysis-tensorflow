Love it here!  Art classes like the mosaic one I took a few years back are great.  The night tours in the summer are really *the* only thing to do in Phoenix during the summer other than the pool!  Luminarias are also *the* thing to do in Phoenix in December!!  Most of the year (except for the dead of summer), the butterfly exhibit is open...a draw for all children and lepidopterists.

Definitely consider joining if you can.  $75 for two people and $100 if you want free rentals of the scooters every time you go...especially handy if you're recovering a debilitating injury!
