Scott is here almost all the time. I've eaten at Scott's since they opened and have never been disappointed. Scott makes the best LEO (lox, eggs & onions) in Phoenix, has lox spread to die for, and is picky about his bagel supplier. I love the knishes and smoked fishes. He even remembers I don't eat meat. This is also my go-to place for a take-out brunch spread.
