Such a great Spring Training Stadium!
Perfect location, the staff are the friendliest people alive, and the concessions are perfect.
There's a great big lawn for relaxing in the sun or under the trees.  There's also the Charro Lodge, for about $70 you can have a spot in the outer field directly above the Giant's bullpen (awesome!!!) and free food, beer, and wine.  Totally worth it!
