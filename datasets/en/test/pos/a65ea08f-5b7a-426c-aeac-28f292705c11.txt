We have been here about 8 times now. Every time we have a great time. THe menu changes all the time, but always a lot of really good choices. 
Last night we ordered the Calamari starter. It was think pieces of cal steak ,lightly breaded and served with shaved bits of carrots and zuchinni. It was very good.
For dinner we had A tatse of China ,which was chicken and shrimp with brown rice(excellent) and I had the Burger with Sweet potato Fries, Another home Run.
 every time good, we are always happy. 
Plus they send out $7.00 coupons all the time. We used one last night as well. Fabulous savings. Clean bathrooms and lots of parking.
