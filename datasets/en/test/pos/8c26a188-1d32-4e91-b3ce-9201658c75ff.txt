Haji Baba is by far my favorite restaurant!  In fact, I fear every having to move from my current residence as it might mean I wouldn't be within a 5 mile radius.  The service is friendly and fast, and they always remember my favorite order.  My favorites by far are the Gyros!  I've never found a recipe so flavorful and moist.  I can't recommend this place more.  If you're a fan of Middle-Eastern cuisine, there's no way you can pass up this gem.
