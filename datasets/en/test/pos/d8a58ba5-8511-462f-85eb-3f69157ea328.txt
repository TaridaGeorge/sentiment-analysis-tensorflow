Holy pa-hey-sesus.  This is the biggest Crate and Barrel that I have ever visited.  The furniture dept is wonderful, I really like their lighting and they have some really nice dining room tables.  The furniture is high quality and the prices are reasonable.  (I think the employees were a little concerned that I was ohing and ahing as I touched the furniture).  I could spend days in the housewares dept.  I love their glassware, cookware and gadgets.  I never visit this store without taking home something!  I would have thrown my clothing out of my suitcase, if I had to, to make room for my wonderful new purchases!  Crate and Barrel, you make this girl very happy!
