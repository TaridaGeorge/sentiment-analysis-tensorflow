Located in downtown Glendale in an old little house Shelley really knows how to make some delicous treats.  It's a very small store, but neatly decorated and has several dessert choices to choose from.  I recommend checking out this place if in the area.

I've had the chance to come here twice since the opening which I believe was sometime in early January of this year.  Each time I got a lemon bar and thoroughly enjoyed every bite.  Made from scratch with freshly squeezed lemons they are simply great.  Never had one better before coming here, no joke!

I'll be back and hope others come check out the desserts that Shelley has to offer.
