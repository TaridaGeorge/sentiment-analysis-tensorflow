The food here was amazing.  Rare to find such high quality authentic food.  I would say don't go in there if you are in a hurry, but I actually found it to be refreshing to not be shoved in and shoved out.  The place is not a chain, which means that it's not going to be polished shined (and utterly crap) but is a place focused on making you great food in a comfortable environment.  The live accordion player was a really nice touch as well.
