San Tan Brewing Co was packed this evening.  My first time here and been in AZ 22 years.  Love this place.  Had the special shaved rib eye sandwhich with beef stew as a side.  It was delicious!  Tried my kids burger and street tacos - they too were excellent.  Had the Gordon Stout which was very rich and smooth.  Would recommend this place for regulars and vacationers alike.
