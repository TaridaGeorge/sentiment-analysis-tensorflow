What a gem! This is legit Chicago style! It brought me back to my childhood. We were thrilled to see Panzarotti on the menu. We haven't seen that since we lived on the south side. We ordered a sausage panzarotti and a stuffed sausage pizza. Positively delicious! The sausage here is top notch. Best I've had outside Chicago. We have some places in Vegas that do stuffed right, but their sausage doesn't compare. Little Sicily will be a must whenever we're in town.

We went back on Sunday anxious to try the thin crust, but they were closed. We were heartbroken. Can't wait to return in spring to check it out.
