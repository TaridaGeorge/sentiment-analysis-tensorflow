One of my favorite places to hike, trail run, and ride my bike. There is so much variety on the mountain - easier trails, more difficult ones, and longer and shorter options. 

My husband proposed on a hike on South Mountain, and we took our engagement photos there. It's a beautiful place to spend time, and it's typically not very crowded when we do.
