Found a deal through Veebow app for a free training and orientation with Phoenix, a trainer there. Awesome. What a work out, and he helps you with what kind of foods to eat. Definitely get the free training session from the Veebow app if your looking for great tips and work outs. Just ask for Phoenix, he looks like a trainer.
