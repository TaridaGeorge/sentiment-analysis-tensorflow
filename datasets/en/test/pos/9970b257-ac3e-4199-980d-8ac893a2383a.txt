Oregano's is always a great call! I could eat there every meal, every day of the week....but try to do so sparingly because of the downfall for my diet. The prices are not bad at all and they have 1/2 portions for everyone's appetite. If you are in a hurry...they also do very efficient takeout orders. Also, the servers are always very animated and helpful. Thanks Oregano's for many years and many great meals!
