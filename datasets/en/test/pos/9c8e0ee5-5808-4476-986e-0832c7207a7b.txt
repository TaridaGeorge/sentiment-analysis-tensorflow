Not sure this place needs yet another 5-star review, but I can't help it. It's my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. The patio (especially at night) + atmosphere of the historic house are beautiful. And the salad, pizzas, and desserts are so delicious. My favorites are the Omero salad (or the Pear, also great), the Funghi pizza (although the Margherita is simple and tasty too), and the Fresca dessert. Only negatives are the lack of reservations and somewhat long wait if you come around 7-8pm. Totally worth it though.
