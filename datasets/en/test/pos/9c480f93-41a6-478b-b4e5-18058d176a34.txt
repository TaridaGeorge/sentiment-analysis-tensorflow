I had a great experience.  All I went in for was a cleaning and a check up, and I received personable service from the entire office staff. From the girl at reception to the hygienist, to Dr Boyse, they were all thorough, they made me feel like I had been a repeat patient, when this was only my first visit. I look forward to future contact with Smiles at San Tan Ranch.
