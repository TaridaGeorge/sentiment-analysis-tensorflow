WOW...another GREAT meal at Girmaldi's
We tend to end up here at least once a month when the craving for pizza is upon us.  Marla (manager) ALWAYS goes above and WAY beyond to make sure our visit will keep us coming back.  This trip was no different than every other one...!  The pizza is GREAT and they always get it 'right'.  
So the next time the pizza crave hits you....head to The Quarter to Grimaldi's and tell them Van sent you...See Marla and give her a GREAT BIG hug from me!
Prop's to Lucas for joining the management team headed by Brad!!!
