Seriously one of my all time favorites in Scottsdale. Consistently good steak (please tell me you'll never go to grain fed bland beef) and equally great people watching in the bar. If you get some time or are hanging with friends, grab dinner in the bar while the piano man sings. And you must simply get the mashed potatoes - they are amazing. Additionally, they have a great price on Caymus Conundrum.
