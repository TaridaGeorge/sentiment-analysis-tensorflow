I live for the Gyro Salad. Always make sure I eat at Eden's when I'm in AZ. This last time I went for lunch. I skipped the lunch specials, which are a great deal: pita sandwich, side and drink for $6.99. My mom got the Chicken Gyro, which she was freaking out over. It's very good, and used to by my lunch go-to, but again, I can't deny the power of the Gyro Salad, extra yogurt, please :)
