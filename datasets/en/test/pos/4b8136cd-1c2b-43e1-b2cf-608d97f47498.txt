After nearly six years of homeownership, an electrical problem: Bad dimmer switch for a bank of kitchen lights. Called GGE late Wednesday night, hoping to leave a message... and Mike answered. We set an appointment for Friday morning, with the caveat his arrival was dependent on the arrival of a repair guy for his own issue. He arrived an hour after our set time, but he kept me appraised with calls during the delay, which was considerate of my time. Once here, he swapped out the dimmer switch almost immediately and the price for parts+labor was fair: $82 (service call of $64). Mike was friendly and professional, so no complaints from me,
