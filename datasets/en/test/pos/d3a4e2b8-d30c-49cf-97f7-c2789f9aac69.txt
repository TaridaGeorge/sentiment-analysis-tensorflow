I have never fallen in LOVE with a piece of jewelry before I saw Debbie's work. Now, it has happened 3 times, and I felt like each of those pieces were made just for me. I love the vitality and energy of her work, I love that every piece is a one-of-a-kind original - unlike anything you will see from any other jeweler.  I always get big compliments every time I wear one of her pieces. The prices are incredibly reasonable for 100% handmade jewelry. Every order I placed was delivered quickly, and Debbie is an absolute pleasure to do business with. If you want an outstanding, memorable gift, or something truly unique for you, The Spirit Box is the best find around.
