great food & drinks.  service was very attentive & helpful with food allergy concerns as well.  BACON popcorn!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I had the sangria & my hubby had Lost in Translation.  both tasty.  Hubby had chicken & waffles, I had chopped salad & we split a lamb burger.  No dessert this time, but we'll be back!
