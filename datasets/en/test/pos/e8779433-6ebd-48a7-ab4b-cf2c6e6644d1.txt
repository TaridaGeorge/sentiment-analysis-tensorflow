Went to NoRTH this past week with friends, and our server Jody could not have been better - thanks Jody! The food was super yummy too. Check out the burrata appetizer- it's amazing! The gnocchi were little pillows of heaven, and the sea bass was good, but I actually liked the veggies on top of it more! How fun is that? We had a couple bottles of an Italian wine too, and that was all the better when we asked for stemmed glasses instead of the short glasses that they usually use. We'll be back sooner rather than later.
