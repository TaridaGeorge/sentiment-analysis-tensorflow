Long time favorite of my family's.  Go there for all special occasions.  The croissants.... oh the croissants.....

Everything is delicious, but I LOVE the black bean soup.  Before I became a vegetarian I always used to get the grilled rack of lamb...  My brother loves egg in a hole.....the corn ravioli is to die for.  Basically, you can't go wrong.  And Vincent, the chef- is a gem.
