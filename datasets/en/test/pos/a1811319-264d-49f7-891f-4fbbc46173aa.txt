Four Peaks is the reason my BAC was higher than my GPA while I was at ASU. 

I've been here countless times and only have positive things to say!

I already knew (as most of us do) that 4 Peaks has awesome beer, but I was excited to discover their food is just as good. My favorites are the nachos, chicken enchiladas, and the veggie pesto pizza. The servers have always been friendly, and when I had my birthday dinner there last year, they did a great job accommodating 15+ people.

By the way, my friends make fun of me when I bring this up (even though they all agree), but 4 Peaks has the BEST water I have ever tasted.
