I recently made a move from San Diego, CA to Phoenix. A friend suggested I use Horizon Moving Systems, as they had a wonderful experience when they moved from Phoenix to San Diego. 

This is the most professional moving and storage company I have ever worked with. My doorways were protected, floor coverings were laid out, and the crew was excellent kind and conscientious. 

I have them storing some of my stuff for a few months and they even let me come over and pick a few things up that I needed urgently.  I will recommend Horizon Moving Systems to anyone looking to move.
