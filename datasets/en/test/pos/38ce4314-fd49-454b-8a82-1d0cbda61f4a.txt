ummm yes.  They had Dogfish Head's Midas Touch in stock.  are you kiddin.  No sir, im not.  

This may be called "another house-turned-pub" in downtown, but its those houses that MAKE downtown phx a decent place.  Walking up to this place, it feels like you are walking into a house party in the hood.  But it had a great local funk & jazz band playing with top notch craft brews available.  Its cozy yet loud, its quaint yet urban, its house jug wine, yet top shelf.... this is the best of the house-bars that i have visited in phx.  better than Rose & Crown... better than Roosevelt's.... it rocks... 5 stars...
