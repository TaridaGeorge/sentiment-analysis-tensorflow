I don't know how many of you have discovered Canyon Lake, and perhaps I shouldn't tell you about it because there are enough people up there as it is...but it is the best kept secret on the east side.  If you are fortunate enough to own a boat...going up this canyon is like being in a mini grand canyon with it's majestic views.  I unfortunately don't own a boat anymore, but must tell you it's worth buying one to get to waterski and fish on this resevoire.    If you don't own a boat, try Dolly's Steamboat for a romantic evening cruise up the river...they serve dinner, but you don't have to pay extra for it, you can just take the ride...  I like Saguaro Lake too, but Canyon is spectacular.
