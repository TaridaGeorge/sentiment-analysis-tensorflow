Love this place - from the service to the amenities, it is awesome.  We've stayed there twice now.  The rooms are big, beds are super comfortable and the price is reasonable (go on hotwire and ask for 4-1/2 stars in Scottsdale).  There are only two 4-1/;2 star hotels, this one and the intercontinental (which is also nice).  They have a great live band on the weekends - we even bought their CDs.  The bar extends to their patio w/lots of greenery, etc.  The pools look fantastic and so did the golf course, although we didn't get time to play this time.
