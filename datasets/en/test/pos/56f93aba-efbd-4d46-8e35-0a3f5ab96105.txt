Luv it. 

Swivelled myself out a mix of chocolate and mocha fro yo....topped it w/ treats from gleaming buffet: chopped snickers nubs, brownie hunks, butterfinger crumbles and ghiradelli syrup.  Marshmallow creme bottle cleverly reads: "mayo---not!"  

Slick, white, modern decor and quality ingredients make you feel less guilty for pretending to be an eight-year-old for a moment.  MWAH!!!!
