An entire grocery store (ok, it's more like a 7-11 in size) Gluten Free? Sweet!

This place is great.. lots of products. They also sell alternative items such as dairy-free stuff. They have a lot of kits for everything from baking muffins to dinner stuff like Hamburger Helper-style kits.

I HIGHLY recommend this place and hope they get the support they deserve. 

The staff is SUPER friendly, helpful, and engaging. GO HERE AND SPEND MONEY. :)
