I love Bookmans.  It's one of the best sources for used media that I have ever been too.  Overall, it might be the best.  I've never seen a better selection of books, records, Cd's, video games and magazines in one place.  You'll even find collectibles and cassette tapes.  

The Mesa location has the benefit of the cafe with wifi but I do like the Phoenix location a bit better.  I've made better scores here and the DVD selection is more impressive.  Don't let that detract from the Mesa store, however, as it still has much to offer and is still an awesome place.

A trip to both stores would make for a fun day browsing used books and records.
