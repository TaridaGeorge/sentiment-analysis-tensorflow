Another Sushi bar run by friendly Koreans. This one though, is a step above the others.

The chef (and owner I think) Paul, was incredibly friendly and explained how he uses only quality ingredients - especially in the reasonably priced and delicious small sashimi platter ($27). You can tell that quality is important to Chef Paul.

The Happy Hour specials (every day 3-5pm) keep bringing us back for the $5 rolls - Salmon and Shrimp rolls and $3 large Sapporo are our favorites.

We also tried the baked scallop cheese appetizer ($8)and it was simply sinful.
