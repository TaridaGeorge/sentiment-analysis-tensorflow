I love it here. Before moving from California, I came down to AZ for a week and looked at over 15 apartments and it came down to San Palacio and San Cervantes. San Palacio is more quiet, we have the biggest pool of all the Mark & Taylors complexes. The staff here is friendly. I love the apartment. We have a comer location in the shade with the playground view. You only hear the kids during the weekend which I don't mind. I like the sound of kids playing over drunk teens with loud music. We're here for a year so we'll see what happens next.
