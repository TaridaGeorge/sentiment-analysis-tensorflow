Yup. I'm jumping on a very full bandwagon: The Old Town Farmers Market is gloooorious. Love love loved it- including the live music and the many adorable doggies of course:)
Came home with "watermelon radishes," deep purple cabbage, cauliflower that looked like it had stars growing on it, and some of the most amazing seedy bread i've had the pleasure of nibbling on. 
All in all, this is how I've decided every Saturday morning should be welcomed. 
Hope the Old Town Farmers Market grows even more!
