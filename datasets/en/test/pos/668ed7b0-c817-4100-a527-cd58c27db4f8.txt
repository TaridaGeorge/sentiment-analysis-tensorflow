Great east valley sports bar! Have been here once with friends who are regulars there, and can see why! Tons of TVs in a newer, clean sports bar! The wings are pretty good, not the best, but well above average, and the beer specials rotate - always including a 32oz mug for 3 or 4 bucks. They also have shuffleboard and a highly addictive golf video game.
