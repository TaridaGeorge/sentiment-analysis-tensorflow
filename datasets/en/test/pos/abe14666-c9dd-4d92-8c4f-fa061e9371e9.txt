Damn you Quizno's. Your sandwiches are so good. And oh so fatty.  

I can't stop eating the veggie sandwich.  It's by no means healthy, but it's exceptionally delicious.  It's loaded with cheese and some kind of oil based dressing that is sure to have 20 grams of fat per serving. 

And then of course I have to get chips and a soda and by that time, my calorie intake is probably in the thousands.  Jared would never dream of getting the veggie sandwich, but I do.  When I want low-fat veggie sandwiches, I go to Subway. But when I want a delicious veggie sandwich that meets my recommended fat and calorie intake for the day, I go to Quizno's.
