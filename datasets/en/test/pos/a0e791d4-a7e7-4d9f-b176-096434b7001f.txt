This is an amazingly good Vietnamese restaurant! I've been to four or five different ones around the valley and I can say that Pho Chandler is by far the best. I particularly recommend the Tomato/Crab Soup (P9 on the menu). It's unreal! Also, any of the fried rice dishes are awesome. My wife always has the Seafood Pho and loves the real crab meat.
The staff is very friendly and prices are excellent. Can't go wrong here.
