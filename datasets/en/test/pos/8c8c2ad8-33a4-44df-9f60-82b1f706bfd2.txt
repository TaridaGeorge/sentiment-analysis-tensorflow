My friend Steve turned me on to this place over a year ago, and Chan's unPhogettable is, for me, the final word on Pho in the valley.

The portions are incredible, the staff is so warm and friendly, and the Mekong Market is always a fun place to shop after an extremely satisfying meal. 

Tip: TRY THE VIETNAMESE ICED COFFEE. There's a ritual to it, which is half the fun. The other half is DELICIOUS ICED COFFEE.
