During the lighting it seem amazing..like a heaven on earth. I am animal loving person so it drive me crazy when my companions are zoo animals.  This zoo is definitely better than The Brookfield Zoo, The Lincoln Park Zoo, San Francisco Zoo, The Bronx Zoo, The Tampa Zoo, The Fort Worth Zoo. I am also a member of zoo and go there most frequently.
