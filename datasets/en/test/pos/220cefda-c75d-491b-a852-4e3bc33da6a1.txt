This was the first place the boy&I went to when we went to AZ! Ohhhh my goddddd I love Fry Bread, and they make it delicious here! We got the green chili chicken fry bread, supreme Indian taco fry bread, and the butter/chocolate one. Ohhhh emmmm geeeeee so good. So unhealthy, but so delicious. I regret nothing!!!

Green Chili was definitely my favorite... I want some more now :( The butter/chocolate fry bread is SUPER rich. I don't know if I'd get it again, but it was yummy! Hopefully I can make it to AZ sometime and try the other ones...
