We had to go to the west side of Phoenix and that was just the excuse for another dinner at Pappadeaux.

This time we were there in the middle of the week so there was no wait for a table.  

We went the same route on the appetizers with alligator and oysters.  No sense messing with perfection.

The hubby ordered the Chilean Sea Bass.  Expensive but fabulous.  I stole a couple of bites and it was cooked to perfection and seasoned just right.  Heavenly!

I wasn't very hungry after appetizers so I just had a bowl of Lobster Bisque.  HUGE chunks of lobster in there and so warm and satisfying.  This will be my choice from now on if I'm not feeling super hungry.  

Pappadeaux definitely has my vote as the best seafood place in Phoenix.
