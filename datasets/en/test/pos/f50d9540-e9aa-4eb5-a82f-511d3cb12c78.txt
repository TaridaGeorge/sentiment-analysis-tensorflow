I was having trouble finding someone to come out and take a look at our AC unit - my home warranty company said the soonest they could get anyone out was in two days.  Not okay, considering it's 100 degrees out and I have a baby in the house.  I called AccuTemp and they had someone at my house within the hour.  The woman who answered the phone was very friendly and understood my situation, and Ken, the technician, was superb!  He found a few other issues in our unit that four previous contractors had not seen, and I'm very grateful to him for pointing out these issues that could lead to future damage.

I was very impressed with AccuTemp and will continue to do business with them in the future!
