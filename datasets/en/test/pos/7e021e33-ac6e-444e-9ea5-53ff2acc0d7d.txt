Like everyone else in phoenix feels that's been to postinos, the Monday Tuesday $20 deal, is unbeatable. Which is exactly why you'll be waiting around for at least an hour on those nights. But when your looking to go on a nice date or double date this place provides the perfect atmosphere, great wine selection and bruschetta your whole table will be raving about all night. I never knew I was such a big fan of Fig until I tried the Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpon. You will never find me here without getting one of those. Every soup that I have tried here has been fantastic. This place is a must for every person living in the valley.
