My new favorite restaurant is Roma Garden Ristorante. When my boyfriend was looking  for a place for us to eat he ran across this location, hidden in an unassuming strip mall so many people could easily pass by this place and not realize what they are missing. Fantastic place to eat! Lighting and omnibus beautiful. Workers are always friendly and helpful, and most importantly food is great. If you want great Italian do yourself a favor and head to Roma Garden!
