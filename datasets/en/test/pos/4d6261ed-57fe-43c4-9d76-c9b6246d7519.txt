Melinda knows what she is talking about when she discusses how to train my maniac of a dog. I've received her help many times about issues with my hyper active canine and she's quick to give me tips that I can easily do and they have always worked. She loves the animals she works with and gives them specific training instructions to their own needs. Keep it up Melinda!
