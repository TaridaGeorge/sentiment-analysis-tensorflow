I have only been to Cornish Pasty twice but both times it was fantastic. The first time I shared their signature pasty, the Oggie, and the second time I got one the Veggie Spicy Asiago. The Veggie one was so awesome I ate the whole damn thing and that's a lot of food!! They also have an awesome beer selection. The only semi drawback is that they take awhile to make.
