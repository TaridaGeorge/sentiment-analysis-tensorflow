This is my very first review ever, and Hillstone's definitely earned it!  

I sat at the bar, the ambiance was amazing,  best of all my server/bar tender couldn't have been nicer! I ordered the tuna sashimi salad, it was delicious! The tuna was so fresh, it melts in your mouth, yum!  

If you want an amazing dinner, and an amazing ambiance, then head to Hillstone you will not regret it :)
