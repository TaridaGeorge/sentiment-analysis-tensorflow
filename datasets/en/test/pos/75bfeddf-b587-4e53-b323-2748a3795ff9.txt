We've been taking our kids here for a couple of years now. The Dr.'s, hygienists, assistants and staff are all SO GOOD with our kids. The prices are fair, especially since we don't have dental insurance. The waiting room makes kids relax, as it is all train-themed, with lots of toys and a huge train on one of the walls. We've had nothing but great experiences here!
