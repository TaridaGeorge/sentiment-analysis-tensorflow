I just went here for the first time for a late dinner last night & loved it!

The parsnip soup with pine nuts and golden raisins was wonderful! 
Very light and creamy without being too rich. 

The salads were very tasty but not among my favorite items on the menu.

The duck with a huckleberry and german spaetle. I LOVED IT!! My friend had the lamb and that was also very good! 

Blue Raspberry cotton candy was presented after the meal which was a nice treat but being the foodies that we are we still went for dessert! I had the coconut mango meringue dish which was very refreshing and flavorful! My friend has their homemade donuts with raspberry, caramel and chocolate dipping sauce with a vanilla shake.  All worth going back for often! 

Service was attentive but not over bearing. 5 Stars!
