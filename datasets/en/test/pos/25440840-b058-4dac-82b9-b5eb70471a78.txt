Great random find in my hotel room entertainment magazine! The space itself is art studio meets one bedroom loft. High ceilings, floor to ceiling windows, lots of space but cozy at the same time. The menu is simple but the coffee is quality. Cinnamon sugar scone is a must!

Staff is really friendly! Got a great tip from a staffer to check out a boutique in downtown PHX which was a great find! This place just has a great vibe and definitely one of the highlights of my weekend in Phoenix.
