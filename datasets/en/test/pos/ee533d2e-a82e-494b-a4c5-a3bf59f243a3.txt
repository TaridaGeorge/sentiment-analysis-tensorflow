I'll miss the $1 loyalty cup refills at Harkins, but that's about it.  UltraStar is my new go-to theatre in the Valley.  It's clean, the StarClass theatre seats are ridiculously comfortable, and they serve all kinds of amazing food and beers!  I could go on, but you really should try this place for yourself, immediately.
