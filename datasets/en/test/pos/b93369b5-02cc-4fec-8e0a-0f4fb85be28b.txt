Zipps is my favorite sports bar and grill in town.  Food, drinks and service are great!  Happy hour specials offer reduced prices on some menu items.  Ambience of this location is warm and inviting.  I especially love their medium golden wings and cookie skillets.  It is a great place to meet friends and watch games on many large TV monitors.
