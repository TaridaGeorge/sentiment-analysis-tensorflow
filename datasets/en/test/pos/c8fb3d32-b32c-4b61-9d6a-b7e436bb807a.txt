The food tastes amazing. I don't want to know how much butter they used to make my waffle, but I sure made it disappear. The staff is intelligent, friendly and efficient. There is sometimes a wait to eat here, but they have a waiting list and try to get new customers in quickly. I have eaten here twice this school semester (it's very close to the ASU downtown Phoenix campus) and I keep talking new classmates into going back with me. The ingredients are fresh and very high quality. No wonder they were featured on Food Network's Diners, Drive- ins and Dives. Yum! Try the omelet, it's my favorite.
