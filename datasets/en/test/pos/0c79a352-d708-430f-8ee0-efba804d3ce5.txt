I have come here twice now and never have I been to a breakfast house that got the orders out quicker! Both times it had to be less than 5 mins and we had our food! So cool. The food is really good, restaurant decor is nice, and they have a full coffee bar located inside so you can order premium drinks. I like it!! :)
