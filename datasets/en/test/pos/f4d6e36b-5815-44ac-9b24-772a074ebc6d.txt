Defalco's is a family favorite! they make handmade pizzelle cookies that are amazing! they don't make them often but when they do my wife will buy all they have.  While she was pregnant, she asked if they could call her anytime they made a batch, and they did!  This place is usually incredibly busy yet quick to take care of the customers.  So for them to take the time to give her a call and let her know about a desert was impressive.  We take friends here anytime they are in from out of town.
