Phoenix is LUCKY to have In-N-Out(s). Moving out of the LA area meant that we didn't have an In-N-Out nearby. Problem solved!

Most importantly - The food is consistently fantastic. Don't go to some other guy's place for a burger. Go here. 

Important backup information:
- CLEAN, CLEAN, CLEAN. Oh yes, the tables are constantly cleaned by their staff. Did I mention the bathrooms are spotless also?!
- Helpful Staff - Great hiring practices at In-N-Out because the staff is friendly, quick, efficient, and well trained.
- Secret Menu - I mentioned the great food, but checkout the secret menu at their website: http://www.in-n-out.com/secretmenu.asp

Fun and quick place for a fantastic burger.
