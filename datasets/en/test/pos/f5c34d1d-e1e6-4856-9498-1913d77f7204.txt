I really enjoy Zinc for dinner, but their lunch menu is amazing! They have a crispy duck sandwich that I absolutely crave sometimes. Their Zinc burger is also very good and the fries you can get compliment both meals very well. 

I do enjoy the dinner menu as well. I would suggest ordering the iceberg salad which comes with bleu cheese and then adding crab to it. It might seem out there, but boy is it worth it.
