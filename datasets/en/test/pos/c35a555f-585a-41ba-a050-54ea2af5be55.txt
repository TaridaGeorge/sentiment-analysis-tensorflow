I love Cyprus Grill because I love lemon.  My 3 favorite things are:

Greek Fries - French Fries with feta cheese, lemon sauce, and seasonings.  They're freaking spectacular.

Fried Calamari - You can get it by itself or on a salad.  The calamari is fried light and crispy.  Never gummy/rubbery.  And of course you get to squeeze fresh lemon on it :)

Avgolemono Soup - A lemon and rice cream soup.  It's scrumptious.

So if you're in the mood for a little citrus zest with your meal, I highly recommend you make a trip to Cyprus!
