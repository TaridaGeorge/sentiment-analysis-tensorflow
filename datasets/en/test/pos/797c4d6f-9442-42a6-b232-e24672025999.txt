The AJ's GRILL at THIS Location ROCKS!! They have something that differs them from anyone, and that is STEPH behind the grill! For about $5 you get a delicious, good quality, perfectly cooked to order hamburger or turkey burger. It is a little bit of a drive (for us) but it is a  well worth one and it's not unusual to see Hadden and me there! You must try, I promise, you'll be hooked!
Also, conveniently it is part of AJ's so you can run in and grab a drink, sides or dessert...
