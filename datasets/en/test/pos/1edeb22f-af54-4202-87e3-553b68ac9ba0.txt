I want to buy everything in this store! Walking in you're instantly greeted by an earthy fragrance, and smiling faces galore! The employees are so helpful here and are always so excited to show you how to use their new products! It's very tempting to spend all my money here, especially on their new "Dirty" line for men! 

I use the Coal Face Wash on a daily basis, and I LOVE the Happy Hippy and Flying Fox body washes, and basically anything Karma scented! And they also have a shower bomb that is designed specifically for those days when you're hungover and need a quick wake up call in the morning!
