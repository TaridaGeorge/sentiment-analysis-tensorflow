I love this mall, it rocks...i love the Neiman's Store, the BeBe outlet, the Nike outlet, Saks outlet...I used to like Group and I just found out they have a Victoria Secrets outlet-wow. The crowd is a bit rough but its a really neat choice for shops. You can smell the yummy pretzels walking by as they have good fast food spots also.
