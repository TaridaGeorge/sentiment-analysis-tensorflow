This place is super cute lunch joint.  I had the sloppy joe special and it reminded me of a home cooked meal back in the day.  I ended my meal with a classic vanilla milkshake which was superb.  Oh yeah!  if you're in a hurry for a quick good sit down lunch, this place is it.  our food came out SO fast.  I will be returning shortly.

You also MUST check out the vintage clothing/ furniture in the room next door before you leave !
