I came home and there was an extra $13.97(U.S.) charge on my credit card from this joint.  Is this a racket?  Did I not prepay some kind of Occupancy Tax for the Rez?  

My charges upon checking out were:
NY Times, Arizona Republic, bockkle of orange juice = $5.25 x 2 

(I woulda drunk up a storm at the nifty pool-side bar, but it's Arizona and I gotta drive places, baby.)

Well I talked to Kristie in accounting (who must have a cool job, if you're going to be an accountant why not at a resort?) it was some kind of computerized mini-bar malfunction, she tells me, and zip--it's off the bill.  

I appreciate this kind of service.
