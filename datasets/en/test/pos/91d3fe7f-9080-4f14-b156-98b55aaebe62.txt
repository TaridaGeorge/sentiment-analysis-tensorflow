I used to stop in here often when I lived off of 19th Ave. and Osborn [before I became a suburban Indian and moved east. There's lots of neat doodads here by local artists, in addition to implements of gardening, the occasional plant or seed pack, and outdoor fixtures. I love my dragonfly door knocker which I got here!!! They also offer gardening classes. So stop in and get something to beautify your life--or at least your yard.
