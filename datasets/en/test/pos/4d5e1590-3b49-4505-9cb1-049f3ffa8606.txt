I do not get to go to the Herb Box often enough, I love it! I think it is the perfect place to meet friends as the atmosphere is laid back and cute. Their lunch menu is great though I only order one thing every time, the veggie and hummus wrap without cheese, which is their happy something or other salad in a wrap form with hummus so surely that salad must be fantastic, too. I don't know how they do it but it is exceptional, even with seemingly simple ingredients. Their sweet potato chips are amazing and so are their crispy edamame. I love their variety of iced teas and could quite likely eat there every day. It is a bit pricier than my typical lunch but for Scottsdale and for the quality of food it is a great deal.
