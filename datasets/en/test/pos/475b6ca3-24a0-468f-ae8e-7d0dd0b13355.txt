Wow, just realized my reviews were never finished... So, this is from a year ago at Thanksgiving.  Haven't been back, but would definitely try it again.

We just returned from a delish meal at Wild Thaiger, after reading all the great reviews.  I'm happy to say it didn't disappoint!  We had appetizers as well as dinner, and everything was sooooooooo tasty!  The presentation was pleasing, the portions outrageously large, and the service exceptional.  Granted, we did have the place pretty much to ourselves (being the day before Thanksgiving...).  Still, it was a great experience.  We'll definitely be back!
