I love Charlie's. 

Now that I've gotten that out of my system, I will repeat how much I love Charlie's. The drink specials are awesome. I don't come here for the liquor, though. I come here to have a couple cold beers and dance. The small pitchers on Sunday are just right for the end of my weekend. 

The best part about this place is the crowd. There is no pretension, just a bunch of regular guys and girls there to have a good time. Everyone is friendly and I've never had a bad experience. 

I've been to the Charlie's in Vegas as well and had just as wonderful a time. If you ever come across Charlie's wherever you may be, go in and say hi! You'll be glad you did. Now, ride 'em, cowboy.
