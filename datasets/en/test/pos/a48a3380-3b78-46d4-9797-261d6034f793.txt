Shortly after my plane landed we headed to Chompie's because we saw the Man vs. Food challenge. 

We ordered the Reuben sandwich to split and a Jewish slider.
Man was it enough food. 

The classic reuben was delicious to say the least.
Pretty sure I had the best fries I've ever had as well. 
The slider was very very good 

Please go to Chompie's.
