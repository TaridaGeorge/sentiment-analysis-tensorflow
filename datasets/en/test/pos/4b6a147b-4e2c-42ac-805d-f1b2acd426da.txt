I have taken my car to Gab for multiple issues over the last 2 years and he has always been just wonderful. As a woman, trips to the mechanic are always less than fun but he was honest with me, always gave me a fair price and would always take the time to explain to me what he had done to my vehicle and show me the parts he replaced, etc. I would recommend this place to anyone. Many of my coworkers use him as well and I've never heard a complaint from anyone. His shop has saved me a time or two for sure!!
