This was my favorite Nursery in the area. Sure you can find plants at places like Fry's and Home Depot, but this place Rocks! Beautiful Displays, lots of color choices, a full selection of desert trees and shrubs, vines, perennials, annuals, pottery, cacti, as well as house plants. You can't come here and leave empty handed. It is a well run, leader in the Garden Center Industry.
