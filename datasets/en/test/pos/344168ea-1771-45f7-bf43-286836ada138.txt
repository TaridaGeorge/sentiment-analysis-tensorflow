If I can ever be as good a hostess as Thomas is, I'll be happy (and have dinner parties every week).

I already love FEZ, so there was never a question that it would be a great night.  I'm sorry to say I didn't try anything new, because the lure of my old favorites was too strong.  Well I take it back, I'd never had that wine (Hob Nob?) before, and it was delicious.

thanks Thomas, and I can't wait for the next one.
