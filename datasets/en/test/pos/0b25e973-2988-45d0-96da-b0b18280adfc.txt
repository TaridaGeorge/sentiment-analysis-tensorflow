I have attended two classes at Blissful in the past week.  While vastly different classes, both instructors were in tune with the participants, guiding them in their practice while helping us to maintain postures.
The hot yoga was wonderful and hard work, the yinyasa was a more reflective class that concentrated on opening specific parts of the body.  I will be attending more classes there in the next two weeks as they have a two weeks for $25 offer; all the yoga classes you want to attend for $25?  Now that is blissful!
