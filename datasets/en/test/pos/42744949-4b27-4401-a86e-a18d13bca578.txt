I really loved this place. As a country girl at heart, I loved the band and that I was able to dance with my honey. It was also cute to see the families out dancing too. The food was good. I had the prime rib which was good. The horse radish was super hot! My husbands ribeye was delish but my daughter swears that the beef ribs were the best she has ever had. There is a beautiful view and I can see why this place is so popular. I am already looking forward to our next visit.
