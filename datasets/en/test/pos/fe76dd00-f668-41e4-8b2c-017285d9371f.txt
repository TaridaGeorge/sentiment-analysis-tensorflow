GREAT American restaurant. Has the atmosphere of a nice steakhouse, but it's menu is much more diverse. Best appetizers: the grilled artichoke and the skillet cornbread, hands down. You get a ton of food with both. I always get the burger, and it's pretty good. The fries are really thin and crispy--so thin that I didn't think I'd like them, but I did. A lot. Their rotisserie chicken is good too--you can see the chicken roasting on the spit through one of the side windows of the restaurant. The only downfall? The water glasses are really really tiny. It isn't a huge deal, but as a big water drinker, I feel bad having my server come to refill my glass 19 times throughout my meal. Good thing the service is so nice!
