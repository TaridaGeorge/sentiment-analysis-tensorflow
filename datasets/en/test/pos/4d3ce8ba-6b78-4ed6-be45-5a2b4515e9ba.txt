I am blessed to have a Sunflower withing walking distance of my salon and another within bike riding distance of my house. I love this place! I usually get my lunch from here a few times a week and it fits into my budget nicely. I usually will get a cup of soup and have never been disappointed in the quality and tastiness. Today I had their homemade meat lasagna for the first time and boy was it good! The produce selection is wonderful with great prices and there is a wide selection of bulk items. I am a cheese fanatic and like the wide array to choose from.  There herb and vegetable plants are usually 2 for $5, a very inexpensive way to start your own garden. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable and I have even special ordered essential oils from here.
