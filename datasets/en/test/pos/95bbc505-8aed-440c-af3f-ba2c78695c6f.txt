I have been coming here for 6 years or so. The main reason I keep coming back is the cleanliness. I have gotten pedicures, manicures and brow waxing done here and I have never been disappointed. The friendly staff are always smiling and professional. If you're looking for an affordable, clean place to get pampered, then this is the place.
