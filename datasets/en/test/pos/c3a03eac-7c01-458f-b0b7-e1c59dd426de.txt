Went here for the first time a few weeks ago and it was some of the best BBQ I've had in Arizona. 

The service was great as well! The manager stopped by a few times as well as our waiter to make sure everything was good.

*****UPDATE***** 
Looks like they went out of business. Haven't been open for two weeks now.....
