This place is a dive, but the food is terrific and cheap. Still working my way through the menu, everything I have had is worth ordering again. Forget that quaint little scottish burger joint or the King of Burgers - get your junk food here - might take a minute longer, but it is worth the wait. Get their sweet tea, while you wait...
