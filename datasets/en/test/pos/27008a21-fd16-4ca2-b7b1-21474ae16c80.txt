Fine dining isn't very popular in this day and age. Most of the time a server is hired on their looks and on how well they can coax some bro into buying pitchers of bud light. 

Durants is the pinnacle of fine dining in Phoenix. Straight up classic steakhouse fare, from oysters and crabcakes to filets broiled to perfection. Take a cab or come with a DD, because they have the most knowledgable bartenders ever. The only place where I can order an old fashioned and not feel like a jerkoff.

Save room for dessert, so far I've had the creme brulee, ny cheesecake, and tiramisu. All were excellent! Enter through the kitchen in the back, and tip your waiter well, these people really bust their ass to provide great service!
