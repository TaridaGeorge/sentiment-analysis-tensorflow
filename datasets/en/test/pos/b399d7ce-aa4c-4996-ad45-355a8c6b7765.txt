This is one of my all time favorite stores!

Sephora has one of the best return policies that I know of (besides Nordstrom and Bed Bath and Beyond). If you are ever dissatisfied with any new or used product, you can return/exchange at any time with no questions asked. They will give you samples of anything you want, and will always apply makeup for you in the store if you ask. I really like this location because it never gets crowded, and everyone is friendly and very knowledgeable about all of the products. 

My only complaints are that the lighting in the store is terrible, and that they don't carry too many brands of hair care products - for that go to Ulta or even better www.folica.com.
