I was in town for a conference and a girlfriend and I needed to get out of there for some nail love. We found Elite Nails on yelp (*thanks all reviewers!), called to get a time and the owner managed to squeeze us in somehow.  He originally said they were booked but he had a cancellation and immediately called us.  We headed over and were greeted at the door like old friends!

They use OPI which thrilled us and we were each handed a sanitized package of equipment, and I'm always thrilled by great cleanliness at a nail salon! Had a great manicure/pedicure.  We mentioned the reflexology place next door (owned by the same folks), and were offered a discount and walked over.  I will absolutely return here every time i am in the area.
