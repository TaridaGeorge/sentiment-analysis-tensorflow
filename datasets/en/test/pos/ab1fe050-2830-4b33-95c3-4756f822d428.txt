Loved it!

We had the El Jeffe wings.  They smelled divine and tasted even better.  They were fresh, hot and flavorful with a good dose of heat!

I also love any place that has fresh hot tater tots...so I was a sucker for those.  They were great along with the Candlestick carver.

It's on Groupon again today!
