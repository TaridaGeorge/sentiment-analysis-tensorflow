I love the dresses and house furnishings here  and the girls at the register are real nice and helpful. I always find something good up by the register like special flavor tea tins, bling mousepad...the prices are sometimes high on clothes since its all designer so it may be a 2500 dress marked down to 450 but it will be a beautiful dress.
