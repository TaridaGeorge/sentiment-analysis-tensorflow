I love these little diner style places!  I would always rather give my business to a local than a corporation.  I stopped in here last night and grabbed a Fiesta Burger with cheese.  It's a big burger with 2 grilled green chilis!  OMG! This is not 1st date food!  Burger juice and ketchup dripping off your chin and running down your elbow is not attractive unless you're into the whole 9 1/2 weeks thing....

I didn't order anything else, because I didn't want to have that miserable "Thanksgiving full" feeling, but it all looked great.  They were dropping fries, spinning shakes, and had a variety of tempting pies in the display window.

Great food.  Great price!  Love that you can get breakfast anytime, too!

Oh yeah!  They'll now let you use a debit card for a $.50 fee.  No more worries about not having cash.
