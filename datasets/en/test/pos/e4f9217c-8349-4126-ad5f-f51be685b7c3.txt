We recently bought a bedroom set from Maddies. The price was excellent, the quality was excellent, the delivery and set up was excellent. We picked the model that we wanted along with the stain color. We did have to wait 4 weeks for it to be built here locally in Phoenix. I like the idea that they are employing local people. 99% of the furniture we looked at here at various stores is made in China.That is a turn off.
Maddies was great!
