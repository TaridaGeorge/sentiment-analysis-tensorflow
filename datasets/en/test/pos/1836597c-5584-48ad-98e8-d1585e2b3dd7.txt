Wow,what a fun place for great deals on Happy Hour food and drinks The bartender Andrew is top notch, never missing a beat in seeing our drinks refilled and questions answered. We are newbies with sushi and it showed. He was patient and helpful yet still tending to a slammed restaurant and full bar. The Tempura Shrimp was tender and delicious. Our California Roll was great and the edamame was tasty. We love the music pounding, hearing a lot of our recent and older faves. The patrons all looked happy and relaxed. Could have been all the Sake bombers goin' around! All in all, we'll be back! Our tab was so cheap we can go twice a week!
