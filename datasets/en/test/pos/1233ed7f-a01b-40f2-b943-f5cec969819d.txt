Don't let the strip center location at Thomas and Scottsdale roads fool you, Noodles Ranch serves outstanding, fresh Vietnamese food. I've been going there for over a year now, at least twice weekly. I always order the crispy egg rolls with fresh greens. Yummy, yummy, yummy! I never seem to get sick and tired of it. 

The Pho soups are all delightful and full of flavor. I can honestly say, after eating nearly every item on the menu, you can't go wrong with a majority of the dishes. The Jasmine iced tea is also a winner. Plus, the owners, Andre and Noel, always come by and chat. Noodles Ranch is a winner!
