This is my new favorite restaurant.  They feature a giant single slice of pizza and a soda for 5 bucks. And when I say giant, I mean giant!

The Pizza is new york style with a hint of heat in the sauce. Great stuff. The Wings are also excellent!  My Wife loves their Calzones as well.

The store is nice  but too small.. so days at lunch you can't get a table, but hey, if that's the only complaint they are doing something right!
