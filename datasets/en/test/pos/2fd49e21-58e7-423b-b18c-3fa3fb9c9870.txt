Love, Love, Love this store. I could spend every last dime I have in here organizing everything in my house. This store has stuff I would have never even thought of! It is such a fun store for people who love containers, organizing, or just unique items. I have completly reorganized my linen closet with stuff bought from here and it is fantastic. They are very friendly and helpful as well. Prices are ok, a little high but the stuff is really good quality.
