We love coming here!!  The food is a little on the pricey side for what you get but you never leave there feeling like you "over did it".  It's pretty much like a soup and sandwich place but during dinner they serve more hot meals.  If you've ever had Panera Bread, I would compare it to that.  I love the fresh ingredients that they use and the breads they make daily.  They've also got a pastry lay out and they are too die for (ESPECIALLY the cheese danish ... YUM!)  My favorite lunch item is the almond tuna sandwich with butternut squash soup (a Pick Two meal).  Service is decent and they are almost always busy.  It's in a relatively large shopping center so parking isn't a problem unless you go at peak ... but you'll just be parking a little further.  ENJOY!
