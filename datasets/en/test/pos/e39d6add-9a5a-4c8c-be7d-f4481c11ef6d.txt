Ok so Im new to Gelato and really want to get to love it more and more especially since I found out that its lower in fat than Ice Cream!   Happen to see this place while checking out Tempe Marketplace and so in the mood for sweetness. They have many of your typical flavors, pistachio,banana, but what caught my eye was a Mexican chocolate one, it was quite diffrent, but very very good, it had a hint of cinnamon and some chipotle chile to it, Highly recommend you try it some time in your life.
