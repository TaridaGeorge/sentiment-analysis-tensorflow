Yelp was a big contributor to my recent visit to Phoenix. I skipped the traditional breakfast place in lieu of a stop at LGO.  I see what the fuss is about:  fresh stuff and interesting menu choices in a cute yuppified setting with lots of eye candy.  I had fruit and the "famous" english muffin.  The fruit was good but I was underwhelmed by the muffin.  Burl Ives had some good-lookin' crepes.

I probably would've bumped this down to four stars because of the enormous crowd at 9:30 on a Saturday but I experienced LGO magic:  a parking spot at the front door and a table for two the minute I needed it.
