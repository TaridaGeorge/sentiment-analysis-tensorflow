Wow! I've been waxing for years and since moving to the north valley I needed a new place to go. I learned about European Wax center from a friend and thought I'd give them a try. I had Melissa and she was amazing. She was very professional and gentle. The whole process went very quickly as well. The ladies at the front did educate me about their prepaid and membership options they offer however it was not pushy in any way. The prices are very reasonable. They have a referral program as well. I will definitely be back. Pre-booked my next appt already.
