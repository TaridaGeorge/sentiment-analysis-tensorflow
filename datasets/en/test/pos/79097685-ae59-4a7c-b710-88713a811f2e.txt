Love this place.  Just had lunch there for the first time today and if you are looking for a fresh variety of wraps, then this is your place.  I had the All American wrap which had turkey, ham, different cheeses, avocado and a delicious dressing.  I wanted the Thanksgiving wrap but didn't have time for the required nap after eating.  I highly recommend this place, very nice owners who aim to please.  Affordable and nice atmosphere inside.
