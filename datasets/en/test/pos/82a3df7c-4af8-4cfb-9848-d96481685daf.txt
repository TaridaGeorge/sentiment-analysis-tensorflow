This park is beautiful.  My little boy is obsessed with train, so this is heaven for him.  We ride the train, then the carousel and after playing in the playground we visit the model train museum.  They have so many model trains in this air-conditioned area.  My kids go up and down the different aisles.  It is a great  and inexpensive way to spend a morning or afternoon with your kids.
