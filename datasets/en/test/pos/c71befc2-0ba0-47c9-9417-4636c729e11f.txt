Cheba Hut's "toasted" theme and winking titles wouldn't mean nada if they didn't deliver with their goods. The menu is huge (and just got bigger), and the toasted subs are overflowing with fresh-tasting ingredients. There are many veggie options if that's the way you like it.

Unlike the big chains, Cheba's employees seem to be having a good time and are always up for a chat or a joke. These guys made getting a study break sub an awesome experience. They've usually got good toons on and occasionally The Simpsons or Family Guy, not to mention decor that can catch your attention like you're...well, you know. 

Stay open later guys!!!
