Just when I think I have had the best burger, I get to a place like the grind and prove myself wrong! This is not a bad thing though! 

I usually go for the simple, regular burgers in order to put the meat up front, but the waitress recommended the sweet and spicey burger. Thank you thank you thank you! Best burger I've had to date!

French fries were good, but a lil too sweet for me.

Mac and cheese is the tits!

cheers
