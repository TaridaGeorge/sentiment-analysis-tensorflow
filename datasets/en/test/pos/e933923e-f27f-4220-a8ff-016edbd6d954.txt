Amazing. No menu; chef prepares a 3-course dining experience that you won't regret. There was one choice for the 1st course, a nice sizes salad; two choices for the main course, and a dessert. When you call to make reservations the chef personally speaks to you to find out if you have any food allergies or dislikes. Intimate setting, great atmosphere. BYOB
