We finally found a contractor who does what he said he will do, when he said he would do it and his work was flawless. Very happy not only with the completed job but with the progress, updates, workers attitude and friendliness and the craftsmanship shown. Arizona Rainfall took a bare dusty backyard and turned it into a showplace for future gatherings. Integrity started at the top with the President Gary Hines and continued through every man on the job. Highly recommend.
