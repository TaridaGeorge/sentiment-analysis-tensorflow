Probably some of the best quality sushi in the valley! I loved how quiet and not busy it was. They had plenty of rolls to chose from and the prices were not outrageous, they were actually cheap for such good fish! The flavors were good and the bill was $50 for 3 people to order 9 rolls!! Crazy good!
It is definitely not somewhere to drop in quickly bc it does take a while to get the food to the table. Perfect for a night out with friends or a date to talk without being rushed or bothered.
 I will definitely be back as soon as possible!!
