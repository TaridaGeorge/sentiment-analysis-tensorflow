Personally, when it comes to sushi, it doesn't get any better than Sakana.  Service is amazing.  Ray brings life to the the small restaurant.   The food is simply, yet varied.  We keep returning for the different special rolls each week.  Price is very reasonable, especially compared to other sushi bars.  Make sure to sit at the bar, the chefs have great personalities, AND DON'T FORGET the real wasabi!
