I love Costco for multiple reasons....Number 1, the ever changing products, every time I go in, I am excited to see what is new. Number 2, the big container of already cut up mango. I love mango, but who can cut one up? Number 3, the great wine prices, I only wish I could afford to buy more. Number 4, the gas, it is always cheaper there. There are a lot more reasons...but I'm just giving 4 for now.
