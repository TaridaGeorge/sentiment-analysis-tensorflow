I absolutely love this place! The food is excellent, the eddie burger and meatball sub have been my favorites so far. The chilli cheese fries are incredible, and the onion rings are awesome! You can tell a lot of love is put into this food, and if I go out to eat I drive 20 minutes out of my way to go to Rocket Burger. Absolutely love this place, and the soda selection is incredible!
