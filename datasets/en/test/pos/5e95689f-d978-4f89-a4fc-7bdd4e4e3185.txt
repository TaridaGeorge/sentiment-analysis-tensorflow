I've been going to Luke's in Chicagoland since the 70's. I happened to be in the area and thought I hit it for lunch. The place was mobbed, I got the last parking spot (sweet). I ordered an Italian Sausage sandwich with red sauce, small fries and a regular drink for $10.23. Finally, a place claiming to be a Chicago place that actually knew what red sauce was. 

The Italian Sausage was grilled and delicious and about 12 inches long on a perfectly fitted bun (now I know why lunch was over $10). The fries were crunchy and good as well. I recommend the Polish Sausage sandwich and beef sandwich as well, had those a couple weeks ago.
