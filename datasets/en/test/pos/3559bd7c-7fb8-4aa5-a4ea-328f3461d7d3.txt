What's not to love? Whole Foods is a great destination for all things food. Grocery/Dine-In/Take-Out/Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner/Desert/Coffee/Alcohol.

Whole Foods is my "healthy lunch standby" during the work-week. Either eating it there, or taking it back to the office - it's simple. The prepared food section at this location is superior. Copious options of tasty, fresh, nutritious morsels to please your palate. 

To copy Schwarzenegger: I'll be back!
