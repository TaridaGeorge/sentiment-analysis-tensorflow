This is the best food ever. Great for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The Zuchini and sweet potato fries are amazing. The best portobello mushroom burger and best regular burger. Fontina Burger all the way. Joe grows his own ingredients mostly and you can taste the freshness of the ingredients. Highly highly recommended. Great atmosphere and you can also walk around the place for fun. When you sit outside and eat, it seems like you're in a whole other village.
