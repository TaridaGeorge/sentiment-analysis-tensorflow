Comfortable and friendly, Java Worx is a great place to hang out if you somehow find yourself in Anthem. I had an espresso. On Fridays they have an open mic with music and comedy. Everybody was cool. They served free salsa and chips. The day I went, there was a thin crowd, but apparently it can get busy during the open mic, which is from 7 - 9. Great staff, beverages, and patrons.
