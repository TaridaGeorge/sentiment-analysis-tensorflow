Flaming Kabob is one of the few things I miss about living in Mesa, AZ.  The BEST chicken kubideh I have ever had!  I just can't find anything to compare (even in the DC area where I now live).  I always got the rice instead of the french fries because it is sooo flavorful - tastes like they cook it with chicken stock and the golden raisins they add to it just makes it delish.  Upgrade to the greek salad for a $1.  The mango smoothie and hummus are also to die for!
