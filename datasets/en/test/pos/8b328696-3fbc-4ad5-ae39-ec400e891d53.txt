A friend once gave me a list of reasons to enroll at MCC, the first of which being "Cheba Hut is right across the street!" 

The subs are amazing. I'd tell you what my favorite sub on the menu is, but all that would end with is me giving you a link to their menu. It's ALL good, even the vegetarian stuff (and I don't usually LIKE vegetarian subs).  And then there are the munchies. Oh god, the munchies are awesome. I'm personally a fan of their goo balls (a giant ball of PB covered rice krispies with cocoa and honey) and their hemp brownies. 

On top of that, everyone who works there is pretty much made of win.
