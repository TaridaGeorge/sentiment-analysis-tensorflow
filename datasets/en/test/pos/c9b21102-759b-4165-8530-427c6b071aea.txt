This was the first time I had been to Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, the food lived up to the expectations I'd heard from others.  The portions were good and the items came at the right time.  I did not feel rushed in any way and our waiter, Jimmy, did an excellent job answering every question we had.  I tried their special house dressing Rimaloud(don't know how to spell it) which was a kind of spicy creamy dressing, which I highly recommend.  My steak was cooked exactly to order and melted in my mouth, one of the best filets I've ever had.  

The restaurant was very nice, the type of place that you'd visit on special occasions, worth the entire experience.
