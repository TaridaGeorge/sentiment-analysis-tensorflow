As I can't stand Sprinkles cupcakes (might as well be bread), I've been on the quest for a while to find the best cupcake for me in Phoenix. I'd say MOB is number 1 right now!

I originally got some of these as a gift and loved them so much I had go back to get more. They can be fairly pricey - but I will say their cupcakes are pretty large and sometimes I can only eat half in one sitting. 

I didn't really have the customer service issues everyone else is mentioning - I had a nice, 20-something girl who helped me with the my two Groupons that I came in with. 

Will definitely go back again - maybe even today! :)
