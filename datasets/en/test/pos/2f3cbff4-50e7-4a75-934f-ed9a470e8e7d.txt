We went here tonight with another couple for the first time, and we were all very impressed. We will definitely be back! I can't wait to try the daily specials in the future. Our chicken kabobs were tender and just the way I like them. The prices are fair, and you get a lot of good, fresh food for your money. I am happy that this place is right down the street from us. How lucky we are to have this jem in Ahwatukee!

It would be nice if the restaraunt had plain yogurt on hand for those of us who like to eat this kind of cuisine with it.
