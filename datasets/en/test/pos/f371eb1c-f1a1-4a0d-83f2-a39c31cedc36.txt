Papago Brewery is awesome!  The beer is very good and so is the food. Their individual pizzas are big, defiantly  enough for 2 or 3 hungry people to share.

 I had to try the infamous Orange Blossom which was very good. Although the Orange Blossom was very good I prefer a beer that has some bite to it. They had plenty of beers on tap probably about 30? Next time I go, I plan on grabbing a growler or two to take home!
