I love this place! Breakfast is always huge no matter what you order & there gravey is homeade. Sooo good the hashbrowns are my favorite here they are crunchy on the outside & mashpotatoe like on the inside. I go here as often as possible. Very homey feel & the waitress&waitors are all great! Oh & the drink glasses are HUGE, the bring you a togo cup without you having to ask.
