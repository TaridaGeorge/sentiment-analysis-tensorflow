My family has been going to the Breakfast Joynt since shortly after it opened.  The food is much better quality than any other breakfast restaurant in North Scottsdale.  The service is also very good.  One of aspects is they have a few 'light eaters" options.  You can get an egg, bacon, toast and hasbrowns for $4.95!   I am never disappointed with the food.  In addition, I am very particular on my coffee and this restaurant has high quality coffee.  It is also nice to know you are supporting a family run business and not a large corporate chain.
