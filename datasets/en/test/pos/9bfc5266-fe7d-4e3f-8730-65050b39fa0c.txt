An authentic landmark just down the road from the vapid consumerism taking place at the Fashion Square.  The selection is superb, my only complaint being their slow inventory renewal process.  I typically come in for my stalwarts- Dublin Dr. Pepper and Dr. Tima Root Beer- but I always leave with a few new bottles to sample.  

A great spot that even Ms. Pussy Katz, of Flakes fame, would approve of.
