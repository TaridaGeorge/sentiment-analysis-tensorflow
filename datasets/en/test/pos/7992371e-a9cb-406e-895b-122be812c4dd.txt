Love, love, love this spot! Great food options but my favorite item is the Breakfast Buzz! It's a blended iced drink with espresso, protein powder, peanut butter, banana and several other ingredients. It's basically like a meal replacement shake and tastes amazing. I'm addicted now!
Great coffee shop/lunch atmosphere and very very friendly service. There's a drink thru window available as well.
