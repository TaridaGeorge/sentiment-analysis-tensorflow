This was worth the ride on the Metro Rail. I get the Triple Burger with Cheese. Ohh man its greasy and the meat is fresh. I love the fries i can never get enough. I never had a shake but they seem to be made with Real Ice Cream. Doesnt take to long to get your food even during the Lunch Rush. Employees are polite and funny, joking around with you and the other employees.
