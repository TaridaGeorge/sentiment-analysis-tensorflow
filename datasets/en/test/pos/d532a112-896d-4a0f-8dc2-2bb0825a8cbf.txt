I came here for food truck friday a few weeks ago. It was delicious! I got to choose all of my toppings for cheap- no $1 extra here or there. I love that their dogs are in the flat bread they use, it's yummy and more efficient than a bun. I'm willing to go out into the phoenix heat for these hot dogs!
