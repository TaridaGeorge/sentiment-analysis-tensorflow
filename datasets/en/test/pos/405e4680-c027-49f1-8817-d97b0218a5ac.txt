Although the selection is fairly small, this adorable little gem carries some really great brand name items.  I spent $40 and walked out of there with a fabulous turkey cutting board (which accounted for $10 of the $40) and clothes from Lucky, Anne Taylor, Talbots, and Nine West.  I would not go here looking for a specific item, it is more suited to browsing and seeing what treasures you can find.  The price is definitely right at $4.00 per item (unless specially marked) and the condition of the clothing is significantly better than that found at Goodwill.  The icing on the cake here is that the proceeds go to Halo Animal Rescue an organization which I have since learned does AMAZING things.  The women who run the thrift store are kind and pleasant and make you feel right at home there.

 Absolutely loved it and will return again soon!
