Went here last night for the first time in years. I used to hang out all the time here when I was younger. It was packed by 1030. Great music mostly top 40 and hip hop..no techno yay! Good looking crowd and not as pretentious and the rest of Scottsdale. Everyone had a blast..dancing everywhere. Friendly crowd. Reasonably priced drinks for Scottsdale. I cannot wait to come back. Patties still has it!
