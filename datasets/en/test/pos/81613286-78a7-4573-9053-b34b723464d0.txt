I'm a regular at Pane and can honestly say I've never had a bad experience. Visually beautiful and home to the BEST caprese sandwich you will ever have. They always have their signature sandwiches and pizzas but the menu changes daily -- something I love in a restaurant. The food is fresh, produce local, and bread made in-house. They sell beverages in glass bottles and if you take your food to go, they supply a homemade caramel. There is nothing about this place I don't love! Especially the fact that it's located next to Lux -- so you can stop in for coffee and dessert or a cocktail afterward.
