I lost my Greek food virginity here and I was quite alright with that.

Got the greek fries and the patty melt. And of course, a few draft beers. This place is such a little hole in the wall, you don't realize how big and open it is until you're inside. Watched a world series game here on a saturday night with my neighbors. Our waitress was so pleasant and such a sweetie.
