I met Susan at a St. Francis event. There she took pictures of my Grandbabies Albert and Lacey. I took a photo of each one of the dogs and Susan turned it into a purse for my daughter for Christmas. My son-in-law loved it so much he wanted a wallet with the dogs on it. She does wonderful work. She is an artist. I am so proud to know her and her wonderful work. She helps rescue groups with her photography and in my eyes she is a wonderful person for doing that.
