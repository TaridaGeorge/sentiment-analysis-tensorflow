Absolutely adore this place. Matts' serves the best breakfast in downtown Phoenix!! I usually order the special which is always amazing!!  The toast  is delicious with their organic preserves. The homefries are also yummy. I love the local vibe. The owner is always friendly,  and greeting you with a big smile! Stop by and you won't regret it! Can't wait to go back!!
