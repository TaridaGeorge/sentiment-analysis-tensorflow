How can you not LOVE a burger place where everything is FRESH! No freezers and a burger only costs $2!!!!

This location is great. They have a drive-thru that goes very fast. Often they have a person waiting to take your order instead of yelling it into a speaker box. 

For a combo meal you can get a cheeseburger, fries & diet coke for $5 and some change. 

The restrooms are clean and the service is very fast. There's plenty of parking & after you eat lunch, walk over to Yogurtland or Starbucks for dessert.
