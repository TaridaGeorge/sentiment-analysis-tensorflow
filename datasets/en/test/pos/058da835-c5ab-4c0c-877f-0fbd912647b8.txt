I WISH we had a Yard House in the Bay Area!  It's soooo good!  First off, they have every kind of beer imaginable on tap.  Seriously, I think they hold a record for how many different kind of beers they have.  Don't let that sway you, this place isn't some local pub or anything.  

It has a really posh, sophisticated atmosphere.  The menu is BEST PART!  They have a range of things to order from your favorite kind of burgers and sandwiches to amazing asian/latin fusion dishes! Happy hours are a great time to come for apps and cheap drinks! Cheers!
