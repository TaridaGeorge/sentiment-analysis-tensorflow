The sushi was very good. It was fresh and well presented. We also ordered the tuna tartare.. The dish looked great and I asked the woman (who appeared to be the owner,server etc.)  if they had any rice crackers. She mentioned that they use to serve them but they typically went to  waste. Well, three minutes later she appears with a plate of wonderful crackers.  Terrific customer focus.
