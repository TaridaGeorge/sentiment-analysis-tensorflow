I ha e been coming here for about 6 years (before they were even at this new location) and have always had excellent service.  I had several medical problems (sleep, knee, back) that other doctors offices couldn't seem to help me with.  Paul (the physician I regulary see) if he can't personally help, he has spot on perfect referals.  My life has been completly changed since coming here.  I never seem to have problems getting an appointment, and unlike other places I used to go to there is very little wait time.   I have sent friends and family here, and all have left happy.
