This place is all about customization and fresh ingredients. They have a newer house blend they call WAKE UP and it really does! What I like about their standard coffee is that they have different blends, so that you're not stuck with the flavor of the day, but rather if you like a milder cup of coffee, they'll get you what you want.

The owner makes a lot of the breakfast pastrys too. When you can get it, the Pineapple Upside Down cake is delicious.

They have music on weekend mornings and FREE wireless access.
