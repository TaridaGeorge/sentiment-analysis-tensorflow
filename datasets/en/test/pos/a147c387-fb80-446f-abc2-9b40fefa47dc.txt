Love love LOVE this place!  A few years ago when I worked at Sky Harbor, they were one of a VERY few places that would actually deliver to airport businesses, so that was awesome.

When not working and stumbling along Mill, you can't go wrong here.  The staff will laugh at your drunk ass, but put up with you reasonably well.  A few seats outside and a bunch more inside. Shitty parking if it's late on a weekend, but if you're picking up (what I had to do as I personally lived outside the delivery area) you might luck out and catch a spot as a delivery driver is leaving.

I still have my punch card (only needs one more  til my free sub!) for the next time I'm in town...I only hope they still take them whenever the hell that  is!
