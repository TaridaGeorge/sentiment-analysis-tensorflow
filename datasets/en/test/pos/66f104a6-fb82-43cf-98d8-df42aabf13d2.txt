More than church, its family.

Biblically sound and effectively delivered inspired messages from Pastor Terry.  But what makes this a great church are the people who care and are warm.  There are currently two campuses, one in Scottsdale and the other in Mesa with several services on Sunday and one Saturday night in Mesa.  The service is dynamic and worship uplifting.  You always leave better than you came.
