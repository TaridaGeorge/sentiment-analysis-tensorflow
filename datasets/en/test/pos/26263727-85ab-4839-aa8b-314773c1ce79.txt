Let me just add my own rave about Postino's. There isn't anything I can add that hasn't already been said about the wonderfulness that is the bruchetta. I come for the bruchetta and $5 wine on Saturdays and just love, love it. I am always looking forward to the next time I can get up this way. 
And now that I hear they are opening one in Gilbert later this year, life is going to get just a little bit better.
