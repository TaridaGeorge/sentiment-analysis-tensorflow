The PERFECT Breakfast :)  If only I could have this every day :)

Matt's is all you want a breakfast spot to be...cute, friendly and the most amazing food out there.

I highly recommend the hog and chick.  You just can't go wrong with eggs*, bacon*, home fries* (get the home fries, not the hashbrowns) and their toast* served with Terra Verde Farms preserves.  * = best ever, ever, ever

I could write on and on...you've seen the reviews.  Just make sure to make it there, you won't be sorry, you'll be addicted!
