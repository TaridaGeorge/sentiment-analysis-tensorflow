Revisited Pagago last Monday evening for A Beer Education class w/ Ron Kloth, Cicerone & owner.  What a great time.  The class was designed mostly for beginners but I found myself learning new things from the first moment. Those little details, explained diferently than I would have done.  I learned as much about public speaking as I did about beer. Afterwards, sitting with a few Craft Beer reps. from World Class Beverage was just as educational. Want to learn more about beer, from it's early origins to down to whats hot this week? Papago Brewing is your place. Cheers.
Ps. Racer 5 & Samichclaus on Tap, WOW.
