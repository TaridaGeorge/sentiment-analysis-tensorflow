I've been coming to the Wild Roots Salon for a few years now and have always had Isaac cut my hair. He has always done a great job and is also a wonderful person.  I recently tried to make an appointment though and found out that the number has been disconnected.  I haven't driven by yet to see if they are in fact closed but there was no forwarding number so I'm incredibly bummed. Guess I've got to find a new salon.
