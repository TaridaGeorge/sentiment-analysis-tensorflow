For our anniversary dinner, my boyfriend and I couldn't ask for more than this exquisitely styled, unbelievably delicious restaurant. The pizza was wood-fired, flavorful, and downright gorgeous, and getting to sit all night on their light-studded patio was a dream. The real kicker, though? Mozzerella, the enormous white cat who casually prowls the property, making friends, taking naps, and maybe getting to nibble a calzone or two. He sat on my lap all through dinner, moving to my boyfriend's for dessert. For cats and pizza, I couldn't recommend a better place.
