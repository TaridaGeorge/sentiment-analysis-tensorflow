My family just adopted a 7 month boxer/pit mix stray dog that is the best dog ever. I always shop at Bark Avenue pet supply. The said Dr Orr and Dr Rice were really good. I brought Max to Dr Rice for his shots and he and his technician got on the floor, talked to him and gave him his shots so quickly he didn't know what happened. He was so gentle and good with Max. I wound up with Dr Orr for his neutering. She was wonderful as well. She came out and met us and talked about how well everything went. Max actually walked up and really liked her.  You can't miss with either of these veterinarians. They are great!
