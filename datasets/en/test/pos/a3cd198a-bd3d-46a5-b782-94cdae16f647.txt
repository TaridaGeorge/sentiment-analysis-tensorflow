We went for the first time today and we were thoroughly impressed! It was a late Tuesday morning so there were only a few other customers present. The staff was very friendly and the decor creates a great atmosphere. Great food selection to choose from for breakfast. I had the caramel banana pancakes in multigrain and they were the best pancakes I've ever had!!! My mom got the veggie scramble with potats and really like it. My husband loved the french toast and thought the cinnamon roll was pretty good. 
We are so glad we found this breakfast spot and will definitely be going back!
