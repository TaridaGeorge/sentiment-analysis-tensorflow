Came in to Jimmys tonight and sat at the bar and immediately was approached by the owner who kindly introduced himself and his wife, I felt completely welcome. I started off with the Caprese salad (delicious) and then topped of with a sausage, onion, and jalape√±o pizza which also was amazing. The owner and his wife made me feel so at home and continued the conversation through out the night. I will most definitely be back soon!!!
