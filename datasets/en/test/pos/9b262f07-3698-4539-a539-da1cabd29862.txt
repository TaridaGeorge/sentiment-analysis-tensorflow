If we are within a 30-mile radius, even for a few days, my husband get cleaning done here.  It's kind of ridiculous.  But they do a great job.  The prices are a little high, but I guess you get what you pay for.  I trust them with my cloths.  That is saying a lot.  I have tried other cleaners in the area and have regretted it as I cried over ruined items.
