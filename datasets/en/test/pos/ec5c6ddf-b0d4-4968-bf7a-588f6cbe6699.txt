Dick's Hideaway has become the ritual brunch for a few of us who've taken up running weekend 5K's every few weeks. 

Is there any food substance in the state of Arizona that's tastier than the chorizo used to make the breakfast quesadillas here? Maybe a slice of Bianco's Wiseguy pizza. That's about it. As I sat here yesterday for brunch, I remarked to a friend that I couldn't wait until our next brunch here to have that quesadilla again, before the one on my plate was even finished. She felt exactly the same way. 

Did I mention the breakfast happy hour special of $5 bloody marys and mimosas? The bloody's come with a free shot of beer. 

Best breakfast spot in town, hands down.
