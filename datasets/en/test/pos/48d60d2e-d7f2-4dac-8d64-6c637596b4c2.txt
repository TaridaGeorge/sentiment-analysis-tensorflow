It's not that the sandwiches are particularly unusual or unique, but they are nicely sized with good ingredients on quality bread.  The patio is great this time of year and set back enough from Camelback so that you can actually have a peaceful retreat.  It can get busy at lunch, so I sometimes call my order ahead and it saves me time upon arrival.
