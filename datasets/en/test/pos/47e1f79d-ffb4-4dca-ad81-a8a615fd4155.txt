I love this place!!!!!!  Sushi is shipped fresh everyday contrary to Jon (fag) N's dumb....ahem excuse me..... uninformed review. The douche probably works at RA.  I have eaten sushi my whole life and I know what fresh sushi tastes and looks like.  Place is absolutely great and the staff gives awesome customer service.  Reverse happy hour gets u hammered for cheap which is a plus in my book.  Anyways...to all u haters out there, don't rip on a restaurant just cuz you are nitpicky, overly critical customers that expect everything perfect.  KUMPIES FOR EVERYONE!!!!!
