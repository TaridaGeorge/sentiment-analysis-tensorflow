I dont live at Shade but I teach Yoga and Pilates at Shade.Mark-Taylor is a great company. The actual "shades" are a very cool concept. I love that there is a Starbucks a pizza place and a Walgreens right there. They are across from Desert Ridge mall how convenient! I love the location of North Tatum. Its far from the bustling crowd yet close to everything.They have a great Yoga room , one which is separate from the gym so it is quiet. The property is very nice and I love all of the colors they chose.My husband & I plan to possibly to the Shade next year.
