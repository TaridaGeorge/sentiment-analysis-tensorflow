Lucy is a talented artist/painter - I have seen her paint portraits you would swear are photos, and murals so realistic its like looking through a window. IF you have an artistic painting project you need to consult Lucy first - from clouds on the ceiling, to a mural in your restaurant, or a portrait of you and your classic car. Lucy is fun to work with and very reasonable for her advanced level of artistic talent.
