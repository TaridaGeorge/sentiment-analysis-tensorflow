Free books, free movies, free mags, free wifi, comfy chairs with foot stools, self checkout, drive thru pick up and drop off, coffee, very separate children's area...ahhh....true love.  

First off, the building is gorgeous with a zen-like front outdoor sitting area complete with the sound of running water.  It's open and airy, and just a relaxing place to be.  The set up is great - children have their own area with plenty to look at and explore, while adults have their own place to study or enjoy a book in some peace and quiet.  Definitely my favorite Scottsdale library, and yes, I've been to them all.   

Note:  You may want to avoid after school from around 3:30 - 6:00pm....those kiddies from across the street can get noisy, giggly, and sometimes obnoxious.
