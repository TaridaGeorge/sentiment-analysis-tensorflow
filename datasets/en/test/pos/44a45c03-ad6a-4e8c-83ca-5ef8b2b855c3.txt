The place is clean and the donuts are very fresh. I am a fan of their muffins. They use plenty of walnuts on the banana nut muffins! I bought a batch for the offcie and I was the hero of the day... just that day (Lol). From my observation though, they are pretty busy so you better get there early if you want to have a good selection. Nice staff too!
