Another of my favorite winebars (which is hundreds of miles away). I used to hang out with work friends for "happy hour"; the great part is we would drink and talk for hours and never once felt rushed to empty the table. My absolute favorite dish is their caprese sandwich and potato soup...the potato soup is cream, perfectly made, and full of flavor!
