Love this place and come here once a month at least!!  You have to try the hashbrown casserole as one of your sides!  They have great chicken fried chicken and pot roast!  My parents always get the chicken livers and my brother always gets the chicken n dumplins.  Desserts are great too, but you are usually too full by that time!  Portions are big!  Breakfasts are excellent too, as are salads.  Pretty much everything on the menu is great!
