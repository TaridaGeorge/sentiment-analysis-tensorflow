This is a wonderful place to sit down and work... and people watch. The staff are friendly, food is great and WiFi (though finicky at times) is free. Since I work from home, I love to frequent this locale to refocus when distractions pop up. The staff here is courteous and doesn't mind me sitting here for hours on end refilling my drink for free. This is my choice for an office away from the office.
