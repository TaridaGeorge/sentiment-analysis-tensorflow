I am in shock that I am the first person to write a review on this place! It is freakin amazing. Am I truly the first Yelper to discover this gem? I mean, come-on, this is Phoenix's own Art's Community Center. They offer art classes (music, photography, ceramics, pottery, glass, drawing, pastel, etc.) to both children and adults. So far this year, I have taken both a drawing/painting class and am currently in a piano class. 
The location could not be any more perfect.  It's right next to Burton Barr Library in those historic brick buildings on the park. The instructors are all professional artists with degrees in the arts + they are incredibly cool people.  I highly recommend this place for anyone looking to enrich their lives with the arts.
