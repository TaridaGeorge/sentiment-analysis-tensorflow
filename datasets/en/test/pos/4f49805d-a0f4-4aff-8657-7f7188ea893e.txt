Jack, Stella (my dogs) and my boyfriend and I just love this dog park. 

We used to live nearby, and would go everyday. I'd say 98% of the dog owners are courteous, and the dogs are usually wonderful. There are a lot of "regulars" that you will see there all the time. I've never had a negative experience, and for the year that I was going here I had only seen maybe 3 dog fights- which were quickly broken up. There is a lot of humping dogs, however, but that gets nipped in the butt quickly, as well. 

I've since moved across town, and am frequenting a new bark park--but we still try to go to the Sportsplex Bark Park as often as we can. :)
