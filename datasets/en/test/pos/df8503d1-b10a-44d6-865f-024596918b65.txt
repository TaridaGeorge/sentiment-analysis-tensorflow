Dr. Jordan S. Weiner, M.D. at Valley ENT is one of my favorite doctors that I've ever had the pleasure of being treated by. He is highly intelligent, friendly, sympathetic and displays all the attributes of a phenomenal doctor. He helped cure my chronic sinusitis condition through a combination of nasal surgery and nasal rinsing treatment. He'll take the time to thoroughly discuss everything with you in detail, along with answering all your questions. He doesn't rush you out the door like many other doctors do. I wish he could be my doctor for everything!
