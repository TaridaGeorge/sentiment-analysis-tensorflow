Just do yourself a favor and eat here at least once.  They really know what they're doing with the food (peppered steak is my favorite), there's a good selection of higher-quality beer, and choices for everyone, including vegetarians - I know because I was one once.

Atmosphere is truly unique; the staff mostly plays the music that they want to hear, which can be a bit random but usually interesting.  The building is very narrow and often crowded, which somehow adds to the sense of fun rather than being annoying.

Just one thing: if you absolutely cannot stand hipsters you might want to stay away: the skinny jeans/fixed gear crowd is pretty well-represented.  On second thought, you should probably just lighten up and come anyway.  It's well worth it.
