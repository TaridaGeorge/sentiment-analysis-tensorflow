We went to the "Date Night" Sunday Afternoon - the movie was great.  The experience was also great - the theater is clean and.  customer service was excellent. I left my purse and when I called they were very polite told me it was found right after the movie locked away for me to retrieve.  They also called me this morning to confirm I knew they had it and letting me know I could pick it up. Much Appreciated!
