Excellent. Great service. Amazing food!  I Had a the "Puerco Lento", a pork shank cooked with cumin, chipotle, and paprika.  Served in a creamy sauce with potatoes.  My husband had the special which was a giant steak that he managed to polish off.  "The best steak I've ever had", he said.  The next time we are in Phoenix we will have to come back here!
