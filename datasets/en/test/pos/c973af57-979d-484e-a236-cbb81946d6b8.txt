Top notch golf country club. The course is well maintained year round, the staff is friendly and helpful, they put on classy family friendly events, and all the facilities are kept clean and in working condition. Saturday morning bingo is surprisingly entertaining, especially when you win Magnums of Napa Valley wine ;)
