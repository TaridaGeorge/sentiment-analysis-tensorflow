so we relax, sip from a bottle of wine, nibble on bruschetta, listen to pleasant music and test our knowledge with the trivial pursuit cards on the shelf. sometimes I wonder why we pay to go there when the whole experience could be replicated half price in the living room, quite enjoyably. 

But we do! This is one of my favorite places in Scottsdale, despite the fact that I don't eat meat and all we ever get is the four non-meaty bruschettas. It is just pleasant here. The happy hour deals, comfy seating and knowledgeable/fun/friendly staff make it. Plus, wine!
