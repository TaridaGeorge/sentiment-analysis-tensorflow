OMG I love this place. Places like these are the kind I live for. Its the diamond in the rough, the hole in the wall, the place you aren't too sure about and find that you love. The staff is incredibly polite, accommodating, and helpful. When we went in we were on a diet. We walked in close to closing time, but were more than happy to serve us anything we wanted. They were happy to make us fresh food that suited our diet. Anything that we were interested in that didn't fit the needs of our diet, they were eager to make what we wanted work or make other suggestions. The food is delicious. I can't wait to go back to this place again and again and again.
