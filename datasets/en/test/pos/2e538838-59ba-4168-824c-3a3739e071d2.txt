* Flamethrowers
* Stare-down contests
* Cyclist activists sporting pink undies
* DJ spinning in a treehouse
* Cool beer and wine bars
* Oh yes, and art.  Real, organic art made by our local neighbors.  

It's not in New York, not in Chicago -- it's all in our downtown Phoenix.

I like to credit Artlink with single-handedly improving the vibrancy of Downtown Phoenix with its First Friday Artwalk.  It's one of my favorite pasttimes about living in Phoenix and is a true testament to the cultural destination our area has become. 

I read somewhere that it's the largest artwalk in the country now and is growing each month.   I make it a habit to go every month.  It's something everyone (art-lover or not) should experience.
