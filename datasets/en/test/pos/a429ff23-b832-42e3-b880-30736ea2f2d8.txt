Since there are already a gazillion reviews for LoLo's I will just say I had a super duper great experience at the LoLo's in Scottsdale.

The staff was the most delightful bunch of folks.  I sat at the bar and chit chatted with them listening to Michael Jackson and devouring Fried Chicken

Fried chicken.  Yes please, may I have another.
