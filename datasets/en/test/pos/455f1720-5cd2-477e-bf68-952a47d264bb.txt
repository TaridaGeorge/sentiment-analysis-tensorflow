One of the best hotels I've stayed in AZ! Staff is very friendly. You get free breakfast in the morning and it's not crappy either.  When I was checking in I wanted a king bed instead of two beds. They said it would be an extra charge. I said no thank you then but to my surprise after heading to my room they gave me the king for free as a surprise :-) 
Even after been in my room for 20 minutes I get a call from the front desk asking me of I like the room and if there's anything they can do for me. I though that was neat. 

It seems a lot of older people, I mean older, stay at this location since I was the only one under 60 everyday. The rooms a big too.
