This is the number one hangover breakfast joint of all time.

Breakfast's are huge and delicious, just like mama would have used to make, if mama were one of those mamas, that used to make such meals. 

Mike and Rhonda have the sort of joint that my grandfather loves. He doesn't drink, but for some reason he eats nothing but excellent hang-over food. Sometimes I go there sober with him.

The biscuits and gravy are possibly the best I have ever had, though addmittedly this is only because the biscuits are so amazing they carry the mediocre gravy.

The service is fast and efficient. I have never had to hold my aching, drowsy, hung-over head up long before the food arrived, and the giant drink glasses are perfect for re-hydrating.
