What a place!!! This restaurant is very warm and welcoming. The staff is very courteous and we were waited on every step of the way. The food is amazing!! My wife ordered the halibut and it was cooked really well (just right) - it was flaky and moist. I ordered the ribeye and it was very nice, although cooked just a little longer that I would have normally wanted, but it tasted great. We ordered sauteed mushrooms and we got some of the most wonderful spiced and wined mushrooms we ever had. Salads were great and so was that bread that was drowned in the artichoke dressing or whatever that was. Don't forget desert. 

Not cheap... at all... but you go there for a very special experience. We went for Mother's Day. This place is a win. Do not leave this planet without having tried it.
