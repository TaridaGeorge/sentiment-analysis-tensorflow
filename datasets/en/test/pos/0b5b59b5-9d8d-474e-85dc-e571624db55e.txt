If you like sushi, you have to come to Sushi on Shea.  I avoided this place for so long, just because I didn't like the name.  Weird huh? For some reason I had it in my mind that with a name like that, they couldn't possibly serve up great sushi.  But they do. 

The food isn't cheap, but it isn't overly pricey either.  I know they have some pretty good lunch specials as well and their cocktails are good and strong- just the way I like 'em.
