Probably the cleanest eating establishment in the entire Valley, it's obvious when you walk in that somebody CARES enough to make it this way! From the people working there, to the yogurt, to the toppings and fresh fruit (which some of the other places have discontinued due to cost), it's all five stars all the way. The tart apple and some others have me going in almost every day. The slightly higher cost per ounce than some other places is offset by their "loyalty card" which gives you back $3 after eight purchases, so the cost is not a biggie.....and.......you'll be back, I'm sure.
Nobody even comes close to this total package, and it shows. Great job guys!!!!!!!!!
