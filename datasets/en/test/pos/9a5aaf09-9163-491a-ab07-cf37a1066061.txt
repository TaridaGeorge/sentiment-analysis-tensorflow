We did a two night "staycation" here. It's very close to my work, so my commute was cut down to almost nothing, making for a very relaxing stay.

For a hotel of this class...very nice. Breakfast was terrific, healthy options, even whole grain batter for the waffle maker. Fruit toppings for waffles were a nice touch. Great selection of food here. Our room was nice, roomy, comfortable, well-appointed. 

Staff were very friendly, the front desk had folks waiting at prime check in time. May have to do it again next week!!!
