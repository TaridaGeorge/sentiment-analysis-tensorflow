How can I not have written a review about one my DT Phx staples!!!!??? 

Eat here! Order pizza. Probably my favourite in town. They will make it however you like. The crust is always thin and light and topped with fresh veggies, smothered in melty artisan cheeses... 

Excuse me while I sop up the drool pooling around my keyboard. 

Try the specials. Pasta is cooked just right and topped and seasoned with delicious, hearty sauces. Plates are always big enough to share. Great date spot!!

Never leave without desert please! Can you say Nutella crepe!?!?!? 

Not to mention the meal complementing selection of spirits... 

Cibo, I love you. My life would not be complete without you. My favourite place to have a bite with my tiny, bring new friends, ladies night, or any other excuse I can muster.
