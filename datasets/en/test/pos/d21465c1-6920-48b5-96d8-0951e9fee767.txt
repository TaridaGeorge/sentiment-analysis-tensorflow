I am happy to have found this place - I put off trying it for what seems like years... I am so glad I finally popped in here for lunch yesterday! I love their egg drop soup (which comes included with most of the lunch specials). I tried the Kung Pao Beef today and while it could have been a little spicier, the ingredients were ultra fresh and delicious. The crab puff and spring roll were perfect! Good vibe, and the staff is 100% on the ball.
