If you read my reviews you will know that I LOVE PIZZA!!!!!  This is one of my favorite pizza places in town.  I just can't complain.  I get the same toppings as I always get:  extra cheese, black olives, mushrooms and artichokes and it's always perfect!

Totally reminds me of getting a slice in NYC.  It's even better cold the next morning!
