this is THE place to buy your dates.  They're grown in AZ and picked at perfect ripeness.  they are way softer and better tasting than supermarket dates.  Honey and nuts are farmer's market good as well.  I have been going here for 13 years.  The staff is friendly and can make a gift box any way you want while you wait.  Given them many times.  They were on groupon this year helping to get the word out.

Give a box of assorted dates as a gift this holiday.  they'll be sure to share with you.  win win :)
