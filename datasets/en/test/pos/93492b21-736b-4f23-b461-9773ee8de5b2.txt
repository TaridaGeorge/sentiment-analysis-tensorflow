LOVE the patio for happy hour!  My entire office goes once a month.  It's a bit more casual, quiet, and intimate than the main restaurant.  I've never eaten inside, but by the looks of it, I would really enjoy that , too.  All the drinks are great!  I've had the carpaccio a few times and I'm never disappointed.  Most usually get a burger.
