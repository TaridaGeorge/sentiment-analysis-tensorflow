I absolutely love this store. MAC has such an amazing line of cosmetics, so many colors, so many different types of makeup. 

This location is by far my favorite. The Scottsdale locations (Fashion Square) are a little too in your face and crowded, unlike this one. The staff here are very knowledgeable and so helpful. And I love how they keep your product on file - just incase you forget that beautiful shadow you used every last bit of.
