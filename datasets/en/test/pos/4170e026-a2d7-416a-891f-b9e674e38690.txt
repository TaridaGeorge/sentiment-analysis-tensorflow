The last time I had AMAZING German food like this place was when I visited family in Jasper IN about 18 years ago.  The soup of the day was a cream of mushroom soup, and OMG, it was SOOOO good!  We had the Sample Sausage appetizer, the Schweizer Schnitzel, and the Kassler Kotelett.  OMG, the food was AMAZING!!!!  This was my husband's first time ever having German food, and he LOVED it.  We're looking forward to going back again real soon!
