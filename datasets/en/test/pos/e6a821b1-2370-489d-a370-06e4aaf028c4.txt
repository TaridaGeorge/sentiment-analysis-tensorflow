My friend and I purchased the groupon for an express pedi.  This place is one of the nicest non-spa nail salons I've ever been too.  For how nice it is, the prices are reasonable as well.  I agree with one of the other reviewers.  The pedi chairs are the nicest chairs ever!  Staff is super friendly.  They have a good selection of polishes to choose from.  I was very happy with my pedi and will be returning in a few weeks to try a gel manicure.
