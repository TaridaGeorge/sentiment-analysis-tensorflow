I hadn't been here since it was known as The Counter - it was good then and it was amazing now. 

Stopped in for a bite with Mom while visiting AZ and decided to try the Roast Beef sandwich (cold). O.M.G. It was probably the best roast beef sandwich I've ever had. I couldn't even save a bite for my Mom (sorry Mom!) - just wolfed it down. I may have left a couple of pounds heavier but I enjoyed every morsel of it.
