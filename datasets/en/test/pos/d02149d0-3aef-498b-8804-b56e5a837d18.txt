This location has been many different restaurants over the years - this is a tough spot. This is my favorite thing it's been though. 

The food is great here and the owner is cool. The prices are really reasonable and the portions are large. The place is really clean and the decor is nice. Everything is cooked in plain sight, so there's no mystery. 

My only complaint would be that he doesn't deliver yet. We definitely need a good gyro place that delivers in the area.

Seriously though - the food is really delicious. If you like flavors - it's all really flavorful. Great hummus too. Try the pizza puff.
