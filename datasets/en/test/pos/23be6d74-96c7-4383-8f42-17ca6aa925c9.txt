Best BBQ in the Phoenix area, and for the record, my favorite place to eat in the city. I have lived here for most of my life and have yet to find anything better. The Meat is Delicious and the sauce steals the show, its wonderful and is always served up hot and all you want is available. many BBQ places give you a ketchup bottle of thick cold sauce and it ruins your hot sandwich. oh, and these are not the best ribs i have ever had, its the BBQ Sandwich that is the must eat. Also they have superb seasoned fries that go perfectly with the sandwich. I have had many other bbq places in the city, Including JOE'S in gilbert, but Joe's just isn't in the same category as Honey Bears. The meat is tough at Joe's and the sauce is averge.
