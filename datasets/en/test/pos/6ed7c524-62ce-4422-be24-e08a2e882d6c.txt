As good as it gets!! 
I found this little gem by purchasing a Groupon for some of their farm fresh products. I have come back numerous times now and I refuse to buy dairy or eggs anywhere else. 
The eggs are fabulous. The yolk is a beautiful bright orange with a flavor that those mass produced grocery store eggs could not even come close to matching. 
The farmers cheese is made fresh and comes in great flavors. The garlic & pepper and chipotle are my favorites. 
The salsa and hummus are also quite tasty. 
I buy whey for my dogs it is so good for them, it is only $1.00 and they love it! 

There is a little area behind the store where you can pet the animals. 
Support this farm and provide your family with farm fresh food and the education about where food actually should come from...
