I've been to The Grapevine twice and love it! Whether you're sitting on the upstairs patio near the bar or downstairs in the open-air restaurant (don't worry - there's still plenty of shade), it's relaxing and more importantly, delicious! I recommend the Lahvosh, which is a type of pizza made on Armenian cracker bread! Yum! I will say if you don't like birds, you may not enjoy sitting there. The birds aren't really afraid of humans anymore and tend to hop around the vine design at the side of the lower section or on the ledge of the upstairs patio. They will also come inside the lower section and hop around on empty tables, etc. The upstairs patio also has a wonderful view of Camelback Mountain!
