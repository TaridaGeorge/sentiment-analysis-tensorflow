OK the business is small and very crowded at lunch but beyond that, They make the best food in Tempe, No Joke!

These Paste's are Hot Pockets on Steroids, from Cajun Chicken to the Original Lamb, these things are packed full of flavor and they serve the best beer as well.

So when your tired of Sushi, Pizza and a Steak dinner and you want something that is different but will get you coming back for more. Now they have a new location that is larger in Mesa on Dobson, that will surely be a hit too.
