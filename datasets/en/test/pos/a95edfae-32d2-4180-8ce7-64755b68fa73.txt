I had a full body massage by Karen and it was wonderful!  My back had been hurting for weeks and she worked on it using hot stones, tiger balm, and several different massage techniques and it felt great the next day!  The massage was different than any I had ever had before.  You remain fully clothed, which was not new to me, and she worked on and around each joint.  Im not sure what the techniques we that she used, it felt very different from other massages that I have had, but the results were awesome!  I decided to let go of control, allow her to do what she does so well and it was the best massage I've had in a long time!  I recommend you experience it for yourself, be open to different techniques and enjoy the results!
