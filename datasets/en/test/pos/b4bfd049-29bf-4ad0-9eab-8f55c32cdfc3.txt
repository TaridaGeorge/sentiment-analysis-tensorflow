Simply the best breakfast! Delicious creamy pancakes, and the best eggs benedict I've ever had, California bacon benedict, with a side of fresh fruit and hashbrowns, and a fresh bottomless cup of coffee, yum! No matter how busy this place gets, we always get great, friendly and fast service! Have to still try their delicious looking personal pies and bread pudding.
