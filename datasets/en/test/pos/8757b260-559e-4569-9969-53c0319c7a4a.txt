Yes, there are a million fro-yo shop across the valley.  Nothing competes with this place.  It is by far the best yogurt I've ever had.  My only request is that they PLEASE keep the vanilla frosting IN stock!  Every time I go they promise a shipment is on the way. Next visit - Vanilla frosting!!!  Following 5 visits - Out of frosting.  Just double, triple, quadruple the order for goodness sake, it's obviously a popular topping.
