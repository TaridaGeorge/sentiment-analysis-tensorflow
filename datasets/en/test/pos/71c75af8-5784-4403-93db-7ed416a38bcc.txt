I love this place.

The food is the greatest, the service is always great and there's just something about the place that makes it feel like you're at a family friend's. 

Go here. If nothing else to see the tweens breaking their backs trying to carry their oversized bass guitars into the nearby music lessons studio. There's also a massage parlor that's always open a few doors down. I'd imagine it's not a very classy establishment. 

Regardless, try the crab angels with the beef with peppers.
