I had the Beef Stew with noodles. It was very tasty.  The noodles were fresh and yummy, and the beef chunks and broth were very mouthwatering.  I also tried the beef buns. They were delicious, The pastry was freshly made and very meaty inside. I dipped then in the stew. I was full and satisfied. 

     The server was very nice and helped me order since I was not familiar with this cuisine. Her picks were very good. I want to go back since there are many things on the menu I would still like to try. The place is not fancy and it's not the dark romantic atmosphere I normally like, but the food makes up for all that, and it's affordable. I highly recommend it! Another great Yelp find for me! Score!
