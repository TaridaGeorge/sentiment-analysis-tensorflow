Four Peaks serves up some great beers and great eats.  This is no secret so no matter which day out of the year or which hour and minute out of the day you go you will see a full patio, and a populated bar.  Plan accordingly.  Try their Italian beer bread, the Carne Adovada, or the Southwest burger and wash it down with a pint of Hop Knot or Kilt Lifter.  You will be happy you did.  All of Four Peaks' menu items are appropriately priced and you will always leave satisfied.
