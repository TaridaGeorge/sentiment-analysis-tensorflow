Out of all of the local Indian restaurants I have tried, Royal Taj is by far the best! The curries are amazing and the meat (and paneer) is always tasty! While the people who own the restaurant may seem a bit distant, they are just shy and open up when you talk to them! Be sure to come here when you crave good Indian!
