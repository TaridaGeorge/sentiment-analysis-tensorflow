My favorite Thai restaurant in the valley! Definitely get the drunken noodles. So awesome! I always get them extra spicy. They don't do "American" spicy, they do "Thai" spicy. It's really intense. My fianc√© really likes the Thai toast. The curries are also really great, can't go wrong with any of them. Their dishes range from 1-5 scale of spiciness. 1 is low, and 5 is max hot.  They ask you how spicy you want it and customize the dishes to your liking. The lunch prices are reasonable and the portions are generous. We don't live in the neighborhood anymore but when we did, we used to go all the time.
