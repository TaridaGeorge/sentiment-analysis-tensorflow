My family had mine & my brother's birthday parties here when we were little. Such a great place for kids! There is a wide open field perfect for playing catch, flying kites, etc. There is a water play area that has a playground in sand & tons of water spouts for kids to spray each other with. 

The small train ride is so fun & kids love it. I take my cousins here when they come in town, it's great!
