I called an hour ahead for take out and my order was ready when I picked it up. The Kung Pao Chicken was delicious with a little kick to it. My kid loved the Mongolian Beef which was a generous serving. It came with a side of rice, and all for $20.00. It easily fed 4 people. I have been coming here regularly and have never been disappointed. The husband and wife who own the place are always smiling and happy to see customers.
