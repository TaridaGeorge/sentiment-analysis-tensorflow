This is one of my favorite places. The food is delicious and very affordable. The food does not come out fast, but it is well worth it!! I almost didn't want to write a review for selfish reasons, but I would also be very sad if this place didn't stick around for lack of support. This cafe/market is a Coronado 7th st GEM!!
