Really outstanding vegan French toast. Vegan chorizo tofu scram wrap. Coffee w/ soymilk.  5 options for hot sauce and maybe 3 more tofu scrambles I haven't even tried yet.  This is serious brunch business, phoenix area vegans.  

Now I won't be able to blame my grumpiness on lack of breakfast that's not oatmeal when I'm home visiting my family... Dang. This place is life changing.
