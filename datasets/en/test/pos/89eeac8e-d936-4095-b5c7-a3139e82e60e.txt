our old animal hospital closed down, so I inquired on facebook about another good one. when I call Ironwood, the girl was awesome. when we got there everybody was friendly and the place was very clean. an old friend of mine happened to be in the lobby and said great things about the place. a man who was leaving overheard us talking and also confirmed it was a great place. the technician and then the veterinarian were both excellent. my fifth greater is interested in being a veterinarian, and they offered to give us a tour. the treatment was not very expensive, and to top it off we got a courtesy call the next morning asking how our dog was doing.
