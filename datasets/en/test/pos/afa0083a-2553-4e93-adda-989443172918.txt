Great Burgers, Great Fries, and Great Beer, is there anything else you need to know?

The Burgers are fantastic, and they have their own amazing special sauce.  Even the Veggie Panini is amazing, full of flavor, and cheese.

The Fries come out in a mini shopping car, come in both sweet potato and regular potato variety.  Get a half and half.

The dessert cookies sucked, sorry, but they did.  

All in all I will be going there again!  Probably Next week!
