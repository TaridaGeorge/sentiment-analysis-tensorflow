Michael's is my favorite place to have things framed.  The selection of frames is huge.  They have a good selection of acid free papers and lots of choices for cuts and bevels as well. Their prices are reasonable, even more reasonable if you wait for their half off framing coupons that appear in the newspaper at least twice a month.   I have had no less than 50 lithos, photos, paintings and such framed by Michael's and they have never damaged anything or caused me worry over any of them.   They are not the quickest, but they have work done when they say it will be done.
