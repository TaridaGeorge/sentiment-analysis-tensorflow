I absolutely love Ted's. Yes, there is generally a long line, but the hot dogs and cheese fries are worth the wait. It is an lovely inexpensive meal. Sometimes it can be a bit busy and loud, but the food makes it worth it. As a side note, if you get a milkshake, let it sit for a while before you sip it...because it's very thick and will be a slight pain to try to drink if you don't.
