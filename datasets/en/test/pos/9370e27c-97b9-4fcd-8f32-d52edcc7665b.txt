thanks to Yelp we found Sala Thai after 5 years of living in our neighborhood. This place is super awesome! The food is amazing, its one of our weekly go-to's now. I am addicted to the Pad Thai. Their homemade ice cream is the best ice cream I have ever had. The inside of the restaurant is a basic strip mall layout, no frills, but the yummy food and super sweet owners make eating there worth it.
