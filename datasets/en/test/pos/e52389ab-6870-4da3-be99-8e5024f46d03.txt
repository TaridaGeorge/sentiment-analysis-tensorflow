The food here is quite impressive.  They serve a variety of Asian style dishes, not just Chinese (given the name).  The atmosphere is nice on the inside and the prices are very reasonable.  I had the Sun Devil Chicken, which was a Vietnamese inspired spicy dish and it was quite tasty.  I can't wait to go back and try out a few more items from the menu.  Give it a shot!
