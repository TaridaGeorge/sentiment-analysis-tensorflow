Fresh & Easy is a delightful addition to the neighborhood. Love the prices, love the produce, and love the pre-made items. Not a huge fan of the meats here, but I'm weird about meat anyway, so that's all on me. I love that I can seamlessly shop and be secure knowing that the ingredients are worthy or serving to my precious little fam. What was life like before we knew about Fresh & Easy's peanut butter pretzels...hello? I love that items such as brussel sprouts, radishes, the pain in the rear to clean produce, is all neatly packaged and cleaned! I hear this location is the busiest in the state & one of the smallest. Great staff- We just love it!
