Location is a bit hidden but the salon itself is wonderful! The staff is knowlegdable and friendly and although the location is relatively small there are plenty of beds and bed types to choose from.  There has also been a dramatic improvement in the overall appearance of the salon over the past few months.  Very clean :). I would recommend this location to anyone looking for a new salon for bed/spray tanning.  Also, if you have never been to any of the 12 valley locations your first tan is FREE!!
