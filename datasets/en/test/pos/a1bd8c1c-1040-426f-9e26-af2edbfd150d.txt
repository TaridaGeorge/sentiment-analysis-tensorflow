You can't beat their special that is in their classic pasta dishes... get one and the chef treats you to another one to take home!  I have to say the Four Cheese Ravioli makes me salivate just thinking about it.  I swear, next time, I am going to get the ravioli for BOTH dishes!  I can't wait til we get to go back!
