This place is fantastic! Everything I have had is simply delicious and I literally wake up some mornings craving their clams, black cod, Sun roll and salmon! The GF BF and I really can't get enough Yasu that just writing this makes me want to go there for dinner tonight!

Don't forget to try the whole list I already mentioned plus the eggplant (either way it is prepared), live scallop if they have it, the jidori skewers, kumomoto oysters and the black snapper! 

Seriously amazing!
