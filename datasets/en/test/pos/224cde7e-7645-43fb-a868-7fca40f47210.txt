loving the chicken. loving the waffles. loving the grits. loving the trough of tea.  lo lo's has it all!  apparently yesterday got a bit insane, but for sunday (today), they've brought in extra help.  super nice staff, super tasty food.  kid friendly.  i don't know what's in the waffles that makes them so good, i don't know what's in the chicken breading that makes it so good.  i don't care!  it was tasty as all get out, and luckily, it's within walking distance from us!  hopefully, this can help our area get some more foot traffic, and also help some of the lovely other eateries in the area (like the noodle ranch).  

yum!!!
