What a cool little place.  A little west of the intersection of Happy Valley road and Pima, you'll find the General Store- a mix of everything you need to start or end your day.

You can fill up your tank and grab the normal snacks inside, but they also have a post office and a little cafe with a full menu.  It's a great spot to grab a quick bite to eat or sit and have a leisurely meal.  

Their coffee is pretty good and they have a much bigger selection of snacks, food, drinks and toiletries than you'll find at other gas stations.
