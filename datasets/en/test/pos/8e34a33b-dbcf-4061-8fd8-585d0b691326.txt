I no longer buy jeans anywhere else. For some reason, the brands they sell at Buckle fit me like no others. I don't even mind paying $100 a pair, vs. going somewhere else and trying on 10 pairs to find 1 that fits alright. 

If you don't mind paying that much for a pair of jeans which were assaulted in ways that make them look both old and busted yet like the new hotness, all at the same time, then Buckle is for you, too.
 
Just so you don't feel like a total chump, the $100 a pair jeans are all made right here in 'merica. Yee haw!
