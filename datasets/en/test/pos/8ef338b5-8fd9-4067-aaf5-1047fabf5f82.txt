....was just on a hunt to find some fresh fish (not frozen) yesterday so I could figure out what to cook last night....after visiting Fry's, Safeway, Albertsons and AJ's.....I saved Whole Foods last knowing well that they would probably have the best selection....and I WAS RIGHT!!
They had the best selection of Wild Salmon (not farm-raised) that I saw, they even had fresh mahi-mahi!!. Just a side note - all of the other grocers had their own variet of fish but it was all frozen for the good majority.
