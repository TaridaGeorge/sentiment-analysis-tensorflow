This is a great little corner market, similar to what we had growing up back east.  Lots of wonderful fresh foods to choose from including organics.  The prepared meals vary in greatness from 5 stars to 3 stars, but they are all well made, just don't all appeal to my pallette.  I love the lady who works at the samples bar and I love that no matter when I go in, there is a little ice tea or fruit juice for me along with something to sample.  It's the best store in town.  I'm glad it's on my corner.
