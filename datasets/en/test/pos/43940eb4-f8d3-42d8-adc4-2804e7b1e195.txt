All I can say is WOW...

The architecture and design was beautiful.  The food was awesome.  The service was friendly and attentive - despite the fact that I had been traveling half the day, probably looked like hell, and should have been hidden from the general public.

Yes, it was expensive but I was on vacation and celebrating a milestone birthday.

This is definitely the place to splurge on yourself.  All the suggestions from our server were on the money, so if you don't know what to get, just ask!
