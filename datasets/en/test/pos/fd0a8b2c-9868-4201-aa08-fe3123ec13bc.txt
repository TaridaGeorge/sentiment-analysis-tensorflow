This place is very close to my house, so, I eat here regularly. It's always fresh good cuts of sushi/sashimi. My personal favs are: salmon, yellowtail, mackeral, tamago, and freshwater eel. I also love the rainbow carpaccio and Hana salad (tons of avocado, parmesan, and sunflower seeds-YUM). I only wish they would add inari to the menu. 

Remember to bring your own alcohol because they don't have it. Otherwise you'll be stuck with green tea instead of sake like me (I always forget). Also, be prepared to wait as this place is quite small and always packed at dinner time.
