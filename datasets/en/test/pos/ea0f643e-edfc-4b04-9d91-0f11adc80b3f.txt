This place nails it every time! I always anticipate a wait no matter what time I go as this place is THAT popular. Their sangria is delicious, tuna sashimi salad with ginger lime dressing is just WOW and the red velvet cake is simply scrumptious. The only problem I have had here was asking for no cilantro in my salad - it seemed to cause a problem. But everything else is so great that something like that is far too minor to affect my rating. They have a great patio and a lot of seating space. The service is always great as well.
