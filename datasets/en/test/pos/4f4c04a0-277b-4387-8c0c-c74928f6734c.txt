I went in armed with coupons! I must have circled the store a dozen times trying to make up my mind, I love everything! The staff is so great, not pushy at all. One of their associates would see me struggling to hold a bunch of items and offer to put them up front for me, yet never try to "sell" me anything. 
They have great little displays that help you match and visualize items at home and how they'd go together. They offer great discounts on their wines if you're a world market explorer member too. Their products are good quality, and they stock their standbys as well as new products pretty well. It's not often that I see something totally out of stock. 
Always fun to go here, and never leave empty handed!
