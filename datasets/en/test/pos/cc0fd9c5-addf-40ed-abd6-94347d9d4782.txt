Just have to give my favorite sushi place a shout out. We eat there several times a month and every time it is first rate.

It is small yet accommodating. The seafood is as fresh as it gets in The Valley of the Sun. The menu variety makes you feel like you are actually in Japan. My favorite is the green mussels. Even for the unadventurous they are a must try.

We have always had friendly, welcoming service. After a long day at work it is so nice to take our own bottle of wine and have the wonderful staff take such good care of us and treat us like family.

Stop overpaying for priced sushi and Japanese food that is served at a mediocre chain. Get out and enjoy this locally owned neighborhood gem!
