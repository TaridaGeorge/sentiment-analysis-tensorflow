If it were possible to give a six star rating, I would consider it in this case. 

I've eaten at Joe's Farm Grill a few times over the course of the last few years. I've reached the conclusion that this is one of the best burgers in America. The onion rings are also stellar. 

The sweet potato fries and ahi sandwich are solid picks, but not quite in the same stratosphere. Overall, the great strength of Joe's is that there is a unique take on everything.
