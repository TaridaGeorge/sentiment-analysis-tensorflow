dew bow bow.ooooooo yyyyeeeaaaa.....dew bow bow.

This is the song that I should be singing, as I slowly enter the Port of Subs after deboarding the light rail.  Port of Subs is my drug of choice, and eating such tasty subs makes me happy.  I got 12 inches last night...12 inches of subs....and it tasted so good!  nomnomnomnom!

Port of Subs never fails me.  Its just so good!  All bread cooked on site, and not like the chain sub places, its actually really really good!  I got the #18, lots of meat and whatever I wanted.  Tasty!

Thank you Port of Subs, thank you.  Eating here makes my brain and stomach delightfully happy!
