In addition to the coolness factor of the decor, the food (Mexican tapas) is innovative and sharper versions of "nouveau" Mexico City" food. I had the flatbread with carnitas (yes the chef instantly okayed the substitution) and my friend chose the short ribs. We started with the guacamole with crab- swoon, swoon and munched our way to sheer bliss. Try the corn and if you still feel a teensy bit hungry, go for a dessert. We shared the flourless chocolate cake topped with espresso ice cream which our waiter then swirled over with hot caramel sauce. And did I mention the helpful, friendly and knowledgeable staff? Make sure you visit the restroom- it's a treat just walking there. This place is a must see for any out of town friends or family, but put it on your "favorites"list. And "Urban Spoon"- get busy!
