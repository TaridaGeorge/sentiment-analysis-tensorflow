We stayed here the first night of our journey across the country last week.  Prior to this we've stayed in 3 other Caesar's Entertainment properties through with our Total Rewards cards. 
This was a beautiful room and completely comfortable. The staff was amazing, helpful and friendly. 
With my Total Rewards card the room was only $51.75 plus taxes which just slightly higher than we would've paid for a motel. It was only a 15 minute detour north off Interstate 8, just before you reach Tuscon. 
The casino was a little small but I found the better odds machines were in the Non-Smoking Casino.
