Again, perfecto!  This place is becoming one of my fav stops. Good thing it's on the way home from soccer. Perfect end to an afternoon of soccer. What's funny is who knew this place would be so good for a cheeseburger.  Yea, they have a cheeseburger on the lunch specials.  Can't wait to go back and keep working my way through the menu.
