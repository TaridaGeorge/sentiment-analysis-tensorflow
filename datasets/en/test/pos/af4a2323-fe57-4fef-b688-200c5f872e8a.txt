So I've been to LGO numerous times over the past couple years, ever since my girlfriend took me there for a hungover breakfast.  I've always enjoyed their variety of menu options, and find it a good place to take people for a quick and easy breakfast/lunch option.  The food is reasonably priced, with the exception of their beautiful and creative Tammie Coe cakes with are crazy expensive.

The market aspect of LGO gives you something to do while you wait for your food to arrive at the counter.  My favorites are any of their lunch sandwiches.  And my friend loves their egg sandwiches so much he texts me to remind me how good they are.

This LGO is too adorable for words, and is hands down the better than their Pasadena location.
