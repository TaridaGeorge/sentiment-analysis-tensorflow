Before coming here, I had never had Pho before, but I definitely loved everything I consumed there. To be honest, I don't really know what I ate there because my friends always take the initiative to order for me. However, I've eaten something different every time, which leads me to believe that it'd be hard to find anything bad on the menu.
Also, the girl that works there most often, or at least the times I've been there, is super sweet and very helpful.  She answered all questions about the menu honestly, and was a little spunky.  The good service only added to the positive experience. I dig this place.
