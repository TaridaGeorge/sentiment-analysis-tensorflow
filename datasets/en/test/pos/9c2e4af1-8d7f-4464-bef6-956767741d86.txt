I ate at the restaurant a couple of times as I was staying at the Westin on business. The service was really friendly without being over the top. At dinner I was recommended a delicious wine to go with my food, the latter being faultless. Both times I have eaten here- dinner and breakfast the food has been superb. Both contemporary and classic- my Caesar salad came with a lightly spiced dressing which I will endeavour to recreate as it was so good. I would recommend this restaurant to anybody who wants a delightful eating experience.
