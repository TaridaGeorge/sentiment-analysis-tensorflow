Awesome subs, the bread was fresh and tasty. The staff is very friendly. My kids don't eat sandwiches and tried them and loved them. They gave my kids a fire hat which they were really excited about. Friendly greeting when you arrived and a big "Thank You" when you leave. Would definitely go back again.
