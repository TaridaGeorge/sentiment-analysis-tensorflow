I took my son to see a matinee of Sherlock Holmes and the Adventure of The Suicide Club. It was fantastic!  This particular show was geared towards children so they had a meet and greet afterwards. The actors were so interesting and offered a lot of insight into being an artist. I felt like it was very inspirational to a lot of the children there. The staff was also very friendly and helpful. I cannot wait to go again!!
