What's that you say? This is the best breakfast in town? Why I think you're right! Simply put, Matt's does the simple American breakfast and they do it rather well. I go for waffle, eggs, bacon, home fries. BAM. A good morning indeed. Small, cute, very 50s feeling. Sure, there's a line out the door, but it's well worth the wait. Trust me.
