Awesome experience!!!  I was having a crisis situation when trying to file my taxes on my own.  There was a particular area of my taxes that I just couldn't figure out.  I had called a couple CPA's and H&R block but everyone was clueless.  I originally called to find a CPA to hire to do this but Tom spent about 20 minutes walking me through it over the phone.....I am not currently a client either.  He basically walked me through how to do this on my own. 

-the issue was trying to file a 8606 for for the past three and calculate my basis for an nondeductable IRA to Roth conversion.  I spent about 3 hours of my life trying to figure it out until I called Tom.  THANKS!

Oh and please don't just call him for free advice, he does have to eat!!
