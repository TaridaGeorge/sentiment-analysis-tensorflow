I've been going to John at Space for a few years now.  It's usually in response to some wacky home improvement injury as in ...

"I really don't know what happened.  I was painting (or digging holes, or fussing with a bird feeder), and now I can't move my head."

I always leave Space feeling better.  John is really easy to connect with.  He's always sympathetic to my problem.  He's also really interested in addressing the issues I come in with.

Actually, I don't leave Space feeling "better".  I always leave Space feeling "great".
