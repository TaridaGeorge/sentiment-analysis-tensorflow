I knew this place had the best ramen in AZ, but yesterday I tried their curry with chicken. It's a killer! Great curry, big chunks of chicken all resting on a volcano of rice. Enough for 3 meals and the best I've had. Serving in a huge black stoneware bowl makes this scrumptious dish look like a volcanic island in a sea of mild Japanese curry.
