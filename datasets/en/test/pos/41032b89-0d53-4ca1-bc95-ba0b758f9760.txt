Originally from Ohio, and we had some great Chinese restaurants all over. Dont know why, exactly... not typically a place where you'd settle from another country. When we moved here, we figured the same would be true here. But in the west valley, there seemed to be a shortage. I decided to try this new little place by dunkin donuts after pregnancy cravings subject me to good flied lice. Wow. We have been so impressed by everything: the service, the food and the amount you get for the money, the quickness in preparation, the cleanliness. Just fyi, we wanted to make sweet and sour chicken into a combo which isnt offered on the menu. When we called the goodyear location, they wouldnt do it, but this location on west thomas did.  So make no mistake about it,good chinese food in the west valley!
