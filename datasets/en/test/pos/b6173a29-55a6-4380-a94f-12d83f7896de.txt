All I have to say is STICKY BUNS! I went to the El Chorro Lodge for the first time last Sunday for brunch. Outstanding! Great service, beautiful location and tasty food. I will certainly be going there again for brunch. I would like to try El Chorro for drinks or dinner. It looks to be a very happening spot.
