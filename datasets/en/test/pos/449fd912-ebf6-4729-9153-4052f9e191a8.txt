Four Peaks is ALWAYS amazing. Not only is the beer the best brew here or anywhere (maybe a close competition with Stone in San Diego), but the food is always out of this world. We always have trouble picking from the menu because we are never disappointed with anything. The Arizona Rolls are the bomb, and their calamari is the best I've ever had. We had a special the other day, a queso panela BLTA and it was the best sandwich I ever had, with a side of chicken coconut curry soup. For beers, the HopKnot and the Raj IPA are favorites, and they have the only Hefe I'll drink. The service has ALWAYS been top notch. I was asked the other day if there was one restaurant I could eat at for the rest of my life and it was Four Peaks!
