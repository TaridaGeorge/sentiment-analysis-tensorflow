Sit at the ceviche bar and strike up a conversation with the chefs. They are super friendly and the open kitchen is fun for foodies. The ceviche is off the hook! Try the lobster tacos and rainbow ceviche with a glass of champagne or sparkling wine. (they need a tasting menu)  The foie gras and fig empanadas are decadent and both the bone-in rib-eye and chimichurri beef tenderloin are cooked to perfection and flavorful. We need a restaurant like this is Cali!
