I've been meaning to review this for a while now, but never got around to it.  Bottom line: Ted's is fantastic!  I'm been going for about three and a half yeas now, and Ted's has never once disappointed me.  Amazing chili-cheese dogs, brats, and polish and italian sausages.  The dogs are cooked on an actual grill too, which earns bonus points in my book .  The onion rings are also great - greasy, but in a really good way.  Definitely worth the ride out to Tempe.
