Just thinking about Cornish Pasty makes my mouth water. I highly recommend the Royal with cheese. CP also has a great selection of local drafts. Good service, music and a kick-ass extension of the bar which overlooks the back of the kitchen. And the bread they make (from scratch) is a secret recipe (for good reason) so flaky and delicious!
