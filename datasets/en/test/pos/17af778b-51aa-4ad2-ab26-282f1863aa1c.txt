My girlfriend took me to windsor for my birthday last night, I was very impressed.  The look of the restaurant was very clean and modern, the service was incredible.  The food was delicious, I got a pulled pork sandwich.  The cocktails were also very tasty.  I don't usually give a place 5/5 stars, but this place is definitely up there and worth going to over and over.
