I've been wanting to try Chelsea's Kitchen for months now and finally made my way over there last night. Wow. I officially became a member of the clean plate club. I had the vegetarian nut burger -- delish!  I had the key lime pie for dessert and I'd definitley have it again. Our server, Christina, was super friendly and helpful when we were trying to decide what to order. We were there early evening so it was a little quiet but the restaurant has a warm, homey vibe. Looking forward to going back soon.
