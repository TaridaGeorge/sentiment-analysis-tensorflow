I started taking TRX classes (which were totally new to me) at Off the Grid a few months ago, joined the gym shortly after, and could not be happier!  It is a clean and welcoming environment, Eric (the owner) is professional and a great instructor.  You will not find a better gym with top of the line machines and equipment as well as a variety of classes and times at this price anywhere else in Scottsdale.  Each treadmill has a built-in touch screen TV and iPod adapter/charger.  It is located at Scottsdale Rd and Gold Dust (shopping center with California Pizza Kitchen)... it's definitely worth it to go see the facility and check out the TRX classes- I have been so impressed with the results in just a few months and enjoy working out more than ever before!
