Just tried this place for the first time for a girls luncheon.  Really enjoyed the atmosphere and quaint surroundings.  It was packed when we arrived, but we had a reservation (highly recommend this).  We stayed well past closing, and they were very polite and did not attempt to kick us out. 

Service was excellent, our waiter was patient with the 2 high protein, 1 full on vegetarian, and one new mommy. We probably had one no dieter in the whole group, so our order was complex, and the waiter just went with it.  Plus he was very entertaining. Always back to the table to top off drinks etc. 

Food is large quantities for what you pay for, very fresh and delicious.  A thoroughly enjoyable outing!!!
