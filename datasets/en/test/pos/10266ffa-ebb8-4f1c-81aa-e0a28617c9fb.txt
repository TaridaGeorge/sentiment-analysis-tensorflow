There is no place that can provide the same level of customer service that you can get at Berning's.  The pieces in the store are of the highest quality and are unique.  They are not mass produced like the products you see in the malls.  Zach and Patricia bend over backwards to fix, repair, search, and find exactly what you're looking for whether it is a new engagement ring or an antique watch.
