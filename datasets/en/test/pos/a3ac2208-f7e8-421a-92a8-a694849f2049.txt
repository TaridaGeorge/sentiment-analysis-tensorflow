when you're gluten-free, vegan, soy milk and almond milk intolerant and you can't have any caffeine, it's torture to go into any bakery or coffeehouse.  Not at Nami.  What was great about this place was the gluten-free vegan treats...yes they are sugary...my favorite is the two snickerdoodle cookies pressed together with some sort of awesome creamy goodness in the middle.  And, they can make steamers with rice or coconut milk!!!  finally a coffeehouse I feel good going to!
