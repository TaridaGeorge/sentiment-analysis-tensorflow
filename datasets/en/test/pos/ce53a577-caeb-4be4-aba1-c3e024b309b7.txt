After reading some of the less than stellar reviews I feel obligated to review one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in the valley. The staples here are excellent, and everything (as far as I know) is homemade. The beans are the best I have had in AZ (not refried and smothered in cheese), the rice is moist and flavorful, and the flour tortillas are damn near perfect. The chicken mole enchildas are delicious, with the mole leaning towards a red mole, sweet with a bit of spice. The shredded beef tacos are also superb. Although I agree that the service can be spotty I come here for the food, not the service. Other favorite Mexican spots include Los Sombreros and Lilys. 

And lastly the sopapillas are oh so delicious, but unless you want your dessert with your meal I recommend requesting that they be brought out afterwards.
