I miss 6 and can't wait for the new spot to open up.  I know that they are going to be rocking it hard.  I spent many a good nights in this perfect combination of Scottsdale sheek, great drinks, good times and good music.

You are missed 6, but it is time for a new approach to an old Scottsdale gem.  The bar that truly changed the way that Old Town did bars!!
