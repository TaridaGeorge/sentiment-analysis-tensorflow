This place is spotless, has a great bottled beer selection, and has outdoor and rooftop patio space.  

I enjoyed a pre-spring training game Anchor Steam here on St Patrick's Day and was pleasantly surprised to find a place to stand outdoors, a friendly dog running around, a lack of douchey customers, friendly service, and a cleaner than clean bathroom.  SCORE.
