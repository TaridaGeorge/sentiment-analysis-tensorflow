folks who yelped this place prior to me couldn't be more on target:
Arthur and his famz run a quality shop here
they're all very knowledgeable and friendly
esp. to me and my dog, as we own the same breed, boy did i get some brownie points for that one! lol i will never go to any other pet store, as i live a stones throw away and they have the BEST products you can buy. i encourage anyone who is a dog/horse owner to stop by you will not be disappointed!
