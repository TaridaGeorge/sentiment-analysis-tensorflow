Recently visited for our first time and wow, were we impressed! Fantastic food delivered with fantastic service.  I've been a fan of the Palm Steakhouse over the years and have been disappointed they haven't chosen to expand to AZ, but now I can get an equal or better meal here at Mastro's!  Can't wait to get back again.
