The best breakfast place, bar none!  I love that it is a local, non-chain place and they do everything delicious!!  The french toast is to die for and the plain and simple (eggs, bacon, potatoes) is perfect!  My husband and I split these two dishes and it is plenty.  We always leave stuffed!!  Be sure to make reservations for a Sat or Sun morning breakfast, otherwise you'll be waiting at least an hour!!
