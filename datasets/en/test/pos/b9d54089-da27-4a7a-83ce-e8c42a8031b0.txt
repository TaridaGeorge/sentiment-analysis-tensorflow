Nello's is great, I've eaten pizza from all over the country and can honestly say this is great pizza. We usually go there for Pizza every sunday afternoon. They claim Chicago style, the thick wheat crust emulates that. The quality of ingredients are amazing, I usually order a Chicken-Bacon-Pepperoni combo, which is always awesome. My wife always gets their Turkey-Avocado sub with extra house dressing. The house dressing is amazing and worth pouring all over a sandwich or salad.

Every one of there locations has a nice midwestern pizzeria feel, growing up outside Detroit, one thing I miss is an old-school pizzeria. The bonus is that they carry local brew from Four Peaks on tap and always stay seasonal, and for a "beer snob" like me that's worth giving 5-stars!
