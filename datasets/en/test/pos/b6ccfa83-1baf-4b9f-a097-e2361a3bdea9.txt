Damn that green flannel is great.  It has corn beef, potatoes, fresh jalapenos, and green peppers.  Even something normally as pedestrian as english muffins are great  (tip, make yourself a flannel english muffin sandwich).   Food is terrific and so are the folks.  My wife has dreams about their monkey cakes which are banana/almond/coconut pancakes.  Our twins consume the heroically large pancakes too.
