I am a froyo (frozen yogurt) connoisseur and am always ready to try to newest and greatest shop! When I have a craving for rich flavor, an assortment of toppings and flavors, cool spoons (eco friendly too!); I head straight to Orange Leaf.

They have cake batter that rivals Coldstone, yet is healthier! 

My tips:
-To re-created "Birthday Cake Remix" cake batter frozen yogurt, one brownie chunk, sprinkles and hot fudge to taste!
-Ask for cereal (they keep it in the back).
-Grab as many testers as your hands can hold.
-Enjoy the greatest froyo you have ever encountered.
