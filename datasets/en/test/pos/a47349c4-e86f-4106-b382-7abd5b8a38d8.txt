This is a great place to bring out of towners who think Phoenix is a hubble of sand. The patio is wonderful, the food is terrific, and the staff is helpful and not too "in your face fancy."
Also- the wine list it to die for.
Thanks for always making us have a good time, Lon's. You're a Phoenix, okay PV classic.
