I continue to be impressed with this community park and recreation center. I spent a morning and afternoon with my family at the park area. It was perfect! 

There are ample spaces for eating, BBQing, and playing. There's a fun water area where kids can spray each other. The bathrooms are kept very clean.

Since I was here last, the Starbucks has closed.

If I had a large event, I would want to host it here. Great entertainment for the entire family!
