There is nowhere else I would rather be on a Friday night. Saturday is a little too mental, wall-to-wall people, so best get there early and get a seat at the bar if you're planning on going there. Sunday is snoozeville!

But Friday, awesome people, beauties with brains to match. Everyone is friendly, mature, interesting, and it's relatively easy to get a drink too.

The bar staff are great! Simply put. And Nikki, if you're reading this, you make Friday worth looking forward to not only because it's the start of the weekend.

Check it out folks, you won't be disappointed. You'll find me at the bar with a smile on my face because there is no place I would rather be.
