Although there are a ton of dogs here, they actually board cats as well. They have an awesome room for cats with a play area and rocking chair that looks out on a bird feeder so they can watch the birdies. The staff is excellent at the Avondale location and they have taken care of my two cats on numerous occasions when I had to go out of town. The facility is clean and the staff is so attentive and sweet. The cats get playtime and cuddle time every day as part of the service. I almost think they were extra spoiled by the time they came home! I am absolutely planning on using Pete and Mac's Pet Resort the next time I'm in AZ and need to travel.
