Well done, Gelato Spot.

This place is pinched right between Zen 32 and Delux, and works as a complementary dessert to ... pretty much anything. 

I studied abroad in college and took a weekender to Florence, Italy where I was fortunate enough to scarf down some of the most unbelievably good ice cream or ice cream like substance I've ever had (it turned out to be gelato, obviously). 

This is the closest thing I have found anywhere in the US to that.
