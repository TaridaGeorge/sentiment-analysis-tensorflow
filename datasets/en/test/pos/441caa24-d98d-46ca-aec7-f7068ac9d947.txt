This is Starbucks. I love everything about it. It doesn't have the local mom and pop feel, but I knew that it wouldn't before I walked in the doors. Its not mom and pop. Its corporate. I never have to repeat my drink to the "baristas"
"Four shots over whipped cream" 
They just grab a cup and start brewin. At most local places, they always look at me with a puzzled look, ask me to repeat it, or suggest something completely different. 

Friendly staff. Quick WiFi. Awesome vibe. FAST
