This coffee is arte.  There is no place in LA or Seattle that can compare to the cup o'joe or espresso provided here.  I bought some beans and brewed at home this morning - amazing!
Not the best place to work due to dim lighting, little seating, and few electrical outlets but if you want to give your taste buds a bit of heaven...
