Beautiful course! Lot's of water...
Now I'm more a bucket of beer instead of a bucket of balls kind of gal, golf is not my best sport by any means.
We had our annual golf tournament here and everything went perfectly. The staff was wonderful and really worked with us to ensure our event was a success. 
This is a lovely location for any event!
