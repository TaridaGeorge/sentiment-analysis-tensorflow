Hellllooo Baskin Robbins.  When it's hot outside, I can't help but want ice cream from Baskin Robbins, I mean, they have 31 flavors after all!  It's so hard to choose because they're all good, but I end up getting the cookies and cream or the mint cookies and cream.  Boring, I know.  But I like to stick with the classics.

They also will make you all kinds of sundaes, shakes etc. but I have never veered into that direction.  I stick with what I know and what I know is mighty fine.
