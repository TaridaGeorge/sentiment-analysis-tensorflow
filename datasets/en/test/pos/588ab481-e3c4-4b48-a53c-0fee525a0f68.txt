Ode to my little vegan haven...you are the sweet escape from the strife and angst of eating out almost everywhere else other than my kitchen, a delicious relief from the menus that more resemble checklists of things I cannot/choose not to eat. I can at last read "chicken wings" and actually order them, extra sauce. I can drool at the thought of a po' boy sandwhich, spinach and artichoke dip, or spicy singapore noodles. I can wear a baseball cap, order chili fries and kick it with the home team. I can introduce you to all my beloved carnivores and listen to the "mmmmm"s without any questions as to why I choose to eat the way I do. ** Sigh **
