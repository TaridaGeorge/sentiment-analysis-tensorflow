I can't say enough that I LOVE this bar.  The food is amazing, the wings are a def item to get, cripsy enough skin and juice well cooked meat inside with bomb ass sauce.

The bartenders are extremely friendly, love return customers, and can make you an amazing cocktail that will get ya going, I recommend the Jungle Juice!

Then we have Karaoke and Trivia hosts who are let me say the bomb dot com.  They are friendly, exciting, want to involve everyone and make sure everyone enjoys themselves!

It may be considered a dive bar, but it's fun, relaxed, the patrons are so friendly and plenty of people to meet n greet that you just have fun with it.  It's my bar.
