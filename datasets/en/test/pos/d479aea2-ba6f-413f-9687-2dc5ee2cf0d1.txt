Downtown Chandler is definitely a hidden hot spot!  Latitude Eight is one reason why you should come by.  I love Thai food and Lat 8 fills my stomach with love!  They bring out that Thai flare and integrate American plating.  Ambience is trendy and sleek, definitely a date spot my friends.  Service was top notch - our waitress was funny and on top of things.  My food was nice and hot when it came and nice and gone soon after.  I appreciate a place that can take fried rice and bring it to the next level - try their Pineapple Fried Rice --- YUM! - Enjoy!
