BEST BRISKET IN ARIZONA.  I am a BBQ fanatic and extremely picky. Had the best from Texas to California, and have been let down by Arizona until I found this place. Only been going a year, I have my own Weber Smoky Mountain smoker and rarely eat BBQ out of the house.  This place, I can honestly say, makes better brisket than i am capable of at home no matter what i try.  Brine, inject, mop...noting seems to hold a candle to Bobby Q.  Have an onion brick, Brisket and Doughnut holes and SMILE!
