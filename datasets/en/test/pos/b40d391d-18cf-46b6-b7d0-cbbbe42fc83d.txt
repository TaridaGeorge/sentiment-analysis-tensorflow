Heard about this interesting steak house from Lindsay, my Yelping 'go to' and I am grateful. What a fun night, feeling "Mad Men' ish as we walked through the kitchen when entering the restuarant. 

Atmosphere was amazing and the food.... WOW. My fav had to be the amazing steak and bean chili/soup.... fantastic.

Steaks were our of this world and the mushrooms... devine.

When entering the restaurant we greeted by helpful eager staff ... with each one adding input into our experience.... especially Patti, our server. She was helpful, informative, fun and sealed the deal of a fantastic night. Thanks
