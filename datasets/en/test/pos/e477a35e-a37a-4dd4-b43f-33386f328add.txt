This is such a cool disc golf store, right next to the course at Vista del Camino. My wife and I went in "just to look around" after playing a round (just before going to the bar next door) and we were so pleased with the selection that we ended up buying 3 discs, a bunch of their excellent minis, etc.. This store also has a very high profile in sponsoring events and supporting the sport of disc golf. Another great thing they do is hold onto lost and found discs, which is important since many of the local courses have disc-eating water hazards...better yet, they even list the lost discs on their website!

If you're a disc golfer visiting Phoenix, you HAVE to stop by Spinners.
