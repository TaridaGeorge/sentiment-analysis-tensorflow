Went here last night for a friend's birthday party - were we blown away!

We were part of a large party upstairs. My wife and I had the Ace Pear Pint beer. I don't usually like beer, but this was particularly tasty. 

We also ordered the freshest Bavarian Pretzel you ever ate, which came with a spicy mustard that tantalized the tongue.

Lastly we had the ice cream cake. "Fuh-getta 'bout it" - amazing!!! 

We live in Chandler so it's a bummer we don't have one (but we do that SanTan Brewery, which is under same ownership and also quite good), so next time we'll probably hit the Tempe location.

Awesome job guys - I'll be spreading the word about you
