When I'm schlepping a car full of wee people around Phoenix to preschool and play-dates, Copper Star Coffee is the fuel that get me through. I patron their awesome car-hop service several times a week.  The staff is always friendly, and the service is speedy.  And of course, the coffee is absolutely delicious.

I like to order flavored iced coffees. They never over-sweeten--the taste of the coffee always comes through. I've also enjoyed their chai, and my mother-in-law enjoys their drip coffee. 

When I am free from baby-shackles, I love to sit inside with my laptop for some uninterrupted work time. The atmosphere inside is lovely with great music and natural light pouring in from the windows. 

Copper Star is the best place for keeping one's coffee-cash local!
