Sunday brunch was great It was a perfect day to enjoy the good food, a sangria and good companionship in the lovely outdoor setting.  There bread and pesto sauce served prior to the meal is to die for,  Over time I have had many of their menu items, all of them pleasing to me.  this visit I had oatmeal, one companion had a very delicious salad. (I tried it) The meal and the surroundings make this Sunday  a special day.  I must mention that there was a slight snag with our reservation but the manager Genevieve Wallick quickly resolved the problem.  The high quality of the management in this restaurant Is defiantly a plus and adds to the overall experience.
