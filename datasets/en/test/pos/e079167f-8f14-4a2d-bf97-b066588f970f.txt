If you love chicken wings, then this is the place to go!
They make your wings fresh right when you order it.
I always get the Lemon pepper and garlic parmesan chicken wings.  I usually ask for some hot sauce on the side to dip my garlic parmesan in. 

Everytime I go in, its not very busy at all.  I always get my wings within 15 minutes.  

Now that I'm writing this review, I think i'm going to go there tonight to get some wings.
