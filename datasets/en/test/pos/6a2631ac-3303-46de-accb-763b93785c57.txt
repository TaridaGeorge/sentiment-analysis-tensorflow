Never ever a bad meal here.  Great staff, salads, wings, and thin succulently tasty pizza.  Throw in a couple of meat balls swimming in sauce and melted motz and you have a night that you will actually miss, until you eat there again.  I love sitting at the bar here, the employees will always give you a great recommendation on things to try, and their local beer that they serve goes really well with whatever you order.  I'm taking my parent's here when they fly in this Friday!
