I don't hand out the 5s very often on Yelp or elsewhere. We had 2 pizzas: thin crust cheese and thin crust pep/onion. Both were terrific. I picked them up to eat at home. They were hot and ready on time. The place was packed at 7:30 on Saturday night. Fast service at the cashier. I am a pizza lover from Chicago - and I generally go with the deep stuff but went thin for the rest of the family. Crust was light and crunch and the taste was a great balance between the sauce and the cheeses. Toppings were fresh and tasty. Don't miss this great pizza!
