Food is unique and tasty. I got the grilled burrito with pork and let me tell you, I was extremely impressed by the succulence of the pork and the big array of flavour in my food. It's definitely not Mexican but a melting pot of all the different Latin countries. I was not much of a pork fan until I ate here with my wife. She got the chili verde enchiladas, those were spectacular!

Will definitely be going back!
