Easily one of the best Sushi restaurants in Scottsdale, we come here every so often.  It can get busy during week...best day to come is Sunday, when it's slow and you get more personal attention.

Some fav dishes I've had here are:

12 oz Filet, $46

Edamame, $4.50
Grilled Chicken Yakitori, $7.50
Deluxe Sashimi Platter - Market Price

The atmosphere in the restaurant is very modern and upscale.  You definitely pay for it when the bill comes, but it's worth it in my opinion.
