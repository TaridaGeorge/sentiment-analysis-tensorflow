Today was actually my first visit to this center as I had before gone to Jc Penny Optical, Target Optical and Macys Optical. They were so nice and Dr Clyde was especially nice, I was a little nervous, I hadnt been to the eye doctor in forever and I really hate the machine that blows air in you eye! I know its silly but the staff and the doctor were wonderful and I will be sticking to this place for a long while, They also were very nice since I did not have a lot of money in my bank account and were able to go over pricing with me. I was very happy when I left and that doesnt happen often with doctors appointments!
