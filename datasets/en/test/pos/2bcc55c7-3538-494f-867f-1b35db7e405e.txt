My wife and I decided to give the grill a try while staying at the Wigwam, after reading about it in the room magazine. We had ceasar salads that were great to start.  I had Chef Matt's burger. It was one if the best tasting burgers I have ever had. It came with very thick cut bacon, onions, lettuce, and the best part, a Guiness and honey reduction sauce that I would have taken home by the gallon. My wife had the Kobe meatloaf. It was also amazing. It came atop mashed potatoes and with a gravy that was simply awesome. The whole combo was mouthwatering. We will definitely go back. Possibly tomorrow.
