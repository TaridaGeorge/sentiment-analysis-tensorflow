This review may need to be taken with a grain of salt, as I adore all self-serve frozen yogurt places, and fro-yo in general!  However, this place offers wonderful, extravagent flavors as well as all my favorite toppings.  I would highly reccomend their yogurt to anyone.  My stamp of approval, 100%.
