I love this location!  I've been to several Buckles in the valley and this one is the best by far.  I do appreciate a great salesperson and they do a great job.  If you like fashion, this place is a must.  Just let  them know your likes and what you love to wear and they'll get you some options.  

They like to sell so they'll let you know you look great. I appreciate a honest person who says that looks terrible and will help you get a better fit.  This place does just that.  

Get your punch card, they'll combine them if you forget.  They hem for free. They'll mail you out your purchase as well for an additional $5.
