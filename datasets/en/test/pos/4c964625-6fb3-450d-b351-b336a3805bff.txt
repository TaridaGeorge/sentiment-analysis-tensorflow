I have always had great service here,even when it's busy.The food is excellent but expensive.They do have an awesome happy hour which makes up for the costly prices.Great selection of beers and awesome martinis make coming here worth it. They also have a pretty cool patio for when the weather is nice.i definately reccomend the yard house.
