You can't beat the lunch deals.  15 different options and they are all good.  Most are $6.25 as of this review.  The lunch specials come with a really yummy chicken soup with ginger and a egg roll.   Both are good.

It is sometimes tough to get a group of 6 or more a table at peak lunch time (11:45).  If you have a big group get there by 11:15 or come after 12:15.

I haven't been there for dinner.
