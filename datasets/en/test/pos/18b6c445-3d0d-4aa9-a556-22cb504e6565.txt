Yesterday I went there for Carwash and the manager named Valentino noticed oxidation on my car and offered me to sample his new buffing machine & the result was fabulous. My Black car use to look like greyish silver because of the oxidation before. I got my whole car done. My 8 year old car looks like new now. I can see my reflection on the hood again :P
My best Carwash experience period. friendly staff & I can totally recommend this place to anyone in the area.
