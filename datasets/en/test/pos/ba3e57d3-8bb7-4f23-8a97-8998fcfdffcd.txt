Great event, good cause, good run.  Nice mini-tour through Tempe (4.2 miles) to honor Pat Tillman #42.  The run is scenic, plenty of water available and tons of sponsors giving away free stuff.  Very crowded now a days, but that is to be expected.  Pick up your tag and shirt  days before the event though to avoid the chaos.  Overall a well organized event and a well known Tempe tradition.
