Wow, so nice and shiny inside.  Went to see The Swell Season here and they sang a couple of songs off mike and their voices carried very well through the entire theater.   Acoustically speaking, quite an accomplishment. 

No security guards, just little old lady's showing you to your seat, so I guess you could bum rush the stage and start a mosh pit if you really felt the need too.

I'll check the schedule and see what they have playing soon and then get a dressed up and act adult like for the evening ---for a change.

Bad news, they they had only two bars with one server each for the whole event.
