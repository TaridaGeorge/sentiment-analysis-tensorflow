I have traveled around the world and always try the local fish and chips.  The second best fish and chips I have found are in Anstruther, Scotland.  The best?  They are located down on Washington and 32nd street in Phoenix, Arizona, the Knock Kneed Lobster.  Not a fancy place, just the best fish and chips in the world!
