I agree with my fellow Yelper, Kari E.: "Holy crap!"  This was SO much more than I expected!

I was there for a small networking event this morning, declined the tour, and was very sorry that I did.  I walked into and past a few of the exhibit areas, and found them totally cool.  I will be back for the full tour.

Examples of a couple of the coolest exhibits I saw: 1) a room that housed guitars by Eric Clapton, Carlos Santana, and Paul Simon, to name just a few, and 2) the Conservation Room which has glass doors/windows so that you can view the scientific process of conserving an instrument.

From old Victrolas to room size [Hungarian, I think] organs, the place is friggin' huge!  120,000SF of which 90,000 SF is exhibit space.

Just beautiful; can't wait to go back!
