I'm not sure if it is a good thing that I moved very close to this Total Wine store.  There prices can't be beat, at least on the wine that I know of, but the more I save the more I seem to spend.  It just happens! I love their wine selection here and the enjoy the wine tasting offered here.  I know my wine and I know this is the place to go to get a decent bottle for a fitting price.
I will be back time and time again!
