Love this spot- especially for weekend breakfasts. Not to sound like a pervert or anything, but the staff is quite good looking, and very nice as well. I've been here several times, and always received excellent service. 
 Good people-watching spot, but the food is also very good.  Everything I've tried here has been scrumptious and fairly priced. Try the protein pancakes. Also, as others have stated, come here to take advantage of the bottomless mimosas.
