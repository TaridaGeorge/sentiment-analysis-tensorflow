First let me say, i'm not a Frozen Yogurt guy, i'm an Icre Cream, more GELATO guy..my friend told me to try this place & i did, thinking it would be like other yogurt places & plain old just have no flavor...I WAS WRONG! This place is GREAT, clean, excellent service...i got the Salted Caramel & put some nutella as a topping & BAM..all this by the way was only $3.50 i'm impressed at what you get for your money!!


1 more thing, TO THOSE THAT COMPLAIN ABOUT PRICE...Have you ever been to a Gelato shop? This is much cheaper, this isn't a Klondike Bar folks + STOP FILLING UP YOUR CUP & TOPPINGS LIKE A P I G then when its time to pay you complain oh its $7-$8...my total was $3.50 and i had a nice amount that filled me up

highly recommended!
