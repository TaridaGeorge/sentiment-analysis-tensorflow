What a great find!!! 
It's not about the appearance on the outside but what is definitely good on the inside.

The rating on this restaurant is solely on their Mexican breakfast.  
My guest & I had very delicious meals (machaca, chilaquiles & huevos / chorizo ruevueltos & huevos).  Everything was cooked perfectly and nothing was saturated with grease.  The pricing was expected for the great quality & preparation of the food.    

Friendly service.
Nice ambience. 
Excellent food.
