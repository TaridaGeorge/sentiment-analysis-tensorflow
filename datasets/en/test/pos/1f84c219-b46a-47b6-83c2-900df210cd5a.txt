Basha's deserves it's motto "Your Hometown Grocer" many time over. Now that I live in SE Chandler, where several members of the Basha family live,  maybe I'm biased; but Basha's has always been my favorite grocery store.

First of all, the stores are the perfect size-- not too small, but not so big you get lost in them.  Best of all they're small enough that the folks there recognize you after only a return visit or two. This particular store location is staffed with friendly cashiers, offers free childcare, has an extensive organic selection, and an amazing bakery where the bread is always fresh. 

The Basha family has donated untold amounts to education, the arts, the environment and the community here. The least I can do is buy my milk and eggs from them.
