Really? A 3.5 star review for a place that has cheesy tater tots, thats ludacris. I have been visiting town for 3 days and found myself at the lodge all 3 days. They have 2 dollar mimosas for Sunday Brunch... The waitress' and bartenders are so nice and really make you feel comfortable when hanging out there for hours on end. Even the busser was on top refilling water and clearing the table immediatly even wiping it down.  Drinks are strong and food is amazing. I had the chicken salad sandwich and sweet potato fries...So fresh. I can't wait to come back next time I visit.
