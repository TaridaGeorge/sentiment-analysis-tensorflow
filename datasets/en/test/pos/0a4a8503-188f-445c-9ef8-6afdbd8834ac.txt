I pay almost $120 month in fees for our family of 5 but it is sooooo worth it.  Just the two hours per day of free childcare for my 3 kiddos is worth it.  I love the group fitness classes, the place is always clean and pretty well stocked.  The cafe has yummy smoothies and the pool is lush.  What else could you ask for in a gym?
