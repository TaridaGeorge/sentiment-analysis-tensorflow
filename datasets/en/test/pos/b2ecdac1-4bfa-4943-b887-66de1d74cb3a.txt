To put it simply--THIS PLACE ROCKS.  Why you ask?  Well, for starters, you won't waste half your life waiting in line, which is the usual if you frequent the the 'real' USPS on Bell.  Second, they're open til 9PM, so you aren't confined to a 5PM close--you can drop off packages after work!  Third, the people that work there are always pleasant and friendly.  Fourth, Party Planet is the 'Ultimate party super store'.   So, in case I forgot to pick up a grass skirt or need to rent a margarita machine, I can take care of it, after I send my care packages.  What more could you possibly want!
