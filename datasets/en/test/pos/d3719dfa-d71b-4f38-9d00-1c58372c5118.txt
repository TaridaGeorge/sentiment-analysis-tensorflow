I love 24 Hour Fitness !  We prefer the 43rd Ave & Bell location and when they close early on the weekends we go to the Metro Center location which is open daily 24 hrs.

Why We Like 24 Hour Fitness:
Friendly & Cheerful Staff
Great Kids Center
Always Clean
Private Showers
Jacuzzi Always Clean & Hot
Pool Is Huge
Members & Atmosphere Laid Back
Plenty Of Equipment
Workers Are Always Cleaning

And finally I can work out at 1AM !
