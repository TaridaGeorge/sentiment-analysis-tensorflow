I takes about 3 minutes for me to walk to this subway from my apartment....and it is always worth it. The guys that make sandwiches there are the best in the business and they are always so friendly and polite. If you go late enough they will even give you freebies...because they are only going to throw them out anyway....so they just give them away. We all love something free...and if you don't then shame on you....LOL!!! Seriously though this guys rock and I will past many subways just to give these guys my money because they show you love for real. So if your ever in my hood over here near paradise valley and Cactus Rd....need a sandwich...and if you late enough coming from the club or a party and want some freebies as well....visit this locale you won't be sorry. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!
