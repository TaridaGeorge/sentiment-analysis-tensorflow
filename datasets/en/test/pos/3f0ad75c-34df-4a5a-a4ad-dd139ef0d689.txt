This is a great place! I am in Tempe for a week on business and was referred here by friends (and saw the great Yelp reviews, too); rode my bike 3.5 miles to get here...
     The first thing you see is the cool, quasi-hippie decor (awesome!); the menu has a great variety from Asian to burgers to Italian... I had the Kung Pao with mock chicken; it was spiced very nicely and the "chicken" tasted quite good! I am not a vegetarian, and even I was impressed! :) I had the Coco Loco Tsoynami for dessert and it was *amazing!* creamy like ice cream, but not quite as filling.
     I will definitely come here again on my next visit to Tempe!
