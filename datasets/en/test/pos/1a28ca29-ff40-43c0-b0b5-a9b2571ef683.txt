When I first saw Saffron's set up at the farmers market the first thought that came to mind was that I couldn't wait to try their food.

I've had just about every one of their handcrafted savory pies and every time I finish I say I have a new favorite. Andrea, formerly trained chef/owner, has a ton of passion, and skill, for her craft, does it up right.

If they aren't in retail by the end of the year I'd be surprise....
