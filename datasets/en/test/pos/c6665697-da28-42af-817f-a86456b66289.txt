I do not understand less than four stars. We had six different plates. Beet Salad, Rabit, Butter,Scallops,Strawberry desert, and Peach desert.  All were brilliant. Our favorite (both agreed) was the Beet Salad. It was so fresh and had a perfect combo of flavors and textures. 

Service was way more than perfect. One note they are now BYOB with a corkage fee for Beer and Wine. No fee if the Beer or Wine is from Arizona.

One note for FnB we were preplexed with the lack of pork on the menu :-)
