Havana Cigars not only sports the largest walk-in humidor in Arizona, the store itself is a great place to hang out and enjoy a fine cigar. With the free WiFi they offer, I call this place my office away from the office. The owner is super friendly and is great about throwing events that draw in the local crowd of cigar connoisseurs.

Unless I'm out of town, Havana Cigars it is the only place I'll go to buy fine cigars.
