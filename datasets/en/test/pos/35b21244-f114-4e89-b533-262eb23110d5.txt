I went on the 90 minute trail ride.  I highly recommend it.  It was a nice ride thru the open area, small hills and water.  The horses are for all levels and sure footed trail horses.  We had small children riding up to us older people.  I had Big Red (horse).  Only ride Big Red if you have some experience.  He is quite large and a little bit of a bully.  We saw the Bald Eagles.  That was an amazing experience.  It appears they have some other activities.  There were also off road vehicles available.
