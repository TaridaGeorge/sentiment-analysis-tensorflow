If you're a landlord, property manager, or HOA, these are the guys you want on your team. They offer corporate accounts so billing and scheduling is quick and painless. Their pricing is very competitive, and the service technicians are highly knowledgeable and able to communicate effectively throughout the process, from scheduling to job completion. They fit multiple units of mine onto the schedule the same day I called, and all of my tenants had great things to say about the tech's professionalism and courtesy. Plus, all of their employees are background screened and drug tested, and as a locally owned franchise, Rooter Hero keeps my money here in AZ. Thanks guys.

PS...Service tech Raymond is the man...thanks Ray!
