I admit I don't really know how to do stars for a place that (almost) exclusively sells olive oil and vinegar...      I have nothing to compare. 

Well,  the owner is extremely friendly and inviting - happy to share her knowledge -  the oil selections are thoughtful and unique and while I'm not some sort of oil or vinegar expert  I have every reason to believe it's top notch quality.      They even have butter and bacon flavored olive oils,  and a caramel flavored balsamic vinegar...  MMMMM!

I'm going to say 5 stars because for this kind of business I just don't know how they could be better,  except maybe selling bread and coffee on premises..

Edit:  There are apparently 2 yelp listings for this place,  I think because they recently moved.   It's definitely here on Baseline,  at the address on this Yelp page.
