I went to Chodang last night and wish I had some leftovers... :(

I had a #9 tofu soup and let me warn you...don't be scared of the spice! I Was and ordewred it level one....which wasn't even taco bell spicy (and I'm a wimp!)! So at least go for a level 3 spice in your tofu soup!

Order some Hite too!
