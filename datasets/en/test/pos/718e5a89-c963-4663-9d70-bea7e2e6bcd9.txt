LOVED this for our new driver!  Ask for Eric- he's FABULOUS.  Really knowledgeable, but easy going with a teenager.  Great temperment for a driving teacher.  Much better than me saying, stop...stooppp  STOOOPPPPPPPP! in my daugher's ear.    I'd save their 'crash course' for more experienced drivers, but the personalized 1:1 driving classes were terrific.  We will use them again when our youngest starts to drive!
