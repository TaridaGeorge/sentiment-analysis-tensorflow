Although I don't know much about bridal stores, my sister went to this store recently and can't stop talking about how great her experience was.  She was visiting from out of town and staying with me, so after listening to her rave about "David's Bridal by Fashion Square" non-stop for 3 days I figured I better give the store props!  Thanks for making this part of the wedding planning go so smoothly for her!
