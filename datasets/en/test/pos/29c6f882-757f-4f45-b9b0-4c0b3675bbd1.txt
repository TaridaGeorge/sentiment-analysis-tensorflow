I have been coming here for all my nail needs for almost 8 years now. The girls are always super nice and do such a quick but precise job and the nails last months as long as you dont mess with them. Pedicures are long, come with a leg massage and they do such an awesome job with hand drawn designs. Prices are great for the quality and pleasant experience. I live in oldtown scottsdale but drive 20 miles every two weeks to get all of my nail needs taken care of here. Have tried finding places closer to my apt, but am always pissed off with service and quality.
