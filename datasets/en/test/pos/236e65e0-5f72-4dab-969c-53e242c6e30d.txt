Wow, this might be my new favorite food and happy hour spot. Which is odd, seeing that it's really nice here compared to most of the Mexican food joints I frequent.  Too often, those look like they're in a constant state of construction or disrepair. Anyway, the exterior looks like a small, quaint house with maybe 6-7 parking spots. Inside, there's various tables, booths and a bar to sit at. The corner booth we sat at had a copper table top and looked great. 

This might be one of the best margaritas I've had. It's fresh and squeezed, not like the premix stuff you get at most places. They also had draft beer and other mixed drinks. I only had a small bit of the Carne Asada but it tasted fantastic. I definitely am coming back here with a date sometime.
