I have to hand it to Sprint, they've seriously stepped up their game. As a heavy BlackBerry user, things are bound to go wrong with my phone from time to time. Trackball replacements? No problemo! Dropped it off here, came back in an hour, and it felt like a new phone. 

People here seemed really nice. At first, I wasn't sure about the systematic way they see customers here. (You check in, and they help you chronologically based on your arrival at the store) But after a few visits, I've grown to like the way it works. It assures that you won't fall in the cracks and have to actually ask for assistance. I know I personally hate asking for things. Service representatives are speedy too. :)

PS - this store is NICE. It looks like its brand new. Very clean, very 2010.
