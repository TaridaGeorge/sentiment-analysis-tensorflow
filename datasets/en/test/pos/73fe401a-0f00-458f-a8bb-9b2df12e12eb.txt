This is by far the best shuttle experience I've ever had! Doug was our shuttle driver from the Phoenix-Mesa airport to the Westin Kierland in Scottsdale. He was right on time, funny, friendly, and had a clean and nice van. With an early return flight, we were thankful he only does direct and single party trips, so no extra stops along the way! With the best rates and far superior service, be sure to ride the Dougie when you're in need of a lift in Phoenix!
