Love this place!!! The waitstaff was really friendly and helpful. Never a dull moment of conversation with them. The drinks were well made and since we went during happy hour a very good price. The cheese platter was tasty and we munched on that the entire time since they didn't go cheap on bread, fruits, and sides. One thing I will say about My Florist is they may possibly have one of the best pianist I've ever heard. If you only come for one thing you should come just to listen to her play. Amazing. The prices are reason, the decor is fun, the staff is great, the entertainment is A+. Promise if you go you'll have a good time!
