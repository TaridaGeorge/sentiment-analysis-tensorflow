I experienced Famous Daves BBQ late one after work. A co-worker and I stopped by during the last half hour and he promised the food was amazing: he wasn't kinding!

We had a sampler with BBQ sandwiches, but before we got our food the waitress gave a little tutorial on all their famous sauces in a cool little presentation (that we got to taste of course). My favorite sauce: rich and sassy! The best part about Famous Daves is that you can buy the sauces to take home. And, be sure to check out your WalMart because they might even have the famous sauce for sale. :) 

All around Famous Daves is great! And its a national chain, so you can find them all over the country.
