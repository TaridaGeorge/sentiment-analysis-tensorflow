I love yogurtology!  This is the kind of place North Scottsdale has needed.  I like that it is kept clean; tables are quickly cleaned after each use and the yogurt and topping areas are clean.  Every time I've been there it is sufficiently staffed, and trash cans are emptied when full.  The atmosphere is great with upbeat music.  It is constantly abuzz with customers and is a fun place to spend time.  The product quality is good and the fruit is always fresh, but the attention to maintanence and fun social setting is what keeps our family coming back.
