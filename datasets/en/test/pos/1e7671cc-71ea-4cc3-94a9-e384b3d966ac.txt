My husband and I eat out a lot and we had the best dining experience ever the other night! We sat at the bar with the bartender AJ and he was such a delight! We had happy hour which was probably the best deal in town! 5 dollar glasses of wine and half priced appetizers!?! My favorite was the steamed mussels. We loved it so much we also had dinner. The classic pasta deal was the best. Getting to take one home gives you at least two more meals, the next day. It's hard in this economy to get more bang for your buck but Maggianos they are doing it right! We will defiantly be back for more!
