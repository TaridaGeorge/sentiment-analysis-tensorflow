Really good service!!  I had to start out with that because the past couple of places we visited although the food was good, service unimpressive at best.  We had their lunch buffet and the food was fresh, even in the late afternoon towards the end of the buffet time.  They brought us fresh naan and came by to see how we were doing.  Maybe it was because we had a cute kid with us but we felt very welcomed there.  

Good service, good food.  It doesn't get much better than that.
