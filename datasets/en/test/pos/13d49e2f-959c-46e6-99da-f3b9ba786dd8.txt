Unfortunately, Aladdin's is CLOSED.

A shame!  Or at least it appears closed...  I stopped by this afternoon and the property had been reclaimed by the landlord (with a notice up on the front door).  Most of the decorations are gone.

Hope the owners are able to open a new restaurant soon, because this place had delicious food.
