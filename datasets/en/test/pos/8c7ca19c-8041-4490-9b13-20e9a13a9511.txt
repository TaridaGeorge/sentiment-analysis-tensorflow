Again, Aiello's was an amazing experience!  I took my bf here for his birthday and it was another great meal.  The service is really what makes the experience a 5-star, along with the amazing food.  I love walking into a restaurant and smelling the great food instantly.

We ordered the caprese salad, which was comp't because the server was embarrassed to bring it out with no basil, which they were out of!  I had the ziti and the bf had tortilini.  The meal was amazing and the service was top-notch!  We had a chance to chat with the owner a couple of times.

I love this place and will keep coming back when I need a great Italian food fix!
