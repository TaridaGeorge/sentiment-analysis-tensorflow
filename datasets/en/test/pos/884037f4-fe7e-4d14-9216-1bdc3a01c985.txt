I never knew this movie theater existed. I mean I don't frequent paradise valley mall that often, and when I go, I have tunnel vision as I go straight to the stores I need to go to and get the heck out of there. So when Travelzoo had their movie special ( two tickets, 1 large popcorn and two large drinks for $15), I couldn't pass it up. The theater is small but very quaint. The seats are EXTREMELY comfortable and they kinda recline. How cool is that. Plus the best part? the staff are super duper friendly. A huge win in my book. I will definitely be going back to this cute little hidden gem of a theater.
