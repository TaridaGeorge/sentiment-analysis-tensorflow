The best wings in Arizona... hands down.  Their pizza is very good, and they make rib-eye / romaine / crispy onion salad that is amazing called the Beefstro.  We've been here more than 2 dozen times, and never had a bad experience.  Yes, you will have to wait up to an hour or more if you go on a Friday or Saturday night, or most nights during the peak (non-summer) season, but that should tell you something.  There is a reason why you have to wait an hour at Oregano's while the joint next door has a sandwich board sign out front proclaiming 'no wait here!'
