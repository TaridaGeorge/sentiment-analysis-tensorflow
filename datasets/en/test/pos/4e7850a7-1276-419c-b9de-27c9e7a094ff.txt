What great place for coffee and desserts. The caramel fondue was so delicious, and couldn't get enough of the chocolate ganache crepe.  The restaurant is set as you are in the Swiss Alp.  The bathroom continues with the theme.  The service was excellent.  I think that the owner must love moo moo's. I need to go back to try the dinner menu.
