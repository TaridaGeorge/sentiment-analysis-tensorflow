I Loved NOCA and will be returning. Do not be scared off by the strip mall location. 

My boyfriend and I went last weekend and we both loved it. To start he had the corn soup, which he loved even after being surprised by the fact that a 'chilled' soup is cold. I had the broccoli salad, which they kindly made sans the pancetta for this vegetarian and it was outstanding. It is making me hungry just thinking about it. We both had pasta, his with a meat sauce and mine without and we both ate every bite. For desert I nibbled on the cotton candy and he ate every last bite (he is not a desert eater) of a s'more type treat. 

The cocktails were great and original, even the ice was unique. I would definitely recommend NOCA and I will return.
