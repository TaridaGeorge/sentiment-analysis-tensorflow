LOVED this place! My husband & I stopped by tonight and everything was perfect.  Complimentary salad & Miso Soup while we looked over the menu. 
We went for the happy hour and they had a great selection & great prices.  Good size rolls too, we ordered only 3 rolls and were both full!
We were the only people in the whole place so they definitely need more advertising or something because it was delicious!  Hands down the best sushi my husband and I have ever had..and we like to try EVERY sushi place!
We will definitely be back!
