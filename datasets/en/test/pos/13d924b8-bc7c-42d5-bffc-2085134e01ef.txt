The kids who were working here when we stopped in for some sugar and caffeine before heading home (our last little stop in our 53 day honeymoon adventure) were super nice and friendly! We didn't expect much from a DD in Wickenburg, AZ, but this was just as good as the ones in Massachusetts.  Maybe even better since the employees seemed happy and friendly!
