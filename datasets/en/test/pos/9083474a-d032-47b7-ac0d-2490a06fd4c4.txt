I had a great experience here, I recently moved to Phoenix, AZ and was told by some friends that since I loved 80's rock to go on Sunday night to see the band Metalhead which I was thrilled just at the sound of a band that covers 80's rock and anxious to see if they were any good and even more so to hear the lead singer. To say the least I was blown away by how great they sounded and the venue Martini ranch has for local music to play.  Needless to say I will be back on many more Sundays to come!!
