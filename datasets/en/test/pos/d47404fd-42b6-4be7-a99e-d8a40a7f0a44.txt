We had a fantastic experience. The menu looks awesome and has lots of exciting specialty pizzas we plan to try. This time we stuck with a pepperoni pizza... Garlic crust and boneless wings. The pizza was epic. Perfect dough to sauce to cheese ratio and the crust sealed this as a unique pie. The service was quick, courteous and super nice... All this and the pizza was $6! highly recommended!!
