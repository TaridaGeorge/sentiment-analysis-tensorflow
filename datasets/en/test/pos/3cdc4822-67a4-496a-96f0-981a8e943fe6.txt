Awesome food with decent drinks.  They have better drinks than Taiwan express but the menu is allot smaller.  I highly recommend Lollicup if you like Chinese food that doesn't taste like glorified Panda Express.  Whenever I go It's patrons are usually all speaking Chinese which is how I gauge food authenticity.  More native patrons equals more authentic food.
