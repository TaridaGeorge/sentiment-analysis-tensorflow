I've been to Pomegranate at least three times already, and each experience was excellent. I absolutely adore this establishment. 
I love the vegetarian/vegan menu and I love that everything is fresh and local!!
What makes this place so special is that it is VERY clear that the owners and employees take pride in their work. Everyone is genuinely kind and helpful. 
Oh, and the food/drinks = bomb.
