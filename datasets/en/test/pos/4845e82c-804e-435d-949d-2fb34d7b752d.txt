I will never drink another iced coffee unless it comes from Royal at the Market.  Ever. I promise. Seriously.  If my hot cup of coffee gets lukewarm, I'll be forced to throw it away because then I'd be cheating on you.  And that would be rude and mean.  I'd never hurt your feelings like that. I promise.
