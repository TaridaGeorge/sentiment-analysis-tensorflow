This place was a wonderful surprise. The food was delicious and the atmosphere was quite comfortable. Our server, Ally, went out of her way to be sure our party of four was taken care of. In fact, the service was world class, yet the prices were neighborhood eatery. We will go back again and again!  Now I know what a pasty is!
