So I have re-evaluated my experiences at Zipps in Gilbert and I have decided that I should really update my review. I LOVE ZIPPS. Great happy hour. Great bar food. Great service. Great management and employees. One employee specifically, ERICA, always provides the best service imaginable. Go to Zipps, find Erica, and tell her that Tim sent you.
