This place is awesome. The food is good, cheap and plentiful. It's by far the best hummus and tabouli in town. Ask for the handmade pita, it's worth the little extra they charge. The iced tea is also my favorite anywhere, it has a slight cinnamon taste to it and it's delicious. Service has always been good and whenever I make the trek out there, I stock up on spices, rice, and couscous in the grocery. I've never had a bad meal here, and I've been going over ten years.
