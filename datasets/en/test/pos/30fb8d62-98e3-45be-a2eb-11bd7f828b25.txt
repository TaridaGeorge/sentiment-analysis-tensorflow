Took a friend from out of town and had the perfect night at Sens.  Our waitress was awesome, and the food, music and drinks were pretty much perfect.  Got mackerel sushi that was really tasty.  Duck salad was delicate and delicious.  Shu mai, panko shrimp, about 4 other dishes later we were stuffed and pleasantly sauced on sake and white wine.  DJ slipped into an 80's coma for a track or so, but was otherwise on the spot.  And again, very reasonably priced--$60 per person for three lazy hours of noshing and boozing.
