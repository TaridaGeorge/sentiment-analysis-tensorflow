Dottsy Z. and I met here last week to try their new happy hour and we had an amazing time! The weather was perfect, the patio beautiful, and the company was amazing.

Their happy hour menu featured a nice variety of white and red wines, all for $6, plus we tried the escargot, pate, and frites as well. We spoke to chef, who was very knowledgeable and able to accommodate gluten free items, especially if you call a day or two in advance. 

We topped off the night with a decadent creme brulee and imported cocoa dusted truffles, which capped off the evening on a perfect note.
