Had the roatsed beet salad and was looking forward to a a healthy lunch.  I discovered the best, most nutritous, edible, satisfying beet salad I had ever tasted.  The beets were perfectly roasted and warm, the goat cheese complimented the flavors of all the colors of beets, appealing to all the senses......

OMG!!!!!   I am not a salad person, but if I could get to Tryst Cafe daily this salad would be at least 3x a week.  Friendly and knowledgable staff as always with smiles on their faces.
