Roberto's was awesome! Perfect first stop on our Food Network Road Trip, and it couldn't have been better! The owner was so welcoming and even sent us t-shirts in the mail! The food was excellent! The misters outside were so welcoming in the warm Phoenix weather! Went off recommendations from the owner and the episode of Diners Drive-Ins & Dives and the burritos we had did not disappoint! We will definitely be back!!
