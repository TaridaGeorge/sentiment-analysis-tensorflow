We love LAMP Pizzeria -  What a little gem in North Scottsdale.  We started with Italian glass of wine, ordered white bean and arugula salad (added some Proscuitto to the salad) and had side of their appetizer meatballs.  I'm Italian girl making meatballs the old fashion way for 30 years - OK...they were just like mine - Perfect.  The pizzia has the best crust and toppings - We have been back several times and are very happy every visit.  The wait staff is very friendly, but the best was the Owner, Lindsay took the time to talk to us and now knows us - so it is our new and most favorite place to go for salad, appetizers, and of course their amazing Pizza.  Lindsay's husband Matt makes the incredible Pizza.  Try it and you will be back.
