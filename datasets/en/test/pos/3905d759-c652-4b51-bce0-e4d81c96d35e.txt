I got stuck at the Phoenix Airport a few weeks ago for SEVEN HOURS!! It was horrible. The only thing that saved me from insanity was Sauce's fantastic red wine and pizza menu. There's no better way to kill a day at the airport than by getting tipsy on wine with perfect strangers. They have a super classy menu that is shockingly affordable for an airport. I had this great artichoke, olive, and portabella mushroom pizza, handmade and cooked in an oven right in front of me... at an airport! The restaurant is decorated in a very modern and trendy style. Like something you'd see in downtown Portland, not in Phoenix and especially not at an airport. If you're ever stuck at PHX, eat here.
