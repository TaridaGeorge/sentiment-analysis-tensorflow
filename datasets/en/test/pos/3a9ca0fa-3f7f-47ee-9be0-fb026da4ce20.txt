Woohoo! This is the most amazing burger you will ever taste!! 

Lets start out with the cute little log cabin feel, this place is seriously rugged and worn, but in the greatest old western town kinda way. We in Arizona can greatly appreciate this feeling since we are from the Wild West. :)

Food... I like food and my burgers, well, I like them charcoal broiled! They cook the burgers on a charcoal grill right in front of you, the smell is amazing!!  The fries are good, at best, and the onion rings are about the same. 

Price is good too, my boo and I spend about $20 for 2 burgers, fries, onion rings and beer :)
