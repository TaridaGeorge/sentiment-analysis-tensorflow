We were referred to this paint and body shop by someone at my wife's place of work. I have seen and know there is a tremendous variance in quality of work at body shops so I went in skeptical.  But i must say Jay was tremendous.  Very professional in explaining the damage and options available to us. He was clear and honest in his description of the repair process and time frame involved for our Subaru's repair.  I only wish we had a Mercedes or Ferrari worthy of their craft.  But hey, work is work these days right?
