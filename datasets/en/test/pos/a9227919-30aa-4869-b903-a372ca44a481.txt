When it comes to Asian food, Thai is my go-to. And when it comes to Thai food, I have my favorite, and it's Thai House in North Scotty. Their curries are full of flavor--panang chicken, spicy 3 is my favorite--and I've recently become borderline-obsessed with their pad thai. Never had a bad experience, and their food is very reasonably priced.

Go to Thai House. Do it. Do it now.
