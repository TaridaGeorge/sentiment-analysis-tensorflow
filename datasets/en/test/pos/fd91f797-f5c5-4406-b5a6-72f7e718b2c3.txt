Good market for fresh produce, Vietnamese, and Asian goods.  We shop there weekly (my wife and I).  My wife is from Vietnam, and I am Asian Indian background.  The following are the reasons we shop here:

1) Availability of products
2) Quality of products
3) Cost of the products

Note:  My parents in Chicago often call me asking me to send goods to them from here because they are not available in the markets there.  My father and mother have to come there when they visit me in Mesa AZ.
