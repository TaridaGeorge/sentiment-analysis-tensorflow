my wife was excited to read about this place. surprisingly the place had been open since February, but we had hand't heard of it until this last week.
awesome little vegan, raw, healthy food cafe.
chatted to the owner for some time - discussed vegan cheese cake recipes  and swooped notes. very knowledgeable lady owner and very friendly staff, nice selection of drinks, snacks and main courses.
the salad my wife ordered was rather large and very tasty, but couldn't be finished.
I had the rice, black beans, guacamole and mixed veggies bowl - yummy.
