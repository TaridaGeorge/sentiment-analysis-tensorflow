In Texas I would rate Rudy's about three stars however in the Phoenix area it is the best there is. They have nice moist brisket where you can actually see and taste the smoke ring. To me, you judge a good BBQ place by their brisket and this place holds it's own. If brisket is not smoked long enough it just tastes like crappy pot roast. That is unfortunately the case with most places in the valley. The only other place I can recommend around here is Texas BBQ House in Phoenix although once Rudy's moved in, even though Rudy's is a chain I have to say they are still slightly better. The Green Chile Stew is really great tasting. As is the turkey and Jalapeno sausage. Overall, if you are looking for good BBQ in the valley this is the best you are going to find.
