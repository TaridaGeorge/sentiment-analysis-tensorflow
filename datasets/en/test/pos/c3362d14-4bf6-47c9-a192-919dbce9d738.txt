Fantastic facility, I only had an hour here and I must return for a more in depth trip.  The architecture and layout are beautiful.  As a lifelong musician, it was difficult to not touch EVERYTHING!  A very comprehensive collection of instruments. The hand held "story" unit with headphones synced up with various looped videos of musical performances recorded from around the world.
