What an incredible way to end our Spring Break trip to AZ!  We got to see our beloved Texas Rangers beat the Dodgers on a beautiful afternoon and then we had the best meal, service and hospitality EVER at Zing!  Our party of 5 enjoyed 3 cheese grilled cheese, monte cristo, mac and cheese and those ever-tantilizing sweet potato fries with tiger sauce.  We loved it all.   James, the owner, and our server  made us feel like family and the chef even came out to talk to us.  We HIGHLY recommend Zing for the food, atmosphere, drinks (something James whipped up special for us) and all at a cost that made it a tremendous value.  Don't miss this spot the next time you are ANYWHERE near the Phoenix area.
