great casual atmosphere and interesting food!    Chrysa Robertson and her gang do a great job with local and organic foods.

the lamb chops are succulent and savory.    also, you will never go wrong with the scallops when they have them.

"mom's pecan bar" with icecream is a great way to finish your meal.....and of course they have GREAT fresh roasted coffee
