As promised, I returned to DeFalco's Italian Grocery last week for another cheesesteak. I was offered a choice of either a crunchy or a soft roll, this time I opted for the soft roll. The frizzled beef was well seasoned and not greasy. The cheese was melted and mixed throughout, warm gooey goodness on a soft Italian roll which was reminiscent of a fresh Amoroso roll. I asked for hot sauce and was offered Tabasco. Once again, kudos to Anthony DeFalco for his willingness to incorporate customer feedback. That's truly as good as it gets!
