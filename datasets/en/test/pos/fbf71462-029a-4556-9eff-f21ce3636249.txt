Love this place!  We have stopped in here quite a few times since they have opened and always have a good time.  It seems to be our Sunday Funday destination!  The bar staff is friendly and personable (we love Heather, Ashley and Dan).  The food is unique (sort of like upscale campfire food) and delicious.  Oh and Bonfire has THE BEST MACARONI AND CHEESE in town!  Hot and bubbly, a Vermont White Cheddar mac and cheese that comes out in a mini cast iron skillet.  It is simply amazing!  I tried the Pecan Grilled Harris Ranch Burger last night for the first time and it was fantastic.  Very juicy and tasty!  Hands down one of the best burgers I have had in Scottsdale.
