Clean, professional, not scary. There was no one else waiting there, so I saw a nurse practitioner immediately and was out the door 15 minutes after I walked in. She was super sharp and explained my illness and her prescription very clearly. If you can't get to your general practitioner, this is a fantastic alternative.
