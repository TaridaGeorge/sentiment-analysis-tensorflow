I went to Bar Smith for the first time this past Friday night. Friday nights = Sticky Fingers. We went there after 11pm, and it was pretty packed. The DJ played a good variety of music, and I especially liked that it wasn't all the hip-hop top 40 at most other clubs. Good mix of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, AC/DC, Nine Inch Nails, Lady Gaga, etc. Then upstairs on the loft was another DJ. Pretty fun considering it gets a little warm downstairs, and upstairs on the open loft it was in the 50's at 1am. Great place to dance to good music and have a good time!
