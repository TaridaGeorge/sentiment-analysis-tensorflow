The food is amazing and the staff is soooo nice! Really cool for fun family nights out. They also have a night life because of their bar - They have karaoke nights (sat. 9pm-12am) and tequila tasting nights, really fun! My favorite dish there is their HOMEMADE Cavatelli with Vodka Sauce - to die for! The first time I tried it, they were catering at an event I was at, now I order it all the time! YUM!
