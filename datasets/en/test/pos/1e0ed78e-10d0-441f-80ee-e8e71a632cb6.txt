Yummy!!! I love Georges, the best gyros in town, get fries or salad you can't go wrong with either. I can't decide which I like better the chicken pita or the original gyro both are so good guess it depends on your mood.  The lasagne is totally delish too.  My only complaint is the soda & tea tastes off, they definately need to install an RO system.
