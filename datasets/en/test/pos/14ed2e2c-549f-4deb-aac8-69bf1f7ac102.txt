I was looking for a place to find true BBQ in Phoenix and I sure as hell found it with Joe's.  I got the sampler platter which is a combination of the most popular meat they serve... ribs, chicken, and pulled pork.  Everything was phenomenal and a great environment too.  I went to school at PSU where we are lucky enough to get Clems BBQ, this makes up for good ole clem and then some.  Definitely will go again, good look Joe.
