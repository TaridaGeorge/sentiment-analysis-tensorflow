I just love this place! It has everything I need - cardio and weight machines, great classes, a pool, cleanliness, towels, and friendly staff.  A bonus is that you can feel good about paying your dues to a community center rather than a for-profit enterprise. Plus, the clientele represents a diverse cross section of the community - all ages, races and shapes, from students to retirees.

Weekend hours are limited, but manageable.  During rush hour (after work on weekdays), the cardio room gets a bit crowded and musty...but there's usually a machine available.
