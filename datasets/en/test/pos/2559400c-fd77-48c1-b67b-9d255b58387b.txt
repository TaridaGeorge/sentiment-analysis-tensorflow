If you have not visited Estate Treasures yet, YOU ARE MISSING OUT!  If you like the mid century modern thing, then you must get in your car and head over right now!!!  They are having a big blow out sale to get rid of stuff for a load of new stuff this week.  

I purchased the cutest dining room table with chairs and hutch for under the cost of what we budgeted to just get the hutch.  Honestly, the affordability and quality of this furniture is amazing.

FYI- they are closed on Mondays and Tuesdays.
Shop on!
