I've been meaning to write a review for Econo Lube for awhile now. This is the place we go to service both our cars and we wouldn't go anywhere else. These are the type of mechanics that you want. They are always honest, helpful and friendly. They have a bunch of thank you notes up in their waiting room and I believe every single one of them! We have been very lucky to find this place.
