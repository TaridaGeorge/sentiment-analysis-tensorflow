I'm so glad I discovered this little gem. Completely authentic Indian food. I've had the chana masala and the...cottage cheese cubes with peas (forgot what it's called). Neither disappointed. Also, I shared both with my 6'5" boyfriend and we still had leftovers (rice and naan as well). If you don't like spicy food, make sure you request a mild flavor (for any of the dishes). They also have complimentary self-serve chai tea which is so delicious I find myself often daydreaming of it. Mmmm...freeeeee.....

On Saturday evenings, they have a live belly dancer and Indian house-sounding music, which creates an awesome atmosphere. It's not too much to where you can't enjoy your food and time, but there's opportunity to get involved and dance with the dancer if you so desire.
