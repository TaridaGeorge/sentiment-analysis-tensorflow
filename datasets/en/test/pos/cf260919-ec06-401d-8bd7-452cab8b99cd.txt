Great fun and gorgeous!!   The opening holes have concave, downhill fairways.  You can crush.  Starting off I was probably averaging in the 300's for driving distance.  That'll get your confidence up.  This place should be in your line up for a phoenix golf trip for the hotness level of the cart girls alone!  wow!  Also, hit We-ko-pa right up the street if you gonna play 36-hole.   I can't wait to get back.
