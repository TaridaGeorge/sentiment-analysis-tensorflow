Over the summer months, this stand-alone farmer's market doesn't carry as much locally grown produce, especially at the end of the summer like July-Sept. Nearly everything they carry is from elsewhere due to the high heat of AZ I'm sure. That's fine with me but unfortunately that means veggies and fruit from other parts of the country that aren't as fresh. 

I've gotten some bad produce but the good part is I can just take it back and get a refund. I do think though that next summer during this time I'll be going to one of the various weekly farmer's markets or just to Sprouts for produce. Every other time I'll still be here. :)
