As a new-comer to Phoenix, two months into my stay I finally made my way here to meet a friend... I wished I had found it the day I moved to Arizona. Great ambiance; fun, adventurous and tasty food (I mean whoever thought of putting jalapenos in mac-n-cheese).  The "Yorkshire Pudding Burger" was awesome.  If I'm ever back In Phoenix, I'm planning on using this as a meeting place for a reunion with friends.
