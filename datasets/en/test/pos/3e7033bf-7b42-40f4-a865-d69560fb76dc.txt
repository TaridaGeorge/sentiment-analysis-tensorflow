Hey Shannon, Lush actually originated on the south coast of England. But you're right on the most important thing -- Lush is amazing!

I only wish there were a store closer to me. On the other hand, if there were I'd need a second job just to keep up with my bath products obsession :)

It seems there are a lot of natural, handmade beauty products these days. But Lush still is unique. I love the solid shampoo bars (Seanick is top) and the Fresh Farmacy cleansing bar with tea tree, chamomile, and rose is my daughter's favorite.
