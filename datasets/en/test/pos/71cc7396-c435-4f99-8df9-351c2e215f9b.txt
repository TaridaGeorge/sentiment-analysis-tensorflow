Was taken here by a client, who swore it was great.  Before we got in, he asked - do you know Yelp.com?  I said yes.  

I love places like this.  Not high on price or high price atmosphere.  I love great food.  

This place delivered.  Our dishes included:
-  Grilled Cheese (was amazing)
-  BBQ Chicken Special - Excellent!!
-  Grilled pizza - huge and amazing
-  Burger - also amazing. 

The surroundings are fantastic.
