BEST YOGURT EVER! This is my favorite yogurt ship for several reasons: lowest calorie/fat, creamiest (not melty), friendly staff, great specials and coupons, and the cleanest. Self serve yogurt shops may be the "hot trend", but it's not as great as everyone may think it is.  Everyone had access to all the food (unsanitary..), you get more than you want (and pay the price for it), it's pure chaos (people are running around everywhere), and it melts while you wait in the line. If you are new to frozen yogurt, try Golden Spoon because it's delicious!
