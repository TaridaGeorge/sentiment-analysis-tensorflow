Eagles has added a Dim Sum table with hosts to the Buffet here, so I whipped over here today to give it all a try, joined by Robyn N. & Mike C.

From the Dim Sum selection of about 10 items, I tried the (unusual) Hong Kong Won Ton Soup, Pork Shao Mai, Shrimp Hauk Au, Beef Tripe & BBQ Pork Bun.  Didn't care much for the last two but the rest were pretty good.  (Yes I do eat tripe.  I'm Cuban!)

A couple of favorites for me today were the Pasta Fagioli Soup & the fried chicken, which they don't usually have here.  Lots of other delicious dishes, salads & desserts to choose from, & all in all it was a great lunch as usual!     :-))

Weekday Lunch Buffet:  $9.95 including beverage.
