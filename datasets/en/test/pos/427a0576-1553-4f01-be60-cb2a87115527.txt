This mall reminds me of Northpark mall in Dallas- and anyone who has been here- i think would agree... they have a La Madeleine- a fave cafe of mine...the only NM store in the area, and most of the high end shopping boutiques...So if its hot outside- don your sunglasses and head on over to cool down in this sprawling mall...
