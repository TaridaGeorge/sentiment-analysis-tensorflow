Me and Amy E popped in to see what he would charge to remove a few links from a watch I recently got for her. Yury insisted that we not pay a penny, and only asked that we come back some time in the future. It's obvious he is into his work and takes great pleasure in satisfying his clients. Plus, he got right to work and finished the job in under five minutes (I have been to other jewelers to remove watch links, and they typically want up to $20 and for me to pick it up later).
