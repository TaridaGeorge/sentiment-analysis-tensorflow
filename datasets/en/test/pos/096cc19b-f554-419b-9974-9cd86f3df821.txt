I will preface this review by saying that I am from Chicago (and still live there, mind you)... and am a regular sushi eater at some of the best sushi restaurants in a city that is known for, and loves, its food.

With that said, I have been to Fresh Wasabi twice now and... can state with confidence that Fresh Wasabi is some of the best sushi I have ever eaten!  Try the First Love specialty roll -- you will love it!  Have you tried it yet?  Seriously, what are you waiting for?  Ok, since you are still reading this, then let me give another recommendation -- try the Crunch Spicy Tuna.  You say it looks a little boring for your exquisite, developed taste buds?  Then tell them to add tobiko (they will do it with a smile).  Have you tried the rolls yet?  Go.  Eat.  Now!
