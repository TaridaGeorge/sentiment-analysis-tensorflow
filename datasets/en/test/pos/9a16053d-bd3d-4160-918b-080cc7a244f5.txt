In a town like Phoenix, independent cinema is hard to come by. Which is why I use Netflix. Also, it is why I frequent this standalone independent movie theater in the heart of Scottsdale. 

It could be just a coincidence, but it seems like a healthy percentage of my favorite movies I first saw here. Motorcycle Diaries, Little Miss Sunshine, Nueve Reinas, I Heart Huckabees, and a few others were all playing here (and nowhere else in town, for the most part) and are now in my top 20. I am sort of on an indie movie kick right now, but this place gets me excited about film again (which was no easy feat after seeing Troy and Alexander).
