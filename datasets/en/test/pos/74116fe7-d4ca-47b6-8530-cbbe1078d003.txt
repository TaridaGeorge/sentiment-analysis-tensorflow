I gave The Locke Shoppe a call a second time because I had locked myself out of my apartment. About 30-40 minutes later, Lars arrived and was able to open the door quickly, even offering to turn my door handle right-side-up, and gave me some advice as how to keep the locks in top condition.

Great service!
