Some of the best tasting salads and sandwiches in downtown Phoenix.  Freshest ingredients and completely original flavor combinations.  Baked goods also offer something special, that home made flavor and texture.  There is always an array of hearty cookie choices to choose from.  Nice informal atmosphere, mix of students and office workers.  A little sidewalk seating if you're so inclined.  Others have already raved about the drinks so I don't need to here.  If you are interested in supporting locally owned businesses that are offering something special, go here.  It is surprising how many downtown regulars do not know of this little gem when you mention it, but that will change based on Cartel's great offerings.
