This is a great place for Sunday brunch!  All-you-can eat buffet for $25/person, including bottomless mimosas.  All of the food was fresh and delicious -- not what you expect from a typical buffet in that price range.

The outdoor tables are comfortable and relaxing and the resort atmosphere around the hotel makes for a fun experience.

Just don't try to hang out at the pool after -- you'll be asked to leave if you aren't staying at the hotel!
