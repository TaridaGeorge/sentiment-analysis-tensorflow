If you like the outdoors...you will like the indoors here!! 
From camping gear to fishing and more....they have a lot of high-end gadgets that will make your outdoor experience even better.
I once went in to look at some camping cookware and I think I was in there for an hour and a half and I barely cracked the surface. I think the key to REI is that whatever your sport ofroutdoor enjoyment - REI will make it even more comfortable and enjoyable. Hey you might even find a new sport while you are there!
