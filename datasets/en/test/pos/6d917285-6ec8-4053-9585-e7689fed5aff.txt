WOW O WOW!!! 

Sweet republic you little piece of heaven...salty sweet carmel ice cream with homemade toppings!!! I think about you all the time! 

There are so many flavors that I love, the fresh mint, the medjool date with roquefort..the banana foster..

They also have these incredibly cute little ice cream sandwiches..

Even if you don't like ice cream, you will feel happy just being inside the smartly designed store..great branding and all around concept!!
