Super friendly, brightly lit, great atmosphere.  These people have EVERYTHING.

This store is loaded with sheet music and song books, and you can get your guitar strings/picks/instrument cables here, as well as a selection of neat straps, metronomes, capos, etc.  They also have a lot of unusual percussion items and other instruments here.  And if they don't have it, they will order it for you.  Just ask.  They can find it.

If it's musical, and I can buy it here, I would rather come here than anyplace else because just walking in is a pleasant experience.
