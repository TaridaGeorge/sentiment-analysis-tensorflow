This is absolutely by far one of my favorite places to eat!  Everything is prepared healthy and is absolutely delicious!  I can't wait for their Ahwatukee location to open!  I have been asking for an Ahwatukee location for some time and finally my dreams have come true!  Thanks Pita Jungle!

P.S.  The spicy chicken wrap is one of my favorites but everything I have ever tried is good!
