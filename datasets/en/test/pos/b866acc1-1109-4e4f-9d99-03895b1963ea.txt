i was craving a sandwich after my meeting, so i yelped for sandwich shops nearby. casella's caught my eye with the high reviews. walking in, i was a little apprehensive...but i reminded myself this is a mom and pop shop. they are all about the food. 

one of the ladies that works there told me about the menu, and was very excited i was a first timer. i got a couple of Italian beef sandwiches to-go. get the au jous with it (she recommended i did). so delicious. my boyfriend about died and went to heaven when he took his first bite. 

we will definitely be back. this place lives up to their reviews!!!!
