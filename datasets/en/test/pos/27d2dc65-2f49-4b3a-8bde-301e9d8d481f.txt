Come and experience this place for yourself before you weigh too much on the negative comments.  Staff is friendly and very accommodating, the food was GREAT, and the ambiance at lunch and dinner is upscale but not stuffy.  A place anyone can feel at home, even if you do not think you are dressed the part.  You can get a quick, reasonably priced bite to eat as they are conscious of your time OR you can go all out and spend all night having an amazing experience.  Try it out and form your own opinion, it is a new place and they have kinks to work out but they want to earn our business.
