Costco sells pretty much everything I need at reasonable prices. Don't need to repeat that. What makes this Costco special is the Kirkland Signature car wash. For $7.99 you get an environmentally friendly clean that even works well with my convertible roof. If you've got a dirty vehicle, this is the place to go. My car now shines like it was new.
