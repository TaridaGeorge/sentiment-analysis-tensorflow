For reals, this is my new favorite place. I LOVE it. The staff is friendly and the food is great! LOVE their hummus. My friend and I got the hummus trio, garlic dip (hummus?), olives, and feta cheese for happy hour and it was bomb sauce. Then for dinner, we split the pesto pizza and garlic potatoes. SO GOOD! Love love love.
