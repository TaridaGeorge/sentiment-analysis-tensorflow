First of all, delicious food!  I had the Big Ass burger and it did not disappoint!  Their Chicken Tortilla soup is one of the best I've ever had.  And you have to try their green chili mac and cheese!
We had a group of 10 girls for my friend's bachelorette party and they were great!  I made reservations about a week before, and they had the table set up, confetti included, ready for us!
Our waitress was outstanding, and I couldn't have asked for a better group dinner!
