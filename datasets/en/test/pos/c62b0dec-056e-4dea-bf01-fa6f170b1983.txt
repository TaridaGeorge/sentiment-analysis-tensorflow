Needed a cake for my daughter's baptism.  As typical for me, I waited til about a week and half before the event to look for a cake!  :) 

I went to a few bakeries in the Valley for samples and quotes.  It wasn't until I sampled some of the super yummy pastries from Honey Moon Sweets did I feel like I was going to be happy with a cake.   The desserts they have are fabulous and the STANDARD cake is soooo delicious and very reasonable compared to the quotes that I had been receiving from everyone else.  Since it was their "standard" a week's notice was sufficient.  

This cake was absolutely fabulous!  EVERYONE complimented on how pretty the cake was and how fantastic it tasted.  

I am soooo glad that I decided to go with them and will be using them again in the future...
