I love, love, love MAC Cosmetics! I have nothing but glowing reviews for the company and their products. As a MAC Pro member I can use my card at MAC only stores. MAC's located within department stores don't usually accept the MAC Pro card. The Biltmore location is great! I've been there a few times and it's a treat. The Fashion Square location is small, very busy and  finding an employee to help you can be difficult. All in all, I haven't had a negative experience with MAC Cosmetics and will be a repeat customer for life. P.S. My favorite location is the Beverly Hill, CA store located on Robertson Blvd. Perfectly dreamy!
