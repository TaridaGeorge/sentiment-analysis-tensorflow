The pizza is incredible, they use really high quality ingredients and the prices are great. I would recommend cooking it on the bottom rack of your oven for a slightly better texture on the crust.

I want someone to mark that this post is funny, so I will add a joke:

Mushroom walks into a bar... Bartender says, "sorry, we don't serve your type here." Mushroom says "why not? I'm a fungi (fun guy)."
