I was so excited to go to Retro Ranch that I waited outside in my car for a half hour for it to open!  And it did not disappoint.  Great clothing selection.  Reasonably priced furniture.  A COMPLETE set of Blakely Oil glasses and pitcher, with tray?  Get out!  The gal behind the counter was very helpful, giving me a map of other vintage stores in the area.  I sure wish Retro Ranch was in my town.
