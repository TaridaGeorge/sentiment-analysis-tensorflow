Damn Fine breakfast establishment. After suffering a horrible wait and no food episode at Matt's big breakfast. I drove by Lo Lo's and decided to give em a try. I am so happy I did. I got the coffee and the breakfast sandwich and I'm happy to say I was sat at a table promptly, my coffee was fresh and great, and my sandwich was heaven on earth. It was similar pricing to Matt's and everything was good start to finish. I will return to Lo Lo's for breakfast in the future.
