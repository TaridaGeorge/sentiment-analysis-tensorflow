That's a Wrap is one of the best kept secrets in Arizona. The food is absolutely phenomenal. All of the cleverly named wraps (Ken and Barbie-Que, Tipper And Alba-Gore Tuna, Cheech and Dijon Chicken, Alota Fajita, Etc.)  are made from fresh ingredients and include a side dish of your choice for an incredibly reasonable price. They have a daily special as well as a home-made daily soup selection. That's a Wrap is also very accommodating to vegetarians (you can select tofu as a replacement in any of the meat based wraps). The atmosphere is casual, colourful and relaxed. The owner is super friendly and is very supportive of the phoenix art and music scenes. The work of local artists typically adorns the walls. That's a Wrap is one of my absolute favorite arizona spots. Check it out!
