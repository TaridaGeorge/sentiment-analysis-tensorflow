Ordered carryout and called the wrong location. The people at Scottsdale were extremely helpful and put a rush on my order even though they were so busy people were waiting 40 minutes to get a table.  It took about 15 minutes to correct my mistake and complete my order. I was very happy with the service and the food was excellent as well.
