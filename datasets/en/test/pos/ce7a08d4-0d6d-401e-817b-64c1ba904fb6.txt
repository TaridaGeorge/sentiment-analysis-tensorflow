I've been craving Pho since I moved to Arizona about six months ago.

I visited Pho Chandler during lunch time and though it was extremely busy, I was greeted and seated almost immediately. I ordered the Seafood Pho and Spring rolls. 

The food was excellent. I was very pleased that with the seafood Pho, real crab pieces (in shell) were used opposed to imitation seafood like some other places use. 

All in all, an awesome experience and I will be back! Highly recommended.
