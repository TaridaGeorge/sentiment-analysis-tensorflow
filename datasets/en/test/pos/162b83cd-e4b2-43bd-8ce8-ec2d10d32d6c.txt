I have no idea what makes their veggie sandwiches better than anyone else's but it's the only thing I order when we stop at Jimmy John's!  They are so tasty!!  They are known for being 'fast'  .. and it's no hype ... my sandwich is usually done by the time I'm done paying!  We are also fans of their low-fat chips .. they don't taste 'low fat' but I'm going with it!
