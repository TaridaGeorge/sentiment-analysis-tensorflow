Who isn't always searching for the most delicious cupcake? I have, and I'm pretty sure I found it in the brown velvet. I tried six flavors, no not all in one sitting, but the brown velvet tops the list. Cakes are moist, and the frostings are all unique and heavenly in flavor. The cream cheese and raspberry frostings are to die for. Service is quick too. Again, I love when places don't have dozens of options to choose from like Sprinkles, and stick with what they do best. I also appreciate how they try to use as many local, organic ingredients as possible. They also introduce limited time flavors like peach, if peaches are in season! How cool is that?
