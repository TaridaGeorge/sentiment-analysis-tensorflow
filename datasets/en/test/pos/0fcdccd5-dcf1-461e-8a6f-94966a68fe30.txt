Great 'birthday week' dinner with my mom, who had already been to North for lunch today.  Started with the burrata alla panna (AMAZING) and bread and cheese (quite good, but not as good as the burrata).  Then had the best salad ever...the heirloom beet salad.  I could eat that salad every day.  It's the perfect salad for me.  

Shared the tortolloni, which was good, but I wouldn't get it again, but am glad I tried it.  I will plan to try another pasta another time as the pasta itself was really good.

Shared the bombolini with my mom for dessert, which was good but we were too stuffed to really enjoy it.  However, lemon curd is always a good thing.  


Nice atmosphere, close to home, free valet, good food.  I'll be back!
