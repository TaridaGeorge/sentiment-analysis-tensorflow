i love this place...found a 1,600$ Marc Jacob bag for 400! in amazing condition!! i don't like the way they have the purse in bins because they all rub together and cause more damage but hey what do you expect and the people are crazy when the staff brings stuff out pushing and shoving aren't allowed but it does happen! they also have ammmaaaazzziiinnngggg shoes here i got some tory burch flats for 80 that are regular 300! i was shocked and happy they had a little scuff in the back but nothing any would notice also picked up chole perfume and some scarfs for winter a great place just be carful not to go over board they have limits on everything ie..purses shoes and blazers....other than the crowds and crazy women great place!!!!
