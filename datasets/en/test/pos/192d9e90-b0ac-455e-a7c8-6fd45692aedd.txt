Never had anything bad here! All of the omlets are great, my friends and I call the wheat germ pancakes "crack pancakes". Get there early if you are going on a weekend. Sundays at 10 are a bad time to go because this place will be hoping. 
The service is very stepford like, but the food can't be beat.
