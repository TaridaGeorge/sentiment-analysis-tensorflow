This is simply a quick healthy lunch spot!  I always enjoy great service and fresh ingredients on my salad or sandwich.  One time they even threw out the lettuce that was in the bin on the counter because they didn't want to serve it to me,  I appreciate attention to detail on things like that!

If you need a quick inexpensive sandwich/salad shop this is it!
