I have been to different nail salons all over the Valley and trust me, Warner Nails is a cut above the rest.  Not only do they give great pedicures and manicures, but their massages are great!   My mom and I have been regulars there for years.  Super service and you cannot beat the price for what you get.  Highly recommend!  (and ask for Tina!)
