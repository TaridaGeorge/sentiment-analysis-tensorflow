Matt's Butter Burger is THE dish to have here! Matt starts his lunch menu @ 11am. The breakfast here is good don't get me wrong just skip breakfast & go 4 the butter burger. Also make sure u don't park on the empty dirt parking lots in front of & behind Matt's or you'll get a $120.00 ticket! Park on the paved streets/lots only & keep in mind parking is limited.
