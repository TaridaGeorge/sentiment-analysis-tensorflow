WOW! This place is awesome! My girlfriends and I came to Atlas Bistro on a Saturday night and we couldn't stop talking about how amazing it was. The food was delicious. Seriously, some of the best food I've ever had. The atmosphere was quaint and fun, and the service was terrific. I loved the somewhat unique dishes. They were different than your normal menu, but not so different that you didn't really want to try much. They also accommodated the various allergies at our table of 9 lades. I just wish I had taken a to-go bag of my scallops!
