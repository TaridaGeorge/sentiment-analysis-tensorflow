I was the victim of a major home invasion--by crickets. They were everywhere making their annoying sounds all night long,  appearing out of no where on my walls and floors, multiplying and overtaking my home.  I tried several over-the-counter bug sprays, but none of them worked for long. I was desperate. Then a friend recommended Alpha Pest Control and I'm so glad I took her advice.  Alpha took care of the problem quickly and efficiently. In no time I was rid of the noisy, nasty pests. Thanks to regular maintenance my place is free of crickets and other nasty crittersl. Another plus is that the bug spray they use has no chemical odor. I highly recommend Alpha Pest Control.
