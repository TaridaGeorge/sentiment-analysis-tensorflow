$4 for OPI?! Are you kidding me?! LOVE IT.

I got 2 OPIs, 2 Orlys, a China Glaze, 3 art polishes, and a decoration tool for $31.00. Awesome.

The store is *packed* w/ product. It's kind of like a consignment store in that if you have the time and diligence to search, you can find some really great stuff. A+
