Haven't had the chance to eat, but I've definitely had a chance to drink here!

They make this pomegranete mojito and martini, which is delicious!!!!  The bar gets really tight and noisy especially when there is  a convention going on, especially when there's a HAIR SHOW going on.  All the educators get drunk stupid, hyphy!!

The bartender we had was JP and he was so attentive.  Scott was cool too, but he wasn't as attentive as JP was.  When we were dry on drinks it was easy to get another round!!
