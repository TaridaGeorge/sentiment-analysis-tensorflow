I love Urban Kidz...  You will find very unique clothes/accessories/gifts here!  I have a baby boy and I hardly ever find stores that have really cute boy things... well, Urban Kidz has them and more!  My daughter loves going to this store, she wants to try everything on!  The owner, Lila is the nicest woman ever and will help you will pick out the perfect outfit!  If you're little girl likes tutus... then you have to stop by Urban Kidz... they have the cutest tutus ever!  Oh, and the blingy tanks with your birthday number is the perfect top to wear with your tutu!  I can't say enough great things about Urban Kidz... I'm so thankful that I found this store!!!!
