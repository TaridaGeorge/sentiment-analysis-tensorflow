Came to MacAlpines for the second time. Very impressed again. Had the pastrami Ruben and it is warm, perfectly seasoned, juicy and amazing. Also had a blueberry cheesecake ice cream float which was decadent and delicious. Every waitress is dressed in vintage outfits and they are all stunning. Most of the clientele are Also wearing fun vintage clothes. And are hot lol. Great food, value and fun. Definitely recommend it
