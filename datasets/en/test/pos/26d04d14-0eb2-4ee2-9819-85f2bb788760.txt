My immediate and extended family have been coming here for years and have ZERO complaints. The food is a buck or 2 more than most places but this isn't your typical dining experience. No place in town compares to the atmosphere and the food is very good. We all love the variety of deserts and the ice tea is excellent. As for the person complaining about occasional ant... HELLO... it's outdoors! And for the person who thought the food was too expensive... go to Denny's for a cheap meal. They cover all three meals via the Farm Kitchen for lunch, a terrific breakfast area, morning Glory cafe, and an excellent evening dining experience @ Quiessence. Thanks for giving us this jewel in the desert.
