Wow! About time Mill got BBQ! They totally changed up everything and the interior is laid back and I felt like I was on vacation. Much needed change from what this place used to be. The staff is super helpful and the Bbq is AMAZING! Get the brisket and the chicken. Again I am so happy that they are here. Kudos!
