Best vegan meal I've ever had, hands down! The chicken wings appetizer was awesome, I didn't even realize I wasn't eating real chicken! I had a curry dish with brown rice and it was very delicious, my fianc√©'s dish was great too, something with mock beef, I forgot what. The drinks were good. The desserts were great! I had a Soynami with "Betterfinger" mixed in (think of a blizzard at DQ) and it was SO good. We'll be back!
