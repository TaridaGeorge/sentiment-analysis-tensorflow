This is a really nice SuperTarget way out on the edge of Queen Creek. This store was really neat, clean, and well-maintained, even had music playing out in the parking lot! This SuperTarget had a Pharmacy, Photo, Optical, Pizza Hut Express, Starbucks, Garden Center, and includes the full grocery section with some of the most delicious pastries and fresh prepaired deli foods hot and cold. I'll be coming back here for the deli chicken alone!
