In the desolate stretch of desert and tumbleweed, Changing Hands, you are my beacon of light. The magnanimous nature of CH compensates for the fact that I sneeze roughly 8.7 times more in Arizona than I do anywhere else. This bookstore has both used books, which are marked with a nifty little dot on the spine and new books. I purchased a hardback memoir for $6.95. We perused the compilation of books recommended by the staff, which was very helpful. My gf and I even inhaled gourmet sandwiches at the adjoining bakery in between skimming back covers and paring down the book selection. Changing Hands is an awesome local bookstore and a refreshing change from the ho hum corporate Borders/Barnes and Noble environment.
