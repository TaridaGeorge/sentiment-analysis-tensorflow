Stopped by to get groceries at Lee Lee market and saw this place.  Realizing I needed a haircut, I decided to give this place a try.  Wow, no appointment needed! The stylist was friendly and I was able to get in and out very quickly.  I have to say I am pretty satisfied with the results and it didn't cause a big dent in the wallet.  Will definitely be back.
