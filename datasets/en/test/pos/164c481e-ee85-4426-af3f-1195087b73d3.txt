The best Mexican in Scottsdale! My boyfriend and I have been trying everything in the Scottsdale area and we finally found it...Frank and Lupes!  Great fish tacos, carne asada tacos etc. Most of all it has a great patio, fun atmosphere and great drink specials!  Very friendly staff and highly recommended!
