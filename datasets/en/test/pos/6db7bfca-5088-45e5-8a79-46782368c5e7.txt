Joe was a complete pleasure to work with AND he does a fabulous job!  He removed all gum and cleaned the carpet through out the facility, cleaned & waxed our floors as well as cleaned & sealed the tile in our bathrooms.  Everything turned out amazing!  He was extremely thorough, showed up on time, and made sure we were completely happy with the final product.  I would definitely recommend using Service Master as Joe is the owner and takes pride in his work and leaves you with a clean facility!
