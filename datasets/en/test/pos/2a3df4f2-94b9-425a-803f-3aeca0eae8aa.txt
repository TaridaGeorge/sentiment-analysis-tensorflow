I loved this store, I've only been there once but I had a good experience.  I took my baby brother there as a birthday gift, I let him pick out whatever he wanted.  We ran around the store and he had so much to say about every toy there.  And there was an associate that followed us the whole time, also listening to every little story my brother had to say.

In fact he acted excited to hear every story.  He had his own "cool" fact to entertain by brother with about the toys.  He was beyond patient and nice, and I only wish I caught his name to write a review into his boss.  He was a great guy and made it a great experience.
