Sssh, it's all oh so so so good don't tell anyone. Omg! Omg! Omg! The best Philly cheesesteaks (outside of Philly).... Cheese is melted and chopped INTO the meat... Had mine with mushrooms and a side of homeade italian wedding soup... Simply divine... Found a few torrone and back, a chunk of smoked mozzarella and scamolz to go! Felt I was back at the Philly Italian market... Now if they only had Italian rum cake (layered cake with rum creme) like you get at Termini's... That would definitely send you over the top!
