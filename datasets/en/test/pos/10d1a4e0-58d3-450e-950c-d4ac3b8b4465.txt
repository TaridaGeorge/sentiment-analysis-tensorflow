I have driven by Eegee's a bunch of times running here and there but never thought to stop since Casa Grande has way too many fast food places.
However today (4/15/2012) I decided to try them.

Even in the drive thru, service is good.
I usually like my sandwiches plain but I took a chance and got a small ham & cheese grinder. It was freakin awesome!!  

The Orange Dream to go with it? Very nice. 

Overall a nice small lunch for $5 that left me really satisfied.
