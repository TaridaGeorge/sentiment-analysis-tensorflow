Wow!  Their cocktail list blew me away.  So rare to find a place with a well rounded list of old school cocktails!  Each one is like a pice of art crafted to make you smile.  After the aperitif this place keeps me happy with outstanding food.  Bacon Popcorn: Delish.  Olives: Excellent to nibble with cocktails.  Mac & Cheeze: American standard done well here.  Chicken and Waffles: Gluten free and tasty.  Short Ribs: Big portion and well prepared.  Scallops: A savory take on this normally light dish.  Pudding Dessert: Hit the spot.  Best meal I've had in a long time!
