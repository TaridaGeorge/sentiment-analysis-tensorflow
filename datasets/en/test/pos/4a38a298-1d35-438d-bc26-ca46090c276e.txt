OK - a dry cleaner that:
1.)  Doesn't lose your stuff
2.)  Gives your dog "cleaner cookies" on every visit
3.)  Actually marks your spots and treats them; and then tells you if they can't get it out
4.)  Friendly!

While we have never been loyal to dry cleaners for very long, we have been Pat's customers for more than 7 years, mainly due to Mike.  He's great!  (And besides, when you want to catch up on sports, he is the guy - loves hockey, Cardinals Football and AZ teams - D-backs, Suns, etc.
