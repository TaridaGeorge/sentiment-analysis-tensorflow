Don't judge me by this, but if you don't like Trader Joe's, I just don't think we can be friends. 

They roll all of the good things about any supermarket I've ever been to into one, tastefully presented package. Cheap, good food and produce, and they have samples here. I love samples. When I was a kid I could spend hours at Costco listening to presenters talk about how to get stains out with their respective magical solutions, or how a blender could make tasty fruit drinks from your fresh fruit. Trader Joe's does one better. Coffee, fresh bread, and things I can consume on the spot are always there. 

And don't even get me started on Chuck Shaw. I know it isn't great, but for two dollars, it doesn't have to be. I think we all owe TJ's a thank you for introducing the world to Mr. Shaw.
