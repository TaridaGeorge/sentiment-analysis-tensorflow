My favorite "cheat day" place! If you go before 6pm, the place is empty so it's in and out. But come later, and it's jam packed with people from the movie theater or from dinner. The selection is deep enough were you can try flavors over and over again. The toppings are pretty good too. As of this the price is 39 cents an once. Oh yeah, the place is clean.
