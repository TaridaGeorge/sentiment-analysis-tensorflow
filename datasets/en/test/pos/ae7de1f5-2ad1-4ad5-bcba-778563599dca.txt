Clean.  Fast, friendly service.  Great food.  All seven of us really enjoyed our lunch here.  

We went a few weeks ago, so it's a little difficult to remember everything we ordered.  We ordered 6 dishes I believe and shared.  Massaman Curry, Drunken Noodles and the Pad Thai dishes were excellent.  Great flavor and the spices on the table allowed those of us to get things as hot as we wanted.

We'll definitely be back when we're in the area again.
