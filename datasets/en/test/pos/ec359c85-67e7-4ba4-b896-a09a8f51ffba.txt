Ok, I'm going to warn you that the waitstaff and decor leave something to be desired. Those are the bad things. The food is EXCELLENT! Normally I cannot overlook bad service but the food really is exceptional. The food is so exceptional that this place deserves 5 stars. It is clean and the menu is well organized. Not to be missed!
