Excellent location of Fry's.  Conveniently located just a mile south of the Loop 101 on Alma School Rd in Chandler AZ.  Employees are always friendly & ready to help when needed.  Store is always stocked up and items are easy to find.  They just upgraded their self service check-outs to new computers.  Very convenient and easy to use.  Usually quick to get in, shop, and get out. =)
