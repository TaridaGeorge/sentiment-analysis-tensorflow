Been here twice in 8 years and would go again tomorrow if I could. The building is peaceful. The exhibits are informative without being kitchy or preachy. There is a little "native americans are at one with the land and then we came and raped it" kind of stuff but it's in check. It's not a message museum. Pieces range from modern era art by natives, to artifacts from ancient tribes unearthed in the region, to Barry Goldwater's 300+ Hopi doll collection.

Infotainment in the truest sense and the only place in Metro Phoenix that felt authentic.
