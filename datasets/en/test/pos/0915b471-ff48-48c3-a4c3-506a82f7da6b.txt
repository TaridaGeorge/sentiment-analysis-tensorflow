Spinato's is by far the best pizza in Phoenix.  The sauce RULES!  THe crust is excellent too, as is the ambiance.  Service is always supurb.

It is especially nice to see a family-run restraurant; a rarity these days.  We have fond memories when the founder, Joe, would go table to table talking with the patrons, and sharing stories of the old days in Chicago.

We often take guests from out of town here, and they ask to go back, whenever they are in town! 

Salads are great, and a very good portion, makes for sharing one with your guests possible.

This is THE PLACE to take anyone that you wish to impress with an excellent meal.
