I've been to this ball park several times over the years and I'm impressed at how well it's keeping up.  I'm always impressed how clean it is, we were most recently out for Fan Fest '11 and again everyone was friendly and the place was spotless.  

The only annoyance this time, and I know this is temporary was some construction, they are gearing up for the All Star Game. I just hope it's done by opening day.

I'd also love to mention for people looking to head out to a game, the price point for food is very reasonable.  Also there is something for everyone, I was really worried about vegetarian options when out last summer and had a FANTASTIC veggie burro from Macayo's.  And I know that several other vendors also offer vegetarian options.
