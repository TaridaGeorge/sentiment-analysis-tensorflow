Having taken very few yoga classes in my life and being an anti-sweat kind of girl, I was very nervous about my first bikram class. But everyone is very welcoming and understanding of the mixture of levels in the class. I signed up for the 2-week trial and went almost every day. The instructors are all friendly and approachable before and after class. Not being familiar with the poses, I'm thankful for the pointers given during the class as well. 
The yoga room fits about 50 students and is typically close to full, so it's good to get there early and claim your spot. Now that my 2-week trial is over, the price will prohibit me grom going as often but i do plan to continue. It's been great for flexibility, relaxation, and clarity, and I've even noticed that it's made me more tolerant of the summer heat! :)
