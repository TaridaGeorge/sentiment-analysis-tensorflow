I needed termite treatment on my home and the estimate I received from Terminex was around $3000. Ouch!
I looked on YELP to get 2nd or 3rd opinions and found the great reviews for House Doctor Exterminating.
Not only was this company, prompt, courteous and professional, they also beat the 'other guys' bids by ALOT! After meeting with the owner, David, and getting the bid, I felt that I no longer had to keep looking.
His team came out within days, arrived on time and cleaned up any mess that they made.
This company also offers new customer specials, which was appreciated! 
David is super friendly and down to earth guy that makes you feel comfortable and well cared for.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!
