My wife was feeling a bit queasy after shopping at the nearby grocery store.  So stopped in just for her to rest, but the manager seemed to notice she was feeling and uneasy and offered to make her something that will make her feel better.  

He made her some sort of noodle dish that she loved.  I had the tendon pho and it was great.  We have liked this unPhogettable ever since.
