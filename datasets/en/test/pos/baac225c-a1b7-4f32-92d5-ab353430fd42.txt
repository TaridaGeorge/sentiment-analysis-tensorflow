I just loved this place!  If you like Calamari you will love theirs!  They are huge and taste fabulous, like nowhere else I have ever been!  the Salmon burger just melts in your mouth and the Kiltlifter brew is not be missed.  With its pub type atmosphere this is for sure a place not to be missed in Tempe.  We will be back often.
