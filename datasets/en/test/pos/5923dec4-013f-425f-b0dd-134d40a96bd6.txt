Sit on the patio if you can. Great view! As for the food my two favorite menu items: 1) Hummus with Grilled Chicken if you don't want something too heavy; 2) Pesto Lavosh Turkey Wrap is a great option if you have a big appetite or want leftovers. Hands down my favorite place to either sit down or pick up to-go by my work in Chandler.
