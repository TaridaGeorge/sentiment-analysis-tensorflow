Huge mouthwatering portions ! Their Tom-Kha blew us away, it was spiced right & large. Pad pak topped off the experience 
Sunday eveniing and there plenty of people coming on to chow near close. 
Some Thai restaurants intentionally serve you small portions especially rice, different philosophy here. You will get your moneys worth.
Impressed!
