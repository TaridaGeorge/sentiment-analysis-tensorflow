I Love Love Love this store. How could a girl go wrong with a color coded accessories store, Aaamazing! You need a bright yellow clutch to go with you little black dress, got it; maybe an orange headband for that outfit you cant find anything to go with, done. 

The staff is super friendly and helpful. I was in no way overwhelmed, at least not to the extent I do when in other extremely cluttered overly stocked discount accessories stores. The prices are extremely affordable, I bought a extra large red bag (faux leather) for $36, what a steal. I have purchased a few other items and I am still very satisfied with everything. They also have some of the prettiest scarfs all between $12- $18. I am so glad this store is finally here!
