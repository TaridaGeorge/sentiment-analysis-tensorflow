What a great day to start! Beautiful people greeting me, "Good Morning :)"  with the smile on their face. I ordered a Grande Vanilla Iced Latte, a Danish Bread and a Zucchini muffin. I've been to this place several times and still customers service here isn't a diminishing star! I love you Starbucks...I hope it's OK to come once in a while.
