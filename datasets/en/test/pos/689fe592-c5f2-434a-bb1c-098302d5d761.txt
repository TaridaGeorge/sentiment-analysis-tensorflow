If I could only eat one type of food for the rest of my life, it would be pizza. And if I could only go to one pizza place in Phoenix, it would have to be Mamma Mia's.

Everything about their pizza is perfect. Sauce. Cheese. Size. Crust. Price. All perfect.

And I'm not a huge wing person because I don't like fried food, but I am pretty sure Mamma Mia's wings are baked and they are delicious.

And the customer service is amazing. Last time I was in there, they threw in a free 2-liter bottle of soda for free.

Pizzeria Bianco, you ain't got shit on my Mamma Mia's.
