I usually meet my friend at cartel for coffee. It is definitely a cute little spot in old town. Their coffee is really great also! They make pretty foam leaves on their lattes! I haven't tried their pastry, but they look sooo good! Next time I'll have to try it out! I'll be coming here again sometime soon!
