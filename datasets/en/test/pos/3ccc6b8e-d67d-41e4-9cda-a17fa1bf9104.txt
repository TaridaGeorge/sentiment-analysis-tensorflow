I switched to Pediatrix from a true "Jack in the Box" doctor group for my children where I would wait 45 minutes (average)  and see the doctor for maybe 5 minutes.
At Pediatrix, I never wait more than 10 minutes and Dr. Montion spends as much time as we need.  The location is not close to our house but I will continue to go to Pediatrix due to the excellent care we are receiving and the comfort level my children have with Dr.  Montion.
