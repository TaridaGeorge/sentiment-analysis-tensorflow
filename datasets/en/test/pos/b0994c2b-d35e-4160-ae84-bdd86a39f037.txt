I don't eat fried chicken very often, but this chicken fingers are very tasty. Not like other franchise fried chicken. I did not get fries and got extra chicken fingers. 

The place is small, but the owner Alin is awesome man. I was very much focusing on the chicken and sauce. Haven't tried all the sauces, but will give them a shot. 

Some people tweet on social network about the tasty Chicken meals. Even news crews were there as well. Now the only place you can find their coupon is http://www.smartlocalshoppers.com/store/view/promotions/1054/

The owner will even give more free stuff if you show the coupon on your iPhone or smart phone. So you don't have to print and bring in the coupons. 

I would recommend everyone to eat at their restaurant. The chicken fingers are too tasty to resist! Best Fried Chicken in Town.
