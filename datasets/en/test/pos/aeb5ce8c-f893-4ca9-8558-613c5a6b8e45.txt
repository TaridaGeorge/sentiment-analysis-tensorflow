THE BEST BAR IN SCOTTSDALE. Yes i said it. Great staff that is super fun and arent afraid to party. You have a stripper pole that gets more action then paris hilton, great music on the jukebox (especially if oyu want some journey in your life.) and last but not least the wheel. You should fear the wheel because the wheel owns all. You will find people from all walks of life at giligans and you never have that stuck vibe you find at most Scottsdale establishments. This is a must for all local in the Phoenix area.
