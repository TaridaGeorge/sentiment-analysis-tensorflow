I love Trader Joe's and this is one of my favorites in town - Far bigger than the Gilbert location.

I love that I can always find something new and yummy to try - and that is sometimes very hard as a vegetarian.  I love the produce, the sauces, the soy selections.

I also love that I can find animal product free & cruelty free household products, which means that I don't have to go all over town to get what I need.

Go here.  Get some meatless meatballs and some whole wheat pasta.   Have a tasty dinner.
