Of course it gets hot in the summer. You're going to be watching bands in a basement with a bunch of people and depending on when / what's going on there might be some idiots 'mawshing'. 

Sound quality is great for the size. Glad they reopened one of my favorite venues. and YES everybody has gotten lost the first time they tried to find the Nile. The main & front room have shows as well.
