We love to eat at Paradise when visiting Scottsdale.  In Florida, we enjoy Panera for breakfast and this is the closest thing to it.  The breakfast quiche is our favorite!!!  I tried the Tuna atop salad with balsamic for lunch and was shocked at how tasty it was!  The small was the perfect size.  

We like the feel of this place and the cookies are yummy too!
