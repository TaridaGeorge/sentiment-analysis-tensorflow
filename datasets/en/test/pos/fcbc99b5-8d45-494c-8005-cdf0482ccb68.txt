We stayed here last month for a quick trip to Phoenix for the Oregon football game. Go Ducks!. Everyone at the hotel was beyond wonderful, starting with Victoria at the front desk.  We enjoyed the wonderful pools and there are quite a few so you can relax at the adult pool or have fun with the kids all at the same hotel.  The rooms were very comfortable and what you would expect at a hotel with this rating.  We can't wait to go back!
