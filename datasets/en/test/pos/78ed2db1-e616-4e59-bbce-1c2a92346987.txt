I really don't know if I can put into words what I love about Durant's without posting some photos of it as well. A vegetarian at a steakhouse...and I love it! I came here for late night drinks and I found the staff to be great. I stuck to cheap G&Ts and smokes at the bar, but transferred to this luxurious round tables for martinis and steak abound when Aaron and his crew arrived. The soft lighting, paintings, clean but totally time-warp feel, wallpaper with velvet touches, a ladies room with a lounge sofa to die for, a bar straight out of the Shining...I mean, this is a classy place to bring grandma or someone you wanna get in their pants or just friends to shoot the shit all adult like. Right on.
