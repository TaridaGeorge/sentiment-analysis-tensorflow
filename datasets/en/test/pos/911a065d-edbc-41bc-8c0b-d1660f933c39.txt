Defintely agree this place is for atmosphere and alcohol. The double AA's...not so much the food. The art piece in the middle changes every few months and the bathrooms are like walking into a mirror box. Love the large Martini's top shelf liquor and atmosphere very unlike your typical Tex/Mex/AZ eatery. Recommend getting good directions--you can't see it from the road and be wary of the area--even though Arizona is touted for outdoor living the patio can get very cold at night or sometimes sweating hot in Summer-Yes even at night.
