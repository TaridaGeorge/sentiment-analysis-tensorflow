This place is quite nice. I go here a lot and have tried almost everything on the menu. I've only had one thing on the menu that I didn't care for much and that was the tuna sandwich. But everything else was delicious. My favorites are the Calzones, cheese pizza, grilled roast beef sadwich and their raviolli. It's really hard to pick something that you won't be impressed with here for the price.
