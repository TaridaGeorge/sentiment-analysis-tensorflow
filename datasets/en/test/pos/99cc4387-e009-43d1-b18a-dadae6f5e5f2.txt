The new owner of Mountain View Coffee in Fountain Hills is doing a fantastic job with the place!
Great coffee as always, but the daily fresh baked goods (must try almond twist and turkey, provolone, pesto croissant sand.) are the star here. 
Decor is a nice change from before; a cleaner Scandinavian update from the owner.
Fast becoming a meeting place in Fountain Hills, both social and business. 
You have to get there if you, like me, were sad to see the shop empty for so long.
