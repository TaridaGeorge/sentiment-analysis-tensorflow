Everything about the restaurant and market are delightful.  It has a euro feel with the narrow market quarters and glassed selections of baked goods and other tasty morsels.  I've stopped in several times before but never had a chance to enjoy a dinner service.  A friend and I decided to dine and were quite happy with everything.

We got a kale and quinoa salad that was enjoyed to every last bit.  We then followed up with a pizza which was so amazing it left me wondering what I actually got because I was so happy with it!  We enjoyed wine with each plate and the selection is broad for regions and open for varietals.  Basically something for everyone.  Service was spot on even though she was a new server she was prompt with responses, cordial and observant.  I'll be back most definitely!
