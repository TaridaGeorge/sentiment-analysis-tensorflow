This place is the bomb diggity. Really cheap and really good. This is the only place that I will go for Greek food. I always get the falafel sandwich with fries and my boyfriend gets the cheese steak. The falafel is perfectly cooked and the pita is nice and soft.  Service is great, the shop guys are always joking around and having fun. 
I agree with Mitch G. on staying open later!!
