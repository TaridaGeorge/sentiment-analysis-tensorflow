Having lived on the East Coast, I loved seeing Brueggers in Phoenix. Their cinnamon sugar bagels are to die for and their customer service rocked when I went in!

The parking at this location is the only down side but personally, I'll park at Biltmore and walk over (just easier for me). This is a refreshing addition to the area--hope it lasts because the signage isn't exactly obvious!
