My family and I have been eating here for years.  It is a very unassuming restaurant in a strip mall location.  The food is always consistently great and the salad you get with your entree is the best.  Also, the garlic bread is amazing.  Some of the dishes I have had the pleasure of inhaling here are the lasagne, chicken saltinboka, fetachini alfredo, linguini carbonara, linguini and clam sauce, sausage and peppers, oh I could go on and on.  Also, they have a small bar which is dark and relaxing.
