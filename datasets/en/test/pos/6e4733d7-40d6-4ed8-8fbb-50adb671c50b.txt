Paletas Betty makes the best frozen treats I've ever had, and I have had my fair share of ice pops.  Each one is hand-made with fresh, natural ingredients, and you can taste that fact in each bite.  Their Naranja flavor is the best, perfect for a hot day in Arizona, or even the few cold ones.  The staff are always friendly and the location itself has some nice tables to sit down and take a break to hang out with friends or use their free WiFi.  Also, they're open late!  This is perfection.
