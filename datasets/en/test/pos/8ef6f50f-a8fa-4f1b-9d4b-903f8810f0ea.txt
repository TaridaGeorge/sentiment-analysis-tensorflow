I am really surprised at some of the reviews on here. I consider this one of my top go to places for pizza. I don't do chain pizza if at all possible. And this is really good New York style pizza. Give it a try before you write Prima off due to the poor reviews by people that obviously think chain crap is good pizza. What do have to lose, that lunch special is awesome!
