Family style, friendly, mom&pop, yummy italian restaurant! 5/5

This restaurant is definitely one of our fav in town! We are lucky to find it about a year ago. Giuseppe is a family-owned italian restaurant on N. Scottsdale Rd with super friendly services. My favorate dishes there are on their 'chef recommended' menu. The price is higher than the rest of the entrees on the menu but not super expensive. One 'chef-recommended' entree is about $15. Very affortable and you won't dissapointed with the food. My all time fav dish there is a tomato based seafood pasta (only available over the weekends). This restaurant is a BYOW place~ Deserts is amazing too... Yumm...
