I been to many stadiums and this is one of my favorites. I attended a game against the Atlanta Braves and it was a great experience.

Food prices are typical for any MLB stadium but get the combo meals and it seems cheaper. The bigger the beer the cheaper it seems. There really isn't a bad seat inside the entire place. Get there early enough and you can go down tot he bleachers during batting practice to catch a homerun hit. The staff is very friendly and talkative.

If I lived in Arizona I would get season tickets. The merchandise pricing is pretty cheap too compared to most stadiums. $23 for a hat compared to $41 at Dodgers Stadium.
