Just had an excellent dinner here the other night - we had great service on a very busy night (the Final Four games were on), too.

My meal:
Three Sisters salsa trio: nice way to start a meal for a group. Three different salsas (two red, one green) with homemade tortilla chips and fry bread. 

Barbeque glazed salmon over squash/sweet potato hash and a tamarind sauce: I haven't had a salmon dish this good/unique in a long time. Highly recommended.

And, the obligatory margarita (known as a "Tontorita" here) - very good.

We sat inside, but the outdoor seating area looked great! Hoping to visit again someday soon to enjoy the outdoor setting in person.
