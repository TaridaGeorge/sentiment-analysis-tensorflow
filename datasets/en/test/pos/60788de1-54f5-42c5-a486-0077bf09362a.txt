Bryan is very efficient and professional.  Not only has helped me with real estate questions but has helped many people I know.  This market is tough and he has weathered the storm.  He broad knowledge base in the industry is a great quality and because of that I have recommended him to many people.  Some agents' bottom line is their commission check which makes it feel rushed and impersonal, Bryan isn't like that.  He listens to your needs, wants and what you can really afford.  Home buying is a daunting task, but he makes it not as scary.  He is able to steer you in the right direction as well if you aren't really sure on what you want.  His personal, customized service makes him stand out in the industry.
