Fantastic find for delicious, healthy food and good service!! 

A local friend said that they'd heard good things but hadn't been yet. They asked us to check it out., so we went for a late lunch mid-week and it was still jam packed (30 minute wait) at 1:30 p.m.. We sat at the bar and received terrific service. The fish tacos, steak tacos, bison burger and desserts were all delicious.

It is an open-air style restaurant where you can see into the kitchen. All ingredients are super fresh and the culinary quality is extremely high given that they can make even the healthiest things taste wonderful. I strongly recommend this to anyone looking for a healthy food alternative.
