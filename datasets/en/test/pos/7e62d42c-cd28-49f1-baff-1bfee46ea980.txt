Sam has a great setup at Maduro.  His cigar shop is nestled in Carefree adjacent to a killer wine bar.  Sam has a huge selection of cigars and accessories, and he really knows his stuff. I love cigars, but my pallet is different than the boys, so he is very helpful in guiding me through the vast array of cigars to find the right one for my man (or ex-man, anyway).  He also keeps the old cigar boxes which are great gift idea. 

Once you buy your cigar, you can take a seat on the sunset facing patio, order yourself a glass of vino from next door, and light up! There are a ton of regulars here and they all congregate on the patio. You can sit off to the side and enjoy some privacy or plop down at the communal seating area and make some new friends.
