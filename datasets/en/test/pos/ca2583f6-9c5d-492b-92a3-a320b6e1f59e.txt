I recently moved to this neighborhood. I stumbled upon this place one day when I was headed to the pizza place next door, but I didn't really want pizza. WOW, what a great find. The food is fresh and prepared quickly, and the portions are huge. The staff are very nice. I usually get the small, which is enough for two meals. Now, I call to place an order for pickup, and they tell me 15 minutes, but it is usually closer to 5. Delivery has been very quick as well. I have tried almost everything on the menu, and love it all.
