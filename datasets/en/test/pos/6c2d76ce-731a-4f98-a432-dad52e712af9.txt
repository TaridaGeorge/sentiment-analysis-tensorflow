I've been going to 5th Generation Barbers since I moved to Phoenix last summer and haven't stopped since. Arthur and his crew take their time and make sure you are getting exactly what you want. As an added bonus, they have two flat screens if you ever wanna catch Sportscenter while getting your trim. Highly recommended!
