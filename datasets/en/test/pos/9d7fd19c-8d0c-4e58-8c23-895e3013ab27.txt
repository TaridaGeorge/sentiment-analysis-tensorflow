Amazing thrift store! The owner was extremely kind and polite to me so I'm not too sure why one reviewer was saying he was rude. They had baskets of clothes out front that were free for homeless or needy people which I thought was great considering places like goodwill often overcharge for clothing that should be donated to those in need. Great find on a Robert cavalli jacket and J.crew pants that were literally like new. Prices were completely reasonable for quality second hand clothing. For sure will go back!!!
