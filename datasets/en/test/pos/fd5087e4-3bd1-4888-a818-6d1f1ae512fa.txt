No joke, I've probably driven by Schreiner's 500 hundred times over the last eight years, two of which years I lived blocks away! I always thought it was some closed up business. Thankfully Yelp comes thru again! 

Went there for their $5 brown bag lunch (choice of sausage, bag of chips, and a soda...they have coke and pepsi) and sat at table they had set up in a little grass area. 

I had a bratwurst and it was great. Schreiner's will definitely become a regular lunch spot for me!!
