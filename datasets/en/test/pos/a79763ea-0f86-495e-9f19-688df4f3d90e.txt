My wife and I had a good experience practicing Bikram Yoga on an unlimited month pass we bought using Groupon. It was a heck of a deal. Every instructor we had is great. They each have their own unique way of giving the class. I would like to attend more sessions but work has gotten a little too hectic. The 5:15 class in the afternoon is really popular and gets really packed but they know how to fit as many people in a class that they can.  Hopefully when things calm down at work we can purchase another package.
