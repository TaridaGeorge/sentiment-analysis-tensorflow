As I was looking to diversify my workouts, a friend suggested I pick up crossfit a few months back, and specifically recommended Crossfit 480 as the place to start it up. They couldn't have been more right- from the day I started I have been hooked, and appreciated the way that Derek and Brian run their gym. Derek is an excellent instructor, truly defining what a coach is. He is constantly making sure that form is accurate and pushes everyone to a higher level of fitness. They have created a community at Crossfit 480 that is uncommon, even for crossfit. All the members are supportive and hard-working, a reflection of both Derek and Brian. 

If you're thinking of joining crossfit, DO IT. And if you happen to be doing so in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area, try out Crossfit 480!
