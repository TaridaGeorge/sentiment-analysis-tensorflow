Best... wedding.... cake.... ever!!!!

On a recommendation from a friend, we had Robert's make our three-tier, two flavor wedding cake in 2005, and went back again for a small replica for our first anniversary.  It was sooo good, and a ton of people gave us compliments for it being wedding cake that they actually enjoyed.  The Robert's staff worked with us on the design, had us in for multiple tastings, and created the perfect cake for us!   The neighborhood is a little sketchy (Arizona Ave in Chandler) but the cheap location is probably part of what makes these cakes so affordable.  Highly recommended for weddings/other events!
