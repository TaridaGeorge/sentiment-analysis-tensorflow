This place is so good. The owners Ivan and Chona were very personable and the samples were wonderful, we ended up getting a good selection of BBQ Chicken, BBQ Pork Belly, and Shrimp and Beef Skewers. We also had the banana rolls with ice cream, 

Go in the side door and not the main door, unless you love the smell of fish. The smell is not coming from Wholly Grill, but it is in the market.
