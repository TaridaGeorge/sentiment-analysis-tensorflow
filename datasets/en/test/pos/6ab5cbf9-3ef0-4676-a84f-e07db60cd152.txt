This supermarket is always one of our first stops when we visit from Baltimore. The prices are sometimes a little high, but he quality is consistently excellent. We love the sandwhiches, in which they use boars head meats. My wife gets a cappucino here daily, and their selection of coffee beans is pretty extensive. Great fresh produce and a very pleasant staff round out the experience.
