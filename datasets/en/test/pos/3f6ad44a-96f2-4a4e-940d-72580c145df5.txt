If someone gives a bad review on this place, take it to the bank; they're clueless.  This seafood place is the best the East Valley can offer. No, were not in Boston or New Hampshire but it's it's good.  Make a reservation a week ahead of time; you'll never get in if you don't.  My only criticism would be the salads; they don't offer caesar.
