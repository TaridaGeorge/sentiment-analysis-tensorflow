This is one of my favorite places!  My friend and I often go after the gym (LA Fitness is a few doors down).   We take our 2 little kids and the staff at Cyprus is so nice to the kids, friendly and we always get fast and fresh food.  I love the salads and pita sandwiches with fresh chopped cucumber and tomato!  The tzatsiki sauce is ridiculously good and I could happily pour it over everything and eat entirely too much pita with it!  And, although it looks weird, the schefitalia (spelling?) meatballs are really good.
