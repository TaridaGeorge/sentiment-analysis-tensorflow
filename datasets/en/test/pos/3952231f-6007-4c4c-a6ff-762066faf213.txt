Rachel is an absolute gem. I wanted to send flowers to the love of my life across state lines and had no idea who I could trust. Thanks to trusty Yelp, I met Rachel. Not only has she gone above and beyond her job, she sent photos to make sure I liked them, delivered for free since I was in Scottsdale, and was very on point with all my needs. 

For all my cross state flower needs, Rachel will be my florist. Thank you so much for all your help and I look forward to working with you again!
