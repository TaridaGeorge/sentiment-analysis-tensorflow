Screw ice cream, I'm converting to Gelato!
Always was a huge fan of gelato but to be honest, I have been disappointed to many times here in the States by little shops trying to get it right. FROST however hit the nail on the head! This place packs a bunch of flavor into one amazing product! All of the flavors I've tried, and believe me there were a lot, where outstanding.

So if your in the area, swing in and try some flavors. Don't be shy, they say you can try all!
