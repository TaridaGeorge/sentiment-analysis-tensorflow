Love Spinato's! Eat it all the time. If you think it's not good you probably ordered wrong. :-)
We always order the thick crust with garlic, feta, salami, italian beef and basil. Toppings are ALWAYS plentiful. If you think the sauce is too sweet (which I don't) try adding garlic, feta, even a little sprinkle of salt. This pizza is to die for! Yummy!
