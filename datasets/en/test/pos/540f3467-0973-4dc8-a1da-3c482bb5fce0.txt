This is a shaved ice hut, that is fast, friendly and great. The usually have buy 1 get another free coupons in mailers and the Sunday paper. This helps on the price. 

BEWARE. They are closed on Sunday. We found this out walking over from Sushi Creek (same plaza, has happy hour all day Sunday) for dessert. 

What they call a bahama mama is a shaved ice with blue bell ice cream in the bottom. It's worth the extra 1.50$. Our favorite so far is "rootbeer float". It's a scary green/yellow color but tastes amazing.
