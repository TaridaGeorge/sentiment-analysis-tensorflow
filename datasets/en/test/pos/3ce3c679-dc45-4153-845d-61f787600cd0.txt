I found a local barbershop down the street from where I live and I took my two boys to try it and I have never been so satisfied!! My boys actually want to get their haircuts done now every week! Before I struggled with them because they move alot and are usually scared of the barbers! At this shop, they actually get to watch what they want while getting their haircut and they love it! Plus the barbers there are very friendly and it feels very heart warming to know that a barber actually remembers your kids names! :)
