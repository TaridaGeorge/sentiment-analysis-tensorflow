Me and malls, BLECCCHH.....but I have to say, I love this mall.  I miss this mall.  I could walk this entire HUUUUUUUUUGE mall and never get bored.  Tired, yes, but never bored.  They really built this place up over the years, and it's gorgeous.  Some very high end, but also some reasonably priced stores, too.  I haven't even seen it in the past few years (having moved to CA), but I speak with friends, who tell me the latest happenings.  They frequent this mall all the time.  It's okay......I WILL go back someday.  This mall has something for everyone.  I can't say that about most malls.....at least out here in SoCal.
