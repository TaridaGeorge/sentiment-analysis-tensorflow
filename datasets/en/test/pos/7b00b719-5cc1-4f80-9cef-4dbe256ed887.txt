After seeing the Fate Brewing opening announcement on yelp I went to try it out.

We visited during the soft opening.  

The ambiance is warm and casual with a very open and airy feel.

The beer is quite good. The Pale Ale will be familiar and likable for those who enjoy Stone Brewing products.

The cream ale is for those that like the American mass produced lagers (your Bud and miller lite drinking friends).

The double IPA needs to be given a chance to warm up before enjoying it.  It was good but I think overshadowed by how good the Pale Ale, an India Pale Ale in all but name.

I had the capicola pizza which was quite good and arrived at the table quickly.

I give this four stars for the beer and food and a bonus star for the friendly and efficient staff.
