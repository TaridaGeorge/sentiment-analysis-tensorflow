Postino's is FANTASTIC. 

Of course, their bruschetta is the talk of the town.

I've tried the apple brie, the salami, the smoked salmon, and a few others. They have cheap pitchers of great beer and great deals on wine. The atmosphere is classy and it's always busy. The waiters are attentive and if I haven't already mentioned, the food is fantastic.

One of the gems in downtown Phoenix area.
