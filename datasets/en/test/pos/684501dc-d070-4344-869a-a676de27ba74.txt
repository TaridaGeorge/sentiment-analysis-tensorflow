This is my favorite restaurant in the whole valley. I have eaten here so many times over the past two years I could not possibly list all the delightful meals I have enjoyed.  I have never ever left here hungry, I don't think it's possible, frankly.  The chefs create artistic masterpieces in that small kitchen, using regional proteins and veggies, creating pates, jellies and cured meats in house, and even selling their delicious selection of cheeses retail out of the AZ Wine side of the shop. 

I highly recommend grabbing a bottle of wine and heading over there for an amazing meal.
