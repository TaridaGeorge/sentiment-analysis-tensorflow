Nobuo has been on my Dining To Do List for sometime and I am very glad that I was able to check it off.  The food was nothing but Amazing!  We started off with Nasu and Teeter Tots.  The Nasu can be served without bacon if you are a vegetarian. We then moved on to the Yellowtail Ceviche and Shiromi Carpaccio.  The presentation of the Yellowtail was perfect and the Shiromi is a not to missed item. It was exceptional! We finished dinner with the Seabass and Mushrooms.   It was perfect for myself and my husband. He enjoyed the Seabass while I focused on the mushrooms.  

Not only was the food great but the service was outstanding as well.  I am looking forward to returing to Nobuo in the very near future and bringing a few friends!
