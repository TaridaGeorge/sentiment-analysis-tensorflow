Shelley doesn't disappoint! I meandered back in today. Heaven help me!

On the counter she proudly displayed her experimental "tweenkies". Um, yum. Yes, I ate one. She looked at it before she gave it to me, and said, "I need to make sure that I've put enough filling in. Here, let me put some extra next to it just in case."

I responded, "Well, we wouldn't want me to miss out!"

I also told her that one of the oatmeal caramel bars told me it needed to go home with me. She examined the bars and made sure the biggest one is the one I got. :)

I think Shelley and my personal trainer are going to have to have a smack-down in the near future.
