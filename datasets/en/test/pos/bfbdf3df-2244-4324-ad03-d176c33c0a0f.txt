Why I don't set up a cot and just sleep at this place, I don't know. I have reviewed this place before, but I stopped in a couple times in the last month (yes, I should get my arteries checked). 

Chicken = Fantastic, Mac & Cheese = Fantastic, and the Red Velvet Cake = To die for.

However, I wanted to add something I just had. Stupid Fries. These things are great for sharing. Cripsy fries, topped with a chopped up fried chicken breast, cheese, red and green bell peppers and gravy. They are off the hook good. 

You should go there soon.
