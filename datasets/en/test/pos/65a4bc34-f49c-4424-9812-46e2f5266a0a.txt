This location is quieter than the one at Arizona Mills Mall. No screaming kids in your way. The clothes are less disheveled, still attached to the hanger, but for the same low price. I get my husband's work shirts here for like $8. Ross understands that there are still skinny Americans out there and they carry size 4 pants. YESSSSS!

I -3 the unusual house goods you can find at Ross. I redid my whole bathroom and made it into a nice Victorian style in light pink and a wood brown. They had this soft-green painted shelf that looked like a twisted vine. Where else can you find something like that? I found these two toothbrush cups that were painted with butterflies. Worth the $5 each. My bathroom is gorgeous. You'll want to take a crap in there.
