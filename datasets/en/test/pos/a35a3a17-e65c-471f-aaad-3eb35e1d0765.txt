I always leave this place feeling rejuvenated and healthy - you can FEEL this food is good for your body, heart, and mind. I have never had anything bad here, and I am a meat and potatoes kind of guy, and I would eat here every day if I had the time and could afford it! The staff are EXTREMELY helpful with food and especially tea choices, and the ambiance and "aura" add to the feeling of well-being after treating your body to the way food SHOULD be. I can't recommend this place highly enough.
Too bad they close so early....
