Ordered the famous "Butter Burger" medium rare. Forget lettuce, tomato, and pickle, eat this with cheese and maybe some ketchup to let that beef shine through. Delicious! Great diner atmosphere, got to sit at the counter.

Happy to see it was Niman Ranch beef, a sustainable/organic livestock provider.
