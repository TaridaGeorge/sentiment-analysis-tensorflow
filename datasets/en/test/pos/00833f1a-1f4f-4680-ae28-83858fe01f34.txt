This festival is one of my favorite annual events in Phoenix.  I loved the new downtown location, but I had trouble locating the bike racks, which turned out to be by the beer garden.  I love the fact that this was such a bike and light rail-friendly location.  This year, the festival sold tickets to taste samples from local restaurants.  I thought it was a great idea, and sampled lots of goodies.  I enjoyed the beer and wine garden, and the fact that there were multiple breweries represented there.  I thought the music has been better in past festivals, but I still whole-heartedly recommend this event.
