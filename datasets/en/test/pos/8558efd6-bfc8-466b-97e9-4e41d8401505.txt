I loved Citizen Public House and more importantly, their chopped salad.  We had a large group of girls celebrating a bday and walked in kind of late with no reservations.  Because we had to wait a bit, the staff opened up a bottle of champagne on the house and let us start the night with some bubbly.  Everyone loved what they ordered and special shout outs go out to the chopped salad (again), buttermilk roasted chicken and pan seared scallops.  The service was excellent and I would come back in a heartbeat whenever visiting Scottsdale.
