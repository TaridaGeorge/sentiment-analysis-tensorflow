Very excited to see this in my 'hood as I used to drive to South Scottsdale to Udupi for the Gobi (Cauliflower) Manchurian and the decadent puffy bread. Who would have thought  you'd crave a cauiflower dish, but you will after you try it. There also is an eggplant dish that is divine. This casual place is the best for vegetarian South Indian food. Can't understand any negative reviews. Friendly staff, condiment bar, and delicious ,food. Don't forget to try a dosa, many to choose from and the speciality of the house.
