Best way to pass the time for the infamous wait for Pizzeria Bianco. I had a great time with a friend here. 

It's a cozy place with a historical feel. Take a look in the drawers to find the visitors log and write something... even read some of what's been written. 

If you're going to be waiting for pizza... spend your time here. Have a great conversation, enjoy local brews, you won't regret it. 

Don't give this place impossible expectations ( you self proclaimed "foodies" are killing all the fun!)... enjoy this place.
