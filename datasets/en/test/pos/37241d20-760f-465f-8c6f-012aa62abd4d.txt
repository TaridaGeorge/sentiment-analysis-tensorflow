Smashburger is one of my favorite burgers because I find it to be tastier than most burgers out there. I like this new restaurant a lot for the same reasons I like the other Smashburger establishments - tasty burgers, friendly and efficient staff, bright and clean interiors and exterior, a comfy patio area for al fresco dining. Great location too, in a shopping area that is not too busy so that parking is not a problem. I guess my only "complaint" is that it is only 2 blocks from my gym, making it hard to resist when I pass by hungry after a workout ;)
