100% bomb! Everything they make oozes amazing, homemade, quality goodness. The pancakes are heaven, the hog and chick is fab, and the rosemary breakfast potatoes are perfect. I have been a handful of times, and it's always worth the wait.

Note: This place is ridiculously small (but charming), so don't go with a bunch of friends and expect to sit together...or be seated anytime soon. Carry out is a good option, but only for those who have had the sit in experience first ;)
