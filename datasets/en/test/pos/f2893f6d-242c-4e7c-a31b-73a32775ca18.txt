I LOVE IKEA!  
Part 1:
The food!  Breakfast here is $1.99 and it's great!  The coffee is very good.  You can enjoy breakfast before they open.  The lunch time menu is wide.  I love the meatballs.  They are so good.  You can get a $1 drink and refill it many times as you shop.  The take home food is always a bargain.  You must try the dark chocolate.

Part 2:
The stuff!  We have a house full of IKEA items.  They are great!  Lots of hits, few misses, they make great stuff.

Part 3:
The "living in 500 square feet" rooms.  I love how these are set up.  The layouts are so clever.  We get a lot of ideas just by checkin out the rooms.  Well done IKEA.
