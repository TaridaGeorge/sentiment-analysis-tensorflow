New owners took over this place a little over a week ago and they know what customer service is all about..it's refreshing to stop in and find the owner mingling with their customers and making sure they are enjoying themselves and asking for suggestions on how to make the place a better experience.
The food is amazing,especially the wings..
If you haven't been there lately it deserves another look, with the new owners you will be pleasantly surprised!
