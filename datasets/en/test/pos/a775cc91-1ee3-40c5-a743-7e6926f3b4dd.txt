My husband and I were on our way to Subway and decided to try Zaytoon instead. Sorry Subway this is now my go to place for a quick meal that happens to be right by my house.

We both had  the Gyro's which were HUGE we probably could have shared one. Our son had the chicken kabob. Both items were delicious. Our items also came with fries that didn't even get touched. 

Prices were fair. Looking forward to going back to try the daily specials!
