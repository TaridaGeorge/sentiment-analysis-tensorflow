I'm from Philly and am a self appointed gnocchi connoisseur.  My I laws and I are on a life long quest to find the best gnocchi in the country.  Said In laws were in Gilbert last month and ate here.  The lauded the gnocchi as the best ever.  So this trip we had to try them.  They are close if not the best I've eaten. The vodka sauce is spectacular! The gnocchi are like little clouds of deliciousness...well most of them.  The only glitch, and it is tiny but we are talking the best gnocchi in the country here, so if we find a nit we must pick it. They needed to be stirred and cooked for a few more seconds as some were not fully cooked.  The under cooked were a little bit "doughy".  All in all the are great, go there and eat them!
