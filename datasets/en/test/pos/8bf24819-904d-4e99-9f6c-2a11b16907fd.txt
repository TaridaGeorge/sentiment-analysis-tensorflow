This is the second time we've come here & each time has been phenominal! Friendly service, amazing food & both times we had live acordian music! So authentic & delicious. The staff couldn't be nicer. The only thing I wish I could change (besides the distance from my house!) is the size of the restaurant. If you go during dinner on Fridays & Saturdays, you may need to wait, but it's WAY worth it. I found out tonight, they make their own mustard...I am loyal to Guldens brown mustard & I described it as "a bit better than Guldens" if that gives you an idea   ;)    . I just love the atmosphere, long tables, music & food! Please please please!!! If you ever have the chance, go HERE. Pretty easy to find, pleanty of parking & a great deal (prices are great too!).
