COOKIES!! Most likely you'll only find yourself at this place if you're in downtown Phoenix on business or at the convention center for a show, but they have these incredibly delicious chocolate chip cookies.  A coworker brought us a bunch back and they were soooo good!

Bottom line: Great chocolate chip cookies are a weakness of mine and the cookies from this place are like kryptonite to me.
