You'll come to CPH for the cocktails.....you'll stay for the food!

Citizen's Public House is my go-to destination for craft cocktails in the Valley. These guys mix all the standards exceedingly well, but take it to a new level with their barrel-aged concoctions. I often order a Sazerac (being a home-sick New Orleanian) and these guys make the best one you can find outside of New Orleans. The Happy Hour is a scorching hot deal, half price beer, wines and bar snacks (and they always have a great selection of all 3!). 

The food is pretty amazing too....the pork belly pastrami is phenomenal. The chopped salad is iconic (has it's own facebook page?!) My favorite entrees are the scallops, Amaro meatloaf and Lamb Burger, but I've never had a bad dish here. Ever (and I work 2 blocks away and come here at least 1-2 times a month).
