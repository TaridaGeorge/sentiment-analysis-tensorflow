My favorite neighborhood grocery store! Great selection of some interesting variation of the foods I like to eat... all at reasonable prices while maintaining high quality.

I also like the fact that these stores are not very large. Makes it easy to navigate and find what you are looking for. 

Much more fun to go to Trader Joes than to WholeFoods... in my humble opinion.
