Heather did my wedding this past weekend. She was amazing. She is an incredibly nice person, and just nailed exactly what we were looking for. We all wanted to look natural, but obviously made up for the wedding. She listened to everyone's desires, and we all walked away feeling like a million bucks. I would recommend her to anybody.
