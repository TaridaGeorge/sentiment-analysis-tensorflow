Ditto to what every one else has said; this place is definitely worth checking out (and re-visiting in my case!). 

In short, the food was great & reasonably priced too. My exposure to Scandenavian cuisine has been limited to Ikea, so it's nice to have somewhere that offers a little bit of Sweden right down the street from my house.

Even better than the food was the service. The family that runs the place is adorable & eager to please. They take care to give all patrons A+ service, and this certainly made an impression on me.

No doubt about it, I'll be returning with by friends to try the desserts (as I was too stuffed from my gigantic meal to even try and tackle the sweet treats!)
