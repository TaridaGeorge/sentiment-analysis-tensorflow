You really gotta be either insane or an idiot to mess with near perfection, and that's exactly what Lux did when they moved next door and added liquor to the mix.

Well that is unless I guess you really know what you're doing ... and the owners CLEARLY know what they are doing. This place is bigger and better than the old Lux and I never expected to say that.

This place is a diamond in the rough. There is no coffee shop within 300 miles that is this hip, this cool and this awesome.

Oh yeah ... the coffee is damned good to!
