I really enjoyed my hike here!  When we drove up I saw how many trails there were so we really had our work cut out for us.  One of my favorite things when hiking is when there is a lot of looks rocks, it is a great workout.  This mountain had that, is was perfectly steep, and just invigorating.  The scenery is breath taking and makes you really appreciate life.  Hike here for sure.  I am going again.
