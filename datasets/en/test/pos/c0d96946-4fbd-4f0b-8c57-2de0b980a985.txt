This is the 4th time I have been there and it was the best experience this time.  The service was outstanding.  The waiter kept checking on us and refills came without asking (even after the bill was paid).  I ordered the naked fish selection: blacken costa rica mahi with dirty rice.  WOW, it was very tasty and delicious!  I ordered my fish well, the normally serve it medium.  I was so full, I did not make it to dessert.  The other ladies were impressed too.  One had the cedar planked salmon and the other had a greek salad.  No complaints from us...
