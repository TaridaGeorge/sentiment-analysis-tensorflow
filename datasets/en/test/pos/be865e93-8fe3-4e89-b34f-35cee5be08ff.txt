Char's is AMAZING... Great music/artists, great people, great atmosphere! It doesn't look like much from the street, but once you walk in you will be pleasantly surprised! I went for the first time last weekend and I will be going back again and again. I'm not sure if they were going for this, but it reminded me of a jazz club from the speakeasy era. I would give it a 10 if I could!
