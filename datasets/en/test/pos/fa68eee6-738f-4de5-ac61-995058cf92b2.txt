I have eaten quite a bit of Caribbean food over the years, having spent my high school in the islands. The jerk chicken (has a kick!) was excellent and fresh, as was the curry chicken. Patties straight from new York, ginger beer, fried plantains and a number of other island delicacies. It's a treat you don't want to miss. This food is kind of Indian/African influenced home cooking, if that makes any sense. A treat for the mildly adventurous palate!
