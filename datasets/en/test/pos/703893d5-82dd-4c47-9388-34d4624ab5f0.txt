Great running store; very friendly and helpful. I walked in on Saturday and Brooks was hosting a carnival-style event there with a double-decker bus. I had my running form assessed on video and was given personal attention (despite the crowds) to find my perfect fit. The store is also a good size: large enough to be well-stocked, but not so big that you get lost and confused. I will definitely be back here for all future running needs.
