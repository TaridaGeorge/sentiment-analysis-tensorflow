There is not much to say other then...AWESOME. This place is bomb and you should just poke yourself in the eye if you think otherwise. Solid bbq and southern cooking. All negative reviews must of had a booger in their eye. GO...NOW....JUST STOP READING AND GO AND ENJOY.  

o HUGE SERVINGS...SHARABLE....I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M YELLING!!
