say "yes" to fez!  

came here for breakfast with my lover and some friends.  got the fez benedict----tres wow!  perfectly poached eggs w/ jamon on sourdough. sipped peach belinis (a fabulous cocktail of peach and champagne).  kill me now, please...soooo good. 

server was very sweet and handsome, friendly yet unobtrusive.  

decor was not memorable.  just another sheik, unthreatening phoenix interior lined w/ big windows.
