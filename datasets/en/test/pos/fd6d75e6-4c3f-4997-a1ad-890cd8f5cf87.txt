Blink and you might miss where Matt's Big Breakfast is located. But don't let the small size of this breakfast hot spot fool you, nor let the long wait deter you. Matt's had been right around the corner from me, and I had no idea until today what I had been missing out on. A group of friends and I all sprung for the daily special of scrambled eggs incorporated with hot links, white cheese, and peppers paired with delicious home fries. So while the wait, especially during a blustery summer day in Phoenix may make you want to stray, don't, and you will be in for a treat!
