Great breakfast before golfing in Scottsdale. Had really great omelette with a side of fruit & rye toast.  Boyfriend loved his breakfast also. Wait staff was super friendly and brought pitchers of iced tea & diet coke so we never ran out. Quick and efficient, it was the best breakfast we had on our trip.
