I found Scott here on Yelp.  

I gave Scott a call and received a call the next day.  Scott came by the house and gave me an estimate.  Pricing was good and he started the next week.  Scott blew me away with the work he did.  My yard has never looked this good.  I'm not sure why K K never received a call back....   I know Scott takes vacation like everyone esle .... so maybe he was out and unable to contact him.. I don't know.

I have had nothing but great service so far. 

Thanks Scott!
