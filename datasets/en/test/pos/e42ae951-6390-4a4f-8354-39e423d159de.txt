On a fine Saturday had to make it out to this spot I kept hearing Beaver Choice is the best... I entered the restaurant everyone was so friendly you could tell everyone cared about what they were doing and wanted to put out the best product they could. I ordered the Chicken Schnitzel Cordon-Bleu (Half a pound double chicken schnitzel stuffed with French brie cheese and black forest ham served with a mushroom sauce. Severed with one side I went with the Pan Fried Thyme Potatoes along with three side salads I went with the Homemade Coleslaw, Marinated Green Beans and Sauerkraut... It was one of the best meals I have had in a long time it's hard to find home cooked meals when you're not at home. I will be back for sure I still need to try a beaver cookie.
