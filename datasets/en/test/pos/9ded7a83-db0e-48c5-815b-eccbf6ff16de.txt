I consider myself a foodie. That being said, I LOVE it when you get extra bang for your buck. Which is why I absolutely love Stax. Everything that I've ever eaten here has been delicious, and I've tried almost everything on the menu, from their more traditional beef and turkey burgers, to their mac & cheese, to the smothered tots to the hummus to the wedge salad. Everything tastes fresh, delicious and tends to have an unexpected flavor profile or twist. 

Their red sangria is my go-to, although they are stocked with great beers as well. 

Happy hour values are incredible. 

Marshall, one of the bartenders, is extremely friendly and will remember your name and your menu favs after just a couple visits. His customer service is superb.
