Amazingly large and diverse wine selection and ever changing "flight" menu. The dark cozy atmosphere makes it a perfect date spot or casual hang w/ friends. Sometimes on crowded nights, its standing room only. But the crowd and music is great so you won't even notice. 

Tip: Jazz on Monday & Thursday nights. Flemenco dancers on Sunday.  $5 cover on entertainment nights.
