I just had Delta Mechanical replace my sediment-clogged, out-of-warrantee electric hot water heater with a new one. I must say that my experience was far different from the other reviewers. I was called by the workman in advance to let me know the exact time he would arrive, and he replaced the unit in less than two hours. He was knowledgeable and friendly as was the office person I originally dealt with. I feel I got great service and an excellent price for everything, including installation and unit. They were 5 stars for me.
