I have been to Defalco's so many times in the past, but since I had not been in quite some time due to moving out of the area I did not feel I could review it.  But I am back in the area because my company moved to the new Sky Song location right down the street.  I was so excited to come back to Defalco's!  It is still as good as I remember:)... I had the hard salami and provolone sub with a side of veggie pasta salad.  So Good!  this is going to be one of my regular lunch locations for sure!
