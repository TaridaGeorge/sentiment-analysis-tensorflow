Ah Amsterdam, what can I say, I remember when it first opened in 2000, the cute girl bartender who would wear wigs every other night, and all the boys!  I got my first kiss from a boy who slammed me up on the exterior brick wall, --It was wonderful....and so was Amsterdam, so what if they are a little over priced, over-fashioned, over decored, over hip-hop miami beach lalapalooza fake-wanna-be's. Amsterdam, you've made an impression on my mind. I finally got my dream to ride up there in a Limo for my birthday, feathers and all.
