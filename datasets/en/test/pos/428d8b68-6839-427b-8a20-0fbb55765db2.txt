Please, please, PLEASE do your body good and get your piercing done at HTC.  They are the best in Arizona, I can guarantee you that.  (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral).  

+ Beautiful selection of jewelry.  They have bone, wood, glass...

+ They know what they're doing.  I actually had my tragus corrected here because the last guy who did it (tattoo shop, of course) did it wrong.

-/+ I have yet to decide what I think of their customer service.  Ninety-nine percent of the time they're very helpful, understanding and polite.  Once, however, I thought one guy was going to have a fit because I took my gauges out.  How was I supposed to know that was unhealthy practice?  Maybe he was just having a bad day...

+ Ask them anything.  No question is too dumb, believe me, I've asked plenty of them.
