Sounds of stirring, lunch
nears and my appetite waits
my neighbor enters.

Quick we drive to it
A simple place but look-busy!
Still no wait to sit.

Varied menu greets us
I choose the daily special
Food like its home-made.

Service is friendly.
Order comes quickly to you,
Owners always smile.

Soon it's time to go
my thoughts turn food away, but look
my wallet not empty.
