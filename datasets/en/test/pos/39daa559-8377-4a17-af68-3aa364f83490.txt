Durant's - if your anyone who knows about finer dining then you know this name.  If your looking for ambiance and to be wowed then you come to Durant's.  This particular visit was during lunchtime.  Place was busseling but the servers and kitchen didn't even break a sweat.  Professionals.  Food was fabulous as always.  I had the Asian Chicken Salad with Peanut Sauce.  TDF translation To Die For.  Loved it.  
Durant's is an oldie but goodie with prime location.
