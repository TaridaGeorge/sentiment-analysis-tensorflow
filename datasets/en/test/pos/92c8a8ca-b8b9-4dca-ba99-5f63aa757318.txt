I love this store! They have such an amazing assortment of items. All made by local artists. My favorites? Garden stake flowers made from old cars and school buses! SO beautiful! 

You'll find something for everyone here. Hand-made cutting boards, sculptures, clocks, jewelry. I could go crazy in this place.

Check it out. You won't regret it!

If you go, give Molly a pet for me.
