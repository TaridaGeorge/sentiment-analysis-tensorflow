I've been going to The Parlor since right after it opened and I have yet to have a bad meal there.  Get the meat and cheese board to start, a yummy bottle of wine and the Pesto Chitarra (sp?).  

They are super fast for takeout, as well, if you need a fix but don't have the time to linger over a lunch or dinner.  

The patio at night has some great ambiance with white lights and a fireplace.
