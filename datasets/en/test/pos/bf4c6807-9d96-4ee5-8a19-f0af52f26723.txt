I had an issue with my Dell computer that I had for less than 2 months that I purchased from Best Buy. I took it into the Geek Squad & was working with Mike & Dan. It was determined that the hard drive in the computer was damaged beyond fixing & needed to be replaced. Mike went out of his way to make sure I left the store completely satisfied with Best Buy & the Geek Squad service. These guys really earned my business for the future! I will be bringing in another computer that is ready to be upgraded and would gladly recommend Mike & Dan as a great computer resource! Glad to see BestBuy making huge strides for the future!
