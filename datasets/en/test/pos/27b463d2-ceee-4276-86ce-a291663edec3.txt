Hrmmm im honestly surprised at the lack of 5 star reviews for this location. 
I have been stopping in here for 5 or so years and have never had one bad experience. 

I stopped in on Wednesday, got a bagel with schmear and a large hot chia tea latte. 

My complaints are that the drinks come WAY SUPER HOT and the bagels always come with so much cream cheese that I have to scrap some off. Seriously, and those aren't bad complaints, im just picky. 

The service is always outstanding and fast! I never have to wait more then 3 minutes to get my hot drink and bagel in my hand. 
Keep up the good work!
