Yesterday we were exploring the downtown Scottsdale area and decided to eat here. I've been to the one in Chicago and knew that the food would be at the very least average. We each ordered the Bento Box lunch. I was blown away!!!! 

We got the onion soup, mixed green salad, grilled asparagus and grilled salmon on a bed of mashed potatoes. Everything was delicious and the perfect amount of food.
