I am born and raised in Hawaii.  This place totally reminds me of Hawaii.  For one, the Korean food is very similar to Hawaii's Korean food, like Yummies.  There's so many different plates to choose from BBQ chicken, Chicken Katsu, Spicy Pork, Kalbi, Meatjuhn-which is only Hawaii thing, etc...
After you order your plate, you have 4 choices to choose from- mac salad, kimchee, cucumber kimchee, chop chae, sweet potato, corn, etc.  
The price is reasonable for the amount of food that they give, and the owners are always nice.
