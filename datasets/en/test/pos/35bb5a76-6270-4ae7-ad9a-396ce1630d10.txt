I have lived in this area for about 3 years and pass Video Paradise daily and it wasn't until yesterday that I stopped by and checked it out.  I at 1st was unsure of what type of place they are, but boy am I am happy to have stopped by.

 

They are an independent family own movie rental shop that has been in business for 20 years, wow!! Their stock of movies very impressive, you can literally spend anywhere from 30mins to a hour just browsing the movies, yes they have all the new releases too.  


Customer service was great! Signed up for my membership and everything! You can even get 5 movies for 5 bucks for 5 days! How cool is that! 

 

It's just awesome to find another local shop to shop at!
