Went back this afternoon to enjoy happy hour with my coworkers. We had a great time and I enjoyed more of the Sonoran White Chocolate Ale. The waitress was very nice, offered to provide us with separate checks and even took our picture for us.

I loved the music, nothing better then Led Zepplin, Buffalo Springfield, and all the other great 70's tunes they were playing.

The best part is getting dinner to go and enjoying pasties at home.
