Yet again I'll say it... This is THE Vietnamese restaurant for me in Phoenix! The food and the prices are still amazing. You can leave completely stuffed for under $10 every single time you eat here, and you don't have to order the same thing every time! There are plenty of well-priced dishes on the menu. 

The thing on my mind that has to be mentioned though is their expansion. They have doubled the size of their dining room, and I couldn't be happier! Now Pho Thanh has plenty of space for all of its patrons to enjoy a hot bowl of the best beef pho in the valley! 

If you still haven't gone here, change that immediately.
