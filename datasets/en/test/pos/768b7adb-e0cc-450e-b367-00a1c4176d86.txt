I have to give it 5 stars.  I went to grad school at KU and lived at the original Planet Sub in Lawrence, KS.  It was called Yello Sub in Lawrence.  The fresh baked bread is what makes these subs.  They have a very diverse menu with lot's of vegetarian options.  My favorites are the Creamy Club and the Californian.  So glad to have "Yello Sub" (here it is called Planet Sub) back in my life.
