I love going here for lunch!  I have been there several times because it is close to work and I have to get out of the office!  I love the soups here. Just had the vegetable and the ingredients were so fresh.  The salads are also very good.  I have tried the blueberry wrap and that is one of my favorites.  I have heard from the owner that she will even be delivering to office buildings in the area.  This is the best place to go if you like everything fresh.  Perfect vegetarian spot!
