This is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant in the area. We've been going there for many years and will continue to do so. I always order what I want, which isn't even on the menu, and they're always happy to accommodate. I bring out-of-towners there whenever I can and they always rave about it.

My only complaint is their drinks have gotten too pricey and too weak at the same time.
