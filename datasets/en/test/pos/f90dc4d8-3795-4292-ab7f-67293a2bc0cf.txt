Thank you again Yelp! Would never have found this place otherwise. We loved our Sunday Breakfast here. It is a very cozy little cafe that has a nice European feel to it. 

I believe they have the best scrambled eggs I have ever had in Arizona. The coffee is hot and tasty AND refilled frequently : )

And can't forget to say that the staff are wonderful. Could not ask for better service....and they were all so happy!
