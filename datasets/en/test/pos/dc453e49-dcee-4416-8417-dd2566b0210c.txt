I don't know what it is with people complaining about the cleanliness of the water at TTL. I work at (on) the lake coaching. The water quality is continuously tested by SRP because of the number of events & activities at the lake that involve swimming or getting wet. Splash & Dash, triathlons, stand-up-paddleboard & rowing (people fall in every once in awhile). They also have to keep it clean enough that the fish don't all die when they stock it. Thanks to the lake we have a lot more activities available to us: kayaking, SUP, rowing, dragon boating, outrigger canoe, fishing, boat rentals. I love the lake and would not be able to stand living in the desert without it!
