I loved Cork.  The service was attentive and efficient.  The restaurant decor is modern and inviting, with a patio that is relaxed and comfortable.  I can't say enough a about the food which was delicious.  I had the dungeness crab cake which was perfect.  Not too much filler, just heaps of sweet, fresh crab meat.  The salad was cold, crisp, and had a nice selection of greens and veggies.  My friend and I shared a servingh of onion rings (huge enough to share) and we really loved them.  Not quite tempura batter, but light and scrumptious.  I had a cantaloupe martini that was WONDERFUL!!  This was my first visit, but I plan to return soon to try other offerings from the menu.
