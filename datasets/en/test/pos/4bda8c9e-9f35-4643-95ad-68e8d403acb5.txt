We got there an hour early for happy hour. Pretty packed but we found a good spot to stand. Drinks were strong and the prices were reasonable. The dinner show was cool but the dinner  prices are quite high for the how small the portions were. I got the seabass and my wife got the fillet. You defiantly pay for the atmosphere and ambience. Relatively loud music throughout happy hour but once you sit to eat you really only hear in the background. Had fun!
