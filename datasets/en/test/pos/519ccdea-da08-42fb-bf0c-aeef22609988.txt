Five stars for what it is - a clean, safe, easy place to stay for an overnight.
Perfect for a place to say near the airport. All I needed was a clean and comfortable place to sleep between late night arrival and early morning departure. The driver came as soon as I called and he was very friendly despite it being midnight. Quick drive, very close to the terminals. My room was very clean and the beds were comfortable. Free breakfast and wifi. Shuttles run on the half hour. 
There is even a little pool and a small exercise room with treadmill. 
I paid about $60 on Expedia. 
This will definitely be my place for future overnight layovers in Phoenix.
