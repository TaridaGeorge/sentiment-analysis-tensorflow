We've had precious little money to eat out lately. The other night, we had all had a long day, didn't want to cook. I decided to get Grady's, as we had fallen in love with his sauce from Phx Public Market. We got pulled pork and brisket, and the food was fantastic. Grady retired from SCA--Scottsdale Culinary--and was a cooking teacher at high school level previously. His love of cooking comes through in his barbeque. The brisket was moist and tender, and the pulled pork had a nice smoke ring and fantastic smoked flavor without being overpowering. And they are very personable folks, too! Give 'em a go, you won't be disappointed. Even if you're a CBJ--Certified BBQ Judge!
