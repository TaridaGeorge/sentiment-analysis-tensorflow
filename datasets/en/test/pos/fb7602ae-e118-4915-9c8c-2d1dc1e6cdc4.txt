AMAZING steaks. Aged and cooked perfectly. It's not too often we can splurge on meals like this, but we were so glad we did. Our anniversary is coming up in April and we will be going to Fleming's for sure. My husband loves their bleu cheese steak and the filet is fantastic. It's so hard to decide on side dishes, but you can't go wrong with any of them. 

I was also very impressed with their service and the ambiance is perfect for a romantic meal.
