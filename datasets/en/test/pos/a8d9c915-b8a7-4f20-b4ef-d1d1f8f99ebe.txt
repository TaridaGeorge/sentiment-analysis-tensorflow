Clinton and Stacy say '3 words - Find A Tailor"  They'd be SO proud of me because I found Valentina.  I've had numerous alterations to pants (hem, waistband, rise, leg width), jackets and shirts (nip the waist or shoulders, add darts..), and even one dress that she took completely apart and put together in a shape that fits me.   She will either do the exact alteration you specify or - and this is the nice part - give suggestions as to how to make something fit better.  Her prices are fair, and turnaround is quick.  Shut UP!!
