Z Pizza has great lunch specials.  I love their slice, salad and a drink deal you can get for about $7.  Very convienent for a quick workday lunch.  

It's a hard decision whether to eat at Slices or Z Pizza.  I really like the food at both, but Z wins an extra star for always being well maintained (and cool) inside.
