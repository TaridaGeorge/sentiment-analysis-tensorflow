All I can say is yummm!  They make the best old fashioned donuts!  I am a sucker for a good donut and wouldn't bother with the corporate chains.... if you're going to eat a donut eat your donut here!  (or at rainbow donuts if you're up north)  The only thing that would make this place and rainbow better is if they had an espresso machine....   do yourself a favor and go get yourself a donut now!
