I hesitate to recommend this place because I would hate for it to become too busy ;)  But in all seriousness, this is a fantastic Urgent Care.  I've never had to wait long and the doctor and staff have taken plenty of time with me and my family.  And, no offense to all the hard working and excellent MAs and PAs out there, but I can't remember the last time I actually went to an Urgent Care and saw a doctor -- I think Dr. McCrae must live there, lol!  He is always there.  The staff is polite and caring as well.  Really, really pleased that this place has popped up near me.
