If your looking for a gym with many options & tons of classes this is this place. Not only is there things for the adults but your kids have things to do there as well and  have fun! The gym is very clean & the staff is very friendly.  The daycare also is very clean and all employees get an extensive background check. I've been to many gyms and paid a range of different dues but by far this has been worth every penny! As an added bonus they have a full service salon in there, so if you don't feel like blowdrying your own hair out, treat yourself to a proffesional one!
