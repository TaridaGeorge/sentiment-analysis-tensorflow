If you live in Central Phoenix and need to buy quality gas and also get your car repaired this is an excellent gas station. I recently took my Toyota Camry to get repaired here.  John the owner/manager was honest about what need to be done, had an excellent mechanic who did the work and charged a fair price.  I will now buy my gas here as well as get it serviced. In the large anonymous world of gas stations, auto repair shops, Caspian Chevron offers customer friendly and personalize service that delivers what they promise.  No more Toyota dealer (for servicing) or Costco gas for me....I have found I gas and auto repair station I can trust.
