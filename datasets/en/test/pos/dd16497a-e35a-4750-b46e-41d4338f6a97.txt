Excellent service. Excellent food. We sat out on the patio and we seated immediately on Friday at 7 pm. Our server was very attentive and gave suggestions for entrees and appetizers. The bread they give you was so delicious I ate a whole loaf myself. We also had calamari and i loved it. It was my birthday and they made me feel special by bringing my dessert. Tiramisu was delicious. We want to bring our friends here! Met the owner and he is a very nice guy.
