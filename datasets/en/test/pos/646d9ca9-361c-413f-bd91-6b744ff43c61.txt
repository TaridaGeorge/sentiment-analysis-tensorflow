Great course on the north side of town. They do a great job keeping the course maintained and are constantly putting money back into the course. 

If you need Lessons see GW. I have taken lessons from several people but no one has ever changed the way i think about the game like GW. By the time I finished my first set of 5 lessons I had cut a consistent 10 strokes off my game with no doubt. GW is one of a kind.
