Love love love this place!!!  From the decor to the delicious utilization of local food, this is a place that I highly recommend to everyone!  The Funghi pizza is heaven.  Goat cheese, mushrooms and truffle oil!? Yes!  We often come here for a full meal, but there have been more than a few times of coming just for the chocolate cake.  The owner comes into my job a lot and I asked him what was up with the chocolatey delight.  Apparently they spent three months working on the menu. Time well spent sir:)  We have tried a wide variety of their menu items and haven't been disappointed once.  Great wine at competitive prices, tasty house cocktails and a really fun use of space.  They even have a cute little garden outside.  Oh, and free valet!
