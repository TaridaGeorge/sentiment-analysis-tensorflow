Thank God for mustache combs.  My Boyfriends beard can be unruly at times, and sweets and beats had the remedy!   My Friend bought one for her fiance as  well(along with some pop rocks and gummy treats of course! How could we resist!) This shop has a great atmosphere, not to mention fun candy, records, books, records etc.  I wish I could peruse this establishment more often!
