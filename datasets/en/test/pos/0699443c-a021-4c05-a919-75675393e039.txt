This place is unreal.  I was in Phoenix for the weekend and had memories of hanging out with my friend Scott who used to live here.  I got on yelp to find a breakfast place and Scott's popped up.  This is as old school as it gets outside of the Northeast.  The waittresses are awesome, the food is amazing and I really can't say anything that hasn't already been said.

I don't make it to Phoenix much, but anytime I'm in town I'll be visiting Scott's.
