Alright, I was up in the Phoenix area from Tucson for an overnight trip and I had some time to head to Scottsdale for a bite to eat.  Used yelp to find this joint and, wow, what a fantastic meal.  I went for the "fish candy" which was spectacular, but go for the half plate.  Plus, they have Anchor Steam in bottles!  I can never pass that up.
