All you Yelpers here in Metro Phoenix ought to be thankful for this gem.  I've had traditional Chinese food in chinatowns in San Francisco, New York, Philadelphia and elsewhere, and I can tell you that Asian Cafe Express is a real stand-out.  No, it's not Cantonese or Sichuan haute cuisine, but I'll take the authentic, traditional Chinese home cooking of this place any day.  Great food at absurdly low prices.  Everything I had was excellent.  In most traditional Chinese restaurants, low price = small portions and/or very poor quality food.  Not here.  What a great place.  I knew I was in for a treat when I walked in.  I was the only non-Asian patron.
