I love Dr. Bradley! I have been going to her for the past few years and could never think of changing. She is always cheerful ad happy and makes you feel comfortable in sometimes uncomfortable situations! She always provides you with additional information and printouts about the reason you came in to see her. She genuinely cares about her patients and it shows. My entire family goes to her and we all feel the same. We love Erin!
