Perfect ambiance and outdoor seating.  String quartet music during lunch (radio) and beautiful outdoor patio, shaded.  Food/service was excellent and resonably priced.  I was impressed with the multitude of chicken sandwiches available.  The location sits along side a park with artwork worth viewing.
