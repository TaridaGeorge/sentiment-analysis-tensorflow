Affectionately known by neighborhood entrepreneurs as Conference Room A, for its popularity as a place to come with the laptop for a social change of scenery from the dining room table.  Because it's right around the corner, I know I will always bump into someone I know.  I do relate to the comments of some of the other reviewers as I have witnessed some of that pretentiousness.  But when I come I mostly come to work and eat and thus block that out.  And hopefully diversify the audience a bit for the other patrons.

Foodwise, everything is great!  I especially love their Arnold Palmers on a hot afternoon.  For breakfast I'd have to pick the Venice Burrito.

Music can be a little bit loud but if the weather's nice just sit outside at the picnic tables and enjoy the ambience.
