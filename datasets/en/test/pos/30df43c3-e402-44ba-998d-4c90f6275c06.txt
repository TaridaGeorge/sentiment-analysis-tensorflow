As opposed to the previous review of this company, I had nothing but a positive experience of this business.  My inspector's name was Steve Bartolomei, and he put a considerable amount of time inspecting my hopefully future home.  After compiling his information and taking his photos, he condensed everything into an easily readable report that my wife and I could read at our leisure.  He even took the time to go over with me all of the areas in his report where he thought there was an area of concern.

His fee was quite reasonable, and he answered my many and varied questions about the property thoroughly.  Very professional and friendly service.

Many thanks to Steve and J. Dewey Property Inspection.  You guys are all right by my book.
