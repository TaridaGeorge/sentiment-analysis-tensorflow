I have been to this place probably a dozen times since my last review... I went tonight with a friend after taking her her the first time she has begun to crave it. Had the rad nad noodles (beef) and the garlic sauce (chicken) the chicken satay as a started and we followed with the sticky black rice and custard for desert. She had plum wine as well... Everything was excellent and we have lunch for tomorrow. This is my favorite place now.
I have taken probably 5 different friends here and everyone loves it including a self proclaimed thai food expert! YUM
