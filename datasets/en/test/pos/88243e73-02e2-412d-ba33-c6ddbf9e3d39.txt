Can I just say?

That if there is a hiker heaven, than this place is pretty close, red rock, river, mountains, non travelled trails with spots that will take your breath away if you can find them (all part of the challenge) easy to get to, spectacular vistas and what in effect just a sea of saguaros by a river  (running) bed, that will just astound and amaze you, grinding stones from the indigenous Indians and lots more await the adventurous.
