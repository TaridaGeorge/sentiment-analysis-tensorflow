This is the best store for single people or people who don't cook much!  Great breads (soy free) wonderful cheese selection as they carry my favorite, Supreme Brie.  It is small and the selection is slim but they have such a great selection of fresh items.  Of course the expiration date is not long, but who wants to eat a loaf of bread that lasts a month, really it should only last a few days.  I am not into the preservatives and junk in my food.  I really like their fresh salads!!!  The store is always clean and they do give back to the community.  Save your receipts for schools and the school gets $1 for every $20 is receipts!  Great place to go every few days for the fresh items:)
