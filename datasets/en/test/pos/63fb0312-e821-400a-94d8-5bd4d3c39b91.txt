I have been going to Yapha's for years now and they never disappoint. Each meal you order you're able to get soup and a salad from the soup and salad bar. It seemed strange at first putting hot peanut dressing on a cold salad but wow that dressing is so good I could drink it. I always dump a little in my soup as well it's so good. The service is always a little slow but I would wait any day for such kickass food. I always order the drunken noodles with beef thai hot it's so good. A must stop for any one that loves great thai food.
