I keep telling my friends about this joint. I have been there twice once on a Sunday and they're pretty busy. I def recommend trying them out during the week when its a little slower. Anyways, this is THE soul food spot in Phoenix. I had the chicken and waffles and my wife had the soul food platter with cod and collard greens and rice and beans.  I haven't tried their new spot in So. Scottsdale yet.

The kids had chicken tenders and grits and waffles. I had a arnold palmer as the tea was a little on the sweet side. The kids had jar-o-drank which translates to sweet red kool aid. 

I was in a food coma all day, but couldnt leave  without the red velvet cake to go.
