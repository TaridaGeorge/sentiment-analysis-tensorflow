What an amazing event! Fabulous food, wonderful service, cool atmosphere and terrific company set off a spectacular evening. 12 hours after it has finished and I am still full. 

Fogo De Chao offers remarkable service that is extremely attentive leaving customers wanting for nothing. One of the staff even took us in small groups to tour the kitchen and see how the various meats are cooked to perfection.

Gabi - thank you so much for organizing this event.
