This place is THE place to go for fresh meats in the East Valley. (the Pork Shop is good too, but a bit far away). 
The brats and sausages are made in house and they have a huge variety of flavors. I really enjoyed the Chicken, Bacon and Swiss. 
Besides fresh meats they carry dog treats, alcohol, cheese curds, and many other staples needed for a delicious meal. 
They guys behind the counter are so friendly and very helpful. 
Check it out! 

I'll be back very soon!
