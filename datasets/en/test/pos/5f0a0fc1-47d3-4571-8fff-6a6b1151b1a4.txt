I have only been to Covet once and that was because my hair guy-Joel Porter (formerly of Salon Jo-el right across the street) recently moved his salon into the Covet store.  The store seemed awesome and they have a great selection of men's shoes.  I highly recommend going to see Joel, Jamie or Cassie have your hair done though! And then you can check out the store!
