I like this place. Not a true (New York) Italian place (in my opinion) but very very close. Food is very tasty especially fried calamari app. I usually stick with fish or veal (not a big pasta person) but have sneaked some from my bf's plate at it was tasty as well as my dishes have always been. We are here fairly often.
