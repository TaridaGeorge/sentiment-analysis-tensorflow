Not sure why anyone would rate this place 1-3 stars, seems pretty harsh.  It may be slightly pricey, but it has a great atmosphere, fun, trendier, relaxed, and the food is A+.  My favorite is the Vigazz burger with the side salad/ranch.  It's great.  I've also had their pasta tortellini, it was amazing but I didn't see it on the menu that last time I was in; I think they have some seasonal dishes they switch up.
Great place for a group/younger crowd.
