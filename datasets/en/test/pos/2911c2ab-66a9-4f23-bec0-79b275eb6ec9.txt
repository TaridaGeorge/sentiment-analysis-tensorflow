I went in the middle of Dec '10. 

Excellent pizza, best I have had outside of NYC. Great deal for the 2 slices and drink. I also ordered the buffalo wings. They were cooked perfectly, but there was something missing (some of that buffalo pizazz), but definitely good.

Overall - excellent, highly recommend. It is a little ways for me, but when I want pizza I will suck it up and go back.

I am drooling just thinking about it now. I will be heading in the near future!
