I think Beaver Choice may be my favorite restaurant of all time. Here's why:

- The food is outstanding. Do not miss the seared gravlax or the coleslaw. Also, do not skip the items that require an extra wait (especially the fish bake). The wait is worth it. I've made it through most of the menu. I even tried the flying Jacob. I have absolutely loved every meal. 
- Great service. The type of place where you really feel like family.
- Ridiculously good value. The portions and quality for the price cannot be beat.
- Beaver Choice makes me want to talk about the love put into the food, and I'm not that type of person. But really, you can't deny that there is love in that food.
