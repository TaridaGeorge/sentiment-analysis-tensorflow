What can you say - Cracker Barrel serves consistent southern comfort food.  All I need to drive across country are gas stations and Cracker Barrel restaurants.  

The Goodyear location is often full during popular dining times and days (Nascar in town or not) .  6:30 Saturday morning is easy to get a table.  Wait until 8:00 in the morning and you will probably get on a half hour wait list.  They have plenty of outdoor rocking chairs to enjoy the usual awesome Arizona weather while you wait.  They aren't so popular to rock away the time in July though.  

I love their fried okra and turnip greens.  Not as good as my grandmother made but still worth my money.
