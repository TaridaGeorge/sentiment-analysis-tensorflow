As You Wish is a fun place to make a gift for yourself or anyone really.  Who wouldn't appreciate a picture frame decorated by you? Or perhaps a nice vase you painted?  

It only costs $7 per person, but the pottery you choose to paint/decorate is how they get you.  And they can be a bit pricey.  But if you stick to the smaller items, you'll walk away without spending much and get a fun item to take home in a few days.

This is also a good place to host children's birthday parties and I believe they have some package for that.

If you haven't been, go.  It's fun and it's different. Check it out.
