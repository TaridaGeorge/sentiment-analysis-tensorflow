So it's kind of in an odd location. It's easy to find but not the place I would expect to find such great food.  I stopped by here a while back to try something new as I was tired of Carl's Jr and Jack In The Box. I wasn't expecting much, just need a change.
I was very pleasantly surprised though!
The people were friendly, and the food was good and was prepared quickly. I had the steak bomb sandwich. Wow! This would turn a vegetarian into a carnivore! It was so good! the meat was perfectly seasoned and cooked, the bread was fresh and had just the perfect amount of chewiness. I might have to go there for lunch today...
