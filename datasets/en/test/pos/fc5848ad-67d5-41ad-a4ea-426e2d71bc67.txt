What can I say!!!! Awesome hip place this is.   The wifey and kids found this place on a spur of the moment getaway.   Man, this place is a winner!  Especially the price and service was great.   

The pool is heated to 82 degrees and they have a huge jacuzzi that fits like 30.  Pool closes at midnight and to my amazement were offering free otter pops, soda,  water, and candy bars til 8am.   Man, we work a lot and this place was a breath of fresh air.    Next time were in town or passing through, this place is a must.  Thanks Clarendon hotel, my family and I will remember this place for years.
