I have been to all the RA's in the Valley and this one has been the best by far!!! Went with a friend on Friday night for happy hour, had amazing sushi and drink specials and ended up staying way past happy hour was over because we had the BEST waiter ever!! Our Waiter Shad made our experience at RA so much fun and the service he provided has been some of the best I have experienced in the Valley!! If you go to RA, ask for Shad, you won't be disapointed!!!
