Solid pizza and my favorite in Phoenix by a landslide.

Last night went for a work dinner and showed a few newbie Patsy eaters what real pizza should taste like. 

We had two pies one pesto and one regular and both were simply amazing like always.  I recommend always adding sun dried tomatoes to a pie it really adds to the sauce.  

This location is great as well especially now with the holiday season they have lights up everywhere and it's just a nice experience.
