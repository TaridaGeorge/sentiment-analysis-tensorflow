If you like hot dogs and have never been to Dave's, turn off your computer, go get in your car and drive there. Now. The hot dogs are unbelievable. Whenever I think about it my mouth waters. Why does my mouth water? It's because my taste buds are crying tears of happiness at the prospect of tasting Dave's Dog House. Everything from the buns to the chili is top notch For the hot dog haters they have amazing sliders as well. The onion rings are good, but I'll take their fries every time. 

Dave's is a great place for some many reasons. Food, atmosphere, location, all great. Stop by and have a dog; you're gonna like the way it tastes, I guarantee it.
