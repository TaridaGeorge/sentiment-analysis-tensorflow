This place is gorgeous! We were here last night for a party and have to say that this club is incredible, the views were breathtaking and the staff is top notch. Everyone was incredibly helpful and friendly. Looking forward to playing a round on that beautiful course sometime. 

Also love that they prohibit people from being on their annoying cell phones. More places should adopt that rule. I'm a fan!
