My baby boy is going to flip when I bring him to this store.  I didn't know they had a Lego Store at the Chandler Fashion Center, so imagine my surprise when I turned the corner and there it was, building block heaven.  I ended up buying a couple more cars.  My little boy is crazy about building different cars and airplanes with the Legos.  Can't wait to bring him here.
