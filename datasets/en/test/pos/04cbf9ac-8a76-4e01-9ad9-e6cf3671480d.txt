The Gelato Spot = Creamy goodness, tons of flavors, and less guilt than Cold Stone or DQ.

GELATO
You can sample as much as you want top help you decide which one of the amazing flavors you should get- Blood Orange, Nutella, Kiwi Coconut, Fudge Carmel Brownie, Mint Chip, Amaretto- is your mouth watering yet?

AMBIANCE
It has coffee shop/Ice cream palor feel to it. They have regular tables and chair and also very comnfy chairs around a coffee table too. 

OTHER
They clean their equipment constantly so if you have a peanut allergy (like my daughter does) they will accomodate.
