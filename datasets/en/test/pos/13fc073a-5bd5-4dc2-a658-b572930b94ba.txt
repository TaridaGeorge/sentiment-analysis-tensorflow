This place is certainly geared toward kids.
I don't have kids.
I don't particularly like kids.
I really do like this park, though.

From the large retired train engines down to the scale models much of the park is free and the things that they do charge for aren't terribly expensive ($2-4 each.)  

If you have kids this place is a must.  If you don't have kids but you happen to be in the area do check it out.
