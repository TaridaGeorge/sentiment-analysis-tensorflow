Many critics claim that the best burgers in the Valley are at AZ 88.  It's amazing to think that so many people are wrong.  It's even more amazing to think that the restaurant with the best burgers in the Valley is in the same complex, and no more than 100 feet away.  But fortunately for me, many people make that mistake.  Orange Table is pretty small and regularly operates at capacity, so I am happy that so many people have been fed misinformation.

Even though I have rambled about Orange Table's burgers, they have great breakfast food too.  And now that they have brinner it's hard to come with a valid reason not to eat here.  So try Orange Table's green flannel hash, relish their awesome burgers, and when you're done with your meal and walking back to your car, laugh at the people eating burgers at AZ 88.
