Want to impress a group of ladies? All you need are Dolce Espresso cupcakes! When I opened the little pink boxes everyone in the room lit up.   Key lime goodness topped with a charming umbrella, German chocolate cake, hot chocolate topped with marshmallows, cream cheese icing swirled with strawberry pur√©e and fresh strawberries... all dusted with sparkles.  Impeccable presentation,  delectable flavor and tremendous value made these the best cupcakes the entire room of ladies ever had.  I have always enjoyed the friendly atmosphere, great coffee just how I like it (drip with chocolate and homemade whip cream) and now I am forever a Dolce Espresso cupcake fan!
