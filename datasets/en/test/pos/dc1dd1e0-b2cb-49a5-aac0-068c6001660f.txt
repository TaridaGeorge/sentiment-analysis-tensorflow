This is a great little shop that has a wide variety of Japanese goods at reasonable prices.  I tend to fall prey to their freezer section where I buy way too many sweets like daifuku and dango.  They have a great selection of condiments, snacks, candy, pantry goods (such as noodles, rice, curry mixes, furikake seasonings), and other groceries such as tofu and frozen seafood.  

In the back, you'll find non-grocery items such as video rentals, stationary supplies, books, dishware, etc.  The owners are quite friendly.  The last time I went, I watched as a first time customer was led around the store according to his shopping list, with the staff member answering all of his questions and explaining the different choices he had.  Awesome customer service!
