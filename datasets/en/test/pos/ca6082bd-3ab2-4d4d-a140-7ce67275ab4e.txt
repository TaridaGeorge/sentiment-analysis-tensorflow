Wonderful schnitzels and their brats are the wurst (get it?)!  Small place that makes you feel at home on the very first visit.  They feature a different special each weekend, and I have tried several.  My favorite is between the Rahmschnitzel (covered in a yummy cream sauce) and the Zegeunerschnitzel (covered in a spicy pepper sauce).  The food and the atmosphere bring back fond memories of great meals in Germany.
