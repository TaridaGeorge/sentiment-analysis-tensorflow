BEST cell phone transaction experience I've ever had!

Julian, Sales Associate was helpful, friendly, and very professional.

Decent rates: I'll be saving money from switching from T-Miserable and now have the White HOT iPhone!!  I'm in love.

All around just a great trip to the AT&T store.  Friendly staff, huge selection of merchandise, and most importantly, they had the white 4G iPhone in stock.  And a neon pink and aqua blue phone case. Long live the 80's!
