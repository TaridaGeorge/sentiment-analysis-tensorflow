I have shopped at Trader Joe's since 1980 when they used to have a butcher section! I love the quality of their food and their reasonable prices. I've only recently got into reviewing so that's why this has taken so long to write about. I buy the pre-made salads for my meals when I just want to eat something tasty without preparing. The great thing about TJ's is that they come up with interesting food and snack varieties. My latest favorite is the Allsorts-a-Licorice. If you love black licorice...this one has assorted kinds..some as wheels and some wrapped in what tastes like cake frosting...yum!!
