The Fireside Grill consistently has good food and great service with a wonderful outdoor patio that overlooks Fountain Park.  We really enjoy sitting out on the patio with friends and watching the town's signature fountain, which at it's full height is 560 feet.  What a sight!  The menu is extensive so whether you are a meat eater or a vegetarian like myself, there is something for everyone.  There is also a full bar!  They have a great happy hour and live music on some nights.  I would highly recommend the Fireside Grill.
