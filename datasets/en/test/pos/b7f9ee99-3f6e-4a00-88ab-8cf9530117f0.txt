I'm a native St. Louisian so I'm going to rate this place 110%.

Feeling a little homesick, a sorority sister of mine (also a transplant to AZ from MO) took me here to watch game 6 Cards v. Giants. We dined on toasted ravilois, povel cheese pizza (STL style, of course) and gooey butter cake. 

It was totally magical. Not only did the place look, feel and even smell like St. Louis but they had the Cards game playing with MO sports memrobilia everywhere. It was outstanding.

I WILL BE BACK.
