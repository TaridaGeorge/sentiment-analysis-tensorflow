I adore this frozen yogurt chain.  Luckily, my dad also loves frozen yogurt, and always used to take me for it when I was little.  He was more than happy to treat me to some peanut butter yogurt when I was in town visiting them recently.  There's a branch near my in-laws, as well, so if they ever get around to opening near me, I might never ever be able to travel again.
