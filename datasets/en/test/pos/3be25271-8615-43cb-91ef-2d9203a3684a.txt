Took family in from out of town.  We all love Thai - I can't believe I have not been before!  It is easily the best Thai on this side of town and probably can go toe to toe with whatever else is out there.  The Tom Yung soup was awesome - great balance of flavors.  The red curry is addictive.  We were there for their first anniversary and all received complimentary dessert to boot!  yum!!
