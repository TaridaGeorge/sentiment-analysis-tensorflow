Posh to anyone who rates this place anywhere below 5-stars. Mrs. White is a sweetheart. The passion of everyone in the kitchen comes through in all their dishes. I have had just about everything on the menu, at least once, and find that it is still worth the drive, no matter how far out of the way I am to indulge in some of that delicious home cooking. Peach cobbler is an amazing aperitif when there's room or if any is left. However, it does not travel by plane well as we very messily found out one afternoon.
