I love this bar. There is always happy hour pricing... $3 domestics and $3.75 imports and $3.75 for a vodka gingerale. Its actual gingerale too, not sprite and coke mixed together. Its not like going to old town and dealing with snobs, but it is close to old town. The people are great. You get 11 songs on the jukebox for $2 (where else can you find that?) and a pool table and a golden tee machine. Its cash only but they have an atm. Its been around for 42 years and the bar staff is awesome, especially sharon. Sharon makes the best drinks and shots in town!
