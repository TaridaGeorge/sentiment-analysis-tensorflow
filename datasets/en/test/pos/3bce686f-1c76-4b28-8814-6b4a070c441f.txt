I also called Mike to get some concealed wiring done for a TV that I already had mounted.  I was interested in adding a home theater hookup to improve sound and hide the HDMI cable that connected everything.

Mike was professional, asked lots of questions to understand what I wanted to do, and had good flexibility in scheduling so I could get everything done in the timeframe I wanted.

As the previoius review notes, he is great at taking his time to ensure everything gets done correctly, cleans everything up, and tests everything to make sure it works properly.  He also is very knowledgeable about technology and can help you get everything set up as well if you want that kind of support.

Thanks for the help mike!
