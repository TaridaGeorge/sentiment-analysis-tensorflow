I can't imagine traveling back to Scottsdale and NOT staying at this Hotel. It is stylish, comfortable, immaculately clean and FUN.  I booked this hotel on a 'blind' recommendation and my expectations were more than met.  If you have the option to splurge and you love the pool scene, get a Cabana King right on the first floor with a pool view.  We got great sun all day whether we sat on our private patio or hit the pool, so it was great for a sun-deprived Chicagoan.  Even thought I don't tend to even like hanging out a a pool (not a fan of Vegas), I found this place relaxing, but lively enough to provide good people watching.  If we go back for Spring Training next year, we might try for one of the tower suites to get a different view but would be happy with many room choices.
