Love Elie's Deli!  It's not a fancy place, but neither is the tood or prices.  Elie is a real person and when you eat there, you feel like you're at his home.  We're usually there in the evenings, it's quiet and we enjoy a leisurely meal with some really great healthy food.  Favorite is the grilled chicken pita wtih hummus.  Don't know how he seasons the chicken but it is to perfection with a slight hint of garlic.  Sometimes I get it with rice - yum!  Everything is really fresh and cooked to order.  Portions are generous - you won't go away hungry.  Just writing this makes me want to go back NOW!
