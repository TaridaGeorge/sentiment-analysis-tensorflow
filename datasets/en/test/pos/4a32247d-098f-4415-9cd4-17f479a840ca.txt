I was pleasantly surprised by not only the hip location/interior of this place, but also the superb taste of the frozen yogurt. They had about 10 flavors, not as many as some of the other franchise yogurt shops, but they didn't need any more because the flavors were SOOO good! I got the caramel and cookies and cream. Toppings are A+ as well! Fresh and a wide selection. Comfy seating both indoors and out. And, being owned by Hula's and located between Hula's and Maizie's, I know I will be back here quite often.

P.S. If you use the bathroom, you have to walk outside to get to it and they will give you a giant wooden mushroom attached to the key. It's quite entertaining!
