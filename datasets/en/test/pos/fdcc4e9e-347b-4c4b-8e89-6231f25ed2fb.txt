Believe me.......
INSURANCE IS NOT ABOUT THE CHEAPEST RATE!!

Know what your buying. Ian and Shelly will walk you through the process and explain all the differences in coverages and show you the BEST rate for what you need. 

My daughter had cheap rate coverage and when she was in an accident she found that many items she thought were covered were not! You get what you pay for and I am very pleased to have Ian & Shelly at Allstate as my reps.
