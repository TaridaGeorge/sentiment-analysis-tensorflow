Great food!!!  We couldn't make up our mind so we ordered way more food then we could eat, but every bit of it was good.  Jon the owner is very informative an tries to make the atmosphere that of a large family gathering....IMO....some people my not care for that, but we loved it an ended up sharing our wine with the table next to us.  We can't wait to go back!  Thanks for a great dinner!
