OMG! Get the kafta pizza. I was like WTF, never heard of that one before, but wow...what a slick invention. SO freaking good. Super fast service, we were in a rush to get to the airport, we were in and out in 30min, our server was a hottie, friendly and efficient too. Their pita bread is amazing, we had the babaghanoush and it was DEE-LISH. I'm an Arab too, so I've got high standards when it comes to our food. This place ROCKS!
