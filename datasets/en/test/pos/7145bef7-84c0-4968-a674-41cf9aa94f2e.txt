Lets just say a little overstimulating - but a good thing!  I think I spent an hour the first in the store 

If you are into wines they have everything from Old World European wines to domestics; from national distributors to regional vineyards; from your average Merlot to unique Icewine and Plum Wine. Even offer wine tasting in store while shopping.

For those who Brew -  national breweries to local/regional/international breweries; Four Peaks, Alaskan, IC,  Santa Fe, etc. 

And the liquors less just say they have every variation/gradation of the whiskeys, bourbons, vodkas, tequilas and all the ones you would never think of . . . Georgia Moon??

Endless possiblities of things to try and cocktails to make.

Other:
No membership/club program to join.
Very friendly staff
Have miscellaneous - snacks, pop

What else can I say . . . . PARTY ON!
