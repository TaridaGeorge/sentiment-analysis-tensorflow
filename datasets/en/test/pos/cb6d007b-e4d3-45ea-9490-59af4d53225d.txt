I love this place! Not only is it different from the Starbucks of the world because it is local, great decor, local art on the walls (I could keep going), but it is really, REALLY good! I hate only having soy milk as a dairy alternative other coffee shops. Echo has many more - almond milk is my favorite. Pastries are delicious too! Haven't had any salads or sandwiches yet, but that is my next on my list.
