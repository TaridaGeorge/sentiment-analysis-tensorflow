The atmosphere and the food were exactly what I was seeking. Very comfortable and well priced. They were more that happy to make any changes I desired when I wanted to substitute sides. I can't wait to go back.  I had one of their well-designed burgers - it didn't need a drop of ketchup. The posole soup was also very much on spot. I subbed in the arugula and beet salad and it was a perfect side to that big burger. 

The hardest part may be not trying some of the other interesting restaurants in this part of Phoenix.
