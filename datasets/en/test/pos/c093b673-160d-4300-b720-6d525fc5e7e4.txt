I heard about this place from one of my co-workers. I told him I wanted to try authentic Mexican food for the 1st time since moving down South and he told me this place is it.

From first glance, it looks like a hole in the wall with a drive-thru window. They got a decent size menu and it took me some time to order. I eventually decided to go with the California Burrito. Best decision I ever made on food...The thing was HUGE...Stacked with Carne Asada and French Fries...I could only finish half of it and had the rest the next day.

Best Burrito you'll ever try. No more going to Chipotle or any of those types of "mexican" food.

I'll definitely be coming back
