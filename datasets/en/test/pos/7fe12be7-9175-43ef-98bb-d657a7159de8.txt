This is by far the best churasscaria I have ever tried. Brazilian bbq at its best! Everything is perfectly seasoned, but my personal favorite is the top sirloin. 

The sides that come with the meal are great too.. there is cheese bread, fried plantains, and these two other things..... very delicious.

The salad bar has plenty to choose from, try a little bit of everything. Great selection. The service is ok/good, but occasionally we had to flag our waiter down. Reservations are highly recommended because this place gets packed. 

The night my boyfriend and I went, we saw two players from the Golden State Warriors, and we saw Muhammed Ali. Apparently famous people come in all the time.
