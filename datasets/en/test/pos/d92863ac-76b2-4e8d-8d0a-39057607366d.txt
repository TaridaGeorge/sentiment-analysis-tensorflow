Never in a million years did I think Irish food would be tasty. 

I hate boiled meat and veggies, I hate soggy fish and chips. This place actually has really great food. Everything was perfect. The beer was great. I normally hate corned beef and cabbage but their version is served with a very tasty gravy and has a ton of flavor. 

There is also always something going on there. Live music, poker nights, trivia, plus a decent amount of TV's to watch a game.
