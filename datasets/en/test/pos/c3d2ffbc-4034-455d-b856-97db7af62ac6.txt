You know, after decades of different restaurant experiences from pasta just outside the Vatican, Antipasti in Bologna, fish and chips in a London pub, Haggis in Edinburgh........pierogies and kielbasa in Chicago's Polish 'hood, Seattle's Pike's Place, Gilroy Garlic Festival, Hatch Chile Fest....I could go on and on...
Sooooo...Roaring Fork-if I had to pick a quintessential Arizona restaurant, this would be it.  It's cowboy/Southwest but just superbly prepared and served.  The staff is more than accomodating, and everyone in our party just had the best experience.
I'm this .[read index finger and thumb about a quarter inch apart]. far from duplicating their green chile pork MWWWWWWWWAHAHAHA!!  :)  Seriously, this dish is killer and a must try!!
T out!
