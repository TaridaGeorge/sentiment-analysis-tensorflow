Never been dissappointed here, awesome food and great service with even better prices! Whenever I talk to someone that hasn't been here, I immediately recommend it. There is usually a wait for dinner but it is well worth it, I haven't tried the pizza yet but everything else has been really good. A nice place to take a date or go with friends.
