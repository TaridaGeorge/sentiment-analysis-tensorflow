we normally visit the tempe location just down from our house. but being in this neck of the woods today, we stopped in for our veggie fix. the place is smaller than the tempe location and doesn't appear to have all the menu options, but the selection is still awesome. tonight, i had the chili fries and the po-boy with steak and a side of tahini coleslaw. all dishes involved are sitting happily in my belly even as i write this. 

who says vegetarians only eat side dishes of lettuce? this restaurant is just so darn great!
entrees around 8-9 bucks....and they even have tons of dairy free desserts!
