I visit Phoenix pretty regularly to see family.  I always make a point to bring someone new to see Taliesin West.  I find that new comers to Taliesin West are always amazed at how it was made and the beauty of the architecture, it never gets old.  The guides always give interesting tours and each one has new nuggets of information that I scoop up and file away for trivia later down the road.  ;)  
The only downside to the tour, I don't think it's well suited to young children.  Most tours are approximately 90 minutes long and it's just a tour guide leading you around the compound, which doesn't hold the interest of children for very long at all.  The last time I went we had to fish a child out of the pool, it was entertaining but not part of the tour!
