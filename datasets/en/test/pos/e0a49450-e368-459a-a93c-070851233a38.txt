I go here every year with my Wife.  It makes for a beautiful night of holding hands in the crisp air while meandering down candlelit paths between the live musical performances.  I love the Native American flute/story-teller.  My wife love the "Dickens" carolers.

Get your tickets early as the popular nights (Fridays and Saturdays) sell out quickly.  I also recommend to get there early.  You'l' be surprised how quickly the night goes.

Dress warm!

It really gets us in the Christmas spirit.
