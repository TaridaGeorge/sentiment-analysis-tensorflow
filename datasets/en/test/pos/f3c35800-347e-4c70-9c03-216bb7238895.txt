Best authentic chinese food you are going to find in AZ. I am chinese so I would know first hand what good chinese food consists of. Their roast duck and bbq pork rivals even the best sam woo bbq dishes from LA.
Hope Kee's chefs are actually from Hong Kong so they know the cuisine like the back of their hands. Try their BBQ or garlic chicken and prepare your taste buds for a crazy ride!
