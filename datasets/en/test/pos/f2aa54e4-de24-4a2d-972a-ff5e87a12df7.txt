Hands down the best department store.

They are the epitome of true customer service. I always have a pleasant experience whenever I shop there, even if I don't purchase anything.

Alan, who helps me out in my section (The Rail), is just fantastic. Knows exactly what I likes and will call me whenever new stuff comes in.

And their sales are ALWAYS fabulous.
