This is one of my absolute favorite bars in Old Town. It is casual with really good food but plays loud top 40 music with great drinks. What more could you ask for?

Service is great and the bathrooms are clean. The restaurant has outdoor seating which is great for people watching and right in the heart of Old Town nightlife.

You're within walking distance to The Mint, Dollhouse, Smashboxx, and the Pussycat Lounge. 

If I didn't live a $40 cab ride away (one-way) I'd come here way more often. 

Lots of huge flat panel tvs and plenty of seating. It gets packed on weekends but the place is pretty big so it never feels overwhelmingly crowded. 

This is not a good place to dance. There is actually no dance floor. But maybe that won't stop you or I after a few drinks...
