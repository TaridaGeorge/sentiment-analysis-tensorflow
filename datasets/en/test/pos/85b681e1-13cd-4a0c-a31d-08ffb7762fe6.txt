I feel very lucky to have found Steve Shinn to handle the small but important rebuild in my living room after a truck crashed into my house. He and his crew were sensitive  to the style and age of the house. His people made a beautiful steel casement window with double pane windows, and a bookcase/cabinet that truly matches the style of the home. The brickwork blends seamlessly into the original structure. I also appreciate Steves efforts and successes in working with my homeowners insurance.  Steve contacted them personally when they tried to micro-manage the cost of the rebuild. Had it not been for Steve, I may have ended up with a cheap HomeDepot window and particle board book case for my historic home.
