At first I was really taken aback by the poor phone etiquette but as I have adjusted I realize that a nice chuck of Phoenix has poorer customer service than I am used to. That's just the way it is. So I let it go.

The pizza is the best and it's a pity they don't deliver. The crust is amazing. So amazing I actually eat it and the sauce has the clearest taste. Outstanding really. This little spot should be voted best over Mamma Mia but I don't know why it hasn't.

I've never ate in but the pizza is always ready on time and I enjoy the hostess/waitress a lot in person. She's a firecracker.
