Excellent cafe - what more can you want, sick mountain OR road bikes to look at, and biking (and baking!) magazines to browse peruse while you drink your coffee!

The staff are extremely knowledgeable about bikes -- both those that they sell in the shop and those that they don't, these folks are serious enthusiasts, not just someone who landed a job at a bike shop to get by.

The espresso I got was a great shot pulled by a not only really friendly but really attractive barista - does it get any better??  And they take their pastries in a very serious way, I'd recommend grabbing a muffin!

Love this place; best cafe I've been to in the greater Phoenix area no questions asked.

PS - they  have free wireless too.
