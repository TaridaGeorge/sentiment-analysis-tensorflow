Not a huge menu but every single thing is delish, not a very nice place inside to sit down so I usually drive thru, which takes no more then a few minutes to get your food. My favorites: large Greek salad which has tons of feta cheese and a delish creamy Greek dressing - seriously best feta I've ever had, their falafel pita which is delish and a little crunchy, and the taziki appetizer - has a hint of dill, so good and their pitas are so fresh and delish.  Oh and feeling lazy? There's a drive-thru and it is surpisingly fast.
