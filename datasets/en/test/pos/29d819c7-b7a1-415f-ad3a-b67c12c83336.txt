I love Bertha's. I admit, when I first came to Bertha's, I wasn't sure it was 5-star worthy. Mainly because my personality causes me to be skeptical of what everybody says is so awesome, however, I went again and found that I started craving the food there. Now I am a regular and you can usually find me there on Saturday morning enjoying my delicious breakfast wrap (which is one of my favorite by far). 

There are lots of delicious choices - The Thai Chicken Wrap, Salami Pesto Goat Cheese, and the Roast Turkey are my most frequents. All of the bakery items are delicious. I love the cookie that always comes with the lunch sandwiches! So good!

The staff is always wonderful and very friendly. The whole experience is always great.
