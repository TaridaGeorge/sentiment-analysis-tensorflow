This is THE best place for late night dessert in Phoenix. $7 desserts with one featured every night for $5. Desserts are plated so each one comes with little extras. They are open till 11pm seven nights a week. Couple that with the view and it is a great time. The variety of the menu items is also great: bread pudding, chocolate cake, tiramisu, pineapple upside down cake and creme brulee. I want and will try them all!!! 
Service is a little slow, but when you are up there, who cares. More time to look at the changing view.
