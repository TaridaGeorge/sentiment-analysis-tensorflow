Kindred Spirits has closed their doors. It is a sad thing that we on the west side of Phoenix cannot support such a friendly and community oriented business, AND one that gave you the option to drop by for a quick coffee or for a more complete dining experience. The live music on the weekends was also something a bit rare for our side of town, and will be missed. Richard and Debra did a marvelous job updating the space, and making it a warm and welcoming place. I am sorry that Youngtown has lost this business.
