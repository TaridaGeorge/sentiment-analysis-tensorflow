This is the cutest pet store that carries high-quality, healthy cat and dog food (the type of non-processed food you can't find at a traditional chain store) and a variety of wonderful cat and dog supplies ranging from beds, pet shampoos, treats, leashes, collars, clothing, dishes, etc.  I've met both owners and not only are they knowledgeable, but they are the nicest people and truly have a love for animals.  They do animal adoptions from their store and often have their own dogs (Oliver and Annie) in the store to greet customers.  The price of the food is comparable to Science Diet and I've noticed a huge difference since switching my pets.  I definitely recommend stopping by and I guarantee you'll fall in love too!
