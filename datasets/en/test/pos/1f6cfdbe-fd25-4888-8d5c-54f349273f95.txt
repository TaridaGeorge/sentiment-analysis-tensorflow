My A/C unit stopped working on Thursday evening. Friday morning I called Angel Air and the owner, Jake Angel, came by within a couple of hours and within the timeframe he promised. He solved my issue within half an hour. He also showed me some things to watch for when using A/C companies, as some of the previous companies that had worked on my unit had sold me parts that I didn't need. 

I will definitely give him a call the next time my A/C goes down and have already recommended him to a few other friends. So if you find yourself A/C'less give Jake a call.
