LOVE the food here!  It's fresh, well priced, and unique!  My husband loved their green eggs and ham dish for breakfast.  The place is decorated nicely, and like was mentioned in other reviews, the service is excellent.  Just be sure to avoid rush hours, if possible, because the line can get long and the seating sparce.
