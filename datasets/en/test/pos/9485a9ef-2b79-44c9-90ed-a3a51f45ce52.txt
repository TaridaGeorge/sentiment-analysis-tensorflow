We stopped here for lunch.  The food was all freshly made.  We shared Jerk Tacos and a Cuban Sandwich.  The tacos were just spicy enough, with tender chicken and fresh veggies.  The pork on the Cuban sandwich was wonderfully sweet.  The drinks were top-notch also.  
We definitely plan to go back sometime during the week and sample some other offerings.
