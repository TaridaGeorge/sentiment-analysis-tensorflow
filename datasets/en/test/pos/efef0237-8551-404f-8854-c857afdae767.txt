I love Fate! LOVE it. I love Fate so much, sometimes I want to take it behind the school and get it pregnant!

Their green tea milk is AMAZING. I go cuckoo for it. For reals! Their little mushrooms are so good too. Oh my god, they are like little mini mushrooms. If keebler elf's, harvested mushrooms, these would be it! So good! If it's your first time, trust me: get the crab puffs, grab yourself a cool refreshing hulk-alishist Green Tea Milk, and go for the Hong Kong flat noodles. So good! 

And what about those little wafer cookies they give you at the end? They are like air! But better! (...they have calories...maybe they are not like air...but in a perfect world? Like Air!)
