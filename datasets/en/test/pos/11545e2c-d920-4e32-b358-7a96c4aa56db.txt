Hands down the best Filipino restaurant in Phoenix, probably in Arizona. The staff went above & beyond catering to my mom and aunt (who's natives of Sebu) ensuring they feel right at home. Food was authentic and the atmosphere is inviting. Tess is the greatest Filipino pastry chef (even though she didn't have any Pandesol) ! Live music with singing and dancing ensures you'll definitely come back.
