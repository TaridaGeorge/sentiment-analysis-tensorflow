Absolutely adorable!

This place made our 5 (yep you heard it here...5) hour wait much more enjoyable.  I think it we had to sit in the same building as the pizzas were being made and had to smell the delicious aroma of others pizzas for 5 hours, I may have gone nuts.  Bar Bianco was relaxed and had everything anyone could ask for while waiting for your meal.  We loved the Arizona wine and enjoyed a tasty plate of cheese and meat while lounging in the cozy chairs in the corner.  

Not only is this bar a great 'waiting room' before Pizzeria Bianco, but I would consider coming here just to relax and have a drink.

Cheers!
