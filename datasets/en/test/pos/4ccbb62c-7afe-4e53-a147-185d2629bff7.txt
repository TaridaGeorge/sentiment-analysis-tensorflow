Love me some Y action!  The downtown Y has everything you could ever possibly want in a gym: tons of cardio machines, a separate weight room, a pool, the "trendy" fitness equipment (like TRX and heavy ropes), personal trainers, lots of classes, cold/hot filtered water, even a cafe.  They could use a couple more stair-masters though.  ;)

Bonus:  The staff here are super cute. Especially Vince. ;)
