Inside the Bungalow is one of the many Downtown Mesa gems! I found this coffee shop Yelp and boy was I happy when I discovered Inside The Bungalow! Upon arrival I was greeted by an amazing house where the coffee shop is located. You feel as if you have stepped into some sort of story book fantasy house. The outside is covered with brick pavers, waterfalls and tons of greenery. The inside is decorated beautifully with comfy couches, wooden floors and tons of room to sit down and read a good book or just catch up. This coffee shop is unique and down right cute. You will be blow away by the amazing staff and delicious coffee/ baked goods. If you ever get the chance check this place out!
