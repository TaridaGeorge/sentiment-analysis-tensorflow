I'm addicted, my favorite restaurant in Tempe!  Craving the chopped salad and a white sangria sometimes keeps me up at night.  I also find myself paying for others to ensure they'll go with me again :)  

The ambiance is fantastic, and wait staff is attentive and friendly. 

Also try the bruschetta | options: get the pork if you like sweet and spicy, get the traditional mozzerella, basil & tomoto, the chicken - - heck, try them all!

Oh wait! I almost forgot, the Tiramisu -  is def something to write home about!
