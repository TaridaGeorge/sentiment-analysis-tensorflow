Considering the price and city, this hotel totally deserves 5 stars for it's interesting styling and great design choices. The exterior of the hotel rooms has a retro feeling, while the interiors are furnished with modern furniture and decorations. The extra large tub (cornered by 2 frosted glass walls) even has a mood light shining down on it. You probably won't find another hotel this chic in all of Arizona.

If I ever come back to the Phoenix area again, I will be sure to book at this hotel again. It gets my highest recommendation.

Price Tip: Smartphone users should use the HotelTonight App, which will run last minute deals for this hotel.
