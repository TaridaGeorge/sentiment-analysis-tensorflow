I've been to Brio a few times now.  The first time, I loved it, it was so wonderful and fulfilling.  I enjoyed every morsel I tasted.  The service was impeccable and the portions were well worth all that was spent on them. 

I then took a couple of friends their for Mother's Day and a thank you, they were quite impressed as well.  The food was melting in our mouths, no complaints came from us. They were very accommodating!  I love it would recommend it for a casual afternoon on the patio, or even a romantic evening with that special someone!  A definite MUST if you're in the area!  

The aroma's coming from the kitchen definitely get your mouth watering for the delectable menu!  Bon Appetite!
