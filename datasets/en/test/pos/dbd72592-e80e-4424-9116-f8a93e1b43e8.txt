This is as good as it gets when it comes to Mongolian BBQ.  No cheap meat rolled up and frozen - just a wide assortment of quality meats, vegetables, seasonings, and sauces.  YC's doesn't hold a candle to it.  This is one of only two places I go back to every single time I'm in the Phoenix metro.  I can't wait until a Genghis Grill opens in Orange County.
