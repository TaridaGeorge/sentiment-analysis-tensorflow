Probably the best sushi in town. Fresh fish - always ! (not easy in AZ)
We always enjoy the strong drinks . Not much changes in the menu and the specials repeat, so I would like to see more creativity but overall I love this place! 
The bar upstairs should be open for people who eat at the restaurant. You should not sand in line or pay the bouncer to get in after you spent $200 at the restaurant... 
I would definitely recommend trying this place! I think they have great happy hours and summer specials right now. Worth a try !
