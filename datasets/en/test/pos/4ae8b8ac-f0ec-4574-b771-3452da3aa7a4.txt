My wife and I live in Prescott and were down for the weekend. We decided to go to the Chandler Mall and found this great frozen yogurt place right there in the mall. 
It is really good stuff. If you are in for a great treat that is healthy and refreshing, you will want to hit this place. It is located near the food court as you are walking into the mall. You can't miss it. 
The flavors are awesome and lots of variety to choose from and toppings galore!
Ocean Blue is smooth and creamy and I love the self serve design.
The staff there are friendly and helpful too! You will love it if you are looking for the healthy alternative for a ice cream styled treat!!
