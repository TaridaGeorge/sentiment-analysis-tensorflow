I generally try to eat vegetarian but I make an exception for short leash. (They do have meatless dogs, but truthfully I've never even tried one). I try and tell people how great they are, but until you eat one, it's difficult to explain the magnitude of greatness. I like these better than Pink's, even better than Ted's (gasp). My old standyby is the Aiko with chipotle cream cheese. They give you a dum-dum lollipop with each dog, which I save in a bag to hand out at halloween. It's very likely that I won't have to buy any other halloween candy with how much I love this place.
