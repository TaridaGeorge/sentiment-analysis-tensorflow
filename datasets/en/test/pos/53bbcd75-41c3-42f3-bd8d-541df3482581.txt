We went to chic nails for three pedicures for my daughters b-day.  We were all so happy with the treatment they gave us.  The salon was spotless,  with nice music and bottled water. The pedicure itself was excellent. I am allergic to latex and the man who did my feet was awesome and no latex!!!  The massage was  great and long. We were very happy with Chic nails.
