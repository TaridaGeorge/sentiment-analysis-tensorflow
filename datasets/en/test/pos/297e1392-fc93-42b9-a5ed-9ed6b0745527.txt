So happy that That's a Wrap moved north and closer to me, thanks That's a Wrap! Expanding there hours was genius, we need more spots like this in CenPho for lunch AND dinner. 

Digging the new location and small patio space, the employees seem even more cheerful and friendly then before (if that is even possible).

This is a great spot for a vegan bites, you can customize pretty much every wrap and SURPRISE - it still tastes good! 

The Ken and Barbie-que with tofu is awesome. Senorita-no-meata sans cheese is great as well, I've never had a bad meal here - EVER. You can sub grilled tofu on any wrap, bowl or salad. Nothing much else to say besides don't change a thing!
