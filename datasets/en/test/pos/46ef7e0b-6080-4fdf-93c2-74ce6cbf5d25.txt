blue sky java is a cool spot where coffee drinkers can find refuge and a free doughnut with the purchase of a coffee.  the girls that work at blue sky are very chill, i will come here whenever i'm in goodyear. coffee is a nice morning midday blend that is mellow and not too acidic.  my dmv zen spot. thanks blue sky java
