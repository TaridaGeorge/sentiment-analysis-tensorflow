This place was really great!! We came here for late dinner Friday and we were seated right away. The ambiance is really chic and trendy- a little dark...as the new/hot places always are....but everything was super comfortable and nice. 
We started with the lamb meatballs on a bed of lentils and other beans. Seriously, I have never had lentils made this good anywhere. I still have mouth-watering thoughts of it.
We had 3 pizzas- the classic pepperoni (yuuuum), the potato-leek (amazing!!!) and the fungi (I don't eat mushrooms, but my friends thought this was great)
Can't wait to visit Arizona again to come here again....especially for those lentils!
