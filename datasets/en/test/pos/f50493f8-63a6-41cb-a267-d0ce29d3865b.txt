I've had my exam here on three occasions; twice were with Dr Kessler and most recently once with Dr Carlson. Both doctors were very thorough and sought to it that my eyecare needs were met. I thought the staff was friendly and helpful.

I should mention that I've had bad experiences with Eye Masters and Lens Crafters when it came to what my expenses were versus what my insurance covered. I always felt the staff at those locations purposefully overcharge me. That was not my experience at Eyecare Plus.

I had an overall great experience at Eyecare Plus. I highly recommend them and have no complaints at all.
