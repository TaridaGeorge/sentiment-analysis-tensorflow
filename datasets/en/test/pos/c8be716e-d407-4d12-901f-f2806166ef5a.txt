Great experience. Just had an office visit for a scratched eyeball. Everyone was friendly, I got in quickly, good explanation if injury after thorough examination, effective treatment plan with quick resolution and thorough follow up exam. Who could ask for anything more? I can't speak to cost as I haven't received the bill yet.
