Two weeks ago I had major surgery and received the best care from my doctor Dr. Bujak and the 3rd floor team Ashley, Carolyn, Elva and others. I had never been admitted in the hospital before in my life (42yrs) and was very afraid. Even more afraid because of the bad talk about West Valley. Today I can say that you can't always go by what you hear. The staff was professional, kind, caring, helpful, concerned, gentle, sweet and knew how to take care of me. I actually didn't want to leave when it was time because I was treated so well. Thank you again 3rd floor team! Tanya~
