Had my mind blown with some amazing service at this location tonight. 

Best stock for in demand products in the Valley, totally pro service, great selection of products for a Sun Belt subrub and a really awesome location with an entrance from the surface parking so one can wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am their way to getting some shopping done without dealing with mall crowds. 

Even during peak hours and sales this place is well run. Patient staff that assists with returns/exchanges with a smile, and they're always able to decant samples of fragrance or cosmetic products in a timely manner. I don't think that I've had a bad experience at this location, maybe a few neutral visits, and the reliability of this location makes it my go-to.
