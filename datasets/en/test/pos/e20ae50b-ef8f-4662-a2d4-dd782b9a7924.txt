Way to go Cards!!! My party consisted of 25 screaming Cardinal fans.( I had made reservations 3 days prior) So, when we walked in our table was ready
and our waitress was standing there to take our drink order! Every aspect of our experience was spot on!!! The Nacho's were Da Bomb! We never had to wait for anything! Here is the one downfall... there are T.V.s in the Men's  room but not the woman's... what the hell.... I jokingly complained and the management said for you it will be rectified!  Gallagher's you complete me!! 
We will be back! And when College football starts again we will be turning this into a "buckeyes" bar!
