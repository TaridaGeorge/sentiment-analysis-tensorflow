Few things make me happier than wine and cheese -- so naturally, I enjoyed the Cheuvront! I wasn't in the mood to make any decisions myself (it was Friday, after all) so I let one of the owners surprise me with his favorite red wine and a cheese plate. The shiraz he picked was delish, and the cheese plate, especially the brie, was equally yummy. I'd suggest you go for happy hour, sit on one of the comfy couches, ask your server or an owner for their recommendations, and try a bunch of stuff!
