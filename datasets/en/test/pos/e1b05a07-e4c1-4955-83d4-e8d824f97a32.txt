I can only vouch for the chicken salad, as it's the only thing I've ever tried in the 20 years I've been coming here. It's THAT good. I always think about trying something else, but why mess with perfection?

Walking inside gives you the sense that you've stepped into a time machine and arrived in the late 70's. I, personally, find it to be awesome. Most of Scottsdale is lacking in historic flare. And yes, the late 70s is historic by Scottsdale standards. Besides, whatever money they're not spending on updating the decor is clearly going right into their magically delicious chicken salad.
