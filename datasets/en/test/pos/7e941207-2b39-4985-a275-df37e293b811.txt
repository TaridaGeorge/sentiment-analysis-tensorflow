I LOVE Four Peaks!!  I went there with some friends a little hesitant only because it is known for it's beer but I am NO beer fan!!!  We went on a Friday around 8p, It was crowded but we had no problems finding seating at the bar.  I told the bartender I didn't like beer but I was willing to have one and surprise me.  And he did!!! It was delicious!  He served me Hefeweizen with a splash of their Raspberry beer, something he came up with for people that don't prefer beer. Not only was their beer great, their food was very appetizing as well!  I had the French Dip.....Amazing! Like a party in your mouth!
