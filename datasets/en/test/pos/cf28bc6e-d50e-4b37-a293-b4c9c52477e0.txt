We come to Cafe Paris every time we come to the Scottsdale area.  We love the breakfast, especially the French Toast a l'Orange.  It's delicate and custardy like a bread pudding.  Croissants are good and we like the quiche.  The owners are warm and friendly.  Mondays are discount days when everything is discounted (30% discount at this point).  It's definitely worth finding this little Bistro.
