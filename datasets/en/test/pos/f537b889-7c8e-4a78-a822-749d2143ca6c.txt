I spent the summer in Southern Italy (Lecce) where I would finish almost everyday with the evening walk and a scoop of pistachio gelato - if I was feeling like a risk taker, I would include a little hazelnut with my daily one scoop. The Gelato Spot is almost as good as being in Italy - all the same, the gelato is as close to perfection as you'll get here in town.
