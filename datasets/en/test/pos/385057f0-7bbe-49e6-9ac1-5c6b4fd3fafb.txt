Shannen is the best aesthetician I've experienced.  I'm in my late 50's and have gotten regular facials since I was in my 20's. She is knowledgable, responsive and always looking for ways to make my skin healthier.  Through Shannen, I've gotten to know Maureen.  She too is highly skilled at what she does.  I particularly like that she listens to her clients needs and does what is best for them as individuals.  I trust them both to do what's in my best interest and do it with great skill.
