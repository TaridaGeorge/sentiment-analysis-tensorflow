Best in town and i've eaten at a lot of different sushi bars.  This one takes the cake well beyond even some more expensive Scottsdale locations.

Sushi is fresh and tasty.  The arrangements are very nice, not over the top so you still know what you're about to eat.  Happy hour menu contains lots of $5 choices, including large sake bombers!  

If you're vegan or veg, this place has lots of options for you.  Get the Veggie Gyoza appetizer, you will not regret it.

Staff is extremely friendly, seating is unique with a long cushioned bench along one side.  Perfect for groups of up to 8-10.

To the regulars: please stop bringing your babies.  I know happy hour is worthy of daily visits, but your kids are crying because they don't want to be there.
