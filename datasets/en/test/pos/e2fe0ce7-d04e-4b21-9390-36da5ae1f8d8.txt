- Service was excellent
- Great breeze on the outdoor patio (thanks mother nature)
- Fish tacos are killer; fish is grilled and smoky; shredded red cabbage nice touch; fresh salsa with jalepenos kicked it up a notch; black beans and bacon side was smoky goodness
- Margherita flat bread was yummy
- Ricos Greens salad - would have it again
- Wine list had great values and recommend the  Night Harvest Sauvignon Blanc
- No room for dessert - next time
