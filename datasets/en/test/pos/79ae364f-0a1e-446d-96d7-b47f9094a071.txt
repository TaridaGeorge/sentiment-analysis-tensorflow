they had an awesome clearance when I went and I got about 6 pants for 5.00 to 7.00 each but they are out of swimsuits. This location is moving across the street next to DSW and Nordstrom Rack so thats why they are "clearancing stuff out really cheap and not getting any more shipments. I will prob stop by there today to see what else is marked down. they have cute shoes but out of my size and of course all the cheap flip flops but i love gold and they were out of gold in 7.  The staff seems ok to me, a nice guy helped me check out, polite and a nice girl with red hair helped me look for sizes etc.
