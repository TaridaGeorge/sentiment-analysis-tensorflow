A little oasis literally in the middle of the desert.. Sure it's not nearly as fancy pants as the nearby JW Marriott but for less than half the price, free shuttle service within a 2 mile radius, large new rooms complete with kitchenette, and the best part a ginormous free breakfast buffet including some glorious whole wheat belgian waffles, this place is sooo worth the price!! 

As an added bonus- customer service is not an antiquated concept. Everyone I encountered was super helpful and made my stay here totally pleasant. Couldn't recommend it more!!!!
