Came here this weekend with my friend and absolutley loved! The place is clean and has nice service.  The View is amazing from here of the famous fountain! What I ordered:

The food was served fresh, hot, and placed well.  My friend and I took it to go to sit in the park since it was a nice day.  So glad we stopped here it is worth every penny except she treated me so i guess it was worth her every penny haha!
