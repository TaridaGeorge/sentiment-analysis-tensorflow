I LOVE this place!  It's a big warehouse without prices on the merchandise.  You need to use the catalog to find prices.  Everything is much cheaper than big box pet supply stores.  

-You can bring your dog,
-You cannot bring in your purse (they'll ask you to leave it in your car or in their cubby at the front  desk).
-You have to spend $25 minimum.
-Local shipping is CHEAP
-Parking is kinda sucky, I don't recommend bringing a big long bed truck.
