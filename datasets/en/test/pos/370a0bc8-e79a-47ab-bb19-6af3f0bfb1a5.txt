Five stars for Chaparral Suites in Scottsdale, AZ .  We had a family reunion and 60th Anniversary event there in late Sept. 2011 and it was the best reunion ever.  Special thanks to Danny, David and Marlene in the Sports Bar & Grille for making our special dinner in the Cactus Room so wonderful.  Impeccable service, great food at a good value and awesome cocktails.  They also served up the anniversary cake we had delivered in a very professional, but personable manner.  There were 13 of us and everyone loved their room (suite), totally enjoyed the free breakfast and other meals and the grounds were beautiful and well maintained.  Staff are everywhere to help you and make sure you were not in need of anything.  We would love to do it again next year.
