Friendly and relaxing. The coffee is smooth and fresh. It is hand tamped and not all run by machines and simply pushing a button, coffee is more complex that that and Java Worx employees understand that.
Coffee is not burnt like u know who, and the coffee is roasted in Cave Creek so it is fresh.
Great place to sit back and relax or study for your big test; check it out!
Also they have movie nights on the big 10 foot screen and sometimes they have live music and somtimes karaoke! How fun is that.
Java Worx is recomended in my book :-)
