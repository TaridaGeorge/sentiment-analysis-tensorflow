I like this place much better than Ruth Chris's, Flemings, or Mortons. Cool dining room, great steaks, and creamed spinach- my favorite! Good location, excellent service, been here about 5 times and its been a while, so I need to get back here! Nice place to take out of towners because its not a chain and its very, very good!
