Coffee is ridiculous! They roast their own in small batches. It just doesn't get any better than that! The owner is a really cool guy. Tends to give too much away being nice, but that shows how committed he is to future business. The treats are great and I'm sorry for not remembering the name of the baker. Greatest old school hand drawn espresso machine too. Just a great little place with killer self roasted beans.
