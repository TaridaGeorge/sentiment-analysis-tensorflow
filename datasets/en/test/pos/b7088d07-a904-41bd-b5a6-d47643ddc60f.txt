This whole complex is great!  If the DBacks were to actually play regular season games here, I'd be more inclined to go to because I do not like Chase Field.  Just walking up to the actual stadium you walk right by numerous playing fields, and batting cages and at any given time you can watch the teams practice.  The aesthetics of this place is really clean.  Not a bad seat in the house and it's cheap!  My only complaint and I'm nit picking because I'm a traditionalist when it comes to ball park food.  I don't want to see Mexican and Chinese cuisine.  That's not baseball!!
