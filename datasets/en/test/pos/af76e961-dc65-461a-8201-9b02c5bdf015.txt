My visit to the FBH was absolutely over the top!  I experienced over the top customer service, the food was over the top good and the portions were over the top huge!  Needless to say there was some serious over indulgence on my part... I'm right there with Dottsy Z.- the Big Red Cream Soda washes the guilt right down!
The manager talked with me for a long time and was helpful with making a decision- it all looked so good I almost couldn't imagine picking only a few things... In the end I believe I made the right call because I was so full when I left the I actually pondered unbuttoning my jeans... fortunately I was out with friends and had to keep my dignity about me.  
I will definitely be putting this place into my regular rotation of favorites...
