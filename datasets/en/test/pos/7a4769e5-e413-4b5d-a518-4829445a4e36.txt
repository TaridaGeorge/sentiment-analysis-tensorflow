I was craving some sweets today and told my husband about this place. Apparently, one needs to make an appointment but my husband made one right away when he called. We got a Baileys cupcake, a chocolate cupcake, and a carrot cupcake all of them were DELICIOUS! Seriously most gluten free pastries are horrible but these were great. We will definitely be going there frequently.
