I have been telling my friends about this amazing gem since I started going there 12 years ago.  Razz is a true chef. Passionate about his food, full of life and incredibly fun to dine with at his Chef's table at the bar.  But I have to say, his Boulliabase is the best in town.  I crave it!  I also crave almost everything on the menu...the duck cakes are his signature and a must have for sure!  This intimate, art gallery dining room welcomes you everytime, as do Bobbie, Razz's wife and Razz himself.  Yummy!
