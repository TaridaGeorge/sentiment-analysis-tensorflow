We were greeted at the door of the packed restaurant immediately, and seated at a table for six promptly, even though no smaller tables were  available. Our server, Brittany, immediately took our orders and brought two tall glasses of Sam Adams Winter Lager and Blue Moon, I had the ribs and brisket two meat plate with mac/cheese and great baked beans. My wife had the two meat with ribs & pulled pork. fries and cole slaw. The surprise was an ice cream plate w/sparkler as it was my birthday. The decor is country/western farm rustic. Cracker Barrel should take lessons from this operation. Even the bathroom was spotless. Two thumbs up for this chain venue. Second visit for us, and we will be back!
