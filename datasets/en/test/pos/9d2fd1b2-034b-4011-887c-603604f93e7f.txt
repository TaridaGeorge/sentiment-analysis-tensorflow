We had my grandparent's wedding anniversary dinner at Eddie V's.  Our server, Rocco was awesome!  He was super attentive and friendly, and definitely made the meal even better.  

The entrees were all delicious, and for the quality, the prices seemed reasonable.

I will definitely go back again.  EXCELLENT experience!
