Giant Coffee is my favorite coffee shop in Phoenix. 

Do I need to write more? 

Well, every time I've been in the baristas/os are nice, helpful and generally classy individuals. The coffee is excellent, my favorite is the honey vanilla latte, but I've yet to be disappointed. The breakfast burritos take a little long, but are worth the wait if you're in the mood for a burrito and coffee combo. The setting is laid back, and one of the few places I can go read a book or catch up with a friend- it's surreal how well Giant works for both. The only downside is they close way to early (like 7 or 8).
