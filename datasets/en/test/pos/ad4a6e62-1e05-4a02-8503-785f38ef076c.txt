I recently went here to get a hair cut after having an hour free in the area. I walked in to a very clean, friendly salon and was immediately seen by a very energetic young stylist named Alex. As a guy I typically have a difficult time explaining things in hair terms, but she was incredibly understanding and insightful in what I was looking for. She did a fantastic job and she definitely gained my future business.
