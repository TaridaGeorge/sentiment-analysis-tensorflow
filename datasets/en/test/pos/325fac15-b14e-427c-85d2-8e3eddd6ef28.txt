I heart REI.
I also heart the cute men that work at REI.  :)

But seriously, they sell quality gear, and clothing.  I am not a fan of things that are basically disposable, and REI stuff is built to last.  I have bought gear at REI 10 years ago that i am still using.  That is awesome.  I am a member so i get a credit at the end of the year, that is rad too!
