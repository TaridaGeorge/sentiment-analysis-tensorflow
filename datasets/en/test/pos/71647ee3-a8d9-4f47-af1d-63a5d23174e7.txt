This is a great place for that home cooking feel.  They have a lot of wonderful dishes from region around Hong Kong and they prepare the standards so everyone is happy.  Don't hesitate to ask for suggestions and advice.  
It's sort of classic to order a soup and then a Chicken, Fish, Beef and Pork Dish and many a Tofu/Vegi dish.   I don't know any other way of ordering besides family style where you order the number of entree per the number of people in the group dining plus a soup.  
We had a House special noodle pan fried, XO Fish spicy, Pork and Tofu Hot pot, Beef and Chinese Broccoli plus Hot and Sour Soup.  Each was great.
This is now our go to Chinese food restaurant in Phoenix.
