My boyfriend and I came to CenPho for his tattoo appointment, and I've seen raves about vegan doughnuts (Chris and I are vegans) so we had to grab the chance. Pulling up this place, I was immediately excited-I LOVE small and local business situated in an old house. We got in and immediately fell in love with it. The doughnuts were OUT, but we ended up having a delicious vegan burrito! I would definitely go back when I'm in the area again-only if you would open another location in Chandler! :D
