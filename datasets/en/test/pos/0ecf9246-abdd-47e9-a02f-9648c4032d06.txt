Very impressed w the food, just know b4 hand the wait was almost and hour long and this was on a Thursday b4 noon. I can see why people will wait. The downfall is that now when I have breakfast, the first thing that I think is "matts, is the best breakfast place I have ever been too" :p 

Can't wait to be back!

Ps Guy from dives and diners was there! :D
