This place is amazing, especially our dogs' vet, Dr. Samoska! He is very knowledgeable, friendly, and patient. He would take his time to answer any questions we have. Most of the staffs there are also very friendly and knowledgeable. Banfield (Petsmart) offers various affordable discount plans that cover dental prophylaxis, comprehensive exams, etc. I highly recommend this pet hospital to others.
