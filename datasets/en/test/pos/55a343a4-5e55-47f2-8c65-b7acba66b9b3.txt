Wow, this dinner was pretty spectacular. I've never had an experience quite like it. 

So, you start with a lovely salad bar, they had butter lettuce (yessss) and a delicious basil dressing that went great with my tomato slices. There were also a variety of cheeses available and smoked salmon, yum!

Now lets get down to the meat. There was a Picanha (the prime part of the sirloin) which was gorgeous, Filet Mignon, Beef Ancho, Lombo (pork loin filets encrusted with parmesan cheese!), Frango chicken wrapped in bacon...yay, Linguica (slow-roasted pork sausages) and my favorite, Cordeiro, the leg of lamb, moist and delicious!

This is a great concept for a restaurant, I can't wait to bring my husband for his birthday!
