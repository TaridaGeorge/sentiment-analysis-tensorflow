This review is solely for Lee.  She's amazing at pedicures.  Gets the calluses off, gives a ridiculously good massage and is a perfectionist when it comes to painting nails!  I drive from Scottsdale just to go to her.  I have gone to others here and have walked away disappointed, so call in and book an appt with Lee ONLY!  $18 for spa pedicure on Wednesdays too!  What a deal!
