*This review is for a Tuesday evening*

Made my first visit tonight with some co-workers, and everything I had heard about 5th & Wine was true. Clean, unique establishment w/ good service and great ambience. Their BBQ wings came highly recommended, and I'm not a big wings guy, but goddamn... they were AMAZING: flavorful, meaty wings that seemed to be cooked perfectly. I seriously couldn't get enough of them. Their garlic fries were also great, as was my caesar salad. My Stella came out with a nice ice cold pint glass. They have a pretty extensive food and wine menu, but not overwhelming. Their Elk burger caught my eye while scanning the menu, so I have a good reason to go back.
