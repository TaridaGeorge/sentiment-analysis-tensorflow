I love TEDS!  There hot dogs are amazing and there are plenty of selections for you when you go there.  I wish there were more places like this in town.

I like to get either a hot dog  or a corn dog and cheese fries.  I once got chili cheese fries and they were on point, but I felt bad after eating all that food.
