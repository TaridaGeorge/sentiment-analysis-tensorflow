I am totally a fan of this place! I went on a random Wednesday night and ordered a salty dog and got lucky enough to catch the 5 dollar burger special! The food was good and I loved the chill atmosphere. I cannot stand stuffy bars and this place was so relaxing and both bartenders were friendly and attentive and came back with suggestions when I ordered something!
