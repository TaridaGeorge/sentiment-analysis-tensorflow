Great place. Beautiful grounds. Fantastic pool for kids.  Excellent outdoor seating in the evenings.  Get the Gold Rooms.  The lounge and breakfast are great values with buffets every morning with eggs, sausage, waffles, berries, OJ, coffee cereal, cold cuts, the works.  The week we were there (Spring Break) the lounge was understaffed, but I suspect that was due to the high occupancy that week.
