Every time we go to Cowboy Ciao, I vow to get something besides the exotic mushroom pan fry and the Stetson salad. And every time we go, I break my vow. Except for the one time I got the ultra ham and cheese, which although very good, was not worth getting again. Which is why I keep breaking my vow.

The service is amazing; attentive without being annoying. We love the atmosphere, too. We usually luck out and get a spot in the front by the window with a view of the fountains across the street.

Highly recommended. Be sure to make a reservation to avoid potentially LONG wait times.
