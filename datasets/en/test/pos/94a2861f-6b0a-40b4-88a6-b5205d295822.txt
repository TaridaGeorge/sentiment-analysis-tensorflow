I went on a Thursday night when they had the event Picket Fences and plus it was a Yelp shop local event.  Jam has so many unique gifts.  Love it!!!  Jam had a tons of people crammed into the place but it was cool because it was raining and cold outside.  The Picket Fences event was great until rain.  =(  Unfortunately, some of the vendors left before I went back outside.  I found some perfect gifts for Christmas at Jam and Boho Farm and Home has awesome jam.
