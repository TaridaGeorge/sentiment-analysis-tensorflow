Why go to another steakhouse in town? The food is standard steakhouse fare: the same delicious steaks (have the ribeye),  la carte sides, and a good wine list (albeit a bit Napa-heavy). Service is also good. Basically, the food and service are what you'd expect at Ruth's Chris, Fleming's, Donovan's, etc.

But the atmosphere is much more fun. City Hall is the place to see and be seen. Beautiful people as far as the eye can see. So if you're in the mood for standard steakhouse fare, why go someplace boring?
