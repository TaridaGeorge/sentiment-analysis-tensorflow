LOVE Trader Joe's...any of them! This one is pretty off the beaten path of "Surprise" AZ, but well worth the trek as its not that busy and the customer service is personal. 

The manager stopped and talked to us for a while as he noticed the HPU (Hawaii Pacific University) shirt my hubby was wearing and come to find out we had some states in common. Super nice guy.

But yeah, the products are great, cheap and as everyone knows the best thing about Trader Joe's? Awesome 2 buck chuck. =) 

Pros:
-Prices, Quality of products, selection
-Seems the staff love working here OR they hire very intelligently. 

Cons:
There's no Trader Joe's in Hawaii....boooo!!!!
