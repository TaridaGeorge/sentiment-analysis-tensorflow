I LOVE Bagel Gourmet. It's close to my house so I stop there for breakfast sometimes. I pick up a dozen bagels with two tubs of cream cheese for my coworkers sometimes and they love them now too. They have a big variety of true, boiled bagels with unusual flavors. My favorite is the Spinach Parmesan with Southwestern cream cheese. YUM!
