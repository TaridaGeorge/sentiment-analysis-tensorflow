I have been going to this office for about 7 years, and have always gotten superior service.  I never feel rushed or ignored, and the entire staff is amazing.  While they are busy, so you want to schedule routine exams ahead of time, when I am truly sick and need to be seen, they always find a way to get me in.  

I love the fact that they can take care of all the well-woman stuff, and they are very open to discussing options.  Of course, some decisions come down to insurance, but they are always up front about what costs, side effects and other options I have.

I have referred friends and family and they have all raved as well.
