King and Duck is most definitely the FIRST of it's kind in this city. The shoe selection is small but 100% AUTHENTIC. I'd rather go to a store with smaller selection than a place that's full of fakes . As for the clothing, they offer up to the minute streetwear lines (10 Deep, the HUNDREDS, Rocksmith, etc.) and consistantly pay attention to what their customers want.
