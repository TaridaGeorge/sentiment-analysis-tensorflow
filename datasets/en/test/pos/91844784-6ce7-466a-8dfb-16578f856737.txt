Outstanding paintball experience.  Super excellent customer service. We brought two adults and 6 kids for my son's13th birthday party. Henry went out of his way from the first phone call to insure we would have a great party. Most reasonably priced experience in the valley as compared to Cowtown or Splatter ranch. The trenching was a bonus feature to fight in. Their local rule of head, chest or back shots being the only that take you out of the game made the fight more realistic. The refs were super attentive and flexible concerning game set up. So appreciated the 5 diverse fields and ability for us to have our own field for private play. This is how a recreational business should be run. The competitors should take lessons because now this is the only field we will be playing on.
