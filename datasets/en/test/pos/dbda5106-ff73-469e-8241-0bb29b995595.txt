Seriously good stuff here.  Yes, the lines are long but that's not really their fault.  The food is great and people want to come here.

The waffle here is simply the best.  I've never had better, anywhere.  I've also had the burger, which was really, really, really good.  Next time I'll see if they can put a different cheese on it because I'm not a big fan of American cheese.  Regardless, everything here was delicious, regardless of the line.  If you're willing to wait, or maybe come at an off-hour, it's definitely worth the wait.
