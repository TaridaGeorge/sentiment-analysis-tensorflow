I feel so organized today!  I decided to stop in Sprouts for a few things I needed knowing that I could get a sandwich at the deli for me and my daughter for dinner.  But they had everything I needed!  Rice milk single packs, Honest Kids juice packs, broccoli slaw (YUM), wine and a fantastic deli sandwich.  Ok, so I got other stuff too (chicken, bananas, yogurt, etc...boring but needed).  I was most surprised and pleased by the quality of the sandwiches - fresh green lettuce, not iceberg!, fresh tomatoes, real deli meat and whole grain bread.  I would stop in here just for the sandwiches or anytime I need some groceries and have to feed me and the kiddo dinner too.
