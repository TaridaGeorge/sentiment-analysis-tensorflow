Desert Pool Cleaning has recently become our pool maintenance company after looking for a replacement for our ex-pool guy. Ben (the owner) was quick, professional and honest. He gave us real estimates on price, timing and suggested services. Our pool needed some serious love and Ben actually drained and refilled it for us- and now it looks gorgeous. I feel comfortable knowing he is coming in and our of our backyard and I know he'll keep our pool in great shape this summer. I definitely recommended his services for anyone living in Phoenix and looking for great pool cleaning service.
