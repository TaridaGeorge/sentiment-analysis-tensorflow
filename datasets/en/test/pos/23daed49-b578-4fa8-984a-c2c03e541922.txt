This place is so cute! I walked in and was promptly greeted by a very friendly barista-man. Since I'd never been before, I asked him if there was anything on the menu he was especially proud of and he recommended I try the white chocolate mocha. I found a cute little table in the corner and they brought it out to me. He was right, it's delicious! It reminds me of the mochas I get in Seattle. 

The whole place is great. Interesting art on the walls, old school library feel and tasty coffee. The only thing I would change is I would expand their pastry selection a little. 

Summary: Friendly, cheerful, cozy, cool art, nice music, fast wifi, and splendid coffee!
