My almost 3-year-old son loved this place!  It's a nice respite during the miserable summer weather.  It's perfect for kids his age.  There was something for all interests--visual, art, tactile, everything!  I love that all the rooms are kid-sized, including the sinks in the bathroom and a separate/lower hand-rail on the stairs

Probably not the best value for crawlers or older kids.  But for 2-5 yr-olds, it's a wonderful place!  The only annoying part are the parents who don't lead their kids by example.  Saw some pretty poorly-behaved, rude, and bully kids there.  But that has nothing to do with the museum.  Just a sad commentary of the lack-of parenting skills out there.

Anyway, we love the museum and think that it's the best $9/person we've spent all summer!
