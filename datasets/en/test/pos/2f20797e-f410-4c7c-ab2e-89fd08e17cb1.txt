Arcadia Farms is a great place to go when you are out on a shopping day with your mom or best friend; or for a shower; or for an intimate lunch with your honey.  

Everything is always fresh and they have THE BEST apricot iced tea.  

Their private rooms are really sweet and can accommodate quite a few people.  My sister in law's bridal shower was held here and there must have been 20 or 30 people there.
