I come here most mornings for breakfast (as I work overnights) and compared to some of the other IHOP's, I have been to, this one is awesome! I always have fast friendly service ( granted it's not to busy at  4am) the servings are always good size and freshly cooked doesn't taste like microwave food, like with other late nite/early morning restaurants. Their hot chocolate is great too.
