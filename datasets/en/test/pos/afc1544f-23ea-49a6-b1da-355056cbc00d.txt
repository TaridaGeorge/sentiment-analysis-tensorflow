sephora is awesome! full of great brands of makeup! urban decay, id, lorac, benefit, toofaced, etc.  only thing i wish they had was MAC! then it be perfect! it's basically like an upscale version of ulta. its like a candy store for girls, they have men's cologne but honestly can you see a man walk into that store just to get cologne and walk out and carry around a sephora bag? lol.
