Exceptionally delicious ice cream, super-creative flavors, great service, and nice decor. It's so nice to see such serious gourmet thought put into ice cream. Basil lime sorbet? Sounds odd, but it's SO refreshing. Salted butter caramel? Awesome. Cantaloupe sorbet? Sweet and yummy. You really can't go wrong with any of their flavors. The staff and owners are very nice. Regrettably, they picked a poor location with almost no visibility.  Even with the great PR and word-of-mouth they've received, they're usually pretty empty. Hopefully more people will hear about this great place, seek it out, and join the Sweet Republic!
