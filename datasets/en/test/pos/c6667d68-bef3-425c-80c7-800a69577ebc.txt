I really like this game store.  I usually try to spend my dollars locally, no matter how tempting the Amazonian deals are out there because I truly believe it impacts our neighborhoods.  This store exemplifies that.  The owner is helpful and friendly.  He also stayed open all New Years Eve night so young gamer nerds would have a cool, and safe, fun thing to do for the evening.  For free. It was kind of like a free mini-gaming convention and it kept a lot of kids out of trouble in my hometown.  Big website can't do that.  I am glad I spent my Christmas money at the Outpost.
