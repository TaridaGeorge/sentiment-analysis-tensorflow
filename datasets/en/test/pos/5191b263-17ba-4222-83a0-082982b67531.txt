Love, love, love the pizza! The diavola is my fav- juicy & slightly spicy. My mouth is seriously salavating as I write this. I know it's strange for a pizza to be juicy, so let me explain...the fresh ingredients melting perfectly in the brick oven for an incredible burst of flavors in your mouth - JUICY!!! For apps I was introduced to the Burrata, which is outstanding and give the bruschetta and caprese a try, also yummy. Dessert wise the crepes with nutella are lip-smacking good as well as the nutella shake. (yep, I'm a fan of nutella)

Delightful atmosphere, patio lit with strands of lights, charming historic house inside.

Sometimes they have live music but I'm not sure how to find out this information. Also, they serve homemade pasta on a selected day :)
