The vintage frames I brought in now have lenses and look so incredible I could cry.  I will now permanently skip the high-end boutique optical places that greedily charge in the hundreds for antique frames (ahem, rhymes with "assy") and bring in my own cool frames to Lesco.  $29 for basic lenses in these things blows my mind.  My glasses addiction is now in full swing...
