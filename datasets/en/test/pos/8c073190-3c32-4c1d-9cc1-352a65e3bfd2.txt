The first we ate (me & hubby)   ,we can't believe, OMG
very delicious BBQ , we always order no 1 and no 20 , 
next time no 1 and no 21 or 22 ,not order to much,
because the food to much .
if you like BBQ ,  broken rice and something BBQ .
This place no 1 for BBQ Vietnam style in Arizona.
# 1 rice nodlle with BBQ and vegetable,
# 20 broken rice with 10 kind BBQ .
they accept  credit card  visa or master, but  not american express.
 for us , not  soup, sometimes aroma(smell) soup fishy.
This place inside Mekong Plaza ( and opposite Mekong Market.)
I recommend this place for all  BBQ .
