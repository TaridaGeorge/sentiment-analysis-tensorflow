I was visiting Scottsdale for the first time and wanted to try something good.  This restaurant has a nice view of the horizon, it is located in the Phoenician Hotel.  Food was really good and service was great.  We started off with appetizer, hubby got some kind of onion soup, I don't like onions but took a taste of the soup anyways and it was very fulfilling and tasty.  I got the tuna tar tar which was flavored just right. 

 For entree, I had the sea bass and a side of brussel sprouts (really good), hubby had steak (don't remember which cut) and broccoli.  He loved the steak.  

There is valet in at the hotel, I'm not sure how much it was, hubby said it was free and only top the valet person.
