Strip mall restaurant which is how they do good restaurants in Arizona and a great alternative to mastro in the same complex. If you want quantity, and noise you can go to there..if you want a steak grilled to perfection, quality service, wine and authentic french meals you go to provance. I went with three of my family members and by the end of it we were having a laugh with the owner who comes by to chat and make sure everyone are enjoying themselves. There is already reservations for some of our party to go again next week. Tell your friends tell your family it's good food in N Scottsdale
