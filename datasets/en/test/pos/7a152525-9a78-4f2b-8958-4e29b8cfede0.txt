so, my husband has hobbies.  Lots of them.  And when he starts a hobby he becomes mildly obsessed.
Saltwater tanks are a hobby of his.
Therefore,  I have been to MANY a tropical fish store, and let me tell you, Reef Culture is THE BEST.
These guys know their stuff.  Anytime I have a question about some odd growth or surprise invertebrate, they have answers.
The store is clean, squeaky clean, modern, very appealing.
The stock is great, they always have some cool pally or fish I've never seen before.
And they have Guinness.  Guinness the dog, not the tasty adult beverage.  Guinness the dog is awesome.  He may be the sweetest dog ever.

In short, I highly recommend them.
