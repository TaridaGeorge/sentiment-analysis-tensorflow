This is a surprisingly nice cinema! While many are rundown these days, this one seems new, modern, state-of-the-art. The seats are quite comfortable and there is a full bar inside! I heard mention of a "21 and over" theater. I can't confirm its existence but it sounds great. There was a mess-up with my tix (purchased online) and the management handled it well. It was a good experience overall!
