I live in the townhomes right next to this restaurant and it still took me 4-5 months to actually try it. Absolute blasphemy as I see it now. This is a charming little place, decor outdated enough that it's sweet again, friendly servers, and man, great food. The pesto cream sauce ravioli (I believe) will blow you away. The wine glasses are filled high. Everything is great quality. Prices are medium-range, most dishes ranging from $11-18 but coming with a salad or soup and bread. This would be a great, great date night spot.
