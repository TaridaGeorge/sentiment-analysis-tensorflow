Let's just say, you cannot go wrong with any of the flavors they offer! Feeling like a Pink Lemonade?! I can bet you my life, it tasted like it was sipped from a cup! Instead of biting into a Butterfingers bar, I was licking it! The accuracy of every flavor used in their yogurt was superb!

The toppings bar was well stocked, fresh, cleaned!  As I moved passed the fruits and nuts, I noticed the Kit Kat's and Twix were not chopped and still in its full bar form! Elated I was! Also, seeing bakalava as a topping was refreshing!

The store interior is quite bland yet still has a modern feel.  I've been to two locations and its pretty consistent.  Also, particular flavors may vary from location to location.  At the moment, Yogurtology is my goto froyo!
