This is a good dive bar with beer pong table, flip cup table, dirty restrooms and some other desirable features that I will check out next time.  For some reason, there are always more guys here than girls but people seem very friendly.  Bathrooms don't always have soap, but I'm sure this cost cutting measure was necessary for them to afford to serve $5 pitchers of beer.
