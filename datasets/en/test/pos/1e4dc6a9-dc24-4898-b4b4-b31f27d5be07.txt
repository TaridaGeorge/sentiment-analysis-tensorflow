My Brother had his wedding here in Late-March. It was a spectacular event! The grounds are absolutely immaculate! Every picture we took came out perfectly. We also stayed there for the weekend. The Food for the reception was excellent, the banquet hall we had was perfect in size. Overall the wedding was storybook perfect. The only criticism I have is that the rooms are a bit dated. The bathrooms could be upgraded to reflect the quality of the rest of the resort. Other than that we were very much satisfied with the experience
