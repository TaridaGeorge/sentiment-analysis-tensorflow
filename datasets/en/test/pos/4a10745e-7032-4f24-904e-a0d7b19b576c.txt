Went there last night to celebrate a good friend's birthday. Loved the dim lights atmosphere, which seem to made the couples celebrating Valentine's Day feel more comfortable. 
The service was excellent. Jose our server did not fail to pay attention to each member of our 15+ party. Appetizers and entrees were enjoyed by everyone. The portions were good for all to share, and as the restaurant mentions on their website, the prices are reasonable.
I had the almond crusted tilapia, with a raspberry butter sauce and green beens, and truly enjoyed it. 
Will come back.
