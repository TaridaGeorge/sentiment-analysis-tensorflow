Everytime we've been to Roy's, whether it was in Honolulu, Las Vegas, Chicago, San Francisco or here, we've never been disappointed.

Yea, it's a chain.  Sue me.  One of the best things about this chain is the consistency in the high excellence of food and service.

We love Roy's, we've been going here for a long time.  I would recommend it just about anyone, even the fussy eaters.

If you are a chocolate lover, make sure to try their chocolate lava cake.  You have to order it along with your dinner as it takes about 30 minutes to make.
