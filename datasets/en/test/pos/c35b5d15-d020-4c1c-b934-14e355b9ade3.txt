AMAZING. 

I've only been to Cibo for dinner, but it's one of the few restaurants that i've been to HUNDREDS of times. I cringe whenever I hear someone talking about going to pizzaria Bianco, bec Cibo's pizza is exponentially better and you won't face the hours of waiting that you'll run into at Bianco. 

Esp. recommend going to dinner here when it's a bit cooler... they have live music, a fire pit, and beautiful outdoor dining.
