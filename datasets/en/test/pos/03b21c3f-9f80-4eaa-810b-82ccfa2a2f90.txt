There really isn't anything in Old Town like Bonfire.Their food is unique (skewers & s'mores) and the ambiance is perfect for any time of day.

I recommend the new watermelon barbecue salad (new for summer). And you HAVE to try their chocolate bread pudding. It is delicious! 

If you are near the bar area, look at the screens on the walls. They are slideshows of Arizona nostalgia which enhances the cultural atmosphere and helps capture how the state has evolved over the past 50 years. 

Overall, it is a great spot to have a drink or two and sample on some good quality food.
