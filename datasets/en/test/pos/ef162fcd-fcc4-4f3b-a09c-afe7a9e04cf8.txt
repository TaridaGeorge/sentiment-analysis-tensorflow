Awesome stadium love the atmosphere here and also that you can sit outside of friday's and see the game back in 2007 i caught the game winning ball when the played tampa bay i was on the jumbo tron it was sweet and the staff quickly approached to make sure i was ok and if i wanted my ball signed by the player who hit it which was Chris Young i have and will return again for games here
