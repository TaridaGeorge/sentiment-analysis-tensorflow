This place is PERFECT!  The menu is rather unique and there's something to suit everyone's taste.  They have a pasty for everyone: from traditional savory options to sweet PB&J offerings, anyone can find something to love!  My favorite: the "indian" inspired options, like the lamb vindaloo.

The only thing I would change would be the fires - they were a bit undercooked.

Still, this is an exciting and delicious experience, and surely one of the best places the valley has to offer.  Top it of with reasonable prices and a good beer selection, and you've got a winner!
