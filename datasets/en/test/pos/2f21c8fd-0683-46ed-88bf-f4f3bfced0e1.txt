My daughter has been attending here since she was 4 years old. 
She loves her teachers and all the diversity in the programs she is offered. She is now in the 4th Grade and I can't imagine her leaving to go anywhere else. 
We have had our ups and downs as any family would but we have always been met by the Administration openly and honestly. I've heard from those that have never been to Rancho how hard it is, and how strict it is...For those don't knock it till you try it. My daughter definitely has to work hard, but that is why I send her...She is going there for a First Class Education and I believe that is what we are giving her...She has her sights set on Pepperdine University and I see nothing getting in her way!!!
