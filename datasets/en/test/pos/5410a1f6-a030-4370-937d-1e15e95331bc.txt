someone once told me hiking isn't a big deal, "it's just walking on a path"

this is no ordinary walk.  it's a thrilling hike with challenges and gorgeous views.  it's quite the workout.  there are certain points on this hike where i feel like i'm actually rock climbing.  parking can be insane on weekends but it's worth waiting 15 minutes for a spot to open.
