This is my absolute favorite hike in the valley. Granted I have a grudge against camelback since I fell in a cactus there a few years ago. 

It's 1.25 miles to the top. There's lots of benches for beginners to break and take in the beautiful scenery also.

 I have been hiking here for a few years now and while I hike up pretty quickly (about 30 mins) I've never caught up w those 22 minute hikers! But pushing yourself to get faster every time makes the workout that much more intense. Woot!

 It's also a really good conditioning hike before hitting up trails north of us in Flagstaff or Sedona.

Just do it!
