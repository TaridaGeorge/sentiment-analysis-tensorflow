Hale pet doors are amazing. I live in Los Angeles and did a lot of research to find the perfect dog door for my new greyhound.  Since they come in so many sizes, it makes finding the perfect door for your dog so easy.  A Tall Large Door version was the recipe for my tall skinny four legged baby. (Most dog doors are too wide and not tall enough for greys).  Four and a half years later, the door is still going strong, but one of the flaps is tearing a bit.  I rustled up my receipt, called the nice Hale people, and they are shipping me replacement flaps at a 30% warranty discount.  These doors are expensive, but SOOO worth it!
