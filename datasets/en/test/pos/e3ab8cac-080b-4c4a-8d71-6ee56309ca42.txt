OMG Savers 1s teh s3cks1 ! I've been a thrift store junkie from when I was a kid. I've made a nice part time job out of ebaying thrift store items for a few years. But I'd never been in a chain thrift store like Saver's before. Goodwill, yes, but alot of those tend to be junk stores, broken Happy Meal toys and used water filters, yuk. I've noticed lately that some "thrift" stores are charging premium prices for certain items like action figures and other random toys. Savers has a variety of goodies at reasonable "thrift" prices. I stop whenever I go past one, every time.
