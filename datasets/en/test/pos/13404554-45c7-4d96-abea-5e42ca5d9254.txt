I can't say enough about the chopped salad. Seriously. I want it to-go everyday.

Also, the mac and cheese was really great - just a little spicy.

Great selection of beers, I loved my 1554.

It's a romantic and warm atmosphere, and our server Julio was so nice, and his recommendations were spot on.
