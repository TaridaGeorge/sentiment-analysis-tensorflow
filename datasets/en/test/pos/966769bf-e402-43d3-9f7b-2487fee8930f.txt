Oh man! this food is so scrumptious mmm the first time we had it we got it to go and oh man i believe it was the Chow lo mein that had just the right texture with the noodles, not too soft and not dry ....mmm great flavor too  ...by far you can not beat their lunch special mmm you get egg drop soup, a heaping meal, and a desert too i believe for a great price    
   Great service too! you can tell they are really pleased to have you as a customer :D ...i will be back
