I'm not much of a candy person, so when my friend and fellow yelper Nick A. suggested that we visit this shop, I thought that my experience would just be just a look-and-leave. But it turned out to be a pleasure-for-all-the-senses experience. Upon entering the charming shop, the heavenly aroma of the toffees grabbed me and made it impossible for me not to try the samples. Everything was delicious! I wish I had bought more than I did, as I don't go to this area often, but this shop gives me another reason to look forward to my future visits to Scottsdale.
