FEZ for brunch on Saturday with a bunch of girlfriends was one of the highlights of my weekend. Several of us ordered the FEZ Fritatta and it was perfectly cooked with tasty toppings and the best bacon on the side. I also sampled the sweet potato fries and they were even better than anticipated--a standout.

Plates looked pretty. C'mon, that's important! Presentation, people. Service was superb.

Hadn't been to FEZ in a while and forgot how delicious it is! Let's go to FEZ more often, girls!
