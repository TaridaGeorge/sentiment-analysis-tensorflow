As a part-Chinese who grew up near a big Chinatown, I wanted a restaurant that had authentic good food like I could find at home.  My Taiwanese pals took me here and I've been eating here once a week ever since.  The service is great and the food is out of this world!  My favorites are the Mongolian beef and the Beef with snow peas, but I've tried many of their other dishes and all of them were just as good.  Don't know what you want?  Tell the waiter what you like...type of meat, spicy or sweet, etc...and he'll come back with a dish so satisfying, you'll think the chef read your mind!  I LOVE this place!  It's fairly quiet on weekday nights but weekend nights are busier.
