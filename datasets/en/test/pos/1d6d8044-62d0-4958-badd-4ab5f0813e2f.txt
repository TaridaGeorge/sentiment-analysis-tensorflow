I've been here twice with my girlfriend and her family. I absolutely love the ambience and the d√©cor. Very Downtown posh! The Mac & Cheese is to die for...I crave it on a daily basis and have yet to find anything close to it. The Switch House salad is absolutely delicious...very well balanced between sweet and savory. Spicy Bleu Burger is amazing. The Beef is cooked perfectly and the tangy wing sauce with the bleu cheese crumbles is the perfect combination. 

They also have THE best cosmos. I suggest the Blueberry Cosmo. I seriously walk out of this place drunk everytime!
