I was very impressed with this salon. When I called at 6:30 to see how long they were open, Tony responded with "it doesn't matter, come on in. What do you need?"   (They close at 7pm by the way). Once I got there, I had a fabulous pedicure, and did not feel rushed or get less massage time even though it was past their closing time. The staff seemed really nice. The pedicure was $20, and I was told their gel nails are only $25 (which is pretty cheap for Phoenix!). Also, the salon itself is clean and well kept. I highly recommend it!
