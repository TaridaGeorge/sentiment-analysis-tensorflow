I have been a virgin at rating cvs. Until now. I have always been a fan of customer service, but in the true sense of the meaning and the lady behind the counter at this place is absolutely fantastic. This downtown location could be a lot worse with the wrong attitude but the farmacist on staff at this place is off the chain. She is very helpful, quick, communicative... i feel like she carries the reputation of the whole place. 

All in all the entire place is great, but any time you are downtown and in need of various farmacy products, i highly recommend this location.

Have fun, be safe and good luck.
