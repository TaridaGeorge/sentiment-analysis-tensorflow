So when I was invited to go to Lon's for dinner I will be honest I was not expecting much. I did know that it was hidden and that it was in PV but as soon as you take a look at the place it becomes obvious that this was going to be a great dining experience.

As soon as I drove in the valet greeted me with a smile and so did every one else. The wait staff is very nice and helpful if you have any question about the menu.  The place is gorgeous and definitely a date place.  But be prepared to spend money but it is totally worth it. I had the grilled beef tenderloin that was cooked to perfection. 

I have been back and I am never disappointed with this place and you won't be either.
