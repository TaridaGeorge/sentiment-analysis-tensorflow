I've been coming here for years and it is definitely the best bagel shop in town!! They have a wide variety of bagels, cream cheese and sandwiches that are all delicious! I would personally recommend the egg and oreo bagels. Staff is friendly and prices are reasonable. They also have really good lemonade :)

Overall, if you're in the area or looking for a nice bagel/sandwich shop, check this place out!! Oh, and they offer a lot of coupons and specials on their Facebook page so be sure to check for those too!
