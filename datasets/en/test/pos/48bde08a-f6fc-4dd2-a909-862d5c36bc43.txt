I love this speciality running store!  If you're getting into some regular running, want to start, or need a good pair of running shoes definitely come here and get their expert advice.  They'll get you fitted with a great pair of shoes, have you run for them, and really know their stuff.  There's also a great stock of clothing and accessories.  

SRC also offers group runs and put together a great pre race tent for PF Chang's Rock n Roll 1/2 marathon and maration.  It may be hard to find back in that corner, but definitely try them out!
