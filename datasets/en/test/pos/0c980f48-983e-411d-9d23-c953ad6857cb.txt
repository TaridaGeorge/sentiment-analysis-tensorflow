If you want a huge, delicious sandwich, this is the place to go.  They offer a ton of options.  I opted for the Liverwurst and it was delish!  Potato pancakes?  Umm, yes please!  Keep in mind that this is a true deli...you have to wait in line.  I haven't been there during a lunch or dinner rush, but they actually have "approximate wait time" signs up, so I'm guessing they get pretty busy!  Definitely check this place out!
