Eden's Grill is definitely one of the best Greek restaurants in Phoenix.  The atmosphere is small and cozy.  The owner's are fantastic.  They always welcomed us and when I would dine there without my daughter they always ask about her.  The food is fabulous.  They have the best dolmeh!  I love the Lentil Soup and the Gyro Salad.  I love this family run restaurant.
