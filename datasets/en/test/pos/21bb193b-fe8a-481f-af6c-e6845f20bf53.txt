Cindy Gentry has created a large part of her dream here and with the outdoor market. Many Phoenicians' dreams have been wonderfully fulfilled as well - I can tell - the aisles are becoming too narrow.

It keeps getting better - the chefs, the selection, the support. Our meals at home are increasingly prepared exclusively from local ethically created ingredients found at these two dreamlands... 

Now will someone please step up and make yogurt locally?!? 

Which reminds me - my CSM card promises me a discount this week on CRAVE ice cream - but 4 reviews said it's no longer carried? What gives?
