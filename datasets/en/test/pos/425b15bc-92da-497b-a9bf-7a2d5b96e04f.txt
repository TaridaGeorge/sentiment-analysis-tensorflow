After visiting Pizza Bianco two days earlier, my wife and I thought we would try the Bianco's newest restaurant in the Town and Country shopping center in Phoenix.

Their selection of salads are both plentiful and the one we had had both the freshest
and flavorfull vegetables, with just the right amount of Italian dressing!

The Lasagna was excellent!  My wife had the spaghetti and we split an order of meatballs.  Best meatballs we've ever eaten!  The flourless chocolate cake was fantastic!

Great service, good value and good sized portions.
