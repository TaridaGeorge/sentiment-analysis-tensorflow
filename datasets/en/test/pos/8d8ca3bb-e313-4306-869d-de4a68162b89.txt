Best burgers ever. They're not of the typical bar-food burger to chow down on variety, but ones that you want to savor, loving every gueyere-covered bite. Just when you think it couldn't get better come along their fries. I could eat three orders of them. They come in a cute little mini-shopping cart. Delux offers regular fries and sweet potato fries, which are a must if you go there. I always order a combo of the two to dip in their spicy aioli sauce. My boyfriend has made this our official weeknight date spot. It's casual enough to stop by after work but has a vibe that definitley makes it "date-worthy." I've always had great service, and have seen the owner strolling around several times. All-around great place to stop by when in Phoenix.
