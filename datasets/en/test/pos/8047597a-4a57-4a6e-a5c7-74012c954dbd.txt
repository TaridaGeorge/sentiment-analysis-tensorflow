The sales people are extremely knowledgeable and friendly. The furniture quality is the best. I purchased a complete patio set with extra chairs for my pool and patio. It was delivered on time and it looked great!  The prices were competitive and the quality of the furniture was as good or better then compared to other stores. I strongly recommend PaddyO furniture if you are looking to purchase nice outdoor furniture at great prices. Lastly, I really liked the customer service and care I received when I was in the store. They were very helpful! I am referring all of my friends!
