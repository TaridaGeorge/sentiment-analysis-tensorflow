Yay! Karve Studio finally made it to Scottsdale and I was there for opening day! It's a great workout that is basically a combination of ballet barre work, core conditioning and stretching. It's a one hour class that is challenging and a lot of fun. I totally dig the music -- I usually snag a song or two at the end of class to add to my ipod playlist. :)

Also, the Scottsdale studio will have a kids room and a locker room and showers. Total perk!

Can't wait to go back...
