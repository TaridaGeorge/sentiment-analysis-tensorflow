I love Lux, and now that I've left downtown Phoenix living for good, I will miss it.

I am going to give it five stars instead of four, because Jeff, the owner, more than makes up for the crowds with his great customer service. He gets to know his regulars by name and encourages all of the staff to do the same. 

To the reviewer who was bummed out that they didn't know what a "cafe ole" was... I think you MEANT "cafe au lait." It's a French drink, not a Spanish cheer.

Yeah it's crowded. Yeah there are often too many hipsters (my little sister said that she'd have to find some Buddy Holly glasses to wear in next time, so she'd fit in better). But the coffee is great, the baked goods are awesome, and the staff is capable, courteous, and kicks much ass.
