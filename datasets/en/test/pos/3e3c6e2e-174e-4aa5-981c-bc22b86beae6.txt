I like how everyone leaving raving reviews for this place is all "I know, 5 stars for a post office, wtf?!" BUT! This P.O. earns every star!

Friendly staff! Hardly any wait! I finally (whoops) mailed out my Christmas gifts yesterday afternoon, and even at 12:30ish when the line was snaking around the whole room, I only waited 10-15 minutes. In and out!

They are fully stocked on regular envelopes and boxes, those flat rate shipping products, fancy and fun holiday and birthday accoutrements, etc. etc. etc. 

Like everyone says, the thing that makes this location is the staff. They know what the heck they're doing, and they do it well. I know serving up quality customer service can be a bitch sometime--ESPECIALLY during the holidays. I can't even imagine working for the postal system this time of year, but they are pros!
