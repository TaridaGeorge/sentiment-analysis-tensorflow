I had heard great things about Pizzeria Bianco and had been to LUX (the coffee shop next door), so I was excited at the chance to get to try this place.

They were out of the the market sandwich of the day, so we decided to go with the Caprese Sandwich.  Let me say this, never in AZ have I ever tasted anything close to what I experienced in Italy, until I came here.  The bread was the perfect combination of chewy and crunchy.  The tomatoes tasted like they came right off of the vine. The ultimate winner however, was the mozzarella.  So incredibly fresh! Slightly salty, perfect texture; literally heaven.  

I have not been there since they opened the Dine-in section, but plan on going back as soon as possible!
