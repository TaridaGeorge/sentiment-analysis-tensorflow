My boudoir photo shoot was amazing!!!  From the first correspondence with Lynn to the beautiful pictures....the process was seamless.   Lynn's makeup artist Erica works MAGIC....making you feel like a goddess.  I checked out so many of the photographers in the valley while trying to decide who fit my style. Lynn's work was by far the most beautiful, sensual and alluring.  If you are looking for the best...Look no further than Boudoir in Bloom....you will be thrilled with the results.  My hubby carries his book of pictures around the house...looking at them constantly!
That's HIGH praise.
