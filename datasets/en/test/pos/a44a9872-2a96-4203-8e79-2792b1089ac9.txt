Best Chicken salad sandwich I ever had!. 
There have been a lot of contenders too!

The sandwich was perfection. Choice of home made forcaccia or ciabatta bread.  It had a generous portion of chicken salad  with sprouts, lettuce, tomato, and oh so rare was that it was served toasted, warm and perfect  with a secret sauce in lieu of mayo.
 Along side some delicious potato salad.
