Great soup and stuff! This chain is consistently good and the food is thoroughly wholesome and good value. I usually end up here if I want something quick and light. I love the soups that they offer, and their complimentary strawberry with chocolate/or mint that you get for ordering the combo meal is a nice touch. I love the Italian syrups. Very different from any chain restaurants out there. I don't know why some reviewers are bothered by the friendly employees that greet you here. I think it's great! Keep up the good work Zupas!
