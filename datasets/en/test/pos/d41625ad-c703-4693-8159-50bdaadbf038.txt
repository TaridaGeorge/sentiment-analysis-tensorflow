As a real estate investor, I need contractors that I can truly count on to get things done for me.  This means that my calls get returned in a timely fashion, work is done properly, quickly and competently but most importantly, that I get quoted a fair price for a good job.  

Don't give me drama and definitely, don't give me any bullshit excuses or sales pitches.

I'm so glad to have found David and Tracy.  They run a tight ship, they are extremely professional and I sensed their sincerity from the word hello and I talk to contractors and real estate agents almost every single day.

Thank you for a job well done.  You have definitely made the cut as part of my go to crew, not only for my rental properties but as a highly recommended vendor to my Sonoran desert friends, colleagues and neighbors.

Cheers!!
