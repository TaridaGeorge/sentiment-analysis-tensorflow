I have been a member of several local gyms including Lifetime Fitness, LA Fitness, etc. I'm not from this area, so I was looking for a good place to exercise without distraction in a good environment. I signed up for the Chandler YMCA about 2 months ago and love it. It's an older facility but has a good vibe going, many people seem down to earth and just do their own thing. You don't have meatheads grunting on the weight machines or soccer moms chatting it up everywhere. I don't get distracted when I work out and feel comfortable. Also, theres a good selection of exercise equipment and NEVER too many people in the room at the same time. Good place to work out.
