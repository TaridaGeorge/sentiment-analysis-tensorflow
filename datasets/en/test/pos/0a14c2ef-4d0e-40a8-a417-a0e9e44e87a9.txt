I LOVE this place. It's where I met my husband, lol. It is like the Cheers of Phoenix. Everyone does know your name, if you've gone there a few times. Always a smiling person greeting you. Not many stuffy people; everyone gets along (or they toss your rude butt out) and you can always find a pool or shuffleboard partner. Trivia is fun, too. They are always coming up with fun events based on sports or other games they involve the crowd with. This is a place you'll want to repeatedly return to. When you go, look for me! See you there!! :)
