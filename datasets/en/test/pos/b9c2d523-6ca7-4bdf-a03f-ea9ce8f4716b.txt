OMG this place is SO MUCH FUN! We came here for a round of mini-golf and we all had such a great time.

We chose the optical illusion course and it was definitely challenging but all in all so much fun. Next time, I want to try the bungee bounce and go to the batting cages.

This is such a fun place to bring the family, friends or a date!
