Location. Location. Location.  ...and then you gotta have good food.  Well this snazzy-yet-inexpensive restaurant served me up the best breakfast I've had outside mom's Sunday fare, for an astonishingly low price.  Not greasy, carefully pan-cooked seasoned potatos and scrambled eggs, and yup, toast CAN be that good.

On approach I thought I was going to an East Coast Panera Bread, or a friendly neighborhood albeit overpriced Paradise Bakery, but then I open the doors to a cavernous living room with a baking problem.  

And if anyone from Wildflower is reading this, can you fix the annoyingly tippy table we sat at outside with one leg missing the rubber pad?  ***UPDATE: Table was fixed promptly the next day!***

Also, they bus the tables there, so just leave your plate where it is when you leave.
