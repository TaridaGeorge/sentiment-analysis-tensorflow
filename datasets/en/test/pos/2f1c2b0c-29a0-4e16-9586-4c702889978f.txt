I have had the pleasure of being served by Johnny(san) three different occasions and under varied conditions... 1. Busy, 2. quiet and 3. over the top busy where I felt like I should jump the counter and help!!!  

This is one cool calm collected Sushi Chef.  He is fantastic and full of class.  Much respect to Johnny and his staff.  I only know him through being a customer...he excels at making you feel like family.  The Sushi is very very good and great care goes into the preparation.  I love Sushi and this place has moved up the list of my closely held favorites.  I'll qualify this by saying that I travel quite a bit and I ALWAYS try the local Sushi... LA, NY, TOKYO etc...
