This is the premier contemporary art gallery in the city.  I almost want to take one star away just because it is in Scottsdale, but I won't do that, it is just petty of me, kind of like most (not all) of the people who live in Scottsdale.  Anyhow, my wife works there, so it must be cool!  By the way, the opening for "The Border Film Project" is this Friday 10/13, you should all go, there will be booze!
