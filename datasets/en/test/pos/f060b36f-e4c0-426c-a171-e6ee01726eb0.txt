First of all, I consider myself to be a donut aficianado, and would consider Dunkin Donuts chocolate glazed to be the penultimate donut around.

With that being said, I still give Rainbow donuts 5 stars because the donuts, including the chocolate glazed, are fantastic and fresh.  They have an extensive selection and are sure to make everyone in your sugar-crazed party happy.

Perfect for the after church crowd, and us sinners alike, Rainbow Donuts makes the best donuts in the valley!
