In my athletic career I've had the opportunity to work with Olympic Trainers and Nutritionists......they have nothing on Robert at Spartan Training!  He has mastery knowledge in all aspects of fitness and nutrition.  He and his wife Vicki take the time to explain what's actually happening in your body during exercise and how nutrition plays it's role.  I have personally never seen the results I've had with Robert this quickly.  Its been a long time since I've felt this good! As a Paralympic Gold medalist, I highly recommend Spartan Training!

Thank you Robert and the rest of the Spartan Training team for all your efforts!
