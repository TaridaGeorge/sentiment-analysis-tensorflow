I've only been once. I had the Veggie Delight with fried rice, which was $1.50 extra. But there was plenty for two meals. I really liked the addition of fruit - a couple of grapes, a slice of strawberry, an apple chunk - in my veggies. It added a pleasant amount of sweetness but not enough to detract from the veggies and rice. 

Overall, the dish tasted clean, light, and delicious. I'll definitely go again.
