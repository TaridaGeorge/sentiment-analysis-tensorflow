Oh YAY, a yummy sammy in AZ!  Went here last week and got the Gobbler sandwich on wheat with chipotle coleslaw.  YUMMMMM.

The bread was perfectly toasty in a not-ripping-the-roof-of-my-mouth kind of way, and the inside of the sandwich was tasty, with perfect portions of each piece.  The coleslaw was tasty, and had just the right amount of dressing on it.

I feel like I MUST go to Dilly's each time I go to AZ now....
