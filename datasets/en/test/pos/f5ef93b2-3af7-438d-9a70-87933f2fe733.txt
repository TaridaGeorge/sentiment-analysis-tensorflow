Best apartments I have ever lived in! The apartments are in great shape, inside and out... Everything is relatively new from the kitchen appliances, laundry room and fixtures... It all has a modern look that is clean and sophisticated. Tons of grass for my dog to run around in as well as a pools and a sand volleyball court that's relatively close to all the apartments.

As for the tenants, everyone for the most part appears presentable and keeps up with the look of the complex. Driving through the parking lot all the vehicles are well kept and look nice. There's dog poop stations everywhere and people actually use them, it's great!

Definitely the place to live if your looking for a new home.
