Yes yes, they have good drinks blah blahhhhh the interior is cool... blah blahhhhhhhh.... THE FOOD!

OH THE FOOD!!

I had just stopped crying over the close of Autostrada when I found this place.

The food is FANTASTIC!
And I think we were the only people eating while we were there, which to me seems like a horrific disgrace.

We tried almost everything on the small menu, and I'm drooling thinking of the deliciousness of everything we ate.

DELICIOUS!
