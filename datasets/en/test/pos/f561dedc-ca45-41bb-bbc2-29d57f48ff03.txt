I love everything they serve at Japan Express. 
One large chicken teriyaki and a roll of sushi can feed my family of 5.  Chris, the owner is super cool, and always lets my kids watch him make our rolls.  I can not say enough great things about this place.  I highly recommend to anyone who wants inexpensive but not lacking on quality or taste.
My children want them to bottle up the teriyaki sauce so we can have it at home.
