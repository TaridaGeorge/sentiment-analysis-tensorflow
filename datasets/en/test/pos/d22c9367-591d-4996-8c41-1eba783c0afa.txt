You cannot beat the atmosphere nor the fine beer at this place. OK, the food is not exactly 5 star, but what would you expect at a brewery? There are food choices that shine (e.g., the Salmon BLT sandwich). And they have a good kids menu. And did I mention the beer? The only complaint I have: they have not had a cask-conditioned beer on a couple of visits. OK, I'm definitely down in the weeds looking for negatives. Go enjoy yourself.
