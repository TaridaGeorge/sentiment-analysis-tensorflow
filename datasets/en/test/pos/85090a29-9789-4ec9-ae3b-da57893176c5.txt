The staff here is wonderful! I would recommend to anyone that has to take their loved one in for any procedure.  First of all, when we arrived and left, there is staff outside waiting to help either by transporting with a golf cart or just helping you get out or into the car. Then we went to the floor where my dad was getting his procedure done. There was a tech there that called my dad back. She was SO hilarious. She started by sayting "ok the next contestant"  When something so serious is being done and you have someone like that who is making the mood alot less stressful..well I give thumbs up to that!  It made me and my dad feel alot more easier about the whole situation. Thank you Boswell!
