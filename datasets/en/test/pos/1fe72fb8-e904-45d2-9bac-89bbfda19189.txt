The very knowledgeable staff at Nature's Health Shop can help you find any kind of vitamin, herb, or health product you are looking for. They will probably help you find something you didn't even know you were looking for!

They have a large inventory, but will order whatever they don't have. The store is clean and well-organized -- a must, as it is also very tiny.
