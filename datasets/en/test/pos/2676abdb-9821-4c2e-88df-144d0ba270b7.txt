Still consistently our favorite pizza place, and it's right down the road from where we live and work, so that makes us really happy!  Also really appreciate the variety of wines and changing wine list to be able to try lots of different ones. Food is always good and the people who work there are always friendly and nice. Our favorite neighborhood restaurant by far.
