This place rocks!!! I had super fun trying all the different kinds of peanut butter and I finally came to decision to order the YUMMER NUMMER!!! I loved it so much I brought home a jar of Raspberry White Chocolate. I think I made myself a YUMMER NUMMER everyday the week I got back from Arizona. 

If you cannot make a trip to Arizona, you should definitely order from their website. I know I will.
