As I was checking in, I heard someone else ask how much a room was? They answered $419 a night. Not for me, I was comped by the scottsdale culinary festival.  Do you enjoy a facility more on someone else's dime?   This is a nice benefit of dating me ladies, I get invited to events and they pay for it.  Sweet!  This is one of the few times, I was impressed. To bad, I am not a golfer, your first view is of the beautiful golf course. Okay, the hotel still made plenty on me. I think I had everything except the soda in the liquor cabinet. I also had all the food except for a few candy bars.  Yeah, the pool is great if I were the type to sit around at a pool.
