They advertise a $15.95 oil change, 32 point inspection and tire rotation on their sign, so when my partner was out of town, I took her Pontiac Vibe in for a little love.

Even though I was a walk in, they still got it taken care of in about half an hour. They were efficient, friendly, did a good job with the car, and I'd definitely go back. With disposal fees and tax, it came to a little over $20, but for all that I got, you just can't beat the price.

However, the waiting area could use some love. Luckily, I live nearby, and just walked home to wait.
