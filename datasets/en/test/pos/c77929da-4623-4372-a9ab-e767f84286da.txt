What a great place!  Came in before a wedding while the baby was sleeping...wasn't sure I'd have time to get both my nails and toes done before the dredded awakening!  They were nice enough to do both at the same time.  And when the baby woke up the girl doing my nails rushed so that I could hold him.  Since my hands were occupied she gave me a shoulder rub instead of a hand massage.  They did a great job and the service was excellent.  Glad to make it a regular spot.
