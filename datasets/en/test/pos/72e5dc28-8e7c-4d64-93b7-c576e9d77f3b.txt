I'm not gonna lie, but this is seriously one of Phoenix's best kept secrets. I'm Native American so I grew up on frybread and I was floored when I found out a whole restaurant was devoted to celebrating it. Also, it's Tohono O'odham owned and operated so that gets huge points in my book. I really don't think I could stand the idea of a "fry bread house" being run by anyone but Natives. The beef stew and hominy are choice, and all come with fry bread. This place may very well be a future heart attack coming on, but I'll die with a smile on my face.
