Been eating here for years.      Haven't been here nearly as often as I would like to have been in the past few months but this place is still churning out great quality burgers.   Very basic, to-the-point menu, burgers, hot-dogs, fries and shakes.         For what they offer, they do very well.     The best out of all the Lenny's that I have been to, definitely the most consistent as well, I'd recommend this to anyone with a craving for a hot, juicy burger.
