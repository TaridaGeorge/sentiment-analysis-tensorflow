It's been nearly a year and a half since an Update from here for Los Reyes, so I'd just like to report that this place is still terrific!  Stopped in for lunch today with Scott W. & Robyn N., & ordered a tasty 99 cent Shrimp Ceviche Tostada for an appetizer, followed by a Carne Asada Torta Norte√±a with salad for the included side ($7.75).

It was GREAT, GREAT, GREAT!!!     :-))
