If you are a mixed media artist don't let the word stamper in the store name keep you away from Frenzy Stamper!  I love, love, love this store!  Not only does it have all the greatest paper art crafting lines, it offers great swaps, and attracts local artists as well as big names to teach classes!

Debby the store owner is friendly and helpful.  If you've not been to check out Frenzy you need to go NOW!  You won't be sorry.
