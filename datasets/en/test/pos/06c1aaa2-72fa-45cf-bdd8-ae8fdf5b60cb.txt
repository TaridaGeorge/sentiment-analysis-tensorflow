If I had to choose one food genre it would be asian and if I had to choose one chinese restaurant that is affordable, friendly, consistent, healthy and all around enjoyable, it would be Banana Leaf. They deliver, which is fantastic, but my husband and I LOVE eating in. The staff is amazingly friendly, the food is always fresh, fast and delicious and the ambience is interesting, but always pleasant and usually quiet. Far above a dive, but not a smidge of pretention, we love it there. We always get the crab puffs and then have 5-8 favorite menu items to rotate between.
