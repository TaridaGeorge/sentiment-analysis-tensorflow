Kelly did an amazing job on the cupcakes we ordered for my Dad's birthday party.  She was extremely responsive and helpful regarding flavor suggestions - we got an assortment of chocolate, chocolate brownie, red velvet and lemon.  She decorated some of the cupcakes to go with our golf theme from a picture we sent her from Pinterest, and everyone just loved them.  The cupcakes were a huge hit and disappeared very quickly, much more so than the main course!

I would definitely recommend Butter & Me for any event.  The cupcakes were delicious and Kelly is just great to work with.  She even delivered the cupcakes to our venue, which was extremely helpful.
