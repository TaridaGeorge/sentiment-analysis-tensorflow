One of our favorite restaurants in the Phoenix area. The chef is originally from new York and you can see her cooking live in the open half kitchen as you walk in. Small venue with exceptional service and the menu changes as items go in and out of season locally. Extremely knowledgable staff that can cater to foodies and novices alike. If your in the mood for wine check out their selection of Arizona wines. Stronghold is a go to for the wine list. The broccoli is not to be missed.
