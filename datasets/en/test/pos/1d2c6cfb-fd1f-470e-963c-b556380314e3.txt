Love, Love, Love this Wine bar. It's owned by the nicest couple Nancy and Bryan. We recently got turned onto it by a couple of friends and can't wait to go back every weekend. The atmosphere is very laid back and the decor is awesome with the climbing wine bottles on the wall. They have a great happy hour as well as a fabulous cheese platter that is delish! We were pleasantly surprised by what a great selection of wine they had, we have a couple of labels that we always have a hard time trying to find but they undoubtedly had them (such as Cakebread and Pride) YUM-O! So if your in the mood for a little wine and a great place to enjoy it go to Brix, you won't regret it!
