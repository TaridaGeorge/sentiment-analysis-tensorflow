I love this place! I have been twice now and plan on going as often as possible. Make sure you order the beet appetizer. It is a wonderful assortment of different types of beets, mixed with cheese, and is incredibly delicious especially the crusty corners. Also, go on Sundays when local wines are half-off. What an amazing deal! Can't wait to go back. It is definitely one of those kind of places where one could easily become a regular.
