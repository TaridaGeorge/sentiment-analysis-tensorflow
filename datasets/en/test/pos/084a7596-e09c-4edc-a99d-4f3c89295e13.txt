Blue Nile offers something for everyone. They offer Raw foods during Mondays while the entire week they offer dishes for Vegan, Vegetarian, and Carnivores. The staff is very friendly, but some days the service can be a little slow which is quickly forgotten once you have your food in front of you. Their house ice tea is delicious with all its spices (reminds me of chai tea). As a omnivore, I always find myself ordering and devouring the Strictly Vegan Combo. The shuro watt (chickpeas), kik alitcha (yellow split peas), and inguday (mushrooms) are a must try. I love Ethiopian food and eating with my hands...the restaurant is heaven!
