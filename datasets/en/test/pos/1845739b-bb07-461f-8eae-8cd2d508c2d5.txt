Been in Phoenix a few months now after moving from Buffalo, NY this past October. I finally made it to a Coyotes vs Buffalo game a couple weekends ago was an awesome time. The Jobing Arena and West World in general is such a clean and impressive little hang out spot. Our HSBC arena is much older than this very modern & CLEAN Coyotes home facility. Easy to get to no matter where you're coming from, enough parking for the whole city (compared to downtown Buffalo!) and great rink. Hope to catch some future games. Oh yea, and Buffalo rocked the Coyotes that night. Buffalo will probably never win the SuperBowl or Stanley Cup but we have the most die hard fans on the planet. : )
