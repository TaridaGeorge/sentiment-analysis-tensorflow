I love pita pit and was sooooo excited when I spotted this while having drinks at Barney's right next door. My eyes lit up when I saw the Pita Pit sign as I yelled "PITTAAAA PIT!! WE'RE GOING THERE AFTER!!" I ordered the BLT and of course, was extremely satisfied with my choice. They're open 24 hrs with the option of delivery! Does it get any better than that? But while munching on my delicious pita I realized that I would shortly be returning to orange county, Ca where Pita Pit does not exist.. I was moping and texting my boyfriend about how I wish we had one when he responded with "there's one in newport, we'll go when you get back on sunday." Just imagine how ecstatic I was to receive such life-changing news!
