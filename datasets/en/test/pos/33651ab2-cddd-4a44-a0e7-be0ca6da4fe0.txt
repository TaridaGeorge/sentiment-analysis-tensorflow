I am faithful and loyal. Simply give me personal service and a good deal, and I am yours forever.

The fact that someone answers the phone when you call is a gift in itself. Airline travel is never going to be perfect or seamless, but I am inspired by this company who keeps a friendly attitude for the most part and a good sense of humor. 

I do get a good laugh out of the A/B/C lines and people camping out to make sure they get on first. I was thrilled to hear about the change in boarding and that now, people with kids have to actually suffer with the rest of us.

Now if only JetBlue would make a direct flight to the Bay... there would be a strong competitor for my cheap ass!
