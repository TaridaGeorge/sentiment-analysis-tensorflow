I'm a Chicago North Sider so I was not familiar with Al's from back in my Chicago days.  I have always been a huge fan of Portillos however I had to give Al's a shot.  HAPPY DAY!  Had a beef, dipped, sweet and an order of Cheese fries.  It was the best beef I have had in years.  Hot, juicy and just enough spice to give it a kick without going over the top.  Needless to say I will be back to Al's on a regular basis.
