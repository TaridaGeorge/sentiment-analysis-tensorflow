Saturday is often "fresh day," when you can get pork literally straight off the hog! 4 lbs of boneless shoulder? No problem. 1.25" pork chops? Coming up. The Meat Shop has the freshest, least expensive pork in the Valley, and you should definitely shop there. They're getting the grass-fed beef figured out; bear with them while they iron out the order schedule for beef.

On my last visit, for $24, I got:
1.5 lbs breakfast sausage
4 lbs boneless pork should
Full rack of ribs
