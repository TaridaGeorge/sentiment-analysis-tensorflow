This coffee house ROCKS! The staff is incredibly kind, the fresh baked goods are fantastic, and the coffee... Well it's incredible.  They use a french press to prepare coffee and it makes for an incredible brew!  The atmosphere is great with awesome music!!!!  In general, this place is a definite two thumbs up! You won't be disappointed!
