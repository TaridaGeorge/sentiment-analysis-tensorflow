if i need a small, fantastic gift or card for someone, Frances is where I go. pretty much every time.  

sure, i'm going to pay little more for whatever i purchase. this isn't walmart folks.   i know that whatever i find is going to be unique and special and have a certain sense of style.

yes, i too have experienced sub-par customer service.  i've waited 20 minutes to pay once.  that was annoying.  the look on the face of the person who opened their gift from Frances made it worth it.  

there's room for improvement, but the charm of the store and its contents earn 5 stars in my book.
