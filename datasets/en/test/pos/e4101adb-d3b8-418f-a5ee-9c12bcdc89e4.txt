The service department is FABULOUS! I stopped by with my 2004 Santa FE (out of warranty for the issue I had even though I only have 38,000 miles). I spoke with the service manager and he had the service department order the parts of concern and had them installed at no cost as a goodwill gesture. They estimated the repair would take 2 hours, but it was ready in just 1 hour. The employees were soooooo nice and they even had coffee and bagels while I waited. The waiting area had been remodeled since my last visit and is very comfortable and well laid out. 
Bonus: They even washed my vehicle. I highly recommend this service department!
