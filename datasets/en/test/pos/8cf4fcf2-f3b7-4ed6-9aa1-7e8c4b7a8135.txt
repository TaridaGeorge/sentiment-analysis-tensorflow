Had issues with my roller ball on my blackberry.  I took it in to this Sprint and they were able to fix it in just a few minutes!  This is one of the only repair places for Sprint that ACTUALLY repairs the phones...not just box and ship them somewhere else.

We plan on moving out of Chandler, but I *WILL* make the trip for any of my cell phone needs to this Sprint!
