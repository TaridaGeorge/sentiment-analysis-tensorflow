Love this place.  Miss the food terribly!  I moved to CA back in 2008 and have not found a Mongolian BBQ place that is anywhere near as good as YC's.  It is always a must when we are back in AZ for visits.  Now as we are getting ready to move back to AZ this is one of the many things I am looking forward.  I can't wait to eat there again!
