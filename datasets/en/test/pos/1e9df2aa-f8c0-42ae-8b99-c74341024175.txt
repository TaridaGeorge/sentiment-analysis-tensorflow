I'm a born and raised New Yorker living in the desert.. I laughed when people said there was a good bagel place in AZ and I was right. Then I was told there was a NY Cheesecake as good as Juniors (Brooklyn, NY).. I laughed again, then I tried it. The owner (Nick) was friendly, helpful and enthusiastic about his cakes as only someone with real passion can be. When he suggested a variety of great sounding flavors I passed and went straight to the "Classic", the real test. denser than Juniors and as delicious as any I have ever had in NYC. Well done. I'll be back!

Now, if he could only craft a decent bagel........
