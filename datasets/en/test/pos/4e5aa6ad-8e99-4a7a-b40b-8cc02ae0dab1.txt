Pizzeria Bianco: The Aftermath
A (very) short screenplay

Setting: A darkened hotel room in Glendale.  Moonlight streams through the window; the air is thick with the stench of deception.  A text message conversation takes place...

Girl:  Would you be terribly upset if I left you for a pizza?

Guy:  I'm honored I'm still in the running.

Girl:  The salami on the Sonny Boy almost had my heart... almost.

Guy:  So Sonny is his name?
