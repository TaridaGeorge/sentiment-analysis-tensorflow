Well, I'm not from Tempe or the Desert or Buffalo at all and I LOVE TED'S! I've lived and traveled all across our country, Canada and Mexico and the dog's at Ted's are about the best. Coming a close 2nd is the Texas Hot Lunch in Hanover, Pennsyltucky near Gettysburg. Cooked over a flame right in front of you, I usually get a All Beef  (or 2) with chili & cheese and crispy fries made the same way. Their chili is so tasty, it makes you want to send to a chemist to get the recipe. The rush's run at different times, too, so be prepared to wait for your dog, it's worth it. Oh, and as mentioned, bring cash, although there is a Bank of America ATM in the same parking lot.
