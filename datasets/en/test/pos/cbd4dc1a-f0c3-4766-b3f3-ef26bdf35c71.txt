If your looking for a best breakfast spot close to the ASU campus, look no further than Harlow's Cafe.  Now if your a regular for more than a week you might gain about 30 pounds and get diabetes.  

They give a full meal at a reasonable price for breakfast food.  The waitresses are top notch, good looking, and the services is great. If you go in the morning after a night of partying you will be so happy you did not go to ihop.  

After your done eating plan on having about a 3 hour nap afterwards.

When you are eating it kind of feels like you are in a basement of someone's 50's styled house.  I would get a booth, you always want a booth if possible, It's not breakfast or lunch unless your in a booth.

Recommendation: Good for groups of 4-6 and a greasy delicious breakfast.
