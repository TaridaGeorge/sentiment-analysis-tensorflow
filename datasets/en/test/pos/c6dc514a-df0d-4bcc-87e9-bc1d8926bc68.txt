My wife and I just ate here for the second time last week.  We were on a short vacation from the east coast.  We had loved this restaurant the first time and have been talking about the chocolate cake dessert for the previous two years.  Well the second time around was as good if not better.  Wonderful margarita cocktail, steak, fish, sides and of course dessert - chocolate cake and the butter cake.  We were enjoying the leftovers for a couple of days.  Will definitely come back here next time we are in Scottsdale.  Many good restaurants in the Kierland area.
