We love this place! The meals are always consistent and yummy. We love the meatball dish as an appetizer. I am a sauce snob and let me tell you, this sauce makes me write home to Mama about it! The calazones and pizzas are fantastic. The crust is perfect, chewy and crispy right where it counts. Our favorite pizza is the vegetarian with chicken and kalamata olives. My mouth is watering and I'm trying to give my hubby to call in an order while I type. On top of it, the owner, wait staff and crew are incredibly nice. We take our two year old in with us and they are very nice to her! 

Try the tiramisu for dessert.  You will write gran-mama home about that one!  Yum.
