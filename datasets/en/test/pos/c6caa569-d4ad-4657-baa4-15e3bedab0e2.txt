Truly as good as it gets when it comes to jewelry!  From trading in your old stuff to custom pieces (and everything in between), Rusty and his no-pressure staff will go the extra mile to make sure you are getting exactly what you need.  I have been working with them on all my jewelry needs (a few trades, a custom piece), for a couple of years now, and they are always consistent in their service and products.  This review is way past due!  I hope everyone reads it and checks them out!
