Like the other reviewers said, the produce is very cheap and of good quality.  They offer a growing selection of organic produce also, as well as other organic offerings.  They have a self serve spice area where you can buy as much or as little as you want, so it is great if a recipe calls for something  you don't normally use so you won't buy a lot and waste it.  The trail mixes in the bulk food area are tasty and the beer and wine is reasonably priced.  

The best thing is if you shop on Wednesdays, it is double ad day so you get the sales for the current week and the previous week.
