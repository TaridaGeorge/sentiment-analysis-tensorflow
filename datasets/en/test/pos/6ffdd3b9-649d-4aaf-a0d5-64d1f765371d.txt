I went to Casey for my first time to get eyelash extensions for my big brother's wedding. She had a yelp deal and her communication with me was great! I knew I found the right fit. I told myself I would only get them for the wedding, but now I am obsessed! 

I have been to Casey a total of 4 times now and my favorite part about her is that she has changed it up for me multiple times. I did not want anything dramatic until I was going to a trip to Vegas and for another wedding, and she was able to go as short and minimalist as I wanted. I love that I can tell her how dramatic I want and she gets it and offers a wide-variety of options.
