I have eaten here dozens of times. Only once was the food ever bad and they made it right in a hurry. Service is always excellent and this is really the only place I go for Italian food. I've eaten at a few of the other locations but this one is my favorite. I generally don't review big chains, but I'm happy to make an exception for Carrabbas.
