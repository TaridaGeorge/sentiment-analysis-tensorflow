I have been coming to this restaurant for years!                                                I have never been disappointed. The wait staff has been the same for quite some time and people usually stay working there for a long time. This is normally a good sign. Always busy another good sign. They give you full carafes of coffee and decaf.   Lots of safe parking in the lot.... The best part                      ( THE FOOD) if you can't find something that you like here, you never will. They have wonderful jam and fantastic potatoes. Plus they have punch cards so every time you come in you get a stamp. I have always loved that idea. Five stamps gets you a free meal!
