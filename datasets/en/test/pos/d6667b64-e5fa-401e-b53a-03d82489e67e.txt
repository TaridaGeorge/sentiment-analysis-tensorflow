Great food at a great price!!!! Ingredients are always fresh and delicious! Happy hour it a good deal with half price appetizers! The spinach dip is to die for! Superbly executed with brick oven pizza bakers tossing you pizza right behind the bar. Fun for a date or a group! Private parties would be ideal here!
