My husband and I recently attended the Balanchine Classics Performance. We thoroughly enjoyed it and loved our 6th row seats at the Phoenix Symphony Hall....just the right distance from the stage.

The orchestra.....Phoenix Symphony Orchestra.....were just wonderful and the dancers were amazing! We will definitely be attending future performances featuring Ballet Arizona.

We also could not pass up buying the Angelina Ballerina book and doll at the gift store for our future little Ballerina.
