Best, best, best !!!! Tina and her husband are excellent. Fast, efficient and fair price. Huge selection of nail designs, but also simple active length French manicures. My manicures and pedicures last forever. My husband asked if they use airplane paint (joking) because the color is so glossy and lasts so long. I have been going now for almost 2 years and have been very happy every time. Final word, kudos to Tina. I have never known her to be anything but absolutely sweet. She is a real pro.
