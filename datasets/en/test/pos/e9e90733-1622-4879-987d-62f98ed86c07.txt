I am really surprised that this place has received such awful reviews..maybe Im just getting the right things? ill be honest Ive never had an entree, only appetizers(ex. dbl stugged potato spring roll and philly cheesesteak roll) and dessert (ex.banana choc chip bread pudding) and nothing has ever been mediocre. Nothing but tasty morsels. I will tell you that I HATE their sister Cheesecake Factory, their food has no flavor (worst Sheppards Pie ever!) and it's consistently awful. I call it "retirement food"..That's why i was so surprised by Grand Lux. Until I have a bad meal by review stands..they've been consistently excellent at least 3 times, for me at least.
