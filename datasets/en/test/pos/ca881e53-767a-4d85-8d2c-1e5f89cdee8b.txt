Dairy Queen = nostalgic yum for me.  This location has a drive-thru, which makes it easily accessible nostalgic yum so it's even better than some!  I've actually never been inside.  

So, why 5 stars?  They have the star pops when some others don't!!! Ye-ah!  Also, their pecan caramel chocolate thingy is Packed with pecans.  

See ya there!
