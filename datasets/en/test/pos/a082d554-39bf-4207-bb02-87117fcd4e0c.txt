I really can not wait to spend a couple of hours going though the amazing clothing collection at Sunset Clothing Exchange.  I was there for a short amount of time during my first visit and my eyes were shooting around the store at all of the adorable clothing.  I didn't have a chance to take a good look at the collection of dresses but I definitely liked what I saw.  I did look though much of their tshirt and other blouses and ended up with a really cute black top to add to my collection.  They also had some great shoes and super cute jewelry.  It is on the expensive side, but if you really love it, you will surely be getting what you pay for!
