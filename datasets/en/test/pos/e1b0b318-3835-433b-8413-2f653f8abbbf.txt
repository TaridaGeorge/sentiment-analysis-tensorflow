Extremely good value for your "Hawaiian Style" appetite.  They serve good quality food and really "healthy" portions.  I love the saimin (flown in from Hawaii), bulkogi beef and chicken katsu, oh, and the manapua (YUMMM!).  They're family owned and operated since around 1985(?)  It's truly a plate lunch paradise in the desert land.
