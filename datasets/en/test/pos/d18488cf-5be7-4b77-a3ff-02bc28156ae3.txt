I LOVE THIS PLACE, I usually will order the Pot Stickers (awesome), House Won Ton Soup, Beef Chow Fun w/ Egg sauce spicy, Mongollian Beef, and their version of the Generals Chicken.  The menu is huge and its fun to try something new each time.  The Chicken Chow Mein tastes like everyone elses so I dont order it here.
