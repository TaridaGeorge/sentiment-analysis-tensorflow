This place was amazing! I have been to Soi 4 in Oakland, CA (the original Soi 4) and the Scottsdale version is just as impressive. Eye catching decor, pleasant wait staff, mouth watering food...it had all the right stuff. You have to try the Kanom Pak Gard (Turnip Cakes), Roti (Grilled Indian Bread), and Kloie Tod w/ coconut ice cream (Fried Bananas). I was here for dinner last Saturday evening with a very large party and the waitstaff and management were very accommodating. It is a must try for the residents of Scottsdale!!
