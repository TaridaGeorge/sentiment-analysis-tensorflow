I can't begin to tell you how fabulous this museum is. I went on a friend's recommendation, and was blown away by the organization and thoroughness of the displays.

The upstairs level is organized by continent, and each country has its own display of instruments from their region. Most also have a video screen, and as you approach the display, your headset automatically begins to play music from the country. Walk to the next display, and your headset plays the next country's music.

Downstairs there is a room that features many important musicians from past and present. Another room gives you the opportunity to try multiple unique instruments.

This is a fabulous place to take your older children, probably about 2nd-3rd grade is the youngest I would take. There is so much to see, it may take you two visits to see everything!
