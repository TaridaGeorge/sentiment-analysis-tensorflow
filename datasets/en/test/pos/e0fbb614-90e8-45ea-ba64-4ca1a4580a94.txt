I could hang out here all day! Always lots to explore, good stock to peruse, and a happy, friendly staff that deserves special mention. It's no secret that this little place is a gold mine - well done to all who are responsible!
Perks: Great selection of new & used books. Lots of other merchandise for many occasions, (Father's Day, Birthday's, etc.) Very knowledgeable staff who never hesitate to help under regular conditions or when face with a challenge!

Thanks, Changing Hands, and cheers to the independent book sellers of the world!
