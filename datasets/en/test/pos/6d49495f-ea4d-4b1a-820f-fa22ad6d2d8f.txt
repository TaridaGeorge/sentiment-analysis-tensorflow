WOW! My fiancé and I ate here last night and it was amazing!

Atmosphere: Very homey Italian feel when you walk in the door.

Service: Waiter was the best I have had in a long time...very knowledgeable of the menu. 

Food: The wine list is probably the best in the west valley especially if you enjoy Chiantis, I had the veal Oscar and my fiancé had the shrimp Bella Luna.  Both were spectacular! 

It was such a great evening, we will definitely be back!!
