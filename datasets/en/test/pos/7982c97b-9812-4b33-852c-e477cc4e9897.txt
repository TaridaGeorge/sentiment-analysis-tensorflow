I've been going to Shangri-La for over fifteen years, and can't believe it has such a bad rating!  I've had Chinese food in New York City, and California.  I truly believe Shangri-La is some of the best Chinese I've ever had.  Their hot and sour soup is delicious, and so is everything else I've ever tried on the menu.  I'm really picky, and believe me I don't just give good reviews away.  Please don't listen to bad reviews about this place, decide for yourself.  If you like Chinese food, then you have to at least try Shangri-La in Chandler.
