There on a SUNDAY-  all day happy hour.  happy hour prices great!  food awesome!  had BIG ASS burger- we shared a side of the famous mac&cheese (think its chipolte chile mac and cheese) normally never order it , but it was excellent-  everyone at the table loved the food.   busy but managed to get a patio seat- by luck im sure-  had my 7 and 10 year old boys with me-  they were fine and my 7 year old was able to order off the kids menu--which is not in print-  but they do have the basics, kraft mac& cheese, chicken strips, burger.
