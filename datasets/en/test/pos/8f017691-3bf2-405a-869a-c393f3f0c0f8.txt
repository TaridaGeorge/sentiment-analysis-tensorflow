I gave La Promesa bakery a try today.  They're one of the few Mexican bakeries doing it right.   As they do this day in and day out it is equal or better than homemade.  I love to bake and it would be difficult for me to duplicate their pastries.  I tried the pineapple empanada, the pastry was light, supple and fresh with an excellent taste.  The filling they used was high  quality.   Do a taste comparison of pastries to any of the larger mexican supermarkets in the valley, you'll taste the difference.  The store owner was friendly, the establishment was clean.  I know where I am stopping after my Saturday Piestewa Peak hikes to replenish all those calories lost :)
