Lamar's has just surpassed Rainbow Donuts on Cave Creek Rd. as the best donuts I've had in Phoenix. All the donuts are fresh and there are many varieties. Many are freaking gigantic, but they do have normal sized-donuts, too! Their coffee is pretty good for this kind of restaurant. Reminded me of the standard Starbuck's offering. I'd get it again, but wouldn't go there JUST for the coffee. Clean, cute store and friendly, helpful staff makes this a good bet for brekky sweets!
