I Love 5 & Diner, and this is by fart my favorite location. It's very clean, and the staff is always very nice. No one can beat the Oreo Milkshake, it's a must have!! My mom loves liver and onions, and while I myself don't have an appetite for them, she loves them here and prefers them over other restaurants.
