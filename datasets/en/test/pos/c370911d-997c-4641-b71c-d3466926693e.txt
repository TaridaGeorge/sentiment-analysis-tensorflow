Dave's rules! I have been enjoying these gourmet dogs since Dave opened his first dog house (2005?), in the now torn down east-most Arches. I always go for the Chili Dog, but have also tried the Boston Dog which the wife likes. The buns are buttered and then grilled, and even a simple side of fries are always fried just right. This is just a great place worth driving across town for. I am lucky though, as it's only a few blocks from me. Come enjoy!
