Unfortunately, after living near the canal for 5 years, I haven't seen a dead body.  Seriously, it's my dream to find one.  I can see the TV crews and cameras now...
The Grand Canal is now paved from 7th Avenue East.  I rode it with Robert M and Bacon all the way down to McDowell, and the paving continued.  No traffic to deal with, except for when crossing streets.  
We saw some cool pottery, super-sized, as decor.  There are also several little parks in CenPho along the canal.
I've read/heard that the city is actually going to start utilizing the canal as more of a park.  They'll be putting up more lighting and trees and little shops along the way.  I can't wait for that part!  
I still need to see a floater, though.
