The sushi happy hour here is amazing. The service is just alright, but the happy hour sushi is very fresh and there is tons to choose from on the happy hour menu. I love this place for happy hour. The place is open, airy and very clean. Next to Stingray sushi this is the best place in downtown Scottsdale to come for sushi happy hour.
