The FOODwas good! My friends ordered the Filet Mignon with median rare and Lamb Chop; they were awesome! Their homemade pasta special was impressive as well. We also had a bottle of white wine that the waiter introduced to us. The wine was very good just that i can't remember the name of it :P
Also, we celebrated for one of the friends' birthday today! The restaurant was really thoughtful that they personalized our dessert for our birthday girl:)
Wonderful SERVICE! Other than the delicious food and birthday cake, I love the service that Marcellino Ristoante had! Their waiter was really professional when introducing the food and recommending the wine. The AMBIANCE was really good for special occasion like birthday, anniversary or date =)
