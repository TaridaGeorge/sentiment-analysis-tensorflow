What a great place!! I was having muffler and exhaust problems (my civic sounded like a chopper), so I took it to a large chain auto shop, they said they didn't wanna risk touching my car, since they don't specialize in mufflers. They recommended mighty muf'ler. After a day @ their shop I get a call saying my car is ready. I'm expecting to pay upwards of $500, but the man at the shop said he didn't want me to pay for what I don't need, and that he would just patch up what needed patching. $25 later, my car sounds like new!! great place, and very friendly!!
