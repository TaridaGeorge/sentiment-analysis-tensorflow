They have PACZKI! Great place! I found this place on Fat Tuesday because I was looking for authentic Paczki's. As a Michigan transplant, celebrating Paczki Day was important? After asking around, all roads lead to Europa. 

I felt like I was back in Polish town in Hamtramck. Very authentic feeling Polish cafe which I believe is run by a Polish family. Sausage, baked goods, perogi's, and all the works. The Polish music was very cool as well!
