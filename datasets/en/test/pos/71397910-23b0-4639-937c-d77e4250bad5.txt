Lola, oh sweet Lola. I've spent many a days in there drinkin my coffee, doing stupid MBA homework and eating pastries. I dig this place because of the vibe and the view. Now I do want to bitch slap the hipster douchebags that I see there once in a while but hey, us military guys don't get down like that. I've always had good service, good coffee and a chill atmosphere to do homework in. Overall, cool little coffee shop. Welcome to cen-pho Lola, I'm sure I'll see ya again soon.
