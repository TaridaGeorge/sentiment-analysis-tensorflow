I have been using Tony for 4 years now.  He has helped me add plugs in unusual places so I could put accent lighting where I wanted.  Also he helped me add flood lights on all back 3 sides of my house and put a plug by each back door that lights them up together.  Really helped the feeling of security.  The list of things he did is too long to list here.  I give Tony my hightet unqualified recommendation!
