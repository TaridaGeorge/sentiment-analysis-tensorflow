I really love lifetime fitness. I have gone to my fair share of gyms. I wont lie, most of them ended up just randomly shutting down because they couldn't pay their bills! I am pretty cheap so I was leery about spending the money but my fiance assured me it was worth it. He was so right! I love this gym! I love the classes, they have like three spin classes a day which is nice. Everything is clean, everyone is so helpful and I never have to worry about it shutting down overnight.
