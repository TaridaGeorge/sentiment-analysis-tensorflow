We recently adopted a little Maltese/Terrier mix from a rescue and brought her here to get her all checked out. Dr. Temple, Diana, and Lisa were all wonderful. Clementine doesn't do too well with strangers right now and everyone was so patient and kind. Dr. Temple and Diana even sat down on the floor in the examination room to spend some time with her. Unfortunately, we had to put a little muzzle on her so that she could get her exam, but Dr. Temple and Diana brought her back into another room for a shot and a blood test and Clementine was brought back into the waiting area without her muzzle and wagging her tail.
