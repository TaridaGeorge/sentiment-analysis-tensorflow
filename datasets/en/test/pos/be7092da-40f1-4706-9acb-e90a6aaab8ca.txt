So much more than a gym!
When my sister or brother visits from NJ they are SO envious of my LTF membership!  "it's like a country club!" they say...
Anyway, I joined in 2005 when I was pregnant with my second child and I've been a happy customer ever since.
My kids (now 6 and 10) don't want to go to the Child Center anymore, but I can't complain--they went for 6 years and it gave mommy a much needed break several times a week!
Thank you Lifetime Fitness for a great facility.
