Hey fellow IPA beer lovers, The Herb Box serves an IPA!  Oh, and they have really good food, too.  I especially love the Brown Sugar & Jerk Pork Sliders to start.  Sometimes I eat them as my whole meal.

But this place doesn't just have a good menu, it's full of good people and a great vibe.  The best nights to go are when they have live music playing on the patio.  One of my favorite things to do in Arizona is eat outdoors during the fall and spring months, and this is one of my favorites places to do just that.
