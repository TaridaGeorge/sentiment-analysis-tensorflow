Everyone talks about the bruschetta and for good reason (so the 5th star is really for the bruschetta).  Good portion sizes and very delicious.  My friend and I ordered the tomato/basil/fresh mozzarella, salami and pesto, tomato jam and fresh sheep's milk cheese, and prosciutto with figs & mascarpone.  All very delicious!

We also ordered a vegetarian panini and a turkey one with romain salad.  We were so full after the bruschetta.  I managed to finish half of my sandwich and the salad.  The panini's are fine, not amazing, but yummy.  I think next time I'm in town I'll have the bruschetta and a salad. 

What's nice is they let my well-behaved dog join us on the patio.
