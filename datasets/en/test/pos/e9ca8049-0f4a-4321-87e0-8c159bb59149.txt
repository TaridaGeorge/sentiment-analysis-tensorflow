Great service, food & atmosphere; love the new location!!

We started out with the bread & cheese... so good, I love how the bread was grilled, one of my favorite ways to eat bread & the cheese was nice & tasty. 

For an entree my friend & I split the Fungi pizza, which was amazingly savory, oh so good! My husband had the salami panni which I stole a bite from & it was freakin' good! There french fries are smashed potatoes cover in graded parmesan, they were good but a bit too heavy for me, I am a skinny fry type of gal.

All & all a great lunch & I will definitively be coming back, maybe when we have visitors in town since the ambiance is so great!
