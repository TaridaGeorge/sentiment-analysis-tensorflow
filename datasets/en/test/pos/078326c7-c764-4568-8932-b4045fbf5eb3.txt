This place is just hands down exquisite! White Salmon!!!!!! Start to finish I can't say a bad thing about this place. The decor is impressive, and the drinks awesome. They have a $3600.00 Seafood Tower appetizer if you have that kinda cash. I gotta say though if they ever offer it to you as a special "White Salmon"...  Get it! It was like candy. Never had anything like it. UNREAL!!!!! Now I'm hungry....
