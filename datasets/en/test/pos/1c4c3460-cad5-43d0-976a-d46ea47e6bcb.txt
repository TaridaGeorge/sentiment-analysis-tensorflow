I have been going to Tish's studio for years now! When it comes to choosing a studio to practice at, the environment and the instructors are crucially important. Hegel Yoga provides an incredible atmosphere to practice yoga, and the variety of classes available leaves little to be desired!

Great energy, great instructors, great studio.
