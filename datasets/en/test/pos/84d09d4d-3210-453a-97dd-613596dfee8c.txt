I recently bought a library wall from Ladlows and I was extremely pleased with the quality and customer service. They  delivered it when they said they would and it looks great!  I am trying to furnish a room by the holidays and they carried all the items in their showroom.   I had liked  a library wall at Ethan Allen first, but they take 9 weeks for anything to be ordered! I was relived to find quality furniture that I didn't have to wait 9 weeks for.  I even asked them to remove something from the unit and they were very accommodating and didn't charge me for the labor. The gentleman who helped me was very friendly not stuffy in anyway.  I will definitely start here for future furniture purchases.
