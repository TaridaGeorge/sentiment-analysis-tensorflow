Raffail and his family are wonderful.

Been a long time customer since 2000.  They are always friendly.  I always have my hair cut by a member of Raffail's family.  But I know  a lot of people come in for a regular haircut from all of the barbers.

Very nice for Dad and son haircut photos, classic barber shop.
