This place is a must try. I came here based on yelp reviews and I was glad I did. Visited for dinner with a group of 8. Everything was awesome; the food, the service, and the restaurant was nice too. Outdoor fire place and open kitchen.

We ate: 
grits & schreiner's sausage trio (very filling)
mac 'n' cheese with pancetta: yum!
seared salmon: fresh and perfectly cooked
fire roasted green chile pork stew: comforting and delicious
short ribs: definitely fork tender
beef bourguignon shepherd's pie: really, really good!
pork osso buco confit: melt in your mouth kinda meat
chocolate dipped bacon s'mores: we still think about this dessert!!!
fig & pecan pie: not very sweet, it comes with a caramel ice-cream!!

Yum! Yum! Yum!
