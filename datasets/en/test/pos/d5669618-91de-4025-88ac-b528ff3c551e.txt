Just when I thought I would never find good sushi in AZ (and I have really, really tried) I walked into Hiro.  I heard the banter in between the sushi chefs in Japanese and knew I had found what I had been looking for.  Yes!  A REAL Japanese sushi restaurant.  I have been there three times now, and have loved every visit.  It is a place to eat and enjoy the food, not a strangely-lit cocktail lounge pretending to be a sushi bar.  The fish is fresh, the edamame is warm and salty, and the beer is cold.  What else can you ask for?  Thank you Hiro Sushi!
