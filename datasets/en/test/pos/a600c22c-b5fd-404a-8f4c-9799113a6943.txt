Holy cow. I'm a first timer here and I'm converted for LIFE!!

I got the "oatmeal our way" (organic quinoa, vanilla macaroon granola, seasonal fruit and choice of steamed milk). It was an enormous bowl of delicious and only $4.50!!!!!

The owner was the cashier and was so nice and friendly!!!!

LONG LIVE D'LISH!!!!!
