Came at the last minute for a lunch, party of 3.  Had one of the best burgers I've ever had.  I was happy for days after that one.  Cooked exactly as I ordered, medium rare, great bun, great steak fries.  This will be on my regular rotation for a good burger, though hopefully I can try things others have mentioned if I can be swayed away from the burger!
