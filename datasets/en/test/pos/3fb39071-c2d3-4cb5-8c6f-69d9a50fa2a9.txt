What a great theater! Clean. Good service. The best of the Harkin's Theaters! Any time I go to the movies, it's here.

Not only that, but my church is here: ELEVATION CHURCH - www.elevationchurch.tv - (not to be confused with Epicenter which also meets there). Every Sunday @ 9:45 AM - so... yeah, I know these theaters well. Spend more time in them between movie watching and church than I may in my own home. :)

Worth checking out!
