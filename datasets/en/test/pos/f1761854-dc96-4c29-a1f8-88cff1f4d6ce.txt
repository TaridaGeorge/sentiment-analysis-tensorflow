OMG I love Drift! I went here a whim the first time but now I always try to make it the pre-club stop when I'm in Old Town. I just really love the laid back vibe of the place and the drinks are fun. I have once carried out their giant clam shell drink onto the patio and sipped on it with six close friends. I would never do it again, but sometimes you just want to share a 36 dollar concoction. 

Come here if you actually want to talk to some of the people you decided to venture out into the night scene with.
