I've been getting my hair done for the past year with Jennifer...and trust her completely to have me look amazing every time I walk out of the salon.  I work as a spokesperson so whenever I have to travel out of town (which is very frequent), I go see her the day before and she takes great care in my color (which isn't easy as I went premature gray), cut (when needed) and my amazing blowout...which can last almost a week!!!!  My favorite part of visiting her salon is the "wash house" where I get to completely relax!  All the girls are terrific...have had Ciera do my hair if Jennifer couldn't fit me in...and she did a great job too!
