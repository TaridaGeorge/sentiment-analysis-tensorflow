I am very pleased to say that St. Pat's a lively, wonderful place of worship that we have frequented throughout the past ten years. We love Father Eric's leadership, passion, and vision for this community. He is always challenging the membership to exceed expectations in terms of hospitality and stewardship.

The variety of ministries available for parishioner participation are astounding; in particular, the quality of children's programs, especially the wonderful Vacation Bible School outreach, is SUPERB. The religious education teachers and administrators are incredibly kind, educated, and dedicated to their cause.

What speaks the most profoundly to me about this parish is that we are ALWAYS welcomed by the people of St. Patrick Catholic Community, not matter if we have been "naughty" Catholics, not attending Mass as much as we should...indeed, this place is spiritually vibrant and we are always blessed when we do attend.
