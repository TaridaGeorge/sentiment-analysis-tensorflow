It's hard to find Chinese Food that isn't covered in grease. When we moved to San Tan Valley, this was the first place we tried. We've since tried other Chinese restaurants in the area, and we love this one the most.

At China Chef, the food is consistently good, the menu has good variety, and the customer service is good. The portions are good too.
