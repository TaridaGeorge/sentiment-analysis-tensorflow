Paws down the best kennel I have boarded my dog at! I've left Max at various kennels while on vacation and he has never come home so happy as he did from the Foothill Per Resort. I could tell he was given a lot of attention and exercised enough since he wasn't out of control and needy when I picked him up.

Some of the other places I've taken him (ex: Canine Country Club near the airport) have been a terrible experience  for him  and he's come home a total wreck losing hair and seriously needy and anxious. Not this time! It's worth a few extra bucks a night to know he'll be as happy and loved and when he's at home.
