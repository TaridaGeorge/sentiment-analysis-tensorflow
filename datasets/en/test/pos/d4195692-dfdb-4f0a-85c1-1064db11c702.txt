This food really is fantastic. The specials are always delish. Their meatloaf is to die for. This is not your 'normal' meatloaf. It's always been perfectly cooked and seasoned, with a good amount of their gravy. 

Their mashed potatoes are of course very good. Always topped with onions and some paprika. Was their for lunch yesterday and the chef came out and gave is tasters of his Sorrel Soup. Wow! It was explosive with flavor! The Pork Ghoulash tastes just like my grandmothers, whose parents were immigrants from there. 

All in all its delicious, and they're extremely friendly. The wife is the waiter/hostess, husband is the cook, and they're both friendly, can't go wrong with this shin dig!
