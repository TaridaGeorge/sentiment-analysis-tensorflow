I absolutely adore Su Vino!  I've taken friends there a few times and everyone finds something they enjoy, whether your taste is white or red. The ambiance is lovely, the wine is great and the service is fantastic (friendly, attentive, patient & they make great recommendations)!  

Great place for a first date or just to meet up with the girls!
