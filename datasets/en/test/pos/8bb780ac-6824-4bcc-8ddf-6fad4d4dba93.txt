DAVE the bartender/server was amazing if you are lucky to have him serve or make drinks for you he is very funny  and helpful I did not know what to order and I asked him for help he asked what I was in the mood for he helped me choose the perfect dinner only downside is parking and their hot and sour soup but everything else was amazing
