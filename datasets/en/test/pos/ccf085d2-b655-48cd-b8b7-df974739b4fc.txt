Moving from San Francisco to Phoenix, I was getting pretty disappointed with the bar scene down here. Enter Camus, which I found some months ago. Really well-designed bar, great non-cheesy yet lively music, friendly bar staff, and great drinks. A cool hip scene, without being pretentious, which is difficult for any place to carry out well. 

I like that the bar is small and the hotel is kind of off on its own, so it doesn't attract too large of a crowd. I've had some of their bar appetizers which were delicious and will definitely be trying out the restaurant sometime down the road. I just hope this place never jumps the shark. I need joints like this to keep myself sane.
