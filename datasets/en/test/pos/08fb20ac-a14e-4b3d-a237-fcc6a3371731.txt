I loved this place. My husband and I shared the porterhouse which was perfectly prepared medium rare and split for us at no charge. We also splurged on the lobster mashed potatoes which, at $34, seemed over the top...and they were! We only wish the bread hadn't been so good so we could have eaten all of our meal and maybe shared a desert. Oh well, we will just have to go back.
