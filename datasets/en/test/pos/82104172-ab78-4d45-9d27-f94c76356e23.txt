These guys are great!!! 50 years in business....
Don't go to Tempe Bicycle unless you was sub-par service.

Ehrhardt's Schwinn bike shop helped me replacing my seat post and seat that got stolen and I had some questions about my bike which they gave me some tips and advice about. I will be going to these guys from now on...

Good people that you can talk to...I like that.
