We went to Orange table for breakfast. This place is wonderful the food is great and the service was top notch. It was a little hard to find not being from Scottsdale but the gps got us really close and then we just asked some nice ladies and the pointed us right to it. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and made great recommendations from the menu. The place was busy and our food was prepared quickly and our drinks never went empty.  We will definitely be going back again for breakfast next time we are in Scottsdale.
