I like to go here for special occasions with my honey.I LOVE THE PESTO WITH CREAM SAUCE TORTELLONI! It was the first thing I tried and now that's all I order. My honey gets the chicken diablo . Our Kids got the pizza but they thought it "tasted funny" - it did not taste like take out, they are kids, what do you want. So, we go there for an evening alone or with friends.
