This In and Out is right across from my hotel, the Aloft Tempe.  It is what a burger place should be, a bunch of young teenagers who take pride in their first jobs.  $2 for a great cheeseburger, $6 for a combo w great fries and a milk shake is worthy of a last meal.  The burgers put the high priced burgers in Manhattan NYC to shame---Ray's Hell Burger wannabes.  In and Out is a throwback to a time when fast food was about quality and affordability.  This place qualifies for Hall of Fame All Madden status.  I miss those days after swimming in a meet or playing in a basketball game where we would go out for burgers and shakes.  It doesn't get better than In and Out!  Arizona Baby!!
