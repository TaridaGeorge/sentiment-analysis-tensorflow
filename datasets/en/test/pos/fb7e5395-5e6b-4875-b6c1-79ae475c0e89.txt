I been to most of the breakfast places here in the downtown area and this is one of my favorites, not just because its in walking distance or that you can get a 10% off your bill if you ride your bike there either. That's just an added bonus. The real reason we go there as much as we do is because the food is absolutely amazing. The owners are always there to meet and greet you and let you sit where ever you want. I have actually tried everything on the menu at least once for sure.  However I must recommend one of my favorites and that is the "Fire Island Eggs" that dish is the bomb, yum yum. Check it out.
