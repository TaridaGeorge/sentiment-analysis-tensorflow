I'm from Chicago so I'm picky with my pizza--this place does it right (NY style)! I love the "hole in the wall" feel. Every customer that walked in was a regular which was a good sign. I ordered the Mozzarella sticks and a large Monster Pie (Sausage, pepperoni, bell peppers, onion and cheese). The mozzarella sticks took a little while to come out but they were cooked to perfection. They also threw in a few garlic knots which was awesome. The pizza was unbelievable--I think the crumbled sausage really did it! They have great deals like large pie & 20 wings for $20 which I definitely will be taking advantage of during football games on Sunday. Glad to have found a new place where I can also be a regular!
