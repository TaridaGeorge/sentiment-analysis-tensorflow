I have always had a fondness for this particular store. I am not sure why, but maybe because you can grab a starbucks prior to commencing your shopping activities?

Makes a difference I suppose. I seem to keep going there. And not having to keep a "frequent shopper" card helps too. 

It's never that crowded, it is always subdued and it is very convenient. I suppose that is all you need for a shopping trip. That and a cup of Joe.
