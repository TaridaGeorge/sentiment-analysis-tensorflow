When our baby Nikki recently injured herself we were panicked to say the least!

We called Sugarloaf and they said to bring her right in! 

We were greeted at the door by the Vet Techs to see if they could help bring her in.

The entire staff was fantastic and very reassuring! 

Dr.Rai answered all of our questions and even included our opinions in Nikki's care!

The prices were reasonable and the care was fantastic!

Nikki has a long road ahead of her but hopefully in time she will improve.(She has a herniated disc in her back)

Thank you to everyone at Sugarloaf you helped in mending my broken heart!
