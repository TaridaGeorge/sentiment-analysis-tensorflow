This is the best Pita Jungle and it's not just because they have a full bar. The waitstaff seems to care more about your experience much more than the other valley locations.

I recommend the Lentil Fetoosh Salad and the Lavosh Pizza (?--may have the name wrong, but it's not to be confused with the Lavosh Pita, which isn't nearly as good).

Even the cheap House Margaritas are good.
