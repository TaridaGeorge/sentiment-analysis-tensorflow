Their bacon doesn't have sugar and their sausage is so yummy I have a problem picking out what I want.  I buy the ground pork and ground beef by the pound and almost always have some browned up and ready to go.  It is very difficult to find local grass-fed meat in Phoenix and this place is affordable and friendly.  I feel like I am going back in time and seeing a true butcher shop, really get to see where your meat comes from and what it takes to process it!  I am in love with this place - I wish the location was more towards the East valley but really that is just me being selfish.
