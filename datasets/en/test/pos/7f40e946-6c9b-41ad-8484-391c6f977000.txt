Da Vang is one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in three states!  I cannot remember my faves in CA or NV right now, but when I remember them I will rate them too.  Anyway, if you are a Pho fan, their Pho (pronounced fuh) is the best with all of the goodies including peppers, lime, basil and sprouts that are really fresh!  I always get the chicken and my boyfriend always gets the shrimp, both are incredible!  We also always get the fresh spring rolls.  I could eat those until I explode!
