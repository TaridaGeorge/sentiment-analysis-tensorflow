Love this place. Met up with a good friend for Happy Hour here. I actually enjoy coming here by myself from time to time and people watch from the bar. There's always somethin' on their wine list to accommodate Love their pizzas and salads. A restaurant that knows how to tease me properly with Nutella as an ingredient will always receive high praise from me! Decor and setting is perfect for friends and family -- If wear permits and is ideal, I highly recommend dining out on their patio. Can't say anything negative about this place.
