This is a greasy spoon but....

Understanding it's not a 5 star resort, very good comfort food. Service is at least fair (sometimes slow but always nice), and can't beat the price. If you know someone who at all is a aviation fan, they will love it.   

Something different and a little bit of history. BTW, the place is pretty big, so good for big groups.
