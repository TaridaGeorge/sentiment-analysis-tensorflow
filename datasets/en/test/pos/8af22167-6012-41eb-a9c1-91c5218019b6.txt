Bob and his family have been at this for a long time and are the best in the business. He is my family's go-to jeweler and has been for a long time. He's just that good. He has a huge supply of engagement rings, necklaces, Rolex watches and just about anything else you can imagine. I can't say enough good things about Bob and what he does.
