I went to the Grill Friday night with two of my girlfriends. We sat outside on the beautiful patio overlooking the golf course. There were several other people dining outside- the patio has been remodeled with new furniture, a bar and even televisions outside- so relaxing! There is a new gastropub-style menu so my friends and I got a bottle of wine and decided to try a little of everything. We had the truffle deviled eggs, cheese plate, duck confit tacos, ahi tuna, duck fat grilled cheese and kiltlifter fish and chips- everything was delicious and perfect for sharing! The wasabi crusted ahi was my favorite, but there are so many other things on the menu that I can't wait to go back and try. Staff was really friendly and attentive. Amazing menu and one of the best patios in Scottsdale!
