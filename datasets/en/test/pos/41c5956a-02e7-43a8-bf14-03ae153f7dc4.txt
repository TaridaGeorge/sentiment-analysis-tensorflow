I love this place it's probably my favorite bar in Tempe. Most of the places around the university are really sleazy. The atmosphere is nice. There is a beautiful courtyard and good food with reasonable prices. This place does not have the strict 21+ rules like most of the bars on Mill which makes it more pleasant for groups with people who are under age.
