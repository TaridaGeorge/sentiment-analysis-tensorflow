There's really nothing better than breakfast at Chompies on the weekend. With pancakes the size of your head, and the BEST corned beef hash I've ever tasted, why would ever go anywhere else? Their sandwhiches are feats of engineering, and i love that you get delicious dill pickles as soon as you sit down.

Their matzo ball soup has helped through many a hangover and if you're still not sure, try their baked goods! delicious rugelach and other sweet items. 

We went to the one on Shea for the Rosh Hashana dinner (delicious and a great deal for a couple of Jews without a large community of Jewish friends), and I have to say I like the University location better. Great ambiance with the posters what not, and the staff is always pleasant and knows how to treat you.

What can i say, I LOVE this place!
