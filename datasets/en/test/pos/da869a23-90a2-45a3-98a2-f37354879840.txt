This place is a little off the beaten path on Mill Ave in the old 3 roots location. 

Wandered in a couple of weeks ago and was blown away by the selection and prices. Great vintage dresses, shirts, skirts and more for a steal! I wanted to buy at least 5 things straight away!

Hurry up and get here before they realize they can hike up their prices!
