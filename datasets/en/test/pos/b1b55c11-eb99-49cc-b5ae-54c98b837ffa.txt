Free WiFi and a Carmel Macchiato are really two things you can't beat. Your bound to run into a friendly face or three here. The staff is always pleasant and remembers my name. If your writing a screenplay, editing your latest mix tape, showing off your apple products or just a general hipster, you know this is the place to be seen.
