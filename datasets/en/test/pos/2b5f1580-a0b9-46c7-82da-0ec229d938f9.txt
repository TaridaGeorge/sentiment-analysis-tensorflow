This is the best steak in the valley, period. 

I've been here quite a few times and every single time it pushes the bar even higher for me. The bone-in filet is the probably the best thing I've ever ate. The lobster mash potatoes are phenomenal, as is the gorgonzola mac n cheese. 

There really isn't anything bad to say about this place.
