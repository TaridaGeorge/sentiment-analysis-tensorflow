If you are someone who actually gives a shite about the quality and wholesomeness of your food, you HAVE TO try Nourish. Clean, high energy food.  Gluten free and very creative.  The owners of this place obviously have HEART!  I understand the menu will be completely soy free soon and also offer some paleolithic options ... very, very interesting!
