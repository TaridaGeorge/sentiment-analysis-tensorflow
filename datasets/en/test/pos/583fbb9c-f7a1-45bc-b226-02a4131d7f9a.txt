Fat Burger has been my favorite hamburger place since I first was introduced to it in high school.  My school was only a few minutes away, and when we could, my friends and I would sneak over to Fat Burger for a delicious escape.  Now that I'm at ASU, it's closer than ever!  Better than In n' Out, better than Sonic, Fat Burger is your ticket to hamburger heaven.
