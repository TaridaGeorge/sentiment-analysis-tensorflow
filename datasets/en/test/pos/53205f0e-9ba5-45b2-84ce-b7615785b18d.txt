What a wonderful meal.  I had a fish stew that had scallops, shrimp, and talapia.  Who would have thought of going to Arizona for great seafood?  Lon's is a really fun and interesting restaurant right in the middle of a residential neighborhood.  We toured the grounds and the wine cellar and had a wonderful time.  I'll go back.
