Three things make this a five star chocolate shop. 
Maybe four. 
1. The chocolates are beautiful in taste and presentation. 
2.The store smells and looks wonderful. 
3. Clearance sales after the holidays- you can get great deals because the box is out of season. 
4. They make terrific gifts. 

I love to have dinner parties and the post holiday chocolates are first rate for desserts. Remove them from the boxes and place them on tiered silver trays and watch your dinner guests' eyes light up. Many people would rather have a piece or two of Godiva Chocolate for dessert than a piece of cake or pie.
