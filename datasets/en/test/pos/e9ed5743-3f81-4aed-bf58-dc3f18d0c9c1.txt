Don't be fooled. Brindley's looks tiny (especially if you've been to Milano's Mesa location or think Guitar Center is the pinnacle of a music store). And it's easy to miss. And the parking can occasionally be interesting.

But once you set foot in the door, you'll realize they've packed this place to the gills with everything they can and staffed it with great people. The employees are all very knowledgeable and eager to help, and no matter what instrument you play you're sure to find someone there with the advice and experience you're looking for.

Brindley's has top-tier stuff at very reasonable prices, too, so if you're looking for accessories or expendables like reeds, be sure to stop in or at least call. They've also got a decent selection of sheet music and books.
