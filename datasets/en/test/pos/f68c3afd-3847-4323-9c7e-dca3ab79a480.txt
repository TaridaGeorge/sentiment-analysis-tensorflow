Awesome! We went for our 1 year anniversary and had made reservations ahead of time, they took great care of us and the entire staff was great. Great for a special occasion, they made us our  menus personally for us, wishing us a happy anniversary. The staff went above and beyond to make us feel catered to, we never needed refills or anything they were on top of it! AND the food was excellent, the wine selections were great too. Great way to spend a quiet romantic evening
