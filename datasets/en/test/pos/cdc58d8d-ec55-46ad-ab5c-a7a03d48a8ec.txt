Good food, attentive staff -- all in a gracefully redesigned historic space.

I had the crispy thin crust pizza with plenty of basil, from their wood fired  oven and some Lorina soda. Open breakfast, lunch and dinner with plenty of favorites to try later, no doubt I will be back soon.

The drink menu included some local brews, but the day was young so instead, I wrapped things up at the E61 bar with their signature "cortadito", a Cuban espresso served with raw sugar in twin shot glasses, a delight for any coffee lover.
