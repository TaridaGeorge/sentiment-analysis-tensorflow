8 of us went on the Saturday afternoon to celebrate birthdays.  I called ahead for a reservation, I hear the place is small and gets packed.  I should have bought the GPS, but I thought I was going to use my sense to get there.  Circled a little and found out the street does not go through the Glendale library is in the way!  LOL!  We ordered 12 pierogi (mixed).  They are so so SO good.  We ordered sandwiches, sausages, cabbage wrapped something, etc...  Everything was so delicious!  Loved the atmosphere of the owners interacting with the customers.
