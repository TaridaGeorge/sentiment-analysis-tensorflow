Woo Hoo, another fantastic downtown dining spot. I have always loved Fate (Johnny Chu's other downtown joint) but Sens rocks it hard. 

brilliant food, and superb drinks.
The food is referred to as Asian Tapas. exactly what it is. Small portions, ridiculously big on flavor.

The Miso soup was the best I have ever experienced. Chock full o' mushrooms, and other delights.

the salad special of banana sprouts and other items I can't quite recall. Perhaps the flavor euphoria has drained some of my memory.

I'm not big on long-winded reviews, so try it, then sit back and listen to your inner contented self... you will say yum too.
