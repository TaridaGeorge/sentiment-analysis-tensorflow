Well, I'm in love. So happy this place is near my office. My coworkers favor Chipotle down the street for burritos and such, but since I discovered Sonora, I haven't been back to Chipotle.

The biggest difference for me is the tender, flavorful chicken SMG uses in their burritos and tacos. Seriously good! And no matter what I order I get a side of their fresh guacamole. Stop eating at the chains and go here.
