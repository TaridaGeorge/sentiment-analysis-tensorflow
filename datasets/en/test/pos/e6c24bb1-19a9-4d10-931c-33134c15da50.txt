Love this place.  The atmosphere, the food, the staff, you name it, it all great! Top picks for me would be the Sergio's Pork Tenderloin, the Buttermilk Chicken and the Santa Cruz Pasta, in no particular order.  But, I've tried quite a few different things there and have never been disappointed.   They finished the basement into a private party area and a wine tasting room.  Very cool.  In fact, we love this place so much we got married there!

Word of caution though, they have changed the parking in front, so you need to approach this place from the south on 7th St so you can be turning right (east) into the front parking lot.  If it's during the week rush hour it is a PITA to turn left if you're southbound on 7th.
