But wait!!!  $5 margaritas have been extended all summer!  And they are good.  I try to get the secret recipe out of the bartender but he won't tell me.  

In addition to great margaritas, this place also has decent food.  We've never been disappointed.  In fact, we were just there Friday and they had the most awesome Gorgonzola mashed potatoes.  You will not be disappointed.  

And the folks who work there are incredibly nice.  We wanted to walk around after dinner so they let me keep my left overs there while we walked.  So sweet!
