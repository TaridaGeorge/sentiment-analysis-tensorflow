I've been to this place a few times now.  It is excellent for "I just rolled out of bed and want some breakfast or maybe lunch, nothing fancy just stick with what you know" kind of meals.  The portions are perfect sized, the price is right and they are always consistent.  

The waitstaff is competent, ready with a refill, and my favorite balance of pleasant without implying friendship.  This place is old school with ads on the table and when you order eggs over medium the whites are solid and the yolks runny.  Rockstar.

I notice they have a full bar and will some day venture into that arena.
