Came here as a recommendation from Mike A and yes it was as great as he said it would be.  The burgers here are great, I love the casual atmosphere and set up where you pick everything you want on the burger.  They have those new cool soda fountain machines and the burger was great, I just got the cheeseburger just the way I like it and the jalapenos still had the seeds so it had a great spicy kick.  I will most definitely go back for more.  The whole meal with fries and a drink was about $9 which is good for a quality meal.
