Not only was the food absolutely delicious but the staff was extremely friendly and attentive!  The ambiance is quite lovely.  For dinner I enjoyed the calamari and then the pasta trio because I just couldn't pick one thing.....tortellini wild mushroom with portebello marscapone was off the hook...spinach ricotta truffle ravioli....gnocchi brie asiago cheese in brown butter sage sauce.....and for dessert best cannoli I have ever eaten out west....Their wine list is also quite extensive.  Make this your new place to frequent you won't be disappointed! Cheers!
