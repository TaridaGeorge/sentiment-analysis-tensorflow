When I first came to PHX, I was brought to the Ranch Market at the Chinese Cultural Center and was told it was the largest asian market in the area.... and I wanted to cry! So, when I moved to Chandler and found Lee Lees, my grocery shopping world was turned right side up again. Lee Lees has EVERYTHING, no seriously... everything! Thai, Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Vietnamese, Korean, Indian, Middle Eastern, Hawaiian... well you catch my drift!

Everything is nicely priced and on top of that they give you an additional "VIP"  10% off at checkout!
