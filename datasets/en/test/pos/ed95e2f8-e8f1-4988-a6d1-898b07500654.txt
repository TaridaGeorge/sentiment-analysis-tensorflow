I fell in love with this place! The food was so amazing and authentic! The roasted garlic olive oil is beyond words good! The bruschetta is so yummy! The atmosphere sitting out doors at night with the live band is romantic yet casual and comfortable! The desserts are a perfect way to end the evening! My husband and I truly love this place!!
