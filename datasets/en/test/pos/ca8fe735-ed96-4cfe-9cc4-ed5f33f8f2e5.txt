5 Stars for uniqueness and yumminess!  Had the green chili fry bread taco. So good!  Everything you've read before is true: very greasy and heavy. But I deem it a "must do" if not for the blind pleasure of fried food, but for the unique "cultural culinary adventure."

I came here by myself so didn't have anyone to split a dessert fry bread with :-(
