First off, the service here is excellent. The staff is very helpful and quick. They even brought us out a complimentary cotton candy which was really nice! The food was amazing... I had the slow-roasted pork and my boyfriend had the potato-wrapped halibut and both were delicious and big portion sizes. We went during the week so it was quiet and had a nice relaxing feel to it. I highly recommend this place!
