The breakfast special has hit my taste buds and is being digested as I write this! I am so happy that I woke my arse up early this Saturday to get down to the Phoenix Public Market to try SLD. For a mere $5 I got what a lot of people will call a gourmet hot dog, but what I would call an ingenious new take on American street food. It was filling, flavorful and a perfect way to start my day. Not only that, but the owners were super friendly and happy too chat with me! 

Do yourself a flavor and read the other reviews on Yelp, look them up on Facebook, find their schedule and be at their next location to get yourself a damn-good dog. I can't wait to go back!
