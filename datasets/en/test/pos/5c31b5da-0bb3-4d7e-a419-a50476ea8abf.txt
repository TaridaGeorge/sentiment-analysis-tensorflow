Finally a Japanese owned sushi bar beside Sakana in Ahwatukee!  I guess Sushi Ken has been here for a while, but I didn't realize what a great find it was.  

My wife and I went there to splurge on Japanese sushi since they are better than the typical Korean owned sushi places which are most common in the Phoenix area.  

We found we didn't splurge at all as we do at Sakana or Hiro.  We didn't break $30, which surprised me.  5 stars for value and great sushi!

Domo Arigato!
