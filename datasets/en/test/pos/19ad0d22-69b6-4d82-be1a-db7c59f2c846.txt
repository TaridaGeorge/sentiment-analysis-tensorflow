Excellent. A sign reads, "Complain all you want, that cappuccino is for here.". There's a reason that has to do with how the foam sits in the cup. Bottom line is that these people care about their coffee and care that your experience is the best it can be. Give it a shot and I don't think you'll be disappointed.

When I ordered a cup of coffee, I watched as the beans were ground and brewed in front of me. Nice!

The cookies are amazing. I especially like the molasses and ginger one: a little bit of Christmas in the middle of August.
