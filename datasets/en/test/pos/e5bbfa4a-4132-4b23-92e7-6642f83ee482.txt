Liberty Market is on of my favorite places in the valley. Ive been coming here since they opened and its 5 stars across the board. Its starts with the historic building that was renovated, yet preserved for the Old Town Gilbert setting. 

The Menu is fantastic and in all reality you just cant go wrong on any item. The menu features great pizzas, sandwiches, salads and is highlighted with incredible gourmet options at an affordable price.

The E61 espresso bar is first rate and one of the only REAL coffee spots in the east valley.

Even the bathrooms are unique! Make sure you check out each one!

Joe Johnston hits another homerun with this restaurant in his partnership with Chef David Traina and his wife Kiersten.
