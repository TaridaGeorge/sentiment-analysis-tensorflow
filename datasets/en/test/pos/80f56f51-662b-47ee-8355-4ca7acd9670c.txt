The best breakfast in Scottsdale! Huge portions, not lacking quality in anyway! Service is so nice and coffee delish! the new renovation makes it hip, classy and fun! Love the new "bar"! Lunch is also incredible!!!! You will wait on the weekend for a table, but get a latte at the bar and wait, it's well worth it!!!!! Yum!
