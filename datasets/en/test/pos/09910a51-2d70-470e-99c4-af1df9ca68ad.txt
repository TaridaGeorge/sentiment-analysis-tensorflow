My friend told me about this place, but I never had any desire to check it out because the name of that restaurant sounds like an ordinary Chinese restaurant.

We finally stop by on a Sunday evening; to our very surprise, this place is VERY GOOD. 

The decoration is elegant unlike other old-school Chinese restaurants with corny cheap oriental deco.

The food is perfect especially the roast duck, which is by far the best I have had tasted in my life. No kidding.

Except Golden Buddah and Flo's, now, we have one more Chinese restaurant that we can bring our guests to.
