Unbelievable i haven't put my 2 cents in about Green, despite being a frequent customer. this vegan restaurant is so adept at making non-chicken "chicken", you will swear they made a mistake. 

the first time i ate here, i for sure thought they put chicken in my sandwich but was assured it was not chicken. since then, i've tried a variety of their dishes from the noodle bowls to the "buffalo wings" to the "rib" dinner and have never been disappointed with any of my meals. 

Green is a testament that vegan/vegetarian meals don't have to consist of just a plate full of side dish vegetables. the prices are extremely reasonable and the interior decor is kind of like that "kitsh-industrial-hippy" look. customers order at the counter and the food is brought out quickly, and you self-serve drinks so the water glass is always full!
