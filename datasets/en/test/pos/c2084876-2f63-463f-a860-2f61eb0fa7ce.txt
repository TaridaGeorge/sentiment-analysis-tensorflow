Wow. I had a severe ear infection and couldn't get in to see my regular Dr so my insurance recommended this place. I opted for the WAHOO wait at home option for appointment and they called me right away to come in. In less than 5 minutes I was being seen by a PA and  15 minutes later I had my prescriptions and was out the door. How awesome is that? And the staff is very attentive and courteous. I will def come back here!
