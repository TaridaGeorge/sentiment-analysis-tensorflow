One of the best restaurants in the valley.  It's locale, in a strip mall, is not elegant, but the food and service more than make up for its location.  It is not a cheap restaurant, but it is by far the best Italian food I've had in Phoenix.  Rivals some of the better Italian restaurants back in NYC.
