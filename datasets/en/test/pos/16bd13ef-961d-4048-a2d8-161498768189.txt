The old Al's was a dump.  Messy, dirty scummy place with terrible food that sent you straight to the bathroom.  The new Al's is as clean as you could ever imagine.  Beautiful inside with a happy, spirited staff.  Ordered the Italian Beef dipped sandwich with peppers and cheddar cheese and it was one of the most delicious lunches i ever had.   If you went to the old Al's and hated it, you really have to give the new management team a chance.  Much better than Casella's which has some of the most overrated food in the valley.   5 Stars !!!
