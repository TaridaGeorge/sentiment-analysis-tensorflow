I "stumbled" upon Doctor Smallwood several years ago after being turned down by two other dentists that didn't care too much about about straightening my teeth as an adult. The proposed treatment would include cutting into my jaw bone and braces with no guarantees. One appointment with Doctor Smallwood and I was at ease. Two pain free appointments and the veneers I'm wearing several years later, proves I made one of the best decisions of my life by stopping in his office. He does all my general dentistry and maintenance as well. He has a beautiful facility and the staff there is nothing short of amazing. I just can't say enough about that place.
