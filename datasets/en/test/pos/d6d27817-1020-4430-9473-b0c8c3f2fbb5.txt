I resisted eating Zoyo for months after they opened because I was afraid I'd get hooked and be there every day. And, yep, it's addictive. They always have new flavors to try, but right now my fave is salted caramel. It's incredible. I usually pass on toppings.

As other have suggested, it'd be nice if they had smaller containers. But I am impressed that they can keep the store so clean with the giant roll-up doors open. They lead to a nice patio that's sufficiently removed from the street that you're not just breathing exhaust.
