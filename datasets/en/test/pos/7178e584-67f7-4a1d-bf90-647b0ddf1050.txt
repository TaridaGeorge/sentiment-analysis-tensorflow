The best Indian food in Arizona, bar none, and especially considering the prices and portions. The young guy at the cash register was incredibly nice and gave my girlfriend and I a free mango lassi because he forgot to offer me coffee/tea with my meal! The food was spicy, savory, sweet, and succulent. The chutney bar is a great idea and were likewise delicious. I forgot to tip for all the good food and friendliness, but I'll be back VERY soon and they will certainly have a couple repeat customers (and a generous tip). I highly suggest this restaurant to anyone that loves Indian food (and doubly so to those who are tired of the exorbitant pricing of Indian restaurants in the valley!).
