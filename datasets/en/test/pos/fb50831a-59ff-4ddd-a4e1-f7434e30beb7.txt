Love love love this place.  We went in because our regular pho place was closed. I feel bad because we are now regular customers and go in at least once a week.  We get the same thing each time and they know our order.  They are super friendly and more than happy to explain how to eat the food if you new (wrapping egg rolls and using the sauces). Not to mention clean clean!  the portions are huge and enough for our family of three to share two dishes.  The soda with lime is amazing!

You will not be disappointed.
