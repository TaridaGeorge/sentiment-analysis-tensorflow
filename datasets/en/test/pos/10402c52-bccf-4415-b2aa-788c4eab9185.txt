they still make places to buy used CD's? i had no idea!!!!

we had a bag full of books and heard we should take them here to get some trades in. i'm so glad we came.

although they only took about 10 out of 30 we had, it was enough to get us store credit for 4 "new" books. 

lots of stuff to check out....even a cafe.
