Hands down my favorite pizza in the valley.  It doesn't hurt that it's LGO and has a gelato shop attached, either.  We've been coming here long before the gelato appeared, however, and it is and always has been just straight-up excellent pizza.  Get the gladiator, the mushroom party, or the avocado (with prosciutto!), and wash it down with a pitcher of sangria.  The burger is also one of the best in town and the chicken wings aren't too shabby, either.  Make sure to get a piece of red velvet cake, too.  Eat it there, take it with you--doesn't matter, just get it.  Service is usually pretty efficient and friendly as long as you get a familiar face and not the hipster-of-the-week.  Yeah, parking is a bitch.  Quit whining and get it curbside.
