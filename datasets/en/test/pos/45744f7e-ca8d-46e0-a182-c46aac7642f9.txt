My all time favorite bar, have been going for the last 10 years.  I am no longer a multiple times a week kid, but I try to make it in at least a couple times a month.

Great food, great friendly service, amazing patio...a really comfortable atmosphere all around.  Lunch is great, weeknights are chill, Friday & Saturday nights can get a little crowded, especially when school is in session but makes for good people watchin :)
