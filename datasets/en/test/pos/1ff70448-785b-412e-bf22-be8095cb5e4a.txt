Ummm...can you say Diesel, Energie, Miss Sixty, Howe...all in one breath, or in ONE store for that matter???

Are those brands usually more expensive than a pair of jeans from Target? Yes! That is WHY it is a boutique! Hello? So...to break it down:

1. pay full price for name brand clothing
2. check out the sales
3. avoid the store all together.

Personally, I went with option 2. I love certain brands, NOT because of the brand, but because of the materials, design, and look. I absolutely would not pay 90 bucks for a t-shirt. 25 bucks for a unique designer t-shirt. Yes, please. Sign me up.

Aside from my rant (sorry), the store is located at the Kierland Commons. The decor is as unique as the clothes that are being sold. The staff is super friendly and helpful. 

Two sweet ass shirts? 50 bucks total? Hell yes!
