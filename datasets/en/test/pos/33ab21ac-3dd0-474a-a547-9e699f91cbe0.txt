Kazimierz is one of my favorite wine bars of all time. It's definition of what I expect other wine bars to live up to now. The layout, with couches and low lighting and really sophisticated atmosphere is perfect for date night or for girls night. On Monday's they have this Jazz singer - Margo (I hope she's still there) and she is phenomenal. 

It's kind of hard to find, which adds to the special feeling - that *you* found this cool little place, you know? But totally worth searching around your first or second time trying to find it :)
