To echo the sentiments of quite a few already, this place is cool. 

I wanted to chime in, however,  to emphasize the badassness of Monday nights here. They have a rotating cast of live jazz musicians who serenade guests with old standards as well as some newer and original stuff while you sip back on good wine. 

Jazz and wine? At the same time?? It doesn't get much better than that, folks.
