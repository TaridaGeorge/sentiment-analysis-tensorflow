I loved Postino. The happy hour was made better by their wonderful wine selection...the happy hour extends to pitchers of beer as well. 

The bruschetta was phenomenal and I could say the same about our sandwiches. The staff was friendly, helpful, and came by just often enough to make sure our glasses were never empty. We were here in the early afternoon and, with the garage doors open, there was a great breeze throughout the restaurant. I didn't notice one open table yet it didn't feel crowded nor did we have to yell over one another to have a conversation. 

Next time I am in Phoenix I will definitely be coming back here. Each and every time.
