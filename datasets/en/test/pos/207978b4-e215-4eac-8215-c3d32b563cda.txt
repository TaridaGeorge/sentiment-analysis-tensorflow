I was in Gilbert visiting an old friend a few weeks ago. While there, I asked around for a good place to eat. The answer, almost unanimously, was Joe's Farm Grill. 

Man, oh, man were they right! It was 100% amazing! 

The atmosphere there was that of an old farm in the 50s. Very vintage. I loved the huge tree in the back. Damn, that thing is big, but perfect for sitting under.

I ordered the farm burger with sweet potato fries. Very good! Probably the best burger I have ever had. It was perfectly cooked, and had a great flavor. I even slid a few sweet potato fries under the bun. Yummy!

Yeah, if you're ever going to go to Gilbert, Arizona... go to Joe's Farm Grill.
