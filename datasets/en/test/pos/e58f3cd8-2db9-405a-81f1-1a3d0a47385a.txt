Love this store. Less expensive and better organized than BRU.

Staff is great and very helpful :)

A HUGE plus: Shooting Stars Studio inside. We get our sons milestone photos taken here and the photographer Felicia is AMAZING. Our sons photos are like that of the pro photographers charging over $1k and we get the digital copies. We tell everyone about the photo studio. :)
