Oh my god. Was this a win or what? 

I enjoy spice and Indian food a lot, but I'm always nervous about cleanliness and getting an explosive asshole later in the evening. 

However, my experience at Tandoori Times 2 left me with no worries, a belly full of Lamb Boti Masala and Flying Horse beer. 

As soon as we walked in I was addicted to the smell, curry permeated my clothes as I began to salivate. 
The waitress was knowledgeable about the dishes and helped in my selection process. The side of rice for $2.50 was HUGE. It disappointed me that they didn't serve the rice with the dish, but it was worth the $2.50 

We had a free cup of chai tea to top of our meal! 

I will definitely be coming back. I'm addicted.
