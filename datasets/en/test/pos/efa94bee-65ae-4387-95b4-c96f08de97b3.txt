I have been here a few times and had a great experience every time. The food is wonderful (creative, fancy yet totally edible), the ambiance is cozy, sophisticated and classy, and the service is spot on. The cheese plate is delicious and their happy hour is fantastic. It's pricey, but if you're looking for a classy date night or even a pretty location for lunch off Mill ave, this is your place!
