I had a wisdom tooth wall crack off at 10 pm and by 7:30 the next morning I was in Dr. Saperstein's office for treatment.  I sent them an email at 10 pm and got a call the next morning at 7:15 am..  The treatment provided by Dr. Saprstein was extremely skillful and careful, and his staff is very attentive.  Usually there is some pain when the novacaine wears off but I didn't even need to take a Tylenol.  This is the best dental work I have ever experienced, from the novacaine injection to casting the crown.
