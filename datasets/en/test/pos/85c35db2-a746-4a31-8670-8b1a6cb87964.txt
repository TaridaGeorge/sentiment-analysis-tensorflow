My family and I have been coming to Kokomo ever since they first opened and still love it from day 1 even with all these other frozen yogurt places opening up.  The place is clean, the yogurt is delish but my favorite are the fruit toppings!  I love love love their fresh fruit toppings.  They are consistently fresh and tasty!  No yucky fruit here.  Superb! I hope they will keep it up and stay that way.
