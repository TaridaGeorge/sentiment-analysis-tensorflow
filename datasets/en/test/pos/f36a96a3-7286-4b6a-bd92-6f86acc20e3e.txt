I was very impressed with this place.. David hooked up what is probably the best haircut I've had, complete with a straight razor line up. I saw that the yelp profile says they accept credit cards, but this is false information. I had to leave to withdraw some cash and come back to pay. Bel View Barbershop is my new spot. Great service for the right price. Parking is tricky though.
