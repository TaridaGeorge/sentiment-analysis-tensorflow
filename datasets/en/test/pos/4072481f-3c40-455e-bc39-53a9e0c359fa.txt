I have gone into this location frequently to find quick gifts at a resonable price.  They always honor current coupons and suggest appropriate gifts.  I enjoy sampling the different sented lotions.  And really like the new spring candle selection.  The staff isn't push, lets you shop and provides you with a shopping bag to carry items.  The best part is if you mix & match different items they will create a gift packaging for free, just ask!  This is perfect for those that don't like to wrap gifts:)
