This place was near my office and I love books, so I thought I'd check it out. At first, I was a bit nervous, because everyone was tellig me how "ghetto" it was. 

I'm glad to say that Bookmans is actually a great place! Great prices and a HUGE selection of books. I've even grabbed a record or two. A great, quiet place to kill a lunch hour and get some books you've been meaning to buy.
