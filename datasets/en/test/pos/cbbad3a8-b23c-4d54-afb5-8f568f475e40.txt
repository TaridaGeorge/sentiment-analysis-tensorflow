I go to Dicks Hideaway every so often, and absolutely love the atmosphere (yummy smell of pecan wood smoke in the air). But best of all? The service and the food! I always always always get the Carne Adovada (in one of the pictures on Yelp) with over easy eggs, yummy beans, and potatoes. I recommend getting it with their blue corn tortillas, super yummy. Very much worth the money. Some might think it's a pricey breakfast spot, but those people don't know good quality when they see it!
