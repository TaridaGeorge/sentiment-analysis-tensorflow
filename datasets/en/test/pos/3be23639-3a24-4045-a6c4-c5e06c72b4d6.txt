This gym is probably one of the best maintained 24HR Fitness's that I have seen in awhile.  They have pretty much everything you could want in a gym, even a pool,a sauna and steam room.  Which you don't really find in many 24HR Fitness's.  The staff is very helpful and kind, it's pretty much an awesome gym.
