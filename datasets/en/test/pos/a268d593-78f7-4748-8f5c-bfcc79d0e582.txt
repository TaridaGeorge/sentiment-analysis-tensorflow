The potatos are sprinkled with fairy dust (or perhaps a healthy pat of butter) with a nice punch and multiple hued bell peppers.  I ordered the chipotle laced hollandaise on the "traditional" eggs benedict.  On the menu they'd mentioned the virginia ham - and it was worthy of special recognition.  My friend had an omlette - every bite oozing with cheese.  She raved about the potatos as well.  
All in all - LOVED IT! Loved the name, loved the minimalist decor, loved being close enough to walk off the cholesterol coma with a brisk walk through beautiful old town Scottsdale
