The service was great, the beers were great and the pretzels rock.  The only downside is the location...sort of hidden in a rather dead shopping plaza.  I rarely drink pilsners but surprisingly their pilsner was my favorite from the sampler tray (the only way to go if you've never been here before).  Glad to have anothrr AZ brewery making a great product.  Keep it up Nimbus.
