I do not know exactly how many folks I've taken to Mark's Cafe (f.k.a. Culinary Solutions Cafe).  I can tell you that Chef Mark - with decades of Executive Lunch/Dinner experience - will blow your mind and "ruin" your palette.  Many of those that I have taken to this phenomenal Breakfast/Lunch/Catering cafe have gone back on their own - without me (when then can get away with it).  My favorite dish is impossible to identify, but my favorites remain any of the Eggs Benedict dishes, or the Friday Night Dinner's.  (BYOB!)  This is a perfect local spot to impress your clients.
