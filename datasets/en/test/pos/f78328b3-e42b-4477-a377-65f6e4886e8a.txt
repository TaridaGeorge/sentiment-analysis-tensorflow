Everything including the food, service, and atmosphere was incredible! Stephanie was our server and she could not have been any better at her job. Although I am sure all the staff are fantastic, I would highly suggest sitting with her if she is there. 

I would recommend everything that we had (caesar, eggplant pizza, chicken parmesan) but most of all focus on the dessert paired with an outstandingly foamy latte. Make sure you try the roasted banana crepes... out of this world!
