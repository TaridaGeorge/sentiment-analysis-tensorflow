Love LOOOVE Bungalow.

A place for all occasions: lunch, happy hour, dinner, pre-bar cocktails...whatever your fancy, Bungalow delivers.  

Heres my Bungalow line-up:

Lunch:  Strawberry salad or grilled cheese (the best in town) and fries
Happy Hour: Steak skewers or bungalow bites (mini cheeseburgers)
Dinner: Steak Foccacia sandwhich 
Drinks: Lotsa them

Good music, clean bathrooms, great food, cheap happy hour.
