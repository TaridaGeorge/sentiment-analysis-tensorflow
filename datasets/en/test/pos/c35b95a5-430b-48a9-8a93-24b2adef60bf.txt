The Heard Museum is probably one of the best we have ever been in!

The history of the indigenous First Nation people in North America is both sad and very compelling.  And, the collection the Heard family has assembled and the museum has added to is incredible.  Yet, it's the little exhibits that move me the most.  I am still brought to tears whenever at the end of touring, I come to the hand crafted dolls of the US Marine WWII Navajo code talkers raising the American flag (See photos).

On our most recent trip here, we enjoyed the Barry Goldwater Bolo Tie exhibit, and  listening to the tour guide of First Nation peoples in Arizona.

BTW, the best deal is becoming a Member of the Heard by showing your AAA card.  It's a small discount but you get their magazine and newsletter.

Enjoy!
