They offer Sunday morning cooking classes! FREE! Go figure! And everything they make...which is usually three or more things...you get to sample and try out! It is awesome! 

Love the store. The people are nice. Know their stuff and are very courteous. The sunday morning classes are done while you are standing around the cooking area and it does get pretty hot in there with the oven on and everythign...so if you can stand for a long time and don't mind the heat...go check it out.
