So Fry's is amazing! After going to "Best Buy" and asking their "geek squad" questions about our computer and getting the deer in the headlights look from them, we said to heck with this. We went to Fry's and the guy behind the counter was amazingly helpful and knowledgeable. Wasn't trying to gouge us for money, just was sharing his specialty.  The sales guys can be jerks at times, but the service people more than make up for it! I'll never set foot in best buy as long as Fry's is open!
