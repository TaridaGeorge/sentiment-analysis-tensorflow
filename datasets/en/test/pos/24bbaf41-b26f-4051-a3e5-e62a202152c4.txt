How is it possible for me to have not only stayed here, but visited no less than 20 times, and not have written about it? 

Luv the lobby bar & live entertainment, Spanish Guitar & Flamenco Dancing.  Our many out-of-town-guests thouroughly enjoy this.

The grounds are just stunning as you walk in from the lobby, down the stairs and out through the glass doors to the beautiful views.

1 of the most romatic things to do is the super unique gondola rides they have in the evening.  It always stuns a couple we bring here!  We surprise them by ending the evening with escorting them to the docks, and leaving them to fininsh their night off after thier private ride on the moon-lit lake.  (Complete with the gondolier singing professional Opera!)

Now, how cool is that?!
