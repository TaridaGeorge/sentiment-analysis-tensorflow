Schizophrenic fun at reasonable prices -- what else could you want from an antiques mall. Sure, there's some stalls full of what looks like garage sale leftovers, but most of the stuff is solid -- a nice blend of furniture and larger items admixed with the trinkets and collectibles. I never, ever, ever leave empty handed, even if it's just a few old Pyrex lab beakers or vintage liquor promo glasses. The only problem with this place is that it takes way too much time to really do it right!
