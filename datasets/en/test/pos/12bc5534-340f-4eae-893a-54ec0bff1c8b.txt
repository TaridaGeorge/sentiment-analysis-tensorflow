Screw the Depot, this place rocks for cheap DIY! You'll never know what you'll find at this hardware thrift store. 

They mostly carry used home improvement stuff like doors, windows, sinks, furniture, door hardware, oops paint, etc...but from time to time you can find a great selection of brand-new stuff that contractors donate. I scored a brand-new-in-the-box Moen kitchen faucet for $37! I was super excited over that bargain. 

I've also gotten a bunch of little things here like a soffet vent for the roof, door knobs, paint brushes, windows, etc...and you can't go wrong for the price. Their prices are a fraction of the cost of home improvements chains and you're helping recycle and giving money to a good cause.
