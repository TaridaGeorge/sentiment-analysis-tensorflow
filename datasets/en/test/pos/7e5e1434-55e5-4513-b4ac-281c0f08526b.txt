I work in this area and we order from Lunch Break all the time.  No one who works here has ever had a complaint about any of the food.  I absolutely am a fan of the Grilled Buffalo Chicken Wrap.  The French Dip is delicious, too.  We've had their soups, salads, everything but breakfast.  They do deliver, which is wonderful, especially in summer, and I believe it is only a $1 delivery charge.

When I have been there in person, the man in charge there is extremely friendly and personable.  You can also get a punch card, so your 10th sandwich is free, if you dine in or pick up lunch.  Prices are reasonable and I just can't say enough about how good this place is for lunch, especially in this area.
