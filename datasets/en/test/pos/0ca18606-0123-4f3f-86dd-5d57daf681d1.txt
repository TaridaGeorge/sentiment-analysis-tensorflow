Absolutely delicious.

While we had a little trouble finding the place (we're out of towners), it was well worth the hunt.  My husband and I enjoyed a fantastic belated anniversary dinner here last Friday and found the whole experience to be a pleasure.  The staff was knowledgeable and attentive.  The atmosphere was simple, sophisticated and modern (love the open kitchen in the middle of the restaurant!).  And the food was truly excellent.

I have to echo the prior reviewers who sung the praises of the watermelon, beet, goat cheese salad.  It was absolutely incredible.  My lamb also was perfectly cooked and my husband practically licked his plate when he polished off the jidori chicken.  We shared the fruit crisp with homemade vanilla ice cream for dessert; a perfect end to a memorable meal.
