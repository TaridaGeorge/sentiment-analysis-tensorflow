My head hurts.

Yes to the wine and yes to the Patron mixture!  Damn it!  Thomas, I do need those cards to fill out!  What the HELL, I think I was "over served"!  Next time!

Yelpers really are a great bunch of peeps!  And Gabi really needs to loan out her big roll of toilet paper (I'm soooo bad at names)

*I re-confirmed that I'm a music snob and this post also reconfirms my seething dislike for the lack of pictures posted with anything on Yelp!  And I've noticed that Thomas is a repeat offender of this!  Like you of all people don't have a Fez .jpeg logo laying around?  I think I'm pissy when I"m hung over!  :(
