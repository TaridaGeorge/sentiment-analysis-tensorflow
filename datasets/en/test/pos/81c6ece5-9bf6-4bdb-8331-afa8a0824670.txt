Everything Fry Bread House serves up is incredibly delicious. 
I like the unpretentious service, and the salsa that comes with the tacos is pretty addictive!

This is probably a bad place to be a vegan. I'd love to see some bison and lamb added to the chili menu, but the beef is pretty tasty the way they serve it up. There are two kinds of chile -red or green. Both are delicious.

The fry bread is perfect all by itself and I have ordered veg tacos here before and they were pretty tasty too.

Yum!
