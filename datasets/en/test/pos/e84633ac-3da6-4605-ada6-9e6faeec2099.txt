The ribs were tender and tasty, the potato salad was a surprising treat- sour cream instead of mayo!- the decor is open and bright, and our server, Dana, was a delight.  The location (next to a grocery store, blending into a corner) belies how stand-out the restaurant is.  If you're in the area, keep your eyes peeled and give this joint a shot!
