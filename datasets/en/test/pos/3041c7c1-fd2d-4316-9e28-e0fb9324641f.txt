Waffle House has never been known for fantastic food, service or cleanliness but this location is an exception to the rule!  The place was spotless, Beth was the nicest waitress I've ever had (at ANY Waffle House), the food was served fast and everything was incredibly tasty.  Hailing from the East coast, I know a good Waffle House when I see one & this was it!
