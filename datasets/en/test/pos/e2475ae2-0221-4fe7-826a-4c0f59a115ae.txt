Had "mom" visiting this week from back east and chose Seasons 52 for a nice diner out.  Chose to sit in a booth by the bar to enjoy the piano music which mom enjoyed.  The food was simply amazing.  Our waitress helped us with deciding between options and didn't steer us wrong.  This was the second time my wife and I dined here and found great vegetarian options for her.
