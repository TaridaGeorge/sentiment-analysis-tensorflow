I've been going here for over 30 years.  My parents took me here as a kid.  I still remember the first movie I saw there, It was Clash of the Titans.  This place has so many memories and I still have a good time there.  I've always brought my own food and drinks so I can't comment on the snack bar. But I have always felt safe there and someday I plan on bringing my baby there if I ever manage to stay awake that late.

Everyone should try the drive in movies experience, there are only a few left in the whole country and we are lucky to have one here.
