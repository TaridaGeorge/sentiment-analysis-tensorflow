I had a really great trip to Home Depot in East Phx. A very nice guy named Rene went out of his way to help me install my headlight. He invited me to bring my bike inside and located all the necessary parts. He then installed my headlight with me! All this for the cost of parts, about $2.

I always have a great experience here, but this was off the charts.
