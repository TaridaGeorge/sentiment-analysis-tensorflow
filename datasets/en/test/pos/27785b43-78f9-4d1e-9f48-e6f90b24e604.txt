Yeah, I realize that Fogo de Chao is the "IT" Brazilian Steakhouse to go to in Scottsdale, but this place far surpasses it.  This place is cheaper and maintains a better quality of food.  Oh...all the meats that they have!  And everything is wrapped in bacon!!!  You definitely can't go wrong there!  I always leave this place way too stuffed, but I definitely don't hate it.  I absolutely love the grilled pineapple they serve.  One of the best dishes out there!
