I love this Humble Pie! Soooo close to home. I have to stop my car from driving itself here. Service is incredible. Bartenders always take ah.maz.zing care of me. Get Server Dave, if you can. Very attentive, great eyes and gooood looookin. I do love me some Desert Ridge Humble. But this location makes me happy.
