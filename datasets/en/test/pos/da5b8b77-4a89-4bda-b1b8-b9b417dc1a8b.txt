I love the food here. The waiter is nice and try to seat us outdoor. He helps us move because we can't stand smoke. The food is like most francise restaurant. It is good for me. I like steak and shrimp the best. The shrimp is fresh since I can tell by the texture of the shrimp and there are still a bit smell of the sea. (My taste bud have weird reaction to sea water so I know) I will visit sometimes when I have time.
