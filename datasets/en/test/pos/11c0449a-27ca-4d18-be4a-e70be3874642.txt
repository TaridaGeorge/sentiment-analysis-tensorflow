If you're looking for a skateboard or skateboard accessories & want to support a local business this is the only place to go. Well they have 2 other locations so I guess you could go to any of them. They are all equally awesome. I have been buying board for cowtown since they opened & the cowtown staff have always treated me good. Whether I need a board to ride or one to add to the collection my choice will always be cowtown.
