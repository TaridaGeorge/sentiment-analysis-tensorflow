I have loved this place for a long time.  It troubles me that people write such negative things in their reviews.  Hi, it costs money to have a credit card machine and if you don't spend over five bucks it costs the COMPANY money. Duh.   And in regards to closing early, yes, it is a bummer.  However, it would be a far greater bummer if they had to close down instead.  In an economy where businesses are disappearing left and right, they are still here.  That says a lot.

The coffee is delicious, latte art very cool and the new baked goods made in-house are absolutely to die for.  Keep up the great work guys!
