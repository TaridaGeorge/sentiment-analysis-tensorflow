Nick's happens to be a few doors down from my business... very dangerous!! Literally, everything is so good. They bake their bread fresh everyday and it melts in your mouth.

Lunch - I suggest a sandwich on their french bread. I personally love their hot chicken sandwich with balsalmic dressing, melted cheese and seasoned chicken, grilled onions... need I go on - hmmm I'm hungry. 
or the greek salad with sliced chicken...

Dinner- This is where you eat the foccacia bread. Now when you're dieting and not allowed carbs - just eat the tops & save your cheat calories for the chicken marsala with penne pasta. 

Don't forget dessert - The tiramisu.

Enjoy
