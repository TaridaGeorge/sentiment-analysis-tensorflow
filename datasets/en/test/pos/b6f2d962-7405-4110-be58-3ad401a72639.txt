First visit could have been a wonderful fluke so I didn't write a review.  Second visit tonight - they didn't miss a mark.  Nice valets (thanks for not making me park my long bed in that cramped lot!).  Pleasant efficient host, great bartender, reservation on the patio was honored on time.  Server knew his stuff, funny without being over the top.  Interesting menu choices that have a few surprises without getting silly or pretentious.  No pressure to flip the table, good dessert recommendation and no "attitude" when we wanted to share.  The patio makes the top of my list of Phoenix patios for ambiance and decoration.  Love it.  Going back.  Recommending to my friends.  Thanks!
