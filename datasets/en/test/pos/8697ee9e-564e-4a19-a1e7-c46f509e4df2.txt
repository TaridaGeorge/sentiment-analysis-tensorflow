When we were on vacation, my friends and I came upon this place by chance. It's a no-nonsense place but with authentic Japanese food. And it was GOOD. REAL GOOD. We were the only customers in there because they were about to close. But they took our orders and never rushed us. The owners and their daughter were extremely polite. Definitely a place I'd go back to when I'm around AZ again.
