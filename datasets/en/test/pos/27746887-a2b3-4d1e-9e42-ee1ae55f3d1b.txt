Yogurtland is my favorite frozen yogurt place. They always have great yogurt choices and they have the best toppings! I love coming here for a nice treat. Their bowls are big and you can take whatever you don't eat home. I usually scarf mine but that's because I love yogurt!!

The only negative is the parking can be limited depending on the time of day you go. Other than that, it's a nice place with great yogurt. I even like their water with the strawberries, which is complimentary. Expect to pay around $5-$10 for yogurt, depending on how much you put in your bowl. Not really cheap but definitely delicious!
