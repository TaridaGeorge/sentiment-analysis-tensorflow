My family has been eating here since it opened.  They staff are friendly, kind, and timely.  The food is delicious.  The prices are great.  My child loves to order any of the noodle dishes.  She loves noodles.  We also like the crab puffs, lemon chicken, orange chicken and both the egg drop soup and wonton soup!
