Feel free to laugh ...but ...

YAY !!  We are hikers !!! ..........i know this is a relatively easy trail compared to most, but ......practice makes perfect right ?    RIGHT ??? you betcha!  

We love it here...no dogs ,no bikes ( we love dogs and bikes) however so nice to hike without those distractions in the morning . 
we are blessed to be 10 minutes from this beauty.

um, a little unsolicited advice ...after completing the 3 miles ..DO NOT  raise your arms in the air ( rocky balboa style) and exclaim YAY !!  We are hikers !!!  with your teenager next to you .......lol  ..ugh (ya live and ya learn) ..ha ha
