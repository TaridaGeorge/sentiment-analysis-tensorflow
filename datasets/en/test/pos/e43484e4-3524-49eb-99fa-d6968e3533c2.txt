This is one of our favorite restaurants!! We love it so much and have become regulars there! We have never had a bad experience! The food is always fresh!! 

I personally love the pad thai and my husband usually alternates between three different things on the menu! The spring rolls are a great starter to the meal!! Enjoy!
