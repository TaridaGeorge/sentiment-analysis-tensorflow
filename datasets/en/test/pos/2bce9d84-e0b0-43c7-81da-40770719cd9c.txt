Great time, great location, ability to park in garage behind it. Beautiful decor, candles, white furnishings, trimmed in wood. Excellent vodka choices that will have you dancing on that raised table all nite which gives you a cool panoramic view of the place. See if you can spot the dj booth! He's cool, friendly door staff. The bartenders kind of ignore you and there's a brunette girl bartender-stay away from her. Downer attitude, and she will charge you for 2 drinks even though they have a 2 for 1 special. But it's a cool club and it's 99% certain you'll have great time.
