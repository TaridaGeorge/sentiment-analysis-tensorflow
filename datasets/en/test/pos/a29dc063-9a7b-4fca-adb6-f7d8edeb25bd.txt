The Inn at Eagle Mountain made us feel like royaly. This is the third time I've taken my social group to the area and stayed at the resort. The staff is top of the line and the resort itself is fabulous. Each room has a fireplace and jaccuzzi tub. amenities are the best and the place was immaculate. Front desk was helpful and informative. The inn at Eagle Mountain gets an A+ number 1 rating from me and my group.
