Don't bag their waiting list. If you come during peak hours - expect to wait... That goes for almost ALL great restaurants that don't use reservations (us savvy Yelpers should understand that). On to the food: Don't expect Roka Akor on a conveyor belt! That being said, expect great sushi at an unbeatable price. If I could rank on Value alone, Teharu would get 6 of my Yelp stars. Bring a fun friend or two, be accomodating with your schedule, and laugh about the random v8 juice & snack packs that come around the belt along with the sushi. I have enjoyed every one of my dozen + visits. It is absolutely a "must-see" if you're a sushi fan.
