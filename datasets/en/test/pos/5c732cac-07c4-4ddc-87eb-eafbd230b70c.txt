Where does a soulful, martini-guzzling polyglot who pines for his beloved Crescent City hang out in the Valley of the Sun?

Where do amateur and professional acts alike pack the houses and fill the dancefloor with old dudes with ponytails and Rubensesque ladies with booty?

Where do dogs dance with cats, where is up actually down, where do your friends run into everyone they went to high school with EVER?

Where can you smoke relatively comfortably?

Char's, dammit!

God, this place rules.  One of the best places in central Phoenix, hands down.
