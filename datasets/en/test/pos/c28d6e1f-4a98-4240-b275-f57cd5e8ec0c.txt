If you are looking for a facial at an unpretentious location in the Biltmore area, I would highly recommend visiting Amber at Sage Organic Skin Care. This self professed "Hippy in Heels" has built a chic, serene salon in the heart of Phoenix. Her shop is just lovely and the facial I received was completely relaxing and rejuvenating. She uses all natural, non toxic ingredients which were gentle on my sensitive skin. Upon receiving such an excellent facial, I immediately purchased a gift certificate for my mother, so that she can feel as pampered as I had.
