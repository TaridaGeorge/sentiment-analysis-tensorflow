I found him!  This is Lou's shop that was located on Priest Drive, and is now on Guadalupe.  We have taken my cars (plural) to this shop on several occasions and the employees have always been helpful and honest.  Whether it was for a quick oil change or some major overhaul, the guys @ this shop are always reliable.  
My car wasn't running and Lou arranged for it to be towed in, and gave me a deal on the work to be done.  He also looked over two cars we were looking to purchase and gave us an honest evaluation of the vehicles.  
Now that I know where his new location is, he has my business!
