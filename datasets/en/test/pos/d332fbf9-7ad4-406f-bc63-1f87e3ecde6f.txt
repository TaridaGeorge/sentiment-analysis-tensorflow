Finally got a chance to visit the new Smashburger and OMG it was THE BEST BURGER EVER! Okay, maybe not ever, but wow that burger was so awesome.  Cooked perfectly, very juicy and hot. YUM!  Went perfectly with the ice cold chilled mug of Bud Light!  My waistline can't afford to eat hear very often but already I can't wait to go back. Wow.  Can't say enough-loved it!
