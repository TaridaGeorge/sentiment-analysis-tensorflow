I grew up going to Turk's back when George owned it and in the 60's was across the street from the Silver Dollar Drive-In and that old Turk's location is now Poncho's. Turk's had a great Steak Sandwich and Onion Rings. George was a former Boxer and was friends with my father. Turk's later moved to the SW corner of Central & baseline and than to the 6607 S Central location and sold it sometime in the med 90's. Sorry To See It Closed
