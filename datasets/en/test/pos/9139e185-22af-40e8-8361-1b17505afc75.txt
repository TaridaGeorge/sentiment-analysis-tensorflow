I don't care how bad the service is or how weird some of the customers in there but when I can find things with huge reductions and still great quality I give it 5 stars. 

I mean 
Nice dress shirts: check
Ties: check
iPod charger: check
Chuck Taylor's: check
Pots and pans: check
All cheap: chachacheck

Five stars hand down
