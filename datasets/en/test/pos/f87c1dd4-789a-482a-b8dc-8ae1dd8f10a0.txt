My jaw dropped when I stumbled onto this place. I could not believe that a store like this existed outside of a city on either coast. This store is truly a slice of geek heaven in the form of toys, clothing, and even a boss selection of hard-to-find magazines. Knowing a place like this is around really makes me happy and I just pray that it stays open and survives this horrible economy.When it comes to vinyl culture they offer everything and more you could find at a Kid Robot or Giant Robot store.
