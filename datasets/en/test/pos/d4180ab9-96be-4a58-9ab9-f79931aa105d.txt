What a great family owned, non-corporate restaurant.  We have visited this establishment many times and the food is always fresh, delicious and unique.  Sarah provides the greatest service, we appreciate it very much.  It is a wonderful experience - and to top off a great meal with yummy wine - a fantastic dessert!!  Try something different, you won't regret it!
