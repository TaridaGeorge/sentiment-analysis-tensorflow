The sandwiches here are really, really good. Sometimes I find myself in a coffee shop or lunch place that has a  salads/sandwich/soup based menu and find myself trying to figure out why more places don't try to be a little more original in their offerings. Echo Coffee has a couple great cold sandwiches and a couple great hot ones, and their pastries are all good too. Their lattes are smooth and perfect and float down your throat at just the right temperature. These people take coffee seriously and clearly love what they do, and it shows.
