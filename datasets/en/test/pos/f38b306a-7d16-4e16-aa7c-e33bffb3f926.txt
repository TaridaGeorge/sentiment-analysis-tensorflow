My wife and I just moved into the neighborhood west of 32 Shea. We have already been there 3 times in two weeks and it has become one of our staples. Excellent selection of wine and beer plus a 6a-6p Happy Hour. The food and desserts are delicious. I really like the bruschetta, roast beef sliders and Nutella cheesecake. Rebecca (sp?), the owner, is very friendly and fun. Highly recommended!
