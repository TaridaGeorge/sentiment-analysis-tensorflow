Great place for a quiet evening with friends.  good wine and unpricy selections.

we were hungry and gotten the half soup and sandwich combos which were all good and nicely prepared.  the portions are not too tiny too.

I like the ambience here very much and it reminds me of how kazmeriz in downtown scottsdale used to be, before it got famous.  so dun swamp this place with your wannabe friends :)  bring nice people okay :)
