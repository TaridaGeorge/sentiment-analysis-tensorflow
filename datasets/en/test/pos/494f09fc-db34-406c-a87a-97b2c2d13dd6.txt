I am extremely picky about my creme brulee.  I make my own and go all out when I do.  I'm talking buyin vanilla beans.  Fresh eggs.  The whole 9.  Torched Goodness is FANTASTIC.  I had the cappuccino on the recommendation of owner and couldn't have been happier.  What a welcome addition to the Phoenix food scene.
