It's always very busy so this isn't your best choice if you're in a hurry.  I've only eaten here at lunch so I don't know what dinner service is like.

The "Heck of Slice" is usually what I order. It's fast and a great value.  The pizza is nice Chicago-style with a crisp crust and tangy sauce.

The Pizza Cookie is a tasty desert but since it's usually shared (it's made from a 1/2 pound of cookie dough) it gets messy looking fast.

Parking at this location can be a real pain, and I'd recommend going right when they open at 11am if you want to minimize all the hassles that come with a very popular place.
