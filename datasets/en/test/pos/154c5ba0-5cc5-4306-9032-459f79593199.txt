This place is off the chain!  Everytime I go, I want to go back the next day.  I don't even like beans, but I like their beans.  I've gotten the combo platter and it usually lasts me 2 meals.  Very reasonably priced.  Great service!  Very clean.  If you're looking for Latin food outside the box, check this place out :)
