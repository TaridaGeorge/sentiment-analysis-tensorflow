Great atmosphere + great food means you will almost always have to wait for a seat... But the wait is worth it!  Wedding soup, wings of fire, a heck of a slice, and a daily deep dish special... The list of special selections just keeps going.  My pick?  Try the "Big Rig" (which might be best if shared) and save some room for the best pizzookie you can find!
