Holy monkeys, I didn't expect this to happen, but my opinion of this place just increased in an explosion of "YAY"ness!

I've been going there for some time now... probably nigh on a year. Somehow, in all this time of getting lunches there, I managed to overlook the roasted pork with plum sauce. NO LONGER will I make such a mistake! I feel like I have an orgy of flavor in my mouth right now. Seriously, this is good. I don't know what they did to it. Maybe I'm delusional. Maybe I'm just really really hungry.... whatever it is, I am in love with this food right now.

Mmmmm, back to nomming....
