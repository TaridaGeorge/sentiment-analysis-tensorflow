I recently had to get some sockets, switches and a new fan installed in one of our front rooms. Jerry from Good Guys came out for a quote the same day I called, quoted me 2.5 hours worth of work and pointed out the areas they expect to be working. Jerry gave me an estimate on his arrival time and was able to come do the work the next day.
 Jerry and his co-worker were both very friendly, professional, and had an overall good vibe to them.
 I was delighted to see that the bill came out to even less than what I expected including tax, service, and parts. I was very pleased with what was promised and what was delivered. I will definitely be calling Good Guys again for future work and would recommend them to anybody else looking for some electrical work to be done.
