Just about my favorite place in Arizona. I love to run, bike or walk around at this park. They also have boat rentals which I recommend! Great for a picnic or having ice cream with friends. The view at sunset is breathtaking! They have events like beer fests, marathons and concerts throughout the year. And the best fireworks in the area for the Fourth of July. If you love the outdoors and haven't been here, you are missing out!
