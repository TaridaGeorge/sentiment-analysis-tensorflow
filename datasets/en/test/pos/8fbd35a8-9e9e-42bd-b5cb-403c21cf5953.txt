This was the kind of modern sports bar I like.  My cousin and I went here on the advice of another bar (guess not rivals down here) for us to find a Buffalo Sabres Hockey game on satellite.  Good move, the bar manager was nice and friendly and kind enough to get a feed for us to watch the hockey game.  Liked the beer, but glass was like fit for a kind -- it was huge goblet.
I met the hostess/waitress and struck up a nice friendship, chatted a bit with her.  
This a good place to visit on a stop in Phoenix..
