We have been to this place multiple times and the food is great every time. I have noticed they have changed the menu over the years, but the changes have all been really good! My favs are the bbq pork quesadilla and the ahi tuna salad. Portions are very large so feel free to share. Their brunch is also good. I prefer more of a traditional breakfast, but the entrees they have are just as good. Love sitting at the bar and the service is always great.
