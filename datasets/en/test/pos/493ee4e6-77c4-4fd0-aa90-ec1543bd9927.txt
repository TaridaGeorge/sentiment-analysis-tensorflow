When I lived in Ohio a Jersey Mike's opened up next to my work. They brought us a tray of free subs to sample and I have been hooked ever since. The review that claimed this place was at all like Subway have obviously never actually been to a Jersey Mike's. From the freshness of the meats to the size of the Giant (what I always get, ya im a fatty) everything is an upgrade. 

I generally get either one of the Philly's on the menu or the Buffalo Chicken. Both are absolutely amazing. Over the past 5 years im pretty sure I have sampled every sub on the JM menu (and have the receipts and free sub card things to prove it). Before you go, look at their website and decide which type you want. Knowing before you get there makes it much easier.
