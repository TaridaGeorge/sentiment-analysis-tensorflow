At long last - a pizza joint that calls themselves "New York Style" and they're ACTUALLY RIGHT!!!  There's nothing "fancy" about these slices, but trust me - having eaten at several "hole in the wall" joints in NYC - including @ the subway stations - this is IT.  This is New York pizza to a tee.  

Very friendly staff.  I only wish the place was bigger to accommodate the crowd.  The $3.50 lunch deal is a STEAL and they don't skimp on the size of the slices.  It's a tad on the greasy side, which lends to its authenticity as New York style pizza.
