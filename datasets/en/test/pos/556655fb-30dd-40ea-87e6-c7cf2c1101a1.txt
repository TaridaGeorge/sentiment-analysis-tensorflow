Lovely! Just lovely! We started out with the Asian Nachos to kick off the Girls Weekend celebrating our girl Shenna birthday. The Asian Nachos were OFF THE HOOK! I had the other two items of the Tapas menu: Mahi Mahi tacos and vegetable Tempura. Washed down with a huge Washington Apple Martini. YUM! The girls were having the Sangria drink special. Looked good but I'm a martini girl. Check out the highlight in a little for the morning after heh heh
