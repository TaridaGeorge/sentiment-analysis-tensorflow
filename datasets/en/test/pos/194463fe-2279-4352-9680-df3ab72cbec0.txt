Everytime I'm in Tempe I have to stop here.  The white bread is delicious.  The flan is amazing.  The curry-pan (curry filled bread) is almost as good as what you buy in Japan.  The cakes are expensive, but the quality is so much better than what you get at a grocery store.  If you're traveling within 10 miles of this place, do yourself a favor and stop here.  Your stomach will thank you =)
