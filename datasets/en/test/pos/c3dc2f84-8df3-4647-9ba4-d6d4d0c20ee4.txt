Amazing!  

We arrived 15 minutes before they opened and the host happily opened the door, got us seated and invited us to water and a menu while the kitchen finished setting up.  The wait staff is fantastic!  Friendly, knowledgable and patient.

Food was amazing!  I had the pozole and it was out of this world with flavor.  My friend had Cowboy Hash and was in love!  We had to order a side of the biscuits and gravy (a special order - not the full order just 2 biscuits and gravy - the waitress was friendly and accommodating!).

Since it was Sunday morning . . . we were daring and had the bloody Mary's!  OMG!  Very tasty - not all tomato juice or spicy - just perfectly flavored!

We'll be back again this week!  

Spread the word about this local gem!!!
