Red Hot Robot is unique in all ways.  As the name suggests they sell plenty of robot themed items as well as related Japanese inspired toys.  I love this place.  I saw it front the street and was curious to go inside and do not regret it.  I found some off the wall magnets, Family Guy inspired figurines and a Lego book for my five year old.  It is a great place to find a gift for the someone who is next to impossible to please.  

Tonight I will be stopping by to get some small, but worthy gifts.  
If you are in the neighborhood, stop by.

It is a great place to spend about twenty minutes and twenty dollars. 

Parking is plentiful and there are some other fun places nearby.
