I will definitely come back to his Discount Tire location. Our mechanic, Jesse, was incredibly helpful, professional, and friendly, and helped me lower the price of 4 new tires on my 4WD Ford Explorer exponentially. Such a great deal! And only took 30 minutes! Would definitely recommend them so a family member or friend.
