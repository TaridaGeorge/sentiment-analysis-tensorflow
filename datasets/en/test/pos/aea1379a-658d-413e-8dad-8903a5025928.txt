Santisi's is perfect. You can sit at the bar, sit at a table or booth- or sit on the patio with misters. There is food here - lots of excellent pizzas, and seafood! This place must have a crazy electric bill, so many big TVs everywhere. Beer is served in icy mugs mmmm
The service is great and they pay attention to you.


UPDATE:
watch your BILL! Mine has always run about 40/50 $ and one day I asked to split the bill. My 5.75 appetizer magically turned into a 9.75 appetizer because of the servers "handwriting". All this time we been paying it and givin high handy tips like mad. Now all of a sudden I realize they been doing all kinds of arbitrary math on me and my sister.
Watch your bill and don't be ashamed to have it "itemeized". That shit is scandalous
