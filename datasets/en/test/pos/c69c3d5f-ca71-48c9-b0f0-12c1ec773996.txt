I walked to Chloe's Corner while on a break from Jury Duty.  I ordered the tuna melt and a bowl of tomato soup.  The sandwich was huge and melty and gooey.  It hit the spot.  The tomato soup was sort of thin, but the flavor was top notch.  The price point was very affordable.  If I worked downtown, I'd be here all the time.  The food was so good, that when I walked back to the courthouse and got released from Jury Duty immediately, I wasn't even angry that they could have released us before lunch.
