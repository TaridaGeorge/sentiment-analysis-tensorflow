Shannon at Fiesta Flowers was really wonderful to work with for our wedding centerpieces, bouquets, and boutineers. She was very helpful- she worked with me while I was trying to figure out what I wanted, while keeping our budget in mind. We followed her suggestions, and were please with the result. She asked for pictures, and I gave her some of bouquets I really liked. I absolutely loved the bouquets she created for our big day, as well as the "guest book table" centerpiece. I chose to supply our own vases, and I loved that I could do that. Shannon also seemed excited to use edelweiss (an Austrian flower) in my bouquet, even though she hadn't worked with that particular flower before. It meant a lot to me that it was in my bouquet. We would definitely recommend Fiesta Flowers!
