For a fast food chain restaurant on a Friday night it was awesome!  The staff was friendly and helpful, the restaurant and facilities were spotless and the manager even came over and chatted with us personally.  We were the only ones eating in at the time, all the traffic was in the to go line, and he took a moment to come over.  My 3 year old starting chatting with him and he asked him for a toy, since their kids meals don't come with one, and as we left he even handed him a free milkshake. So sweet!
