Deceiving from the outside with it's location in a strip mall, we were curious about the rave reviews we were reading......Rest assured, (after being back at least a dozen times), those rave reviews were well justified.  Service: great, food: great, Prices: reasonable for the quality and quantity, atmosphere: once through the front door very pleasant.  Overall,  a very comfortable evening with good food and service!
