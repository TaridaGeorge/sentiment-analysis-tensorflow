This is one of my favorite places to eat in chandler. We come about once a week, and the staff knows what I order as soon as I walk in--mint chicken and garlic green beans. Yum! I've never had either dish any place else, and I find myself craving them throughout the week. My mom likes to mix it up, so I know the lemongrass chicken, lemongrass beef, and various phos and curries are awesome, but I have a hard time ordering anything but mint chicken. Seriously, it's so so good. 

Friendly staff, clean dining room, and great food... who could ask for anything more?!
