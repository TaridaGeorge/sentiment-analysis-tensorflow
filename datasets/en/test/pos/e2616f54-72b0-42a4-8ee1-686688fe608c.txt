I have been to dim sum places in Boston, Orlando, Memphis, Atlanta, and Westminster. This place is one of the finest and it's right here in Chandler! The staff was very friendly and the presentation was top notch. Not to mention very clean! I came here on a Sunday brunch and they had dim sum served in carts. You select what you want and wha-lah! Another plus is the receipt on the table makes it very easy to determine how much you owe without question. Not many dim sum places make it this easy to calculate. If you're in the mood for dim sum, come here. Also, there was minimal communication barriers with the servers. A+
