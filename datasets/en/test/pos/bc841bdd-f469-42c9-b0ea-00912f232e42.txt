Looking for the best salad around?  Try Donna's Summer Salad at The Painted Horse.  It has assorted greens, gorgonzola, mixed berries, toasted walnuts, raspberry vinaigrette and bits of chicken white meat.  It's great for lunch and it's a nice side at dinner.

I order it as the "Donna Summer Disco Salad," which went over my young server's head recently, LOL!
