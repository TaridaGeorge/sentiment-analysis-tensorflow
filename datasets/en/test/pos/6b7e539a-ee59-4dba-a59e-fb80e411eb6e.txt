Over Easy was featured on Diners, Drive-in's, and Dives.

I've been to Over Easy several times, and I never leave disappointed. Today I decided to order the Chicken Fried Steak and it was awesome.

The Chicken Fried Steak is topped with country gravy and an egg cooked as you like it. It also comes with some great tasting hash browns on the side. The Country gravy has the perfect amount of spice to it, the egg was delicious, and the hash browns were cooked perfectly. 

Over Easy has one of the most extensive and unique breakfast menus that you will find and is one of the best breakfast joints that I've been to in the country.

Great food, very reasonable prices, awesome selection, unique menu options, and friendly service gives Over Easy a well deserved five star rating.
