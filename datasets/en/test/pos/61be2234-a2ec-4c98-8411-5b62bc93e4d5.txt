One word. Fabulous.

Another word(s). Go there. Eat.

That's all there is to it.  It's fabulous, and you should go there, and eat.

We had the roasted parsnip soup.  I did not know that soup could be this good.  Then the mussels with butter and something else with a little more butter, I'm sure. Perfection.

The house made mozzarella is an inspiration.

Honestly...eat at Cafe Bink. Do it whenever you can.  Soooooooo super good. You will not regret it.
