One of my favorite Thai restaurants around town. Their Pad Thai is excellent, decent portion size - my boyfrined love this dish called The Siamese Twins - chicken and shrimp dish with bamboo in a green curry sauce - YUMMY!

It is kind of located in an awkward location - but don't let that discourage you. Definitely a great place to go when you are craving Thai!
