Mmm, I love this place!  The ramen here seems like a healthier fresher version of the stuff you can get in Little Tokyo, Los Angeles, CA!  I wonder if the owner is from California...

Anyways, the ramen here is quite delicious!  The variety of vegetables makes me feel like I ate something healthy versus eating something super heavy like pho can do at times.  

I have the miso ramen with spam and gyoza combination and it was amazing.  The gyoza itself impressed me the most since I myself work at a Chinese restaurant [oh yes, I'm entitled to be a gyoza elitest].  

I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone!
