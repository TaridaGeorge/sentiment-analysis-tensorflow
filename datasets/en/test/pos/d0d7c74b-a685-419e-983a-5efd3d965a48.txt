I've been to Giant over a dozen times since my first review, and I'll proudly admit it's  hands down my favorite. coffee joint. ever.

Quality and consistency are always spot on, ambience/music are killer, and the baristas are always so friendly. The Honey Vanilla Latte is where it's at, and the iced coffee is amazing as well. Sometimes it's hit or miss with the pastries, but as long as I'm sipping on that splendid latte I could care less. 

People, it's seriously so good.
