First time Pho eater so I have no frame of reference but I definitely know what all the rave is about after eating at Pho Chandler, I loved this soup! 
I also tried their fried rice since it's an Asian dish I'm familiar with and love so much and it was really good, lots of veggies.

The servers were super sweet.

Didn't know this before hand but we saw most people bringing their own wine to drink, awesome, we will definitely be back!
