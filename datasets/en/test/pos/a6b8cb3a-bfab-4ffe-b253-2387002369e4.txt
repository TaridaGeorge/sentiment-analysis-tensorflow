Pratically made this account just to write about this place.

I Loved it here. Im from California but im planning to move to Phoenix and I wanted to see what can be grown in Phoenix, so i made my boyfriend stop at this exotic place and gosh! There were so many more varieties than I anticipated. Even Lychee! My personal asian fruit favorite!

Its not in a good neighborhood and it looked kind of shabby, however it was absolutely WORTH the visit. the people knew what they were talking about and they knew their product so well. I was very happy, i'd definitely will come back when i move to Phoenix!!
