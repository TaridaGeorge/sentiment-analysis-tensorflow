I'm really happy with this gym.  Would highly recommend it to anyone, the group fitness classes alone are worth the membership costs even if you only go a few times a month.

I also like the LifeCafe restaurant inside...I love the pesto chicken salad (if you need extra protein after your workout tell them to throw in some spicy peanuts ...sooo good with that salad.)
