First let me say, as a woman from Chicago and a Chef, I am very hard to please when it comes to Chicago style food. So many of the places around here make claims that they never seem to love up to. 

Lobby's is not one of those. Besides the very friendly staff (another thing you don't find often in this valley), the food is wonderful. Hands down my favorite place to get comfort food when I'm home sick. 

The burgers are THE BEST I've had in the valley. He does not cut corners, his pruduct is top of the line. Flavorful, juicey and delicious. 

Portion sizes are great, my only negetive is that the cheese fries need to be a little crispier to hold up to the cheese (and more cheese lol) 

Only thing missing from the menu, Cheese Sticks, Fried Mushrooms and Tamale Boats ;)
