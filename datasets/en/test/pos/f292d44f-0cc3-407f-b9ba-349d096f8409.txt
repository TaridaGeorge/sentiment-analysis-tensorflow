I actually enjoy going here....My kids like it also.  My kids get the short rib.  You should get it here also.....

Go during happy hour, I personally love the Kona beer and lower prices on the happy hour menu.  Great outdoor seating, when its not 100+.  The servers are excellent and we almost where going to the point the servers remembered us?  Happy hour prices with excellent food.  Lobster potstickers, Kona beer, and maybe some tuna tartar for lunch?  great refreshing ambience and great food. Can't get Lobster potstickers anywhere else I have been thus far.....

I had to give it 5 stars, because I have gone here so many times......great food always brings me back....
