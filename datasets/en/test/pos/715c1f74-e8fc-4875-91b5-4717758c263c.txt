I went back to Copper Star today. I ordered a vegan apple cinnamon muffin, which was much better than the pastry I had last time. The cinnamon was oozing out of it and I never would have guessed it was vegan! 

The staff was also super friendly today, and they helped me choose an iced green tea (which came in a 7/11 Slurpee size cup...dang!). It took me an hour to sip the whole thing down but there's no rush here! It seems like a good place to hang out!
