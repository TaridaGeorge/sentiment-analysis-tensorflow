This place is always popping with patrons during lunch. I would say one of the healthier choices when it comes to eating out. I always order their half sandwich and half soup deal. Love the French Onion and the Potato Cream soups. As for the sandwich I dig them all. The portions are just right for me and truthfully just right for most of us.  Quality over quantity is what I preach; so quit stuffing your face until you feel like you need to pop (SEVEN - Ouch!). 

The place has outdoor seating except I wouldn't sit there since traffic around the complex is pretty hectic.  All that dust flying around means extra salt in my diet I guess.  Indoor seating is recommended, but during lunchtime -- good luck finding a seat. I wish the place would expand! - Enjoy!
