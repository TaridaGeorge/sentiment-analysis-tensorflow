One of my favorite places to take my 3 and 4 year old. Only drawback is it gets really crowded- especially with the school groups so we call early to see how many school groups there are and then we decide if its worth it or not. They sometimes host 500 kids at this museum and thats just not fun. Other than that this place is amazing.
