will definitely be back. Our steaks were incredible as always, wife got the filet, I got the boneless ribeye. First time getting the ribeye, and next time I will stay with filet. The filet's at Ruth Chris are boarderline magical. Jeanie was our waitress, and she was wonderful. Her wine recommendation was top notch, suggesting the pinot noir "Duckhorn." Alex assisted her and he did an awesome job as well. Overall, just a great, professionally-relaxed dining experience.
