We had our anniversary dinner there, we wanted top notch sea food and boy did we get it!! Our service  was fantastic and our night was topped off with the manager delivering us our desert. She asked how our meal was as well as congratulating us on our special night. I give five stars to the food the staff especially the manager "Kari" it showed great hospitality. 
Good job Kings Fish House we will be back:)
