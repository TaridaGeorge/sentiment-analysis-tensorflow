Sprouts is a true gem!  Whole Foods on a budget!  Their vegetables, fruits and meats are top notch.  They grind their own hamburg, make their own sausages, which are outstanding.  They also have bulk items, a wide selection of organic, natural and homeopathic products.  I can't say enough good things about this store.  We are snowbirds here and I will definitely miss Sprouts!  Hope you're planning on expanding East -- all the way to Massachusetts!
