My husband and I went to Flight Lounge last Saturday for the very first time and we loved it! the service was great!
Honestly, neither my husband nor I drink alcohol ( which is very weird for Argentinean) so other than orange juice we asked for a lot of water, they never had a problem, and they treated our "water" as any other drink, we would get every glass of water with a cherry on top!. Great Atmosphere and music. Definitely will be back!
