Babbo Italian Eatery is a cute little Italian restaurant. The restaurant itself looked modern and cozy. The service was awesome. Our waiter checked up on us numerous of times and was very friendly. Now for the food, OMG what can I say. I love Italian food and love pasta. I could eat any type of past for one week straight! It was my very first time eating here, I was really hungry and didn't know what was good on the menu. I decided to play it safe and order the "Alfredo Supremo" which was a white wine, garlic cream alfredo sauce over a bed of linguine with chicken. It was filled with flavor and was yummy to my tummy! The bread that's served as a complimentary appetizer was awesome as well. I really recommend eating at Babbo's if your in the mood for tasty pasta dishes!
