I'm so surprised no one wrote a review about this place! 

Came here over the weekend... it's a new club in Scottsdale and I'm in love with it! Bartenders are full of energy and aren't stingy with your choice of liquor... VIP hosts were incredibly friendly... even the gogo dancers are sexy as hell - no fur boots and tacky outfits at this spot!

Definitely the new go-to-spot in Scottsdale. It gets crazy packed and the music is unreal... the DJ has to be one of the best I've heard. If you prefer quiet and less crowded - definitely have to go somewhere else. But that's boring, so don't!
