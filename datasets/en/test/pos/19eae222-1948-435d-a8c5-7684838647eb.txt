YUM.
I LOVE coming here for dinner.  The food is always superb.  I think it's amazing that we have such a great seafood place in the middle of the desert.  First off, the service here is first class.  They know what they are talking about if they recommend you something and are always incredibly polite and respectful.  I have found one of my all time favorite dishes at this restaurant and hardly ever order anything different when i'm here, it's the Hong Kong style Seabass.  It's delicious and always perfectly cooked.  Pair it with a side of the crab fried rice too.  I've sampled quite a few other things as well and everything is always perfectly done.  If you like seafood, you'll like coming here.  and save room for desert!  they always have really good ones.
