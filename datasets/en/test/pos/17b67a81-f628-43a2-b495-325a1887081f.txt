I am ALL About the Maple Long John!!!

Made the stop this morning for a little Christmas Eve Eve dozen for My Battle Buddies in "The Cubes"! Haha. They are so warm and moist this early in the morning. I do recommend that you try to make the short drive on over to The the Rainbow for a tasty treat. Have an Amazing Day Arizona!
