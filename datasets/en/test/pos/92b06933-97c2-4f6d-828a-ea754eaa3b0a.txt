I work for the Phoenix Fire Department and you will see me here almost every Saturday night. The coffee is exceptional and the customer service is alwyas nice. Its a nonpretentious douchebag place and the vibe is no corporate. Its a nice change of pace in my life and I enjoy it. You will also find me here now on random nights with my laptop watching a movie and enjoying a coffee as I am just so relaxed when I am here.

Great coffee, good atmosphere and a great addition to downtown,,
