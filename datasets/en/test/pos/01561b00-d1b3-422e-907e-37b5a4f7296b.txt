What a great store concept!  Little Jewelz doesn't feel like a second hand store, instead you feel like your walking into a super chic boutique. The clothes and jewelry are so cute and trendy!  This is my favorite place to shop for my kids and to sell all the cute stuff they've outgrown! The customer service is excellent too!
