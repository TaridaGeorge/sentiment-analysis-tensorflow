A friend of mine told me of Eliana's because I was familiar with Salvadoran food from L.A. and lamented that I couldn't find a good place in Phoenix.  I was happily surprised to find the food as good as it was there.

That was in 1998.  I come here every so often when I get a "hankering" for Pupusas and have become very familiar with the proprietor and his family.  AWESOME food, AWESOME service, AWESOME ambience!
