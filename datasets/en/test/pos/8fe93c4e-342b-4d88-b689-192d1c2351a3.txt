I've had both breakfast and lunch here (yes in the same day), both were amazing! Service was great, and fast (I went there on a Friday morning). For breakfast I had the mushroom & cheese stuffed omelet smothered with a sherry cream sauce, served with olive bread. VERY rich, but delicious.   They always give me a cup of coffee to go, love their attention to detail. For lunch I had the Arrogant Bastard Burger (local organic beef from the Stockyards), very tasty & huge.  They have free wi-fi and covered parking next door in the parkade.
