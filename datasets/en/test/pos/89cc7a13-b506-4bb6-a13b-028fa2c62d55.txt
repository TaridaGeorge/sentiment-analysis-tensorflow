Freakin awesome food, atmosphere and service! This is the kind of place that makes me miss living in the city. Off the beaten path, unique character, and a great value. Whenever Salt River Rafting (www.RaftTheSalt.com) has a spring whitewater rafting season we will be taking the crew here for a guide appreciation dinner without fail. Outstanding!
