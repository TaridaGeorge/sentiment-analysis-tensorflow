Don't let the long, slim, dining room and strange neon signs deter you... Yes, the decor and architecture is a little strange, but the food is so flavorful and the service SO FAST and friendly, you will be so thankful you tried our luck on this unique little place. 

Coconut curries are my favorite, and while the prices are not cheap, it is comparable to everything else in the area... especially for the large portions that will easily feed two people or make for great left-overs!
