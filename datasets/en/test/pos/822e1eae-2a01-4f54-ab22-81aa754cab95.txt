Really yummy food in large quantities at a great price. The ingredients are fresh, the salad portions are substantial, there are tons of different menu options, and the food is tasty...hard to beat that for a lunch break from work or dinner with the family. The bread bowl pasta (pesto penne) is genius. The Oregano's Favorite salad is amazing and very substantial. It's full of fresh vegetables, tons of cheese, and wonderful toasted pine nuts. I could eat this salad over and over, and the portion size is big enough to make it an actual meal
