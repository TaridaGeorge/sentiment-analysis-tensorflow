I can frankly say that the real frozen yogurt craze has had my attention for the past couple of years.  I have frequented Red Mango, Froyo, and a few other establishments in my day, and Yogurtland has become my favorite.

$0.30/ounce, a plethora of flavors, and 15+ toppings to choose from.  You can even sample the flavors before grabbing a bowl and making a flavor commitment. How can you go wrong?  It helps that their employees look as if they actually enjoy working there, and I'm always pleasantly surprised by the total at the register.  

I'm lactose retarded and the drive, crazy parking, line on Saturday, and uncomfortable aftermath are definitely worth it.  Go put some frozen yogurt love in your stomach.  Trust me, it needs it.
