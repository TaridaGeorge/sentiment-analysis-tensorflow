Best haircut ever for our 13-year-old Danny!

BellyRubz totally understood that our Senior 100+ pound guy needed special care and they provided it. They gave us a "first-in/first-out" appointment on less than 24 hours notice. The staff helped him keep his back legs up while the groomer worked on him and they had him ready in no time. 

After a grooming, Danny usually hibernates for the rest of the day, he's usually dehydrated and has to poop right away. Not this time, he's calm and happily enjoying his usual daily activities.

Thank you Michael and staff for making a usually painful experience such a joy.
