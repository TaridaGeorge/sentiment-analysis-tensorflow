Left a message for Stacy who called back very promptly.  She and Dr. Pehoushek were able to fit my son in same day to remove a jawline cyst.  Another dermatologist had suggested a plastic surgeon due to proximity to nerves.  Dr. Pehoushek had no such concerns and quickly and thoroughly removed the cyst.  He was professional and personable!  My son has other cysts and will not hesitate to go back for his treatment.  Since I have a Yelp account he asked me to write the highest recommendation for him.
