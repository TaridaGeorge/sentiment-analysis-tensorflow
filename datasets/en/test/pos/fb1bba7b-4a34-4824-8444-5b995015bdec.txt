Heaven. Fuego is just heaven. This super small, yet charming place is our favorite!! The menu is unique, and delish!! The creamed corn is to die for, I am talking unbelievable!! 
Thirsty? Their mojito selection is insane and they have an even better happy hour. 
Only negative is, that because of its small size, it fills up fast. reservations are a must!
