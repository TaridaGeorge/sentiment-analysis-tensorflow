This little Polish restaurant tucked in downtown Glendale is authentic and warm. I went for lunch and had the tomato, basil, and mozzarella sandwich, which was outstanding! Next time I go, I will try out some of the more "polish" dishes such as the sauerkraut and sausages.

It is only open a few evenings a week for dinner but it is BYOB or bring your own wine..a hard to come by perk in most Glendale restaurants.
