I'm in trouble, real trouble with this joint.  It is the most delicious BBQ I've ever had.  No more "chains" for me, now it's all about Pork on a Fork.  They are two doors down from where I work so it's super convenient to get my pulled pork fix.  I could really just make a meal out of their sides as well. The coleslaw was fresh and crisp. Baked beans tasted smoky and sweet.  Oh and don't let me forget about the crispy on the outside, tender on the inside sweet potatoe fries.

I ordered a pulled pork sandwich and a beef brisket sandwich. Both were enough to feed me for 4 days!  There was a lot of meet on those sandwiches.

All in all, my belly is happy, even if my waistline is not.  :)
