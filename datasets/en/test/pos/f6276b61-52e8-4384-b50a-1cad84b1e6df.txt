Can't begin to explain how wonderful and helpful Affordable Party & Event Rentals were for our wedding! 

Each time we called to make a change to our order or ask a question, there was always someone available to help us and talk through our concerns. We were never left "hanging" or felt like we were being rushed or pressured. Their prices were considerably less expensive than other rental companies we look at, but the quality of their merchandise was second to none. Their relaxed and easygoing attitude help put us at ease throughout the entire process.

If you need to rent tables, chairs, dance floors, glasses, silverware, table cloths or anything else, look no further than these fine folks!
