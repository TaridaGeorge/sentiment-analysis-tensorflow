absolutely love fujiya market
while i am not proficient in my reading of kanji characters
i usually just let my stomache dictate what im gonna buy
and you just cant go wrong here
the bento boxes are made fresh daily, and you never know what they're gonna have
the sushi is phenomenal and also made fresh daily
i love the ease and affortability this market offers
anyone and everyone in the greater hipster compton area should patronize el mercado de fujiya!
