Why does this place only have an average of three stars?  My boyfriend and I try to come here at least once a month and their punch cards makes it worth it when you get enough punches for a free meal :) I'm not a big egg fan so I usually get pancakes or french toast which are always on par.  Their service is always fast and efficient so you can't get much better than this place!
