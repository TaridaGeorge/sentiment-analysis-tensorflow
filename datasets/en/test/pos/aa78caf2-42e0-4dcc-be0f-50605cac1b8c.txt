This is my favorite place in the Scottsdale area hands down.  Amazing food, nice crowd and always consistant.  And it is never to loud - I recall going to Mastro's thinking it would be a "nice" place and felt like I surrounded by a bunch of over grown Frat Boys with too much money to blow - money doesn't mean class!

Being from Los Angeles and being spoiled by some great spots - this place is so wonderful and always have such a nice vibe.  I do however wish they would make their portions larger!
