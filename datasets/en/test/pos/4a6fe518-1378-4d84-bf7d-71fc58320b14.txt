I get the hot pastrami on sesame seed bagel with swiss and thousand island dressing. The cheese is melted into the soft interior of the bagel while the hot pastrami and dressing combine to a wonderful flavor, topped by the chewy outer crust of the sesame studded bagel...  wheew  sorry

It comes with a drink and chips for $6.99.
