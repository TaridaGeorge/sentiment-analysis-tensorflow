Arrived in town on March 22.  I had a feeling this was a hot, new spot because a couple friends were checking in here 2-3 times a week.  My friend Michael T. mentioned we'd stop by when I got hungry.  It was a great way to end my first day in town.

I ordered the seasoned wings, sweet potato fries, and a grape Kool-Aid.  The wings were crispy, meaty, and seasoned perfectly.  You could tell they were cooked fresh.    The same could be said about the sweet potato fries.  They were fresh and crispy.  Washing that all down with grape Kool-aid just made everything better.  The Kool-Aid is a little spendy at $2.99, but you get free refills so drink away.

I will definitely be frequenting this place on a regular basis.  I'm looking forward to trying out the other wing flavors and other stuff on the menu.
