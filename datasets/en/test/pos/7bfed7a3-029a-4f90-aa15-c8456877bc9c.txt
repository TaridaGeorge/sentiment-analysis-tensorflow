Went to this location last night to celebrate my birthday. I was so impressed by EVERY staff member and how polite and professional they all were. We interacted with the hostesses, bartenders, our server, and a manager and every single one of them was truly awesome. 
Great food, great wine, and great dessert. Will definitely come back when we want a nice steak place!
