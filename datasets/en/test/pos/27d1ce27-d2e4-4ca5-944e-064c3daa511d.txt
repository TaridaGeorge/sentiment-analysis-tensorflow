Wow, what a great scrapbooking store!  This place has it all.  Ribbon, paper, all kinds of supplies a girl could dream of.  I believe they have a lab in the center of the store as well.  Great place for the serious scrapbooker, or the beginner looking to get ideas for just about any project.  Definately worth the trip.
