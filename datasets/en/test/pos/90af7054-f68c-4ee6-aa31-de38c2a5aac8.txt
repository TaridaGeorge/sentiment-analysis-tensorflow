If there is ever a time where a perfect review is due, this would be it.  There is absolutely nothing bad that can be said about this place because they are the bar in my opinion....epitome of a top notched world class hotel! They're doing something right with their staff because I have yet had anything less than a superb experience with any of their staff during a 3 night stay.  There is absolutely no details that are overlooked whatsoever! I had a flawless experience from the service, to accommodation, to even the food!!! It is overall an awesome property.
