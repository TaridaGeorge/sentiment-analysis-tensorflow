I'm a fan of Dr. Weil, and my mom took me to True Foods on the way to the airport (I'm from San Francisco). I had Ahi Sliders and my sister got Spaghetti Squash Lasagna. We split a Kale Salad. Everything was amazing!!!! and so good for you! The waitress told us the Lasagna was only like 150 calories for the whole thing. (i think its thing on the menu). They also list which foods are gluten free!!! I went back again last time I was in AZ. I heard one opened up in Scottsdale, and I'll be going t that one next!
