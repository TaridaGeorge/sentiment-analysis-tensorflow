I say give 20% if you're happy. And we were! My hubby and I had dinner last night at Sakana. Believe it or not, we spent only $38 before 20% tip. 

Sakana is in par with my favorite sushi restaurant Yoshi but the former is way cheaper (San Francisco, Oakland). We ordered Agedashi Tofu, Tootsie roll, Soft Shell Crab Roll and Chicken Teriyaki. Apparently, they have a special if you buy a drink you get to choose an appetizer. The vegetable spring rolls (3 pieces, mind you) was delish.
If you're looking for a save-my-pocket-today kinda dinner, here is the place. Great place with great food.
