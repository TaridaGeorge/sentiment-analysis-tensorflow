We had a great dinner at Taggia the other night. Service was personal and attentive. Food was fabulous, we even got to meet the chef! They were able to accommodate my food allergies (which is great for being gluten free at an Italian restaurant). Sitting outside was a total delight. It was so great that we went the next night. We really love this place!
