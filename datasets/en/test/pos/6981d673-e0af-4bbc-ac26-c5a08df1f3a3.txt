This is the best frozen yogurt I have ever had. In fact, I never really liked frozen yogurt until I came here. 

They seem to have twice as many flavors as other yogurt places. My favorites and strawberry, cheesecake, french vanilla, and madagascar vanilla. All mixed together, with cheesecake bites and strawberries. Sooooooo good. 

It's also pretty clean here, and it smells so good. I want a yogurt land scented candle.
