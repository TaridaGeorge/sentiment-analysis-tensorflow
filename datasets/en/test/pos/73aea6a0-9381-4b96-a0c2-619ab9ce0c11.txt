Papago Park Is a great time! I never gone and been disappointed! It is one of the most fun, easiest, hikes you will ever do! I have been going there ever since i was a kid, and to this day i love going there! I do recommend that if you go bring water, especially in the summer time! You are better safe then sorry! it is great for the whole family everyone can do it and have fun! Highly recommended!
