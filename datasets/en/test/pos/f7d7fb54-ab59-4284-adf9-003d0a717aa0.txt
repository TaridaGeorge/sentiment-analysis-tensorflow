So after driving by this place dozens of times, a few friends and I decided to check it out and this place doesn't disappoint. Super tasty pizzas, great atmosphere, and great service. They have a bunch of specialty pizzas made with their own cheese blend and super fresh ingredients..place is spacious with big booths and tables. Cant wait to get back here to try all the other pizzas.
