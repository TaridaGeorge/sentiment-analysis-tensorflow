It's actually called 'La Piccola Cucina' and it is wonderful! They have awesome food, set up like a deli, or you can order a panini. The food is very fresh, and they also have fantastic gelato- the only gelato counter I know of in DT Phoenix. 

The atmosphere is so cool. It feels like a mediterranean sidewalk cafe - umbrellas, fountains, flowers, etc. They are barely open a month, so the hours will be expanding. I know they are closed on Monday and they close all other nights at 8pm, but the owner plans to stay open until midnight in the coming months. The only downside right now is no beer or wine, but the owner is working on that too.
