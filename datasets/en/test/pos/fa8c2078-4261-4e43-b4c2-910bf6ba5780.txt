AWESOME!! Happy Hour is phenomenal! The Golden Sauce for the Chicken Skewers is incredible. $1.50 for a slice of cheese pizza, $3 pints, $6 chicken skewers.

We have no experience sitting in the bar.

Looking over the other reviews I'm not sure what happened while they were there. We have never had a BAD experience there. One time we ordered something we didn't like- our problem. One minor issue that I don't even remember aside from remembering that they went above and beyond with a free dessert and Zipps cash to make it right. Then one night the dinosaur game wasn't working- we got our money refunded AND free pick of a couple dinosaurs for each kid from the game guy.

We come at happy hour and it's been great every time. We love it.
