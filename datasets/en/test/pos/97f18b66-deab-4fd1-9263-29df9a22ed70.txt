The place lives up to its name.  A+ experience.

Took my family to Scottsdale for R&R and got tired of eating at chain restaurants.  Decided to look for more interesting eatery and found a Vietnamese place near the resort.  Yelp reviews were really bad.  One of the reviews mentioned Unphogettable.  When I looked up Unphogettable on Yelp, there were many positive reviews.  Although the restaurant was 20 miles away, we took a chance and glad we did.

This was the first Pho restaurant that I've been to where staff were attentive.  Owner came by to ask if everything was ok.  Wow!  That was the first.

By the way, good food too!

We will definitely make an effort to go back while we are in town.
