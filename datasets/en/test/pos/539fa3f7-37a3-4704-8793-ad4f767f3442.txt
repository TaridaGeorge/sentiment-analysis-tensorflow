GC in Verrado has just gone under a ton of changes with staff, menu, and management.  This place has its kick back! 

You can't beat the amount of craft brews on tap. Nice to have a locally owned business providing such great beer. This place has a home-town feel, and reminds me of the show "Cheers." The servers really try and get to know the guests and provide the best service possible.  

This place is great for Friday night hangouts, Saturday football games and in-house entertainment, and anytime you want to take a break and have a cold beer after a long days work. Also, the wine list is impeccable.

If you are looking for a nice night out, come back to GC and check out the changes.  You won't be disappointed.
