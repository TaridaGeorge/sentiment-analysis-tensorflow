I was very happy when this location opened not too far from my work location I got hooked on Capriotti's while staying in Las Vegas a year ago. Nicely crafted sandwiches are found right here at this Tempe Capriotti's, the Bobbie's are legendary  and are scrumptious parcels of Thanksgiving anytime you wish to experience it. The Cheese Steaks be they beef or chicken are what you want even when you have no clue what you want; get them with fried onions, sweet or hot peppers, and mushrooms. When you check in here through the Yelp App you get a free bag of chips no purchase necessary. This location is right near ASU across from PF Chang's and parking can be found in the either the structure the meters that are near by.
