If you are ever in a bad mood or is having a lousy day, come to this Whole Foods and I guarantee that by the time you walk out, you'll feel better and you don't even have to buy anything for the mood picker upper. 
Yup, this store is just that great.  They've done everything right with this store. 
I've also noticed that Whole Foods must be responding to the economy cause their price points for many of their items seem lower too. 
Love this place!
