I love how you can go hiking outside..... across ravines, some steep climbs, quick runs, jump or skip across some small boulders, take some gorgeous photos -- all while still within a major metropolitan city!

It's great... you don't have to travel too far to get here. 

Weather has been absolutely gorgeous lately. We started off by parking in the Hopi lot, and then trekking out, over, above and beyond, and back for about 3.5 miles. It was great because when we were climbing up mostly we were in the shade. 

We encountered several other hikers, runners, runners w/ dogs, and mountain bikers. But it was never crowded. 

Great outdoor activity to appreciate Phoenix.
