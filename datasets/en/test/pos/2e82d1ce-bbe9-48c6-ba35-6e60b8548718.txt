This is hands down my favorite breakfast place to go to now.

First of all, they have fresh coffee outside that you can help yourself to. Secondly, there will probably be a wait but it's worth it and you can sip on coffee, sit in a big chair and people watch outside.

We had the bacon bloody marys which you seriously should try. Amazing!

We had the Hangover sandwhich and Southwest Flannel Hash. Both were superb and I couldn't finish the Southwest Flannel Hash but it made for amazing leftovers the next morning. 

The vibe inside is very trendy and fun. I loved the friendly service we received and will be back again and again! :)
