As far as Starbucks go, this one is my favorite.  The staff there is always so friendly and ready to serve you with a smile.  Unlike most coffee shops (that are run by hipsters and burnouts) these people truly care about you and what you've done with your day.  They are also the only store I've been to that asks me if I would like to try something different in my drink, like adding mocha to a chai or caramel sauce to the pumpkin spice.  There is always high turnover at places like this, so negative reviews should be taken with a grain of salt, as a large percentage of the staff is different from one year ago.
