I've been using Ron for 12 years.  Ron and Craig are awesome mechanics as is the rest of their team. Ron is always up front with all of the work being done and will tell you if he thinks something in not necessary. He has always come in at or well under his estimates to me and their work is guaranteed.
Every person I've refered them to has come back and thanked me and has become regular customers of theirs for all of their repair needs.
