Tried SBG last weekend for brunch and have been thinking about that meal ever since. Two words come to mind: absolutely delicious. Started off with an agua fresca (pineapple-mint), an iced tea and the mini quesadillas. The quesadillas were a fabulous start to the meal; followed that with the veggie omelet. OMG that thing was huge! Inside there was a delicious mix of calabacitas, veggies and cheese. The veggie hash that was served alongside was a great compliment. My dining partner had the huevos rancheros and loved it as it wasn't served the traditional way. SBG uses fried tortillas as the base and loads them up with eggs, guac, etc. making a sort of "huevos tostada" so to speak. Anyways, definitely worth checking out sometime if you haven't stopped in yet!
