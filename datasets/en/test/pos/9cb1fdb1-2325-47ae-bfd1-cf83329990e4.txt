I LOVE JIMMY JOHNS!!!!  

Delicious, fast, fresh, cheap, and they'll even deliver just one sandwich!!  Plus they're open late, to cater to the night crowd.     

I order from them at least twice a week, and usually get the turkey tom or the beach club. Their bread is delicious; they use real meats and cheeses (unlike Subway), and even have fresh sprouts (yum!). 

They don't toast their subs, so don't ask them  :)
