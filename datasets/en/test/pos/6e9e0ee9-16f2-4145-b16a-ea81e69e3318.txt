My favorite movie theater in town.  $5 movies before noon, nice neighborhood and surroundings, and not too many annoying ankle-biting children.  Yes, the escalators should just be made into fixed stairs.  I've had the privilege of riding an escalator one time in dozens of trips.  The smells in the parking garage are sometimes not fun, but it smells like roses compared to the clientele at Harkins AZ Mills.
