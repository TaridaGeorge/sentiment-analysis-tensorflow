Delicious!!!  Between my family of 4 we have probably tried most of the menu items at Sauce.  My daughters (5 yrs and 3 yrs) love the pizza and pasta with meatballs.  I hope Sauce comes out with more specials like the Summer Deal - $20 for pizza, salad and wine.  My favorite items so far are the Meatball Sandwich and the Chicken and Broccoli and cheese sauce.  I need to find out where Sauce gets the side pepper that comes with the Meatball Sandwich.  If you like peppers ask for an extra one as the peppers are really good (not spicy but sweet).  Can you tell I am a HUGE fan of Sauce?  If someone knows where I can buy those peppers let me know?
