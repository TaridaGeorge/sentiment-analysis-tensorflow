I have not been here is quite a while so I honestly do not know if anything has changed. This place is awesome. Its a great place to go for fun. For a date, out with friends/family, for exercise, and pretty much anything. i love how great you feel when you get to the top of the wall. They have easy areas for people like me, and hard areas for those that are more experienced. You do have to sign a waiver, which is pretty funny (you will die is the main point), but i did not find it to be deadly in the least. They have a video to teach you the right way to climb and then staff throughout to show and help you the whole time.
