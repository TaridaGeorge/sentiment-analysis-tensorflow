I have had two trips to Lindsay's Auto and both have been great.  I felt completely comfortable with the level of service. I know they are honest and do a great job.  Recently I took my husbands truck in to have it looked at and evaluated, and I was told exactly what was a priority and what was not.  They are simply easy to deal with, straightforward and honest, you can't ask for any more with a Auto shop.
