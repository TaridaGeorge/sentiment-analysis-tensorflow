Wandered in this jewel of a shop today during the Yelp Scavenger Hunt and wow! I can't wait to come back and buy some goodies. The owner is extremely friendly and is good at reading a person's tastes. He noticed my necklace and was quick to point out other Judaica I might like. He clearly loves his shop and all the items found therein. And boy is it full of colorful stuff!

It's a bit off the beaten path of Mill Ave, but certainly worth a stroll over.
