I travel with my dogs a lot, but during those trips, my 2 cats have to be left home.  During a 2-week trip this fall, I had Conni take care of my cats in my home.  I received daily text messages from Conni letting me know how my kitties were doing - they're elderly cats, so I was very thankful for the daily updates!   They were kept happy and healthy by Conni the entire time I was gone!  I have also been to her house and seen the facility that she has for boading dogs in her home - it's beautiful and has a HUGE backyard with lots of room to run and play for those dogs that stay with her!
