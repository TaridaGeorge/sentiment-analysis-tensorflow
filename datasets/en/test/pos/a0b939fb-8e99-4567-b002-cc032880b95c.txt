This past weekend, I hiked Pinnacle Peak for the second time.  Its a great hike because its challenging but without killing yourself.  I was on a date... and I would recommend this hike for this type of activity.  You can talk to each other without getting too out of breath.  Also, there are some 'romantic' spots that you can relax and take a breather.

Not only for dates, but I think this hike is good for out of town guests.  There are some great views on this hike for picture taking.  And, also, the footing is very even.  Less chance for sprained ankles, bumps, and bruises.  

Just like most of the hikes in the area, parking is limited.  But, there are plenty of spots on the road... you just have to walk a little longer.  But... hey... you are out for a hike, right?!
