Best service I've experienced in a long time, what a refreshing surprise to the norm!  Took my bestie to dinner last night for her birthday.  We had the biggest oysters I've ever seen!  Do you see the bread in the picture that someone complained about having bacon in it?  Yes, I agree they should warn Kosher people there is bacon in the bread.  But for those of us that love bacon, that is the bomb!  My steak was cut and cooked perfectly medium rare!  They brought her an amazing dessert.  And would you believe they called me today to follow up and ensure that I enjoyed my experience?  Well done Modern Steak, I'm a fan!
