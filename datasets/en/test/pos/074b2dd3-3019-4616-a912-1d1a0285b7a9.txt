Definitely better than Subway thinking of their meat makes me sick. Anyhoo I always get the Philly with chipotle mayo and it is deeelish!  Jersey Mike's is little expensive and that's why I don't come here a lot but you get what you pay for I can't think of another place where you can get a better sub.
