Love Saffron - excellent food in their new deli (what, Persian specials every night? Where can you get ghormeh sabzi for $8??), really lovely people, and excellent selection in the grocery store. If you're looking for good fruit, delicious yogurts and breads, a solid pastry selection, and dried herbs for all your Iranian cooking needs, Saffron can't be beat. We trek over at least a few times a month and it never disappoints.
