RACLETTE!!!!!  OHHHHHHHH sweet sweet raclette, how I love thee.

This place has raclette, and it serves it in the old-school way.  Big wheel o' cheese, stuck on some stakes and melting all over meats, potatoes, and cornichons.  AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I tried their savory crepes, I tried the dessert crepes, and I can't wait to come back for some chocolate fondue and more raclette.  And maybe some tartiflette.  

Holy crap am I happy I discovered this place.

***They also have the calories listed next to about a dozen entrees, pretty cool!
