CMYE Opening Night of Giselle was a fantastic event!  This was a great event that I am so happy I got to attend.  Our seats were perfect and I didn't miss any of the show.  The production of Giselle was wonderful and I loved the costumes and set design.  

Thank you Lindsey and Symphony Hall for an unbelievable night.  I cannot wait to check out Romeo and Julie.
