I found this place by chance, about a year ago.. It was a Sunday evening around 10pm,  ME being the Foodie that I am, was craving Sushi at the wrong time of night (or so I though).  I browsed around online not thinking I was going to find anything Open (Let alone, a Sushi Restaurant) and WHA-LA.. There she was.. "ZEN 32" Open til 2am everyday, Serves Sushi Till Midnight. How Can you beat that?!? 

My boyfriend and I zoomed over, and were amazed  to find how good  the food was, not too mention the atmosphere.  Their menu is simple and delicious.  Did I mention, their open late. This is defiantly one of the best  Sushi Restaurant I've found here in Phoenix.   Needless to say, I am a frequent customer of Zen 32! I highly recommend it, for all those late night eaters.. Or Sushi Buffs! ENJOY..
