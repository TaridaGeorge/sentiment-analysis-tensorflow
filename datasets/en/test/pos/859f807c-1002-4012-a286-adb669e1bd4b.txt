I love this gym- 
No pressure sales. Money-back guarantee and great facilities. 
It's a little gimmicky with the spa and cafe and LTBucks but over all a good space with nice clean, functioning equipment. 

Shane helped me sign up and he really took care of me without the sales guy feel. If your thinking of signing up you should go talk to him- he;ll hook you up and show you around without any pressure. Very straightforward. 

I'll update more as I use my membership.
