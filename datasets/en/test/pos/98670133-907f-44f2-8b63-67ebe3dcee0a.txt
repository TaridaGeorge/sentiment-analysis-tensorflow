This place is amazing. Best sandwich I ever ever had. Fresh and organic ingredients. It is worth the 45 minute drive and I would normally say to keep it small and local, but this place is just too good. 
Please expand to Phoenix!!!

Go here for The Best Sandwiches, great dinner specials and good local products!
