If you are looking for REAL NY pizza, then look NO FURTHER than Ray's!!! 
My first time there I was taken by my Mom, who obviously has GREAT TASTE, and told it is the "BEST PIZZA IN TOWN!" And no truer words have been spoken about a pizza joint! 
The pies have HUGE slices! 
The employees are TRUE BLUE New Yorkers!
And BEST OF ALL...... GREAT TASTING PIZZA!!! 
You've got to try it to believe it......
I guarantee you won't feel the same way about pizza!
