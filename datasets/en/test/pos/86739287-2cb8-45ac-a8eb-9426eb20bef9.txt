Del frisco's is awesome. The food is delicious. I loved the tomato mozzarella flat bread, the mushroom flat bread, and the Mac and cheese. There was great service. I sat at the bar and the bartender was especially friendly and courteous. The restaurant has a really cool ambience and there is an amazing upstairs bar with a great view.
