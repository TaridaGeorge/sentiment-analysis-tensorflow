Evil Place!!!

That's right.. I walked in there and I couldnt believe it.  The people were nice to me, asking me if I needed help and by the end of the day, i had a new kitten!

All joking aisde, I love this place.  I know you can buy food and other things cheaper at grocery stores, but I kinda like a specialty store like Petsmart.  The staff is great and anything you need they are more than willing to help out.

To this day I have purchased two cats here and both are still awesome and amazing.  The last kitten my girlfriend actually picked up and when I went in there to pick up some food, they remembered which kitten we got.  Apparently she was among the favorites that was adopted.  

You want good service and a great place for your pets.. Petsmart is the best!
