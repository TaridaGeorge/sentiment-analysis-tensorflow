This is tucked away in the Scottsdale Fashion Square mall by Nordstroms. It is absolutely delicious. At about $2 a cake pop, it is slightly pricely but definitely worth its price. Moist rich cake in the shape of lollipop. Must trys are red velvet, coconut, and strawberry. If I had known how much I'ld enjoy them I would have bought even more! I can't wait to go back.
