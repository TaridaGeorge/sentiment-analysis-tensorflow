BEST SUSHI EVER!! I love this place. Its my go to place for dates and happy hours. The crunchy spicy tuna and las vegas roll are my favorite rolls!  All the food here is awesome though. I have tried almost everything on the menu and haven't been disappointed. The service is pretty good and the prices are decent! You can't beat happy hour here :)
