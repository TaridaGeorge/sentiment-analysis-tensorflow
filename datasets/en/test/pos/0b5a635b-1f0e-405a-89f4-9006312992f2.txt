This place is a gem that is so different from many other up and coming places around town. The hostess greeted us and seated us quickly. The waitress was nothing but a fountain of knowledge about all things on the menu, which was helpful in making our selections for dinner. 

Starting off with some fun, different, and delicious drinks was a great suggestion, and the mac and cheese on the appetizer menu was to DIE for. Great mix of food and fun here. Dinner came out perfectly timed, and our waitress was attentive and helpful. The food was awesome and quite different than we would normally get. Great options, and the chopped salad is awesome, and I don't like salad, so that's saying a lot.
