I had been researching getting a new DSLR for months for shooting video and pretty much knew that the Canon 60D was what I wanted. Went to Foto Forum to see how prices were and was surprised to find that they were selling the 60D for $100 less than BH and Amazon. Also Greg the salesman took an hour to talk with me about various cameras and lenses. He has decades of photography experience and was great at giving me feedback on what I was reading online.
I bought the 60D with the 18-135 kit lens and a number of other items that will help me get started with getting serious about taking pictures and video. I hope they are around for years to come.
