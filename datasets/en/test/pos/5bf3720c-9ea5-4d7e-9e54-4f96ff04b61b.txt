Taurus moving is a great moving company and I will definitly refer my family and friends!  They showed up on time and the guys were very nice and hardworking.  The price was reasonable but most important it was clear with no hidden/extra charges.  I have heard stories about companies offering a very low rate and then racking up the charges when the work is done.   They worked at a good pace and handled our furniture with care.  I am very pleased with Taurus moving for making our move as painless as possible.  Thanks again!
