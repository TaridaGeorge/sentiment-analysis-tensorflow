This place may be a small "hole in the wall," but if you want a great sandwich and the freindliest staff, you can't beat Cheese & Stuff.  I gave it a try about 8 years ago, and have been coming back ever since.  Stan (owner) greets me by name with a smile.  For my money, you have to try the Manhattan Special- pastrami pilled high with coleslaw and russian dressing on a wheat roll.  Awesome!
