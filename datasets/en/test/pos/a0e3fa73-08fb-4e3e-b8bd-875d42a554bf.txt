I love Postino's. The wines are amazing and the food is just as good. The bruschettas are great. They are perfect for sharing and trying new things. I also have been here for lunch and they have $5 glasses of wine! Awesome. I mean, who couldn't use a good glass of wine mid-day? On my visit i tried a salad and sandwich and both were good, however, next time I will just skip the sandwich because my salad was incredible. The atmosphere is inviting, and I love the patio and the way the doors and windows can open. It gives the place a wonderful feel. The service was also great. I can't complain. I love you Postino's
