This is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. It is quaint and quiet and the food is fabulous. We particularly like the BYOW (bring your own wine) because it adds that personal touch when you bring your favorite wine(s) for a special occasion. The menu changes seasonally and they always have a great selection. You never can go wrong with the brie plate or the onion tart. The desserts are all amazingly delicious as well. This is the perfect place for a romantic date with someone special!
