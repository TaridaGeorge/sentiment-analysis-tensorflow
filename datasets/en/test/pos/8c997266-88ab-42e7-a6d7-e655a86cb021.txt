I have been lacking in Yelp Reviews lately, but after the 10th time my sister and I have been here after discovering this place a couple of months ago.....she said outloud, "Yelp this place, I would be so upset if it closed!!"

I believe it has been opened for less than a year, the only drawback is although the place is nicely decorated it is maybe a bit depressing inside and no patio dining, so I suggest takeout if this is important to you.

I recommed the Chicken Pumpkin Curry and House Peanut Salad....So Fresh and So Good.
