Liberty Market is my favorite place to go for good coffee, good food, good people.  The staff makes that place what it is.  They are friendly, efficient, and just genuinely good people.  The espresso bar is by far my most favorite part of this establishment.  You always meet a new person at that bar while enjoying a nice cup of coffee.  I typically work on my laptop while there and chat with the baristas and other patrons.  The food is beyond delicious.  Most entres are very filling and do yourself a favor and try the red velvet cake.  They always have something new from the baker worth trying.  The owners are all great people who will do anything for their customers.  Like previous posts, do yourself a favor and check out the bathrooms, I prefer the chef's.  See you at the E-61 Bar.
