Do you have one of those people who are quirky and hard to buy for in your life? Me too. I ALWAYS find something for her (and myself) in here. They have tons of stuff you can't find anywhere else and most of it is local art, which makes me happy. I stop in anytime I'm anywhere near Mesa and will make a special trip on occasion too! LOVE!
