Another staple to the South Tempe scene, Seattle Espresso has been a great place to hang out for as long as I can remember. 

The coffee here is usually superior to the world's larger chains. The baristas are always friendly, and let you know when anything new and exciting comes in, like a rare variety of organic Japanese green tea that tastes incredible. 

Out front a fountain softly plays its tune while you enjoy the drink of your choice. If you like people watching, this is a great locale. There is a tool store, a dance studio, a boutique pet store, and many other locations that bring a variety of people into your line of sight. 

Always looking forward to the next cup!
