We are staying at the Marriott Desert Ridge and stumbled on to this spot this morning, what a gem!!!  The people were great, the food was outstanding.  Sorry I don't live closer to come more often.  I had the Huevos Rancheros... definitely not your traditional rendition, but great.  My husband had the Hawaiian Breakfast and loved it, too.  Staying two more days, will probably go back.
