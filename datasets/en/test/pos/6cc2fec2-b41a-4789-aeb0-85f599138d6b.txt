The Specialty entree's are my favorites and bring me back time and time again. The Salmon and the Rib Eye are both so reasonably priced, yet are both as good as it gets! Former chef from Flemming's makes this possible. The style and atmosphere are comfortable, yet can make for a special night. I suggest Simon Crown for the entertainment. Their website will tell you when he's on. Simon is like a smooth operator on the keyboard w/ calming bass notes. He looks like Charles Barkely, but has a style and voice that Prince would envy.
