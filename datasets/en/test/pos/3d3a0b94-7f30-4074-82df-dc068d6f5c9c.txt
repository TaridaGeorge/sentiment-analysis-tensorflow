First, I am not from the East Valley.  Second, Josh K's review is the most ridiculous thing I've ever read.  He must be trying to get something for free out of Joe's or he has NO taste for food.  With that said...

This is quite possibly my favorite restaurant anywhere.  The BBQ chicken pizza is awesome.  The Bleu Bacon BBQ burger is the single best hamburger I've ever eaten.  The BBQ sauce with the bleu cheese is SO good.  Their BBQ chicken salad is phenomenal.  And, if you come for breakfast, their blueberry pancakes will knock your socks off!!!

I can not recommend this place more highly, you will not be disappointed.
