i am SO glad we decided to try this place on a sunday night!  they were a bit busy and there was about a 15 minute wait-but it was well worth it. the service was amazing, the sushi was awesome, and my yakisoba with tofu was so yummy. portion size is great-plenty of leftovers. will be returning there very shortly!
