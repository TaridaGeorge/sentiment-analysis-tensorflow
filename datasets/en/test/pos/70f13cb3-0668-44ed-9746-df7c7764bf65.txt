Had a great time at Kona last couple times I've gone so am updating my review. Service was very friendly, and got good feedback from waitress when I asked for suggestions. They have a new coconut Mojito that is to die for. There was no wait, we were served promptly and the food got to our table surprisingly fast. The food was really light, and healthy, veggies cooked just right. 
Seems like a great place for happy hour too. Good job Kona!
