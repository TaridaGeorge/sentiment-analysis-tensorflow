I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! The food is amazing and the staff are top notch. Great menu with lots to choose from. We love how we are treated like family when we go there. The management has always been kind from the moment we walk in the door and they go out of their way to ensure we have a great time. My favorite is the Bacon Cheddar Burger "Rodeo Style" and the Prime Rib is AWESOME! It's great to see Owners who take pride in their establishment greeting guests, taking out food and stopping by tables to say hi and make sure everything is alright. I will be going back on a regular basis. 

Thanks Wallys!
