3/3/11: Tonight it was a takeout smorgasbord of goodies... New pork chops tasted great in restaurant & now in takeout too. Love Santa Fe rolls - next time I'm asking for two each of the sauces because then I don't have to worry about double-dipping accidentally at home. Same for requesting an extra sauce with pot stickers when I'm sharing a meal with someone  :) Tonight the takeout food is as good as in restaurant & it's a rare restaurant that can do that.
