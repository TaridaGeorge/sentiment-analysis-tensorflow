Went here and we had a groupon. The ambiance was awesome. Two stories down, you enter a cozy space. We were a few minutes early for our reservations and we hung out in the bar. Table was ready and I ordered the lobster dinner. It was delicious and they cracked it table side. We definitely will be back again.
