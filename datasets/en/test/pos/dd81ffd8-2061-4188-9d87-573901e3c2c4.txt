Great place, very friendly and welcoming, excellent food.  Frankly it is one of my favorite steak houses in town, in part because the quality of the meat is excellent and the price is reasonable.  The decor is rustic and reminds me of the steak houses my dad loved when I was a kid.  You pay for good food and excellent service, not for glitz.  That's just how I like it.
