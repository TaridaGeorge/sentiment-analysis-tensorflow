Cute, quaint and tasty.  The escargot, foie gras and beef tartare were splendid.  Server was knowledgeable about the food and wine, but not pretentious.  We met a couple there who had just returned from France.  They said the food here was as good, if not better than most of the restaurants they ate at in France.

Fairly inexpensive for a fine french restaurant.  Petite Maison is rated 8th out of 648 restaurants in Scottsdale.
