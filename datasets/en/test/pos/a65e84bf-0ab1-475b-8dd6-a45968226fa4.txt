I always seem to find something here...like treasure hunting.  Your pickings range from used books, new books, trinkets, bird feeders, tea sets, etc.  My little cutie pie just loves the children's section.  Everytime we go, it's the same sweet lady who is always more than happy to be of help.  One time we got to talking about Astronomy.  Instead of just pointing the section out to me, she gave me a summary on each book and which one my little cutie would benefit from age wise.  Well, I guess it helps that she's a retired teacher...score!   There's also plenty of hard to find educational toys to be found.  Oh, and fyi, Wildflower Bread Company is right next door. 

 Love this place!
