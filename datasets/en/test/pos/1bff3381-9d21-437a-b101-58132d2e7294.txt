I went to Bj's when I lived in SF. I was excited to learn we had one in the north valley!

Nothing short of spectacular. Never had a problem here, food is always excellent, and if the food is ever late or ordered wrong, we're always compensated with something small like a free beer, desert, or that specific entree/app for free! Waitresses, waiters, and bussers are on there stuff. I recommend this place to friends who want something a little more upscale than Outback, or someone who wants something a little different than your old fashion pizza. You've got to try their cheeseburger pizza, it's astounding.
