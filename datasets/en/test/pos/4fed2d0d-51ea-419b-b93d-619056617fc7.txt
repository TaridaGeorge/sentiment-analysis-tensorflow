I love this place! I love sitting outside here! The seating is very comfortable. The atmosphere is very laid back and elegant. Even though they were busy at the time our waiter was very attentive. I had the Gnocchi soup for the first time. I am sad that I can't find a place that  could compare to that of Nick's Gnocchi. I also had the Caesar salad which was yummy! This is such a nice place for a date or a night out with the family. This is also my grandfathers favorite restaurant in Phoenix!
