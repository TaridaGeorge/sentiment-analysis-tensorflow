This is my new favorite tea house in Glendale. For this non-coffee drinker it a key differentiating feature: an amazing selection of loose tea. And these are not just the same blends you can find anywhere else, but many are inventions of the proprietors own choosing. The atmosphere is at the same time upscale and homey; I totally love the fireplace. The location is a little out of the way, but we finally do have an amazing coffee house in Glendale.  Next time, I'll try the food.
