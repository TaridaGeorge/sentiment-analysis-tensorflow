I love this Safeway! It has the friendliest staff and it's very clean. They have a great mini Starbucks. This is by far my favorite Starbucks. I will actually drive out of my way to stop here for the fast friendly service. The have the best staff there too!  They know my drink and as soon as they see me, they start working on it.
