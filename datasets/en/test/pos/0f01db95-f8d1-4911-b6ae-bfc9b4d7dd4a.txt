The camelback mountain is a really nice place for urban hike. I have been walking up and down daily in this month. Its a great work out and helps me lose some weight. A few tips that i would share with the future hikers.

1) avoid shortcut..i saw many people chosen the shortcut (after the 2nd handrail) stuck in the middle.  it would be very embarrassing and dangerous. so avoid it if you are not expert

2) be careful of your keys and wallet. i saw many people dropped it and had to climb down finding them.

3) good shoes and water is a must. 

4) be careful of some super-charged runners,, a very few of them don't like to yield uphill hiker. Downhill hikers should always yield uphill hikers.

Enjoy your hike :)

ps: help your gf carry water or she will not hike with you again
