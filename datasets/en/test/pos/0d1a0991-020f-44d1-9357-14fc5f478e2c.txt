This is my favorite in person store to go to.  Why?  
1) Dresses in here actually FIT you - I have better luck in 10 minutes finding dress after dress that fits than I do after 4 exhausting hours at the mall.  
2) You won't find anyone else wearing what you just bought.  Have you ever gone somewhere and saw your outfit on another 1 (or more) person?  Hate that!  But when you buy here, that doesn't happen.  
3) So many sizes and styles to choose from.  With pieces from the 1920's - the 1980's you have a fun array of styles that easily look modern - anytime.  

Love, love, LOVE this store.  I now own 10 vintage pieces from Fashion by Robert Black.  And EVERY time I wear something from there I get stopped on the street with compliments from strangers.  EVERY single time.
