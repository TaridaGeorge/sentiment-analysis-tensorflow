Lux rawks in so many ways. They always have a top notch barista working bar, freshly baked goods from their own bakers, nice selection of music, and that overall hipster vibe that keeps things interesting. For those of you west coast out-of-town-ers, they're similar to Intelligentsia, Ritual, and Stumptown.

When it comes to selecting and serving coffee, they strongly believe in getting the basics right (roasting, grinding, extracting, brewing, etc.) before consuming their time with other details (bean purveying, cupping, etc.).

With that said, their whole bean selection is limited, which may disappoint those (including myself) interested in unique blends and single origin beans.

Other notes: Laptop friendly; Busy, even during all the light rail construction; Pane Bianco next door serves amazing lunch sandwiches; They have a light table for you old school photographers
