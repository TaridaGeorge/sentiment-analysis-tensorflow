CLOSED

Temporarily or permanent, not sure... but it's been closed for two weeks now with no sign of reopening.

Last week there was a "closed for maintenance" sign, and this week, there's a "No Trespassing" sign on the doors and boxes all over the place inside.  

Sad to see, as this place had really great food.  I hope they find a way to reopen somehow.
