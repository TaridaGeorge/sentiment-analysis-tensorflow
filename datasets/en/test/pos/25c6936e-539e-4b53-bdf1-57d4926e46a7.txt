This store gets 5 stars solely based on the fact that it has the best deals of any store I've ever shopped at. While you do need to thoroughly check any item you're thinking about buying for defects, you can definitely score some amazing deals, especially on shoes and purses. Some of my favorite things purchased from here are the following:
Marc Jacobs jeans $15
Diesel jeans $15
BCBG large leather purse $70
Prada clogs $100
Stuart Weitzman heels $40
With deals like these it's not hard to understand why this place can get a bit overcrowded with aggressive shoppers. Go early on weekdays and keep a good eye on your cart.
