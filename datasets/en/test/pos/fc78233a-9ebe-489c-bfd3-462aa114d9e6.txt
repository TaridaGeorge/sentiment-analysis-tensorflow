I am giving this place 5 stars but as a disclaimer I've only had their pizza. My fiancee and I have gotten pizza from this location a couple of times and every time it's hot and Delicious. This location is very convenient for pickup or they have a patio if you're feeling social. We usually get the Vinny's favorite where you can choose up to 5 different toppings. We get a new combination of toppings each time and are never disappointed. I would highly recommend trying ricotta cheese and eggplant on your pizza. We will be back for sure!
