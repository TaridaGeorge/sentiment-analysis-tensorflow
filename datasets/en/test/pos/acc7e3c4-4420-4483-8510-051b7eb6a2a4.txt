This is my final review for 2012. So I thought it was fitting to review Fed Ex.
This location is great and Edward is a really nice guy. (He works there).
I had to visit this location a few times during December, he always had a smile and was happy to help and answer questions. 
At times he had a lot of people in there. All wanting and needing information, help, and packaging.
He was so laid back and helpful.
Even thanked everyone for their Business.
So nice to go into a place like this. Plus, all our packages arrived safe and sound and in perfect condition.
They will take Check, cash, or credit as well.
