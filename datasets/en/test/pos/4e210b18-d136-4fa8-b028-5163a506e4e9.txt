I went to the Downtown Deli looking for a decent pastrami sandwich, and boy did I find it!  The pastrami is melt in your mouth perfect and the fries are excellent.  This has become my favorite guilty pleasure for lunch.  If you're feeling adventurous, try the Vic's Madness sandwich. Yes, I know a pastrami, egg salad, and swiss cheese sandwich sounds strange, but it's incredible.

And the best part is that the service is so fast you can get in and out for lunch quickly.
