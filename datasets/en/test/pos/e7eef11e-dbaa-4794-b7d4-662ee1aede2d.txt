I stopped in here on my way to AMC Westgate and it was pretty dead.. mainly because it was about 4:30PM.  Who drinks coffee that late?  

..I do.

The girl behind the counter was extremely friendly and I commented that I had never been here. Im usually a Starbucks person.  So I ordered the same drink I order at Starbucks.  She made the drink more than perfect.  Just the right amount of flavor in each sip. 

Very cool place.  The set up was actually nicer that most Starbucks I have been too.  Made me want to go home and grab my laptop and come back and work.

I'll be back!
