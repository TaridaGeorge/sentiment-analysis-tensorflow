The perfect breakfast diner!

God I love this place.  Big portions of GREAT breakfast food in a CLASSIC diner setting.  The hasbrowns were greasy and awesome, pancakes and scrambled eggs were done PERFECTLY!  

They have a bar and booth seating as well, and the place was filled with the sounds of the sizzling grill.

What a great place!
