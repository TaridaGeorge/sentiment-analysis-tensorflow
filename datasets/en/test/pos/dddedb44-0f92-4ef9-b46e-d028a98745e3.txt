*nom nom nom!*  Mm, this place is the perfect eatery for a lazy Sunday, or if you are skipping school or work as it's quite naughty.  One of those mimosas and bloody marys in the morning kind of days.  The Garfield is extremely satisfying and the french toast in a cup is genius, if a bit sticky.  But since we are being naughty eating here a little stickiness is probably appropriate!  It is tiny tiny, but I find it amusing rather than annoying.
