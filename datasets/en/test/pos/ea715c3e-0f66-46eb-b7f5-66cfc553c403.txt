I bought a bone-in, smoked half ham (12lbs - whoa!) for Thanksgiving and everyone that ate it said it was the best tasting ham they'd ever had! Not too salty, and the perfect amount of smoky flavor. 

And don't get me started on the sausage! When I went to pick up the ham the full deli case of sausage was staring me down - how could I NOT take some home. We ate the chicken apple sausage with eggs the next day and they were beyond flavorful. You could seriously taste the apples, it was that fresh!

The prices might be a little bit more than you'd typically find in a grocery store, but still reasonable, and for the quality of product it's totally worth it, plus it's locally owned!
