I have had the privilege to indulge myself in true Italian cuisine made with love and passion. When you dine at Marcellino's not only do you experience the graciousness of the owners who are ever present and friendly,but you get to lavish your taste buds in the essence of true Italian flavors. The housemade pastas are ones that you can't get anywhere else, or would you want too. Then top that off with live Opera, make you feel like to are in the heart of Italy riding a gondola. The attentive staff are at your table giving you impeccable service and enhacing your experience with through knowledge of the menu. I recommend this restaurant to everyone looking to have a memorable experience!!
