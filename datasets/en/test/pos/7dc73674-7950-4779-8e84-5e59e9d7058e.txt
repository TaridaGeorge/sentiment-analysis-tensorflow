I finally made it to GFC and it was like finding the mother lode!  Yay - so many different gluten free options, it was actually hard to decide.  My daughter and I ordered crepes and fruit smoothies to eat there.  They were totally yummy and even though the store were busy because of Mother's Day, the staff was very attentive and so helpful - I felt like I was one of their regulars.  It was a great experience and I will definitely go out of my way to get back over there.  I live on the northwest side of town, so it's more than 30 miles from my house, but I want to go try some other things from their lunch menu!
