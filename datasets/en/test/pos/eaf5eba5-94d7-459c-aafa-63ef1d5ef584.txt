Every time I go to Pappadeaux  I get the item on the Appetizer menu, Large order of Fried Alligator.  I always ask that I get half Fried and half Blackened Cajun.  Take a piece dip it in that AMAZING sauce that it comes with and be prepared to know what HEAVEN IS LIKE!!!  I just LOVE this dish so much that I get it at least once a month if not more. And anytime I go to a Pappadeaux's Resturant I get this dish.  ITS UNBELIEVABLE!!!!
