This store offers a very knowledgable, friendly and helpful staff!  They are quick to offer assistance, answer questions, address product issues and process returns if need be.  Specifically, today I had to exchange our baby monitor for the 3rd time due to it being a poorly manufactured product.  Mike, the store manager, quickly offered helpful insight and offered superior customer service!  Simply put, he turned to frustrated parents into very happy loyal Buy Buy Baby customers for life.  Thanks again Mike!!!
