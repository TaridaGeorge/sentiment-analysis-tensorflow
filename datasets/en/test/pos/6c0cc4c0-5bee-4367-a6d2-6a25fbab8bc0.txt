My favorite coffee in town. While other places may have the speciality beans that wow you every now and then, Royal's self-roasted blend is consistently great--whether it is their hot pour overs or iced toddy.  

Hayes and his staff go the extra mile to serve you without the indifference or even worse,coffee talk gobbledygook or condescension of some other places.  

I love the urban, adaptive-use nature of the place with  modern yet organic, custom made furniture.

Best yet, it has become a hub for downtown denizens and urbanites. I never fail to see a familiar face when I stop by. It's a great way to remain connected with the who what when and where of downtown Phoenix.
