Best Pizza in AZ!! I love the flavors of their NY thin crust pizza. I always start with the caesar salad and I love the anti pasta. 
If your counting calories take the dressing on the side and best pizza is the cheese because the liquid in the toppings make the crust soggy so I suggest without any toppings. Also they have some beer on tab from euro that i forgot the name but real good.
