I love Skies!  Totally a place you'd feel at home at - especially if you're from MN or WI.  I can see why the get celebs in there from time to time.  The beer is cold, prices are reasonable, and the bartenders (especially Jeff) are fun to chat with.  They have pretty good bands and decent food.  The nachos are enough to feed a small army, onion rings are better than the fries, curds you can skip, burgers are alright (ask for it medium).
The place does get packed, so get there early if there's a band or if you want to watch football on Sunday.  
Oh, and they have there own kind of cherry bombs (that are not shots, but cherries soaked in booze).
Good times!
