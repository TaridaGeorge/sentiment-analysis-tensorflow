I've always loved spinach on my pizza, but my typical complaint at other places was the tiny amount that was used.  NOT SO AT SPINATO'S.  This spinach loving pizza fan was in HEAVEN!  

This was honestly the best pizza that I've had in a while...thin light crust, tasty tomato sauce, cooked to perfection.

We also got the anti-pasta salad, and their house Italian dressing was awesome.  

My only complaint was the lack of alcohol.  Would have loved a nice glass of wine to go with the supper yummy pizza.
