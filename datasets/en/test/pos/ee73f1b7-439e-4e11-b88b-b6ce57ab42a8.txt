This may be the best spa I have ever been to and I have been to a LOT of spas! I had a body wrap that was done to perfection, It listed as a one hour service and was well over that. The therapist was attentive, skilled and very kind. The body wrap was done with towels and not sheets of plastic. While waiting for the oils to heat and penetrate I was treated to a head, shoulder and foot massage rather then the standard therapist goes for coffee break and leaves you alone for 20 minutes.  Well worth every penny it cost. Remember - sign up for the Fairmont Presidents Club and you will receive 10% off your services. The cost of your service allows you to use the steam room, grotto pool, roof top pool for the entire day. Money well spent!
