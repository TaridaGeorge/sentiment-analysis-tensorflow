We have been using him for years. He serviced our unit till it could not be repaired anymore and the time came for a new one (unit was 20+ years old) and we got a great price. Jake Angel, the owner, is one of the most honest business men we have had the pleasure of meeting. We will not ever use anyone else!!!
