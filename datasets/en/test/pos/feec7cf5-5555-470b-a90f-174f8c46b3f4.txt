This place seriously has the best coffee, lattes, hot chocolate and chai tea i've ever had, period!

I was visiting my brother and he insisted on taking me here, to which I replied, I only drink hot chocolate, no coffee or tea. Well, did i eat or should i say drink those words.

We ordered a latte, chai tea and hot chocolate and i was singing their praises all the way home. This is not an ordinary coffee shop - all three drinks were rich, creamy and had wonderful flavors - i was completely blown away!

If i lived here, i'd definitely be a coffee and chai tea drinker, but sadly i don't - though this place is on my "must visit" list next time i'm in town.
