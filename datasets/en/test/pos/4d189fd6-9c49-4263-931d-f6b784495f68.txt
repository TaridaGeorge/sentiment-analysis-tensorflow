Been going to Garcias for at least thirty years, remember when it was a hole in the wall. I've probably eaten there a thousand times and almost always get the red chili chimi. My ex wife always gets the chicken fajitas. The only complaint I've had over the years would be slow service, we actually walked out a couple of times after filling up on chips and salsa waiting for our order to be taken. Even after saying that, it is my favorite Mexican food restaurant hands down !
