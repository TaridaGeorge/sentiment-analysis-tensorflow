Classy, high end mall. Certainly the best in Arizona! 

There's stores for all price ranges, however don't expect a Marshalls or K-Momo, no. This place is the real deal when it comes to high end stores, Prada, Louis Vuitton, Barney's, Nordstroms, Armani Exchange, etc.

I love hanging out here on the weekends!
