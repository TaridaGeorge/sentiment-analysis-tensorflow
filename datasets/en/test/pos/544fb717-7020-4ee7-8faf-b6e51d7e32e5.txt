Cost Plus! Mmm lots of impulse buying in this store...

I always loveee coming here. Great prices on everything is one reason! I buy a lot of kitchen supplies and glassware here. I feel like kitchen things are their specialty. You just have to make it to the back of the store to find it, which is hard because there are so many interesting things on the way there which prove distracting! Chocolates and odd foods also reign supreme here. If you're into messing with spices or unique flavoring when you cook, I strongly suggest a visit here. No trip to Cost Plus can leave you empty handed. Nice furniture here too. I just like the international vibe you get from the place though. Oh, and keep your eyes peeled for cool knickknacks!
