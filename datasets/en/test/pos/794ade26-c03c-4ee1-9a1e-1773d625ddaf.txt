This is a great date place. My and my boy toy go here all the time. The food is delicious. All of the negative reviews on here seem to be about the waiting. That may be part of my favorite reason I love this place. It gives the chance to relax, and enjoy the people you are with before you are seated and concentrate on eating. You have to expect over an hour of waiting before you get  in, use that time wisely!! The wine bar is next door and will give you the chance to sample some good wine.
