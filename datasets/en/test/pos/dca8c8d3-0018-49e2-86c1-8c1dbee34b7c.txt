I was recently in Arizonia for work and our boss took us to the Spa for the day. AMAZING....First I got a facial. I dont know what she did but I left the room GLOWING! My pedicure was heaven. They gave us champagne, massaged our feet forever and  my toes were smiling when I left:) The food was fresh, tasty and of course not too filling. The atmosphere is beautiful, the service was one of the best I ever had and I would love to go back...I have no idea about the price because my boss paid for all of us:) It is worth taking a spa trip to the Fairmont!!!
