A very enjoyable desert course.  We had a fun here.  The ranger and cart girl were nice! The layout was excellent with the desert in play on every hole.  Being from back east, I got a rush trying to blast the ball out of trouble.  Of course, I failed miserably but who cares? The back 9 had more memorable holes than did the front 9.  All par 3s were interesting and challenging.  A few long forced carries over waste areas.  The course was green and lush when we played in mid October.  The only downer was a miserable woman swearing at my friend for driving his cart onto the fairway.  Bleep you if you read this review, sweetheart.  Overall, a must play for those wanting a good value on a course with a private feel.
