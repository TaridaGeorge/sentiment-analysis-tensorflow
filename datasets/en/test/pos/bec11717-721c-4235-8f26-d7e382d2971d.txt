Simply awesome.  The drinks are good and the boba is fantastic.  Boba Tea House has a huge variety of flavors available - everything from the simple (mango, peach, thai tea, etc.) to the more exotic (taro, lychee, jackfruit, red bean, and others).  Be warned that some of the more exotic flavors are pretty weird by American standards, and if you don't know what you're getting yourself into, you might not be happy with your drink.  That said, everything I've had here has been good, and it's always made quickly without much wait at all.  They do have punch-cards if you go here often, and you'll get a free drink for every 9 drinks you purchase.

Screw going to Starbucks for a crapuccino - I'll stick with boba tea.
