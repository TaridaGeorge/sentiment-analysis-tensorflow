I think will be one of my favorite restaurants in PHX.  Not only are their drinks and food are , but the atmosphere of this place is just great! We had the sliders that were more like sloppy joe's and some hummus to start with. I remember having this cranberry and vodka-ish drink for $3 and it was heavenly!
