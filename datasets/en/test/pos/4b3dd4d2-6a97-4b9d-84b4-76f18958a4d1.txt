Cost Plus is awesome. I stop by here at least once a week as they have a fabulous wine selection and the prices are great. Their international food section contains items you can't find at AJ's or TJ's. 

They also have nice house wares; I've bought decorative pillows, bath mats, shower curtains and wine glasses. Need a gift? This is a great place to find something unique and cool for anyone on your list. 

It really is a World Market and you won't leave without buying a lot more than you anticipated.
