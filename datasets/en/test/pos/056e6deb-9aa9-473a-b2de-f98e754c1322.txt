loved this place, esp our server mike!!! he was sooooooooooo courteous, professional, friendly and made great recommendations. we had the butter sword fish as appetizer... loved the flavor!!! lamb cutlets (more like lamb chops, not katsu), yummy, but hated the side dish of the smoked eggplant (tasted burned, but it was done like this on purchase), fatty tuna belly (2 pieces for $24), blue fin, yellow tails (4 pieces each) and salmon avocado roll (SOOOOOOOOOOOO delicious), spent $150 for the 2 of us. very romantic and gorgeous place to eat dinner with my husband. good job to my hubby for findings this place and made RSVP!!! love it!!!! highlyr ecommend this place! it's expensive, so watch out!!
