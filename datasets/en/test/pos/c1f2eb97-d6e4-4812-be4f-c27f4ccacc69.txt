I've been going to Laveen Nails since they very first opened and have never ever had a bad experience.  We moved to Verrado (Buckeye) a year ago and we still try to make it over there at least every 4 - 6 weeks because I've yet to find anywhere that even comes close to being as good in this price range.  My husband and I both get pedis and a massage (either full body or reflexology) and I also get a fill.  I love that it has grown and expanded since they first opened.  A testament, in my opinion, to the great services they provide and the excellent team that works there.
