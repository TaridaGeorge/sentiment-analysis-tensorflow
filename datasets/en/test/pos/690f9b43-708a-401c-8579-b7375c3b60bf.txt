Shimogamo is one of those hidden gems of locally owned sushi restaurants and easily the best sushi and traditional home style Japanese food in the east valley.  I agree with another reviewer, the best way to eat here is to put yourself in the hands of the sushi chef and kitchen cook and let them take care of you.  If you don't mind spending a bit more, they are open to creating an omakase for $50-100+range or tweaking a lunch special to suit your taste.

Best bets for lunch:
Assorted sushi - $19 (or $30-35) if you want to upgrade to uni, ama ebi, toro if available/

Daily bento box lunch - $8.50
Super cheap and amazing, true Japanese comfort food.
