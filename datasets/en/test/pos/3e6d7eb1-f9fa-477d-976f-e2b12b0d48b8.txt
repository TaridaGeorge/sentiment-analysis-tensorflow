Tiffany @ the chanel counter. 
Tana in the lingerie department. 

these are my go-to girls for everything. i bring all of my purchases to them bc they are THAT much better than everyone else. except shoes because the shoe people know how to work that confusing back shoe room. 

but everything else: make up, accessories, clothes....all to one of these girls. i recommend you only work with them as well :)
