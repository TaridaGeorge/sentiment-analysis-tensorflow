This is my NEW nail place that I plan to stay loyal in regards to my hands/feet needs!! 

It is a pretty big salon - love that they have a nice Lobby where you can sign in and THEN a second room that has walls of polish colors/brands (elaborate selection) and couches/plasma TV to watch, H2O in fridge and restrooms. NOTE: Am I the only one who goes to the restroom before mani/pedi time? For me, I want to turn the phone off, not have to pee, etc. - complete relaxation!! 

To the left, they have nice, big pedi stations and a menu of "options". Yes, they can get pricey, but so far, they have proven to me the stellar services.

To the right, they have nail stations - very relaxing place, in general, w/friendly nail technicians. Keep up the great work!
