so its official~as much as im a beer snob....im a sushi one too....my last nite in phoenix after a 49er victory was craving the sushi goods...my cousin/his lady said this sakana brand was a chain in az...kudos to him for the plug...this place didnt disappoint...urban legend says this place has a line/long wait....mainly due to the size of the joint...luckily no wait....walkin into this place...your treated like royalty...the sushi chefs & the waiters greet u once u enter & when u leave....so about the food...had to have the tuna shashimi/spicy tuna roll...the icing on the cake was this sushi dish that was called a salmon dynamite/salmon cake on top of this roll...this place was good...jus havin flashbacks now
