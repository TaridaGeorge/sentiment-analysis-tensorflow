We have an arch shape driveway that we would like to put pavers on, so we called Pete based on the good review here.

We have no ideas what color or pattern to choose for, Pete helped us on this. He ordered two colors and mixed them together to match our house.

It only took them one and a half days to finish the job, now we have a beautiful driveway and many our neighbors stopped by to check it out.

If your driveway, walkway, or patio needs pavers, give Pete a call, he will do an excellent job.
