well my trip to this golden corral was well worth the trip.Ilove golden corral and this is probably my favorite one.They had my favorite dishes from there amazing pot roast to the molten lava cake. a few new items were the homemade potato chips were bbq and they also had some breaded chicken livers that were very good and that is something you dont see at any buffet.they also have a cream of potato and bacon soup that is very taste.as far as all the one and two star reviews go i cant figure out the problem these people have..do they not like lots of good food with plenty of choices. Well i hope my review boosts there rating because i love golden corral and i hate to see them get negative reviews because i dont think they deserve them.
