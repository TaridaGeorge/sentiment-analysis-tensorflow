Ray made our wedding reception absolutely phenomenal! He timed all of the little special requests perfectly (like me surprising my husband with a groom's cake). He read the group on the dance floor perfectly and because of that, we didn't stop dancing until our time ran out. He even went along with a surprise our friends had for us that called for a certain song. Could not have imagined that night as perfectly as it turned out. Thank you Ray!
