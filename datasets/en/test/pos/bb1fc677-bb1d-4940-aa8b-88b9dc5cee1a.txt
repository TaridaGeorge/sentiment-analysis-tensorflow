The idea behind Bahama Bucks is genius...especially in a place like Arizona. Delicious, refreshing and very affordable. I have frequented many of their locations but this one is the closest to my house. I try to branch out with their many flavors but usually end up getting the same thing--strawberry colada with tropical cream. You won't be disappointed!
