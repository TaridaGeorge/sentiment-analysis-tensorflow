This place will always conjure up wonderful memories for me.  My family would always come here on the weekends for Dim Sum and we continue to come back even 20+ years later.

Some of my favorites here include the shu mai (pork dumplings), the sticky rice wrapped in a lotus leaf, and the shrimp wrapped in a long noodle.
