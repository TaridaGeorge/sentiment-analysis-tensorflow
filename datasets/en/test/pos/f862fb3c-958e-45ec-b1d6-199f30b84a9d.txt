I love life and life loves me. This breakfast house is worth it's weight. And if it wasn't for yelp, I never would have dined here. Both of the gals I interacted with are all that. Awesome smiles with beautiful personalities.

And kiss the cook, I hope she's a girl, because my egg sandwich was the best. Love my fity cent cup of coffee in a mug and the apple juice was a kiss sweeter than wine.

Here's to you Chloe.
