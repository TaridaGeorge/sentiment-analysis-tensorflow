Time to update my review and bump up my rating because frankly, they deserved it. 
I'm quite fond of Pita Jungle as a franchise. I've never ordered a bad meal here and staff have always been cheery.
The reason for the bump in the rating? The tapas special during the happy hour. You can order small portion plates from $1 to $2. You can get Mozzarella & Tomato plates to Hummus and tiny slices of Pizzas. Seriously, It's cheaper than chips! 
What's not to love?    .
