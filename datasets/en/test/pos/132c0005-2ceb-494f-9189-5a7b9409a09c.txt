Never had a pasty before coming here. I'm a HUGE fan, now.

Girlfriend had the Shepard's Pie (with lamb) pasty and I went with the Oggie pasty. We started off with an order of Mushy Peas. For dessert, we had the Apple Cinnamon Pasty and Chocolate Bread & Butter Pudding.

Everything we had was so delicious! My girlfriend said it looked like I was having a food-gasm. (I think I was) The pudding ... oh, my ... the best I've ever had.

The food here is OUTSTANDING. The beer is nice and cold. The service is great. The atmosphere is perfect for a British Pub. What more could you ask for?
