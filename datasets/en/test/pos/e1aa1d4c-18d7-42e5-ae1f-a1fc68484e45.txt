This place is the best kept secret in Az! The owner Lobby is a wonderful young man, who takes great pride in his employees, food and restaurant. The cook Mario, makes the best bacon burger I have ever eaten, it is always juicy and very flavor-able with all the fresh condiments. The crinkle fries are done to perfection and that LOBBY sauce with them is beyond divine!  We have eaten here on different days of the week and times, we are always very satisfied. This is a HANDS down GREAT burger place!
