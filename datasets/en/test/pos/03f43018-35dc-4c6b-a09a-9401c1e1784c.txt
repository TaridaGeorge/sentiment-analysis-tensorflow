I can't believe I have not Yelped Pop the Soda Shop yet LOL! I have been going here since well before it moved to the new location. Pop the Soda shop has introduced me to so many amazing drinks that I actually crave and can only find at Pop's. I love being able buy in bulk or stop by and pick one or two random bottles out of the coolers. They have such a massive variety already cold which is amazing. I consider myself a connoisseur(in training) of soda, so this place is heaven. To think of it I would even live in the attic of this place if it was legal and not creepy and If I could go back in time I would have moved my wedding to Pop's and walked down the middle isle of soda. I love Pop the Soda Shop.
