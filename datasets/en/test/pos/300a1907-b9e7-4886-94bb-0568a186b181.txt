OH MY GOD! This place was fantastic, I was visiting a friend of mine in AZ.  And this noodle cafe was a breath of fresh air among the fast food joints and the cheesy greasy fattening chain restaurants.....

We go in, and the staff was really nice, the service was actually realy good, and the noodles..........omg the Noodles were delicious I had the Yakisoba noodles, and they were fantastic.  They had lots of different noodles, so check it out, they were pretty good sounding.  

It's a nice place to talk with a friend, and they have good food. 

Check it.
