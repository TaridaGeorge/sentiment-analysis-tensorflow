I have tried many auto repair places in my my years of car ownership. Sears is the one place I found that always is fair, honest, and does the work as expected. I'm writing this review based on my latest experience. Saturday my sons car was making a terrible noise. My effort to fix it did not go well. Off to sears Saturday afternoon. They told me it needed an alternator but the normal parts suppliers were closed Sunday, though Sears auto repair was open. Shoot! We needed this fixed asap. When asked if we could find and bring in the part they said sure. How awesome is that. The car was done Sunday at noon for a very reasonable price. No hassle and a great price.
