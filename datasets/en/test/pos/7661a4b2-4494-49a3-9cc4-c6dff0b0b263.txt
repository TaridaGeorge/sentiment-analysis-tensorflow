I've been driving across town to patronize the good folks at Bell for over 6 years now, and I have never had a reason to doubt my loyalty. Sure, we've had our issues, as with all cleaners, but they've always been fair and quick to make it right. I used to think they were more expensive, but after a little bit of research, I discovered that they're not. I think the essence of a quality business relationship with a dry cleaner / laundry is trust. And I absolutely trust the people at Bell.
