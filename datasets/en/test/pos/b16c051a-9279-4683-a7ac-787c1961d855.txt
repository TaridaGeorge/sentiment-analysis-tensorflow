So they now have the entire building and a dinner menu.  Alcohol license pending.

Now is the time to sneak in for some of the best food in the Valley.

We went 3:30PM Friday, 

-wild arugula salad with roasted beets, goat cheese and toasted pecans
-pizza margarita
-roast pig, she apologized that it had just come out of the overn and was resting for 10 minutes.

Absolute heaven.

We left at 5PM Friday, still almost empty place.  I must be in bizarro world.

I wish my budget allowed me to eat there every day until the alcohol license arrives.  Or bizarro world stays put.
