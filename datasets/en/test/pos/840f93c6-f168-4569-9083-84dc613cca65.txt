Dr. Randy Leavitt is the best Doctor ever.

Not only did Gilbert Pediatrics provide the greatest level of care to my newborn, they went the extra mile with their compliments and customer service.

I actually owe many thanks to Dr. Leavitt and the people of Gilbert Pediatrics for taking a thoughtful moment and giving a very considerate and well thought recommendation for my wife as to which OBGYN she should see. Turned out to be one of the greatest suggestions as he discovered certain things early which allowed us to resolve a medical condition that would have become much worse.

Thanks again Gilbert Pediatrics and I highly recommend this as the primary choice for those of you in Gilbert.
