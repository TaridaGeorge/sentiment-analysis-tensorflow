Modern inside trapped in a windy desert outside. I loved my soy americano. Beats going to the local Starbucks. I like to support the little guy. And their coffee was excellent!  I ordered the Americano.

Oh and the Breakfast burrito was delicious! I was the Jalapeno, cheese, egg and potato). OMG. I wanted to buy another one, just to take it home for later!
