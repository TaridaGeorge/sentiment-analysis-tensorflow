My hubby and I love this place.  We hit it easily 2-3 times a week for lunch.  Occasionally, we will visit for dinner.  The dining room is always crowded during lunch, but, the service is extremely efficient.  The restrooms are impeccably clean!  The manager, Eric, and his staff are very friendly and accommodating.

Onto the food... We've tried several items on the menu, from the different burgers to several rice bowls to fish tacos to the salads.  Portions are large enough to share and they will even split it into two bowls/plates for you.  We have never been disappointed in flavor on any item.  

Give Rumbi's a try and you won't be disappointed!
