I love the Ocean Club !!! Especially the bar. . If you want a Great dinning experience . . you should order from the bar . . .to sit and watch live entertainment while you dine is an aweome experience. . .Your bartenders at OC treat you like a good friend so your comfortable,..If you have a party of 4 or less definately sit at the bar for a WONDERFULL dinning experience. . The bartenders are REAL and fun!!!
