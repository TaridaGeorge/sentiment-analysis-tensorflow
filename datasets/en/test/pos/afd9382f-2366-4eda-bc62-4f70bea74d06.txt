I have eaten Peruvian food in Costa Rica and this is comparable but with smaller portions. The flavors and smells were enticing. The service was excellent. The ceviche dinner was perfect. I had a 1/4 of chicken with an incredibly addictive spiced rice, some thinly sliced cucumbers and red onions and a side of Yuka, that serves two, served with a cilantro sauce that I could have drank plain it was so tasty. They have a South American cola but it has high fructose corn syrup as an ingredient.
Listening and watching Andrea Bocelli video in Spain es mui romantica.
I want to see some neighboring flavors of Uruguay and Argentina, grain  fed beef (sold at Sprouts) free range chicken and anything with chimichuri, please.
