This place is outstanding.  I will eat here every morning while I am visiting Scottsdale.  If you have a chance to visit this place, definitely do so.  I ordered the breakfast burrito with sausage, bacon, and no beans.  It came with this indescribably delicious chorizo queso sauce and I savored every bite.  Also, as I looked around at the other orders, I could not see anything that looked short of delicious.
