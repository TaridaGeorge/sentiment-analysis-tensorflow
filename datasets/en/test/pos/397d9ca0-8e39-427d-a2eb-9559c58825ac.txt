This is got to be my favorite hiking trail in Phoenix.  I hiked the whole trail which took about 2 1/2 hours.  To get to the top is well worth the hike.  
Warning:  This is not a smooth trail like Pinnacle Peak.  If you don't mind all the rocks and the heavy traffic.  Make sure to wear proper shoes to hike this trail.
