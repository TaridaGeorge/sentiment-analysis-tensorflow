Visiting from SoCal. Husband's favorite meal is breakfast. Butterfield's passed the test. He had the Mexicana, I had the California, kids had the Grilled Cheese Sandwich and the Mickey Mouse Pancakes. Not one crumb was left on anyone's plate. Service was VERY good. Can't wait to return to Arizona. Butterfield's will definitely be on the itinerary...
