Ok
I've only ever had the gelato here, although they do have a small dessert case filled with cupcakes and cake slices

However, their gelato is so good, why get anything else?

A small with two scoops is $3
Not too shabby!

My favorite flavor is strawberry with chocolate gelato.  It's like eating chocolate covered strawberries.... yum!!!
