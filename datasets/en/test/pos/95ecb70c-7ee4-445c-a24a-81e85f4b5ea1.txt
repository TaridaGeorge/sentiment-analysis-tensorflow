Baffled by the unfavorable reviews here. Easily one of the best burgers I've ever had is the Zinburger. Truffle fries are also delicious. Always have good service here and leave very satisfied. Atmosphere is slightly upscale I suppose, but not snobby as some complain. You can wear shorts and a T-shirt and feel right at home here.
