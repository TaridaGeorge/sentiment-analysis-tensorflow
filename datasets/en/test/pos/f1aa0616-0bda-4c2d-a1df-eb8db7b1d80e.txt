I hadn't visited the dentist in several years and was having severe "dental anxiety."  I was referred to this dentist office by a friend and was ensured that this is the nicest dentist office ever!  This was in fact the case....nicest group of ladies ever, especially the hygentist, Mandi.  The office is located in a home in Old Town Scottsdale that was converted into a "green" dental office.  Great environment...flat screen tv's built into the cieling and goggles to wear for comfort.  Will continue to go here for as long as I can!
