Sooo delicious! Finally tried this place a few weeks ago after driving by it so many times. I'm glad I found such a neat place only a few miles from my house.

I've had gelato at many places in Italy and Germany while living abroad, and this place stands up to the best of them. Quality gelato, friendly service, reasonable prices. Best of all, it's run by an Italian family! Can't get more authentic than that.

A small size costs $3.25 but you can get more than one flavor. Compared with how much I usually spend on mediocre frozen yogurt, it's a steal. My favorite flavors so far: hazelnut, coffee, and cappuccino. Next up, pumpkin!
