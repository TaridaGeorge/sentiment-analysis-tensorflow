I use this UPS store as a mailing hub for my small business. I have NEVER had any problems with packages coming in or going out and I have sent out hundreds of packages in the past 3 years I have had a box with them.  They are always friendly and greet me by name. I feel like I live in a small town again and not just another ant in the sea of people in the valley.
