Shimogamo is always a treat. It's tucked away in an unassuming plaza at Dobson and Warner next to C-Fu Gourmet. The intersection has a high concentration of Asian businesses, so you know this is the real deal. It's a small-ish restaurant, and I am pretty sure they do have teppan tables, but I think everyone basically comes here for the sushi.

This is this east valley place for true sushi and nigiri. It is fresh. And high quality. 

I suppose I could go on about all the different rolls and beautiful recipes and combos, but those all fall in line when the fish is fresh. So there you go.

Here's a tip though-this place has restaurant hours-you can't just drive here at 3pm thinking it's open. Make sure it it. And it's worth it.
