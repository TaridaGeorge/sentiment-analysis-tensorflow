Awesome steak sandwiches.  The meat is very tender and very flavorful, you won't be let down I just wished I ordered more my first time there. There is always next time though.  So far everything I have had here is excellent and I just say you should go try it out.  Next time I am going to try the italian sub there, should be good.  I need to go back here soon.
