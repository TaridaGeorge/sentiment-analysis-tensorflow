This is the best Sushi ever.  We eat here at least once a week and love it.  The fish portions are large and the price is reasonable.  I send people there all the time and they love it.  The staff is great and the sushi bar is usually very fun.  

Must try: The "House" Smoked Salmon.  It is amazing.  Make sure it is not the regular smoked salmon.  The Pink Panda roll is amazing too.  It is not on the menu but the sushi guys know what it is.
