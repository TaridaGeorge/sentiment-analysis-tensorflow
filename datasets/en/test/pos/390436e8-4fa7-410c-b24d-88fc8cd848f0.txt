Yum!

If you are in the mood for a good, juicy burger exactly the way you like it- Cheeburger Cheeburger is the place for you. Everything is build your own- burgers, shakes, and chicken sandwiches. My husband was a bit more adventurous than me. He had a 1/2 lb burger with pepper jack, sauted mushrooms, black olives, and honey mustard ( I know he is a weirdo) he was in heaven. I played on the safe side with a 1/3lb burger with jack/cheddar cheese, thousand island, and bacon. The burgers were actually cooked to medium, the buns were good, they are just god burgers. It is an al a carte setting so you order the fries separately. Those are also delicious. We spent about $20 for the both of us to have a burger and split an order of fries- not too shabby considering how tasty it was.
