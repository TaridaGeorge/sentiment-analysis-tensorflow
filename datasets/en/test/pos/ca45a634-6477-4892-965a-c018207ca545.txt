I live not but a half mile from this Z Pizza and I can't in good conscience bring myself to ever call Pizza Hut or Dominoes again!  The pizza selection fantastic...You've got to get the Napoli or the Provence pizzas.  They're not just good, but sublimely good for a place around the corner.  I feel bad for anyone not within delivery range, but I guess I am lucky to be so close and have access to great, simple pizzas and salads that don't taste "fast".  A definite must visit when in the Northeast Valley!
