My sister in law recommended Valley Pediatric to me and rightfully so! The entire staff was wonderful! Dr. Amy worked her magic and took care of everything with in one visit. Now I understand why they have pediatric offices, you really need a special touch and understnading of how children think and they have it down pat here!!!
