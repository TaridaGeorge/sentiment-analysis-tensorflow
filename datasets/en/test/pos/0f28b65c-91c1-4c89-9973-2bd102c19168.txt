I am a long-time happy and satisfied customer.  I called Hendel's this morning because my A/C had quit 24 hours earlier.  I called at 8AM.  The technician was here at 8:45.  He made the diagnosis and repair and was gone before 9:30.  The cost was very reasonable.  As long as there's a Hendel's Air Conditioning, I'll be a customer.
