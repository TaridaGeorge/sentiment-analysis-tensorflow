It's not over-crowded, the theaters are always clean and tidy, and the crew is always friendly and helpful. They have an array of different options from seats that move and rumble with the movie to wait staff that will bring your food and drinks right to your seat with the push of a button. If you haven't gone, then you should, but don't go too often...I like the lack of crowds! :-)
