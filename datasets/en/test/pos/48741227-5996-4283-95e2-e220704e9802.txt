The pizza is awesome but be prepared to wait.  I went with a group of 8 and waited about 4 hours to get seated.  The nice thing was they own the bar next door so we had a great time talking over drinks and appetizers.  The pizza was awesome and the staff are really friendly.  Altogether it was a great Saturday night.
