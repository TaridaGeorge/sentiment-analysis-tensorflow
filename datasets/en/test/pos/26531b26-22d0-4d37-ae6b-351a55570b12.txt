Love love love the Biltmore! By far my favorite macy's ever! Because they have more upscale merchandise but the same sales as every other macy's. I have found some amazing shoe deals here! I also enjoy the set up and browsing through the stuff I can't afford.

Great place to take out of towners to walk around in December and make them jealous. And around Christmas time they have snow machines!
