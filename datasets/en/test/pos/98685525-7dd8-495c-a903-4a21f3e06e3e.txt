My family and I ate here after a killer work out at CrossFit Mesa. I am the owner of the gym and a big part of my coaching is giving healthy eating advice to my clients. I was very pleased to learn that the Mesa Grill Co. Had an amazing menu that allowed my family and I to enjoy a healthy Paleo meal in a nice burger joint setting. 

The owner informed me that all the menu items could be made in salad form to avoid any grain or beef could be substituted with a 6oz chicken breast. The nice thing is that these options are on the menu, their not just winging it it's a menu that has been thought out!

We will be regulars at Mesa Grill Co. As long as they continue to serve awesome healthy food!
