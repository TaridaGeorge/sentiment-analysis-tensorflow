Love the urban feel contrasted with the French cuisine and pastries.  I usually get the foie gras sandwich (comes with a salad & amazing vinagrette) which leaves just enough room for...dessert!  

I've tried quite a few pastries and don't have anything bad to say about any of them.  I do prefer the milk chocolate tart to the dark even though I'm usually a dark chocolate person.  So that's a darn good tart.  Dessert cups tend to be VERY sweet.

Great friendly atmosphere and definitely interesting to see an Asian guy with a French accent.
