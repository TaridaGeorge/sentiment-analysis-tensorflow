We have found our new Favorite Breakfast Sandwich at  the Restaurant: TOAST, in Central Phoenix.  

It all starts with MJ Bread and then Perfectly Prepared/Seasoned Marriage of Egg, Meat: (Sausage -or- Bacon),  Cheese, Tomato, Spinach and Onion.  Latte's are frothy with Rich Coffee Flavor and the Scones are to die for.

Do yourself a treat and stop by this Intimate, Hip, Casual, UP-Beat, spot.   Be Kind to your Tummy - Life is too short for Mediocre Food.  Put Toast on your list and ENJOY.
