I go for the hot chocolate on a chilly morning. My daughter loves their lattes. And we really enjoy the quaint atmosphere of a nursery in the background. A serene way to spend a morning. 

Ted and Maria are absolutely fabulous hosts. Ted is a musician and every so often, they jam at the nursery. Don't miss it. Also, Maria does monthly events and fundraisers for local charities. 

If you have dogs, they just started selling treats for them. Bonus!
