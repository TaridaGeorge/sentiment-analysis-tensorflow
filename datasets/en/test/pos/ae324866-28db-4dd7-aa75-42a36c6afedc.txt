The antithesis of Starbucks...independent coffee shop at its finest.  Bungalow with slacker types on Macs, board games, and dudes with dreadlocks on their fourth quadruple espresso latte for the day (and it is only 1:30 p.m.).  Americano was unbelievably smooth, made me swear off corporate coffee for almost a week (until I had no choice).
