Oh my sweet darling 8,000 calorie ooey, gooey delight. You are my pre-flight tradition. Prior to boarding I always purchase one cinnamon role to eat on board for two reasons. The first, because it's usually the start of my vacation piggery and my low carb diet goes out the window. The second, this could be my last meal and I sure as hell don't want it to be airline slop.
