I have never had a facial or any spa treatment before, but I assume this deserves 5 stars.  I had a facial and a  detoxifying body treatment, and they were both amazing.  The  staff is kind, friendly and helpful.    The facilities are beautiful.   There is a steam room, jacuzzi, pool, fitness center and beautiful, huge showers.  I hope to go back someday.  Even if you don't stay at the resort- give some of the treatments a try.
