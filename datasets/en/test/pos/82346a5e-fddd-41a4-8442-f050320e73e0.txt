When I'm in town, my mom and I always stop for some apps and a glass of wine here.  It's such a sweet place to go.  It's casual and eligant at the same time.  Their salads and bruschetta are TO DIE FOR!  Fresh is a priority with them.  Everything seems freshly made to order.  If you're looking for a quick wine break in between shopping, this is your place.
