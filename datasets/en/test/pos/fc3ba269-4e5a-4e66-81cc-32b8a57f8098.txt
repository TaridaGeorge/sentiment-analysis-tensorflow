Awesome hotel.  I got a suite with a full kitchen, a living room area, and then the room where the bed actually was is pretty huge! I love that internet is complimentary, I'm used to paying 10-15 bucks a day.  I read that they do have complimentary breakfast and I got here late today and they had some kind of light eats for dinner time close to the lobby.  The only thing is that they don't have room service if you do get check-in pretty late but they do have a booklet where you can order but there is a 20 minimum and a delivery fee.  I paid it just because I'm tired and don't want to go anywhere but there are some restaurant close by.
