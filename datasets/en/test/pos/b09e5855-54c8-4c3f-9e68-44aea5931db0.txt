The best steak that I've had in years. Cooked perfectly, tender, and juicy. And the pesto sauce on top was amazing! The lamb is also fantastic. Service was great, the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. Nice atmosphere, the patio outside has a firepit and nice outdoor seating. The restaurant is towards the back of the hotel, there was live music in the entry area of the hotel, but you couldn't hear it in the restaurant. It's a bit pricey, but the food is worth it. We plan on visiting again on our next date night. Definitely recommend for a quite dinner out!
