Jessica is fantastic!  She has a tiny private salon space, which is just the right size for stripping down without feeling awkward or like you are being put on display.  :) She is super friendly while still maintaining the professionalism you want from someone who is seeing your  ....  .... parts.  LOL!  I had an airbrush tan - she customizes the color lever for you and was great with advice about how dark I should go.  The color is great - I never thought that my white self could look so naturally tan!  

Even better, when I was paying she let me know that as a first time Yelper client I got a discount!  I will deff be back soon.  Thx Jessica!
