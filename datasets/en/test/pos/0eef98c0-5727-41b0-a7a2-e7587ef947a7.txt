Went there last week and we were very pleasantly surprised. Everything on the menu looked delicious. We had an order of onion rings to start out and they were great. Then we had a couple of steaks for dinner. The Beef Bistro Tender was rediculous. If you're getting a steak, go for this one. The price is great also. We had the New York Strip as well, but it didn't hold a candle ot the other. Avoid the strip and go for the bistro tender. They have a great selection of beers. They are devoted to using local products and making everything from scratch and it shows. We'll definitely be back.
