I wanted to add Upper Crust to the best Happy Hour list, that is why I logged in, but my friend and I visited Upper Crust Pizza for lunch today.  He was as pleasantly surprised as I usually am.  There are many reviews on Upper Crust and I am happy that they are somewhat close, sorry Rachel C.  

The pizza is fantastic and my favorite appetizer are the stuffed mushrooms.  Dang those are good!  I have had more items but for a $5, the mushrooms are a happy hour favorite. They are with cheese and sausage with a generous portion, it's fantastic. 

It also deserve mention that their pizza is awesome and for $4 the personal cheese is YUMMY!

Well, I am glad that I make it here at least once a month.
