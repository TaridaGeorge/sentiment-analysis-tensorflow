This place is just  consistently great, with great service.

The wine list is great, and I just really enjoy the small-plate experience.  It allows you to try a bunch of things without getting too stuffed (which allows you to drink a bit more wine)!

The pancetta-wrapped gorgonzola stuffed dates are SUBLIME.  We also got the lobster corn dogs -- very fun, with great dipping sauces.
