I've recently moved to Phoenix and was looking for a good accountant. After reading the other yelp reviews I decided to make an appointment with Michael Gallacher. I am so glad I did, he was extremely knowledgeable and helpful and I feel a great deal of relief and comfort knowing he will be handling my taxes for my business and personal needs.
