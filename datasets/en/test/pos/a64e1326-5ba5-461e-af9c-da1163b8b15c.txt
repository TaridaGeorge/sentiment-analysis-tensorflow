What a gorgeous place for hiking! The trails are well-marked, well-maintained, and varied enough for different hikers with varying capabilities and degrees of stamina. The rock formations and vistas are amazing, and along the trails there are a number of benches where you can sit and rest while taking in the view. On a clear day, (such as today when my friend and I did the hike), you are treated to a spectacular view of the surrounding mountains, and even the skyline of Phoenix is visible in the distance.
