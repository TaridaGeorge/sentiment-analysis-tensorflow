I love this place. I go here often but this last time I went to see a friends art they had on display and of course for the Shwarma (spelling?) I tend to order mine with no tomatoes and the sauces on the side. I can't help it, I like to deconstruct the wrap. 

Big fan of this place and the service is always top notch.
