The sushi is always amazing. They have the best spicy tuna hand roll in exsistance and the albacore tataki is to die for! The service can be hit or miss. I have been eating at kampai since 1996, and have seen my share of snooty employees come and go. As for the sushi, it ia always fresh and delicious & you can count on getting some uni or toro freguently. The rolls are sometimes a little "loose" and need to be eaten quickly because once you dip a pc in soy it tends to fall apart. Otherwise excellent. Please also try the ginger dressing!
