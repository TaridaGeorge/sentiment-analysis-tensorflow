The food was AMAZING!!!!  I've had my share of bad Chinese but this isn't even close.  I placed my order for delivery and it arrived at the time they said and it was PIPING HOT!!!  Not lukewarm or just warm it was HOT!!

I highly recommend the Flamingo Chicken.  It's a simple dish but the sauce that is served with it is amazing.  Also the House Special Chow Main is phenomenal.  It's not loaded up with a lot of filler.  It has appropriate portions of meat, veggies and noodles.  The Pork Fried Rice was little salty but with everything else it was still good.

I have found my new Chinese Restaurant!!!!  After living in Seattle for over 20+ years this place can compete with the best one in Seattle.
