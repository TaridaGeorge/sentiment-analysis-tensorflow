This is honestly the best place I have been to for Dry Cleaning.  The price for clothing is cheap, always surpasses my expectations, and oh, one more thing.  It doesn't matter what I have brought in, suits, shirts, etc., every time I have brought it in around 5pm, I am always told it will be ready for pick up by 4pm the following day.  Always!  No complaints here, just praise, and the employee (Possibly owner) is very respectful and pleasant.  I will continue to go to Krisply Kleen!
