I love going to the opera. I am always impressed with the vocal range of the performers. They can do amazing things with their voices! And the sets and costumes are so elaborate. That is the best part. Even though they are usually sung in a language that I don't understand, you can really get swept up in the emotion of the music. I usually read the program beforehand so that I know what's going on and then try my best not to stay fixated on the subtitles on the screen but instead just enjoy the action on the stage, the orchestra, and of course the singing.
