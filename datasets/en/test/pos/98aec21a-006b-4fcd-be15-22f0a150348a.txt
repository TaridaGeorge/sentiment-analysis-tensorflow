A million years ago, when I was a desert-dweller, the Chuckbox was my absolute favorite stop for a smoky tender chicken sandwich. The place is a dive, and was literally falling apart, just like their soft juicy meat. They grill the meat as you wait in a cafeteria style line with carniverous anticipation. Probably a vegetarian's worst nightmare, this spot is a MUST for any BBQ lover who is trapped in a desert college town.
