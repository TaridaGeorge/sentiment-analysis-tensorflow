As far as sports bars go, this one can't be beat. You won't find one in the East Valley with better food, beer selection, happy hour, or a friendlier staff. This is hands-down one of my favorite places in all of Ahwatukee and the surrounding areas.

I've been here bunches of times, and the only one bad experience I had (overcooked burger) they took care of the situation above and beyond.

I can't say it enough: go, eat, drink, see for yourself: Public House is the best around.
