I was brought here by my team at work and was truthfully afraid I'd starve (I'm not a vegetarian). The environment was fun and inviting and I ordered the "Big Wac" and would you know, it was much better than the Big Mac! Five stars because this place is truly awesome!

Caution on parking, though, there's not much of it and a lot of people don't seem to know how to negotiate the lot.
