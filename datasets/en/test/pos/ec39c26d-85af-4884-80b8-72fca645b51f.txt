Dr. Bryant is one of the most professional orthodontist I have met. He is kind hearted and always attentive to all of his patients. I've never had a bracket pop off or anything break. His staff and team are wonderful and will work with you so you can have a beautiful smile at the end of your experience. Also he is very kind hearted I once lost my retainer and he graciously gave me a new one, free of charge. I definitely recommend him to anyone who is looking for a professional staff that have your best interest at heart.
