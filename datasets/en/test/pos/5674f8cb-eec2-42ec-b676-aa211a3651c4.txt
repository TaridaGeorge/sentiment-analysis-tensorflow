I just got 9 items dry-cleaned for about $20!! Can I get a "HELLS YEAH?!!"
 
I'm so happy I discovered this cleaners.  They are a HUGE step up from my old cleaners and are awesome with their same day turn-around service!  They charge about $1.25 to have any item dry cleaned and if you turn it in by 9am, then they will have it to you by 4pm.  Regal also has later hours, staying open until 7pm.  Be aware that they do not accept debit/credit cards but they do have an ATM in their lobby. 

I never thought that I could get so excited over a dry cleaners.
