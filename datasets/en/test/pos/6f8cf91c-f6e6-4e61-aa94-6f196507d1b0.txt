A lot more than a restaurant.  The best place to hang out in North Phoenix.  A mixed crowd of mostly 20 to 40-somethings.  However, everyone is made welcome.  Great HEALTHY  food.  Friendly servers.  The burgers (Beef, Turkey, Veggie, Tofu) are all great.  The edamame salad is one of my favs.  For breakfast get the protein/complex carb pancakes (order just 1... its huge) or granola/fruit oatmeal. Great smoothies as well.
