MY DREAM PLACE - healthy fast food!  I tried the Scottsdale location on Saturday for the first time - had the Protein Burger, Early Bird style, and it was so delicious.  Also had the dirty chai (has a shot of espresso) - so good.

Today I had the Signature Tuna Sandwich from the Tempe location, and thought it was excellent.  Everything tastes so fresh and has such distinct yummy flavors.

I saw the Tempe location didn't have many reviews and a lower rating so I wanted to try it out for myself.  I thought the food was just as good, and as I live in Tempe, I will be frequenting that location. 

The drive-thrus seem kind of slow and ridiculous, but eh, that's ok -- worth it!
