In a word.....Divine!

My colleague and I always choose something a bit more upscale on our last dinner in town on business trips and we were very happy with our choice to dine at Tommy V's. 

The wine selection to start was good and had some "off-the-beaten-path" choices. The plates were equally wonderful. 

My colleague is a sucker for pasta and therefore chose the Carbonara. I had a taste and thought it was very nice. Not as creamy as Carbonara is usually served on the East Coast but really nice. Very flavorful and just a tad lighter than normal. I had the Sea bass and it was very tasty with the lentils.

The service was good and the premises very clean and attractive. Looking forward to return trips to the area so I can enjoy this restaurant again.

Enjoy!
