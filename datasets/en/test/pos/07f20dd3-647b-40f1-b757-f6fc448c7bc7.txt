Went here after the Critical Mass bike ride last night.  We had so much fun!  It was a great night to sit on the patio.  There was 80s karaoke.  I've only eaten breakfast here, so it was good to check out the other offerings.  My friends got a salad that looked fantastic.  Another friend got the biscuit sliders, and said they were yummy.  I wasn't hungry, but I did sample the homemade chips, both regular potato and sweet potato.  Both were delicious, but I thought the sweet potato chips had a more complex, interesting flavor.  We drank too many mojitos and mingled with our fellow bicyclists into the night.  The venue was very accommodating, and had set aside an area for us to lock up our bikes.  Fun!  Oh, and news flash!  The Duce will soon carry Rock Springs famous pies!!!
