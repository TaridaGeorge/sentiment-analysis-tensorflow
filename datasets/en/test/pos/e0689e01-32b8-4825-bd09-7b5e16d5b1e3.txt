Cheap prices, decent food, friendly staff. I had the General Tsao's, added a side of veggies and an iced tea - came out to $8.30. My friend had the Kung Poa Chicken with water and he was out the door for $5.40 (less tip). 

I gave this place 5 stars for the friendly staff, great price, and decent food.
