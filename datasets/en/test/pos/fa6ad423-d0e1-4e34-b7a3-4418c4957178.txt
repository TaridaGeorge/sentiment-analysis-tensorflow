Hands down the Oatmeal and the Pistachio are the best flavors. I've had my fair share of Fro-Yo places and this one is by far the cleanest, and tastiest of them all.  And the decor isn't too shabby either, I love it.

Yogurtology definitely has a plethora of toppings to choose from; Fruit, candy, syrups to even baklava! 

They now offer a keychain card, so after I believe 8 purchases you get a $1.00 off your 9th purchase. Not bad. Definitely encourage you to try this place out... you probably won't sway to any other Fro-yo place after this :) Just saying.
