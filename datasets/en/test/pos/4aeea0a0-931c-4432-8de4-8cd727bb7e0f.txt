Was thrilled to see the old Caffe Portobello location reopen. If you're up around the McDowell Mountain area, you should make a point to swing by the Twisted Lizard. We've always loved the location and the staff at this location is sensational. Great patio, great bar, lots of patrons. The food is great, especially the pulled pork and smoked brisket (appetizer, sandwich or entree). All five of the lahvosh choices are fantastic, too. If you're really into draught beer, you might be disapponted, but there's a great wine list and plenty of bottled beer. Great place to go hang out with a few couples - especially if the guys want to keep one eye on a ball game. ;-)
