First time visit on a Friday evening. The happy hour is affordable and delicious. Drinks are imaginative and flavorful. The patio is comfortable and cozy with a fireplace and heaters. We sampled our way through appetizers of Mediterranean style meatballs, veggie flatbread, and goat cheese baked with fresh tomatoes. All were spectacular. Dinner salad was crisp and fresh, and the polenta was creamy good. Hubby had the risotto which was a bit salty to my palate, but appropriately creamy. Our friends had the salmon which was moist and flavorful, and the black rice shrimp bowl which was tangy and tasty. The only bummer was the chocolate cake. The gelato it came with was superb, but the cake was so dry. Sorry. We will definitely be back. Maybe the sticky toffee pudding next time....
