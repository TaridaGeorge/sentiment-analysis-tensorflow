great service!

i brought my company here for a happy hour, and i knew it would be packed.  so i called ahead, and the hostess reserved us a table for 6.  when i got there, the table was all ready for us.  terrific scratch made drinks and happy hour food.  we had margaritas made with herradura, my favorite tequila.  the apps are a cut above your normal bar food; the wings are perfect.  everyone loved it..

ive had dinner here a few times as well, and i always find it a great value for the level of service and quality of food.  great consistency each time.  will bring everyone back soon.
