Zinc Bistro -- very French.  Indeed a favorite of mine.  Love the onion soup and the chocolate souffle; good bread and French style butter -- a slab -- not that whipped garbage.  I ask for French slab of butter everywhere I eat and some places say it is not available.  I always say "ask the chef."
And, suddenly it appears.
