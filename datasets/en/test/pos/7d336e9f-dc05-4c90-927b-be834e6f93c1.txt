My co worker had suggested I use Philosophy after she used it and got awesome results.........Of course anything to help my face maintain my youthful skin......I got a sample and tried it at home wow talk about instant results....my daughters and my mother noticed how clean my face was and how my face just glowed........

I now am the proud owner of the Philosophy face wash Purity and the Exfoliator face wash...I love it I am faithful..........it is also gentle enough for my off spring to use,,,,my mom is also treating herself to this lovely experience

Next I will be purchasing the Oxygen Peel and the Eye Serum.


Thank you my very crafty Co worker Marcella thank you so much for this introduction!
