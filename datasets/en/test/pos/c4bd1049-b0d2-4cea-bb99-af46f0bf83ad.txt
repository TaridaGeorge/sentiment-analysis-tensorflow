Part of it may be nostalgia. If you grew up in G'Town you shopped at Liberty Market when it was the town's general store. Maybe you and your cousins would show up in a pack to buy a coke (in a bottle) and pick up some groceries for the grandparents. 

Joe Johnston, always respectful of Gilbert's history and people, has opened a great place to grab a casual meal with family and friends.  The breakfast is the best.  Especially the biscuits.  They taste just like the one's my nana used to make.  

They have a bit for everyone on the menu, including great coffee, a nice selction of craft beers and a decent wine list.  It can get crowded around meal times but it's worth the wait.
