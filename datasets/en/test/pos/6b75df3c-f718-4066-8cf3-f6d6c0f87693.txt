Love this stadium! I've only been to stadiums along the west coast but out of all them, Chase Field is my favorite. The temperature is perfect, the seats are comfortable, parking is easy & inexpensive, and most importantly, the food options are way more varied than most stadiums. There's chinese, mexican, pizza, gluten free options, salad (whoa not normal stadium food), ice cream, dessert treats, and all the regular stadium food. Prices are pretty comparable to other stadiums, however there is a value menu that has $1.50 food options & $4 beers. The $4  beers are a ripoff though cause it's only 8 oz and a normal $9 draft beer is 24 oz...do the math. 

There are a good number of sports bars that are walking distance from the stadium, and Sliders is right next to the stadium with a big outdoor beer garden.
