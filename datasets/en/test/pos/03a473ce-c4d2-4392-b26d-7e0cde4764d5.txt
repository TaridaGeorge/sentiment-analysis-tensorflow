Recently under new ownership, and we've noticed a much better selection of wines that they offer. We love the happy hour! - and they offer TONS of fun wines to try by the glass. Our favorite: the ONEHOPE Merlot - it was more like a bordeaux blend, and oh so good! Very affordable, and half of the profits get donated to charity. We'll definitely be coming back to Enotria!
