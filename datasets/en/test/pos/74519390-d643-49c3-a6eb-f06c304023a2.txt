Eyebrow wax?  No way.  It's all about the thread.  

Tori is absolutely amazing.  She is so accommodating too.  My friend and I called an hour before we showed, and she said to just come on in, and that she'll fit us in her schedule.  We were literally in there for maybe 10 minutes, and then we were out-thee quickest brow service ever!  

She knows what she's doing.  All she asks of you is to sort of pull your upper eyebrow skin...which is fair to me if I don't have to deal with any sort of sticky residue afterward, no blotching, no redness-all the irritants you get from waxing, gone!  

Threading is just soo good.  It leaves you with the most natural, precise lines.  Thank you Tori!!
