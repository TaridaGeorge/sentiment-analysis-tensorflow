Must try drinks here include the Gin drink as it is made from scratch at your table. I won't make any other comments on the drinks as I don't want to ruin the experience. This bar is good for small groups on 6 or less only. 

My only complaint will have to be the wait but it is needed for the ambiance of the bar.
