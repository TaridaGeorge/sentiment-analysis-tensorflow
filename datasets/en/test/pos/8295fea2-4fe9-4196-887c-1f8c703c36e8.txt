Great hotel, very clean. The hotel is very quiet and the rooms are a nice size. I was upgraded to a suite, which is basically two rooms connected together. 

The hotel is close to a lot of shopping and wonderful restaurants. There is a very large mall about a mike away that offers a regular mall experience along with some upscale shopping.
