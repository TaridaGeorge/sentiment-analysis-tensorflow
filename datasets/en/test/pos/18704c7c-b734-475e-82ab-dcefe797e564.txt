I was conveniently greeted by Pablo as I arrived. My tire pressure light was on- and I spent several quarters/ time trying to fix the problem on my own. 

Thank God for this place. Because I bought my tires from here, I have an extended warranty- and they replace or fix the issue every time. Pablo and the Discount Tire team said that I had a nail in my tire- and fixed it in 15 minutes- perfect!

I was able to have lunch and make it back to the office in time. 
The staff was friendly, professional, and engaging. I'll always come here first before testing my gas station- air pumping technique.:)

Thanks guys!
