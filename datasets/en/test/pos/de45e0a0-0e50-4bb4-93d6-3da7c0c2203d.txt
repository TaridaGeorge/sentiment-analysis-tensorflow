After an hour and a half the pizza was excellent.  There was a charity event here last night where half the proceeds went to the family in need.  Their volume had tripled due to the event and they handled it very well.  I've never seen a pizza place on overdrive like that as I saw about 65 pizzas slung out in an hour.

My pizza was excellent.  Pepperoni and cheese with just the right amount of sauce.  Great crust and not too doughy made it perfect.  One dozen wings with Joe's Sauce had just the right flavoring.  Not too spicy but not plain either.

I was mainly a Barro's fan but I will come back here for the customer service and the great pizza.
