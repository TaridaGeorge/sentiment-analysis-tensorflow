My doctor's office used to be in the same complex as Genrich, which is how I found them, even though my doctor's office has moved, I continue to go here instead of Walgreens, Target, etc. I like it that it's a small pharmacy, there's rarely a wait longer than 5 minutes, the pharmacist and the techs are always friendly, always helpful, and too, I prefer to support an independent business.
