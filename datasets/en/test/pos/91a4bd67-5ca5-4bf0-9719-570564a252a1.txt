Wow!  These guys are really fair priced.  Do their work quickly.  And do not rip you off.  They took off 45 min worth of work that was written into the quote they gave me without me saying a word.  I called a couple of dealers for a part (drivers power mirror) $190!  They installed one and buffed out a small scratch benith it for $114.  They will get all my future business, I recommend them to anyone.
