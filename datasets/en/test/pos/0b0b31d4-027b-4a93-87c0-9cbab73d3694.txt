I share Tim's sentiments about Behind the Mask.  In a hockey store starved town, BTM could really rake you over the coals for their inventory.  Yet I always come out of there paying $5-$10 less than the ticketed price.  I have even gone in there needing small replacement items, willing to pay $10-$15 for it, but somehow I never end up paying.  The manager, Brian, is a goalie like myself, and I could spend all day talking about random things, equipment, or the state of the game.  I don't even bother ordering from catalogs or websites and go directly to BTM.
