I get my eyes checked about 1 time a year, sometimes once ever 2 years.  Lucky me has perfect vision.  I see Dr. Maury Kessler.  Nice man. 

Wish I had more to say-- It is a really nice office space and the people working there seem really friendly. 

Now I know my vision is going to be flawed for my next check up simply b/c I said I have perfect vision.
