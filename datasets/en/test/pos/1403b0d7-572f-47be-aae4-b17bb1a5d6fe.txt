I called with an emergency and they were able to get me in the same day - how amazing is that? The staff was super-friendly on the phone and even nicer in person. Dr. Farraye is professional and efficient and knows his stuff . I'm so glad I found this office as I've been looking for a primary care dentist since I moved here 6 months ago. I highly recommend him.
