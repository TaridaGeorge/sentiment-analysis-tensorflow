Love these dogs!  If you love hot dogs, you should track down this truck immediately. I always get the same thing--the dog with the sauerkraut--but everyone I've dined with has loved their selections too.  Ask the owners what combos they suggest for the various toppings.  They are incredibly nice and knowledgeable.  You will have to wait for your food longer than if you get a hot dog at Costco (which I also love), but it will be worth it.  It's good food, not fast food.
