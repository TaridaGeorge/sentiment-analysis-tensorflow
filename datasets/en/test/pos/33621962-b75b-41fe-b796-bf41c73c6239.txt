This is the neatest place to have coffee and extras.  They also serve great lunches.  The staff is the friendliest people I know.  They make you feel like part of the family.  The facility not only quenches your thirst and feeds you well, they also have Yoga classes and they cater weddings.  All of this at a reasonable price.  The courtyard is is like sitting in a small grove and the inside is so cozy.
