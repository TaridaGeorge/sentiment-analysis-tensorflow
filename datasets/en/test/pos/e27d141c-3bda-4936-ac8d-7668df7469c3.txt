Being within walking distance of this place is what I will miss the most when I move across town. Pages and pages of menu items, but most of the time I just get something off of the first page - the "special bowl." It is a pretty decent amount of really good food for $3.98. There are about 15 different options on this all day, every day deal and I have yet to be disappointed. I got it to-go for the first time today and I think they gave me even more than when I eat there as the standard sized to go box was overflowing with rice, chicken, and vegetables. Check out the appetizers, too. 10 steamed dumplings for $2.99 is practically a meal in itself! Do yourself a favor and check this place out!
