Five of us had dinner at Carrabba's on Saturday 3/10 and experienced a few problems with our food and service.  This was a surprise to us because we have been to Carrabba's numerous times and have always had excellent food and service.  

We are type of people who understand that sometimes things happen, so we did not make a big deal about it and wrote it off as just a bad night....

Entrees came minutes after our salads were given to us.
One entree was not what the person ordered.
Food was just warm and not hot.

Not that big a deal, right?

Carrabba's answer was to comp all five meals, the sign of a truly great restaurant.  

Carrabba's, a great place, good food and great management.....
