I never ever thought I would find a dive bar like the ones in Flagstaff. Ever.

Last night, I was proven wrong.  The Lost Leaf is a pleasant breath of fresh air, devoid of the moronic masses that usually clog bars. There is fantastic art everywhere, and fabulous music. 

And the beer listing is the best I have had in town. I will come here again and again.
