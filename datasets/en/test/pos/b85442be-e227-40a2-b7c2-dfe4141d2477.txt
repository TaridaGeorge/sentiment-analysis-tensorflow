My home away from home. 

I write some keyword blogs for a living so I need someplace to work. I go here and try to look like I am working on a script instead because the hipster girls like that.

The baristas are all lovely ladies (Except Joreal [sp?] but he is cool as shit so I let it slide).

The coffee is divine. The place is hip and you will run in to myself and/or Wayne almost daily and that's cool right?
