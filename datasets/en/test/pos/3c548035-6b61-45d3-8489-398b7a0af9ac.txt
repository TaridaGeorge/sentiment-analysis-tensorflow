Always a great hostess gift when you know your friends have pets. I know a bottle of wine, brie or fresh flowers would be nice however I do admit to loving dogs more that people. I just showed up at a housewarming party and trust me the bacon and cheese treats in a the cutest doggie treat pot made a perfect gift. I love this store, we get the good stuff for our dogs to. Would recommend to anyone needing a fun treat or gift for the dog lovers you know.
