Miller Barber Shop not only offers an excellent haircut but a great experience as well. The facility is clean, the staff are friendly, and the service is second to none. The barbers give exceptional attention to even the minor details ensuring that you have a first class hair cut. Individuals used to the mall style hair cut cattle calls are in for a real treat and you will be loathe to return to the corporate cookie cutter experience.  I happily frequent this establishment on a monthly basis.
