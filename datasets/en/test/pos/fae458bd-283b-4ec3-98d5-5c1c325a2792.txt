I think we discovered a new take away favorite that will not break the bank, within walking distance and with exceptional food.  I couldn't believe the quality of the ingredients is outstanding, the portions are more than expected, the combination of flavors is just right,  and the price us unbeatable.  Nope, I don't work there, I was looking to try something other than Lin's or the Golden Egg-roll.  Trust me, they better catch up!  the Poo Poo Platter is flavorful, tender and don't taste like reused fried oil.  the house fried rice cleans up the fridge with big identifiable pieces of all ingredients, the Mongolian beef... Oh well, I'll shut up, you go and try it.  It's Ab-Fab, Stoli and all, pass the bottle Patsy...!
