What a great place to go for Homebrew Supplies. The store is spotlessly clean, very well organized and well laid out. The staff there is very friendly and knowledgeable about homebrewing just about anything. Also you do not feel intimidated if you lack certain knowledge about the brewing process, because they are there to help. They have about everything you need for all your brewing needs, and at a very reasonable price. I will surly return to BYOB for my homebrew needs.
