I have now been here 4 times and can't say enough good things. My first time was right before my wedding as a gift from a bridesmaid and I was booked with Emma who is fabulous! I have been going to her since then and she always makes me comfortable during each appointment. The place is very clean and nice. I love the wax they use because there are no strips involved! I recommend this place to my friends!
