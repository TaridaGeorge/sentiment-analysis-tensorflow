i used to go to monroe's back in the day, and it was a really sweet, literally underground,  spot.  i've also heard from many people that it's been closed (i haven't lived in phoenix for a couple of years), and that makes me sad.  it is now my mission to see this place, or something like it, back in dtphx.  who's with me?!
