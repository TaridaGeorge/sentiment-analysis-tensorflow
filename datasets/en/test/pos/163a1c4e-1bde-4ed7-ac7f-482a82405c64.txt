We went last night and sat at the bar.  Good cocktails and a nice wine selection. They have hooks under the bar for your bag which is always a bonus in my book.  Started off with the chorizo stuffed dates.  They were tasty.  We ordered the pork loin and Vovo's special which were raviolis stuffed with beef and pork with a vodka sauce.  The pork loin was seriously tasty.  Lick the sauce from the plate kind of tasty.  Was one of the best restaurant meals I have had in a long time. You won't be disappointed if you order it.  The ravioli on the other hand was flat in my opinion.  Just overall needed more seasoning.  Groovy local atmosphere.  We will go back.
