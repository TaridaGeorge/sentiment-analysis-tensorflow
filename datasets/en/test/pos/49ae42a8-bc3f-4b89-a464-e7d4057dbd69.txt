I've been searching for a "bar pizza" that I grew up on back East and Luna comes the closest.  I've been here 5 years and have tried just about every pizza around and was very disappointed.  Luna helps me make it through to my Boston visits.  The chicken wings are also very good.  It's a 15 min. ride but worth it.
