What a great place! In addition to the physical facilities, which have been restored and maintained in their Rat Pack splendor, the staff is so accommodating and professional. I have stayed here several times since discovering the Valley Ho a few years ago, and it never disappoints. The guest rooms are lovely (even the smaller ones, and the suites are spectacular!), the common areas are beautiful, and the food and libations are delicious. From the moment you drive up until the minute you check out, this place is comfortable and delightful - a spot to get away from it all while enjoying all the perks of Scottsdale. A real treasure!
