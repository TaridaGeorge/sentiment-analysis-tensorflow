Just 2 words for you Italian Beef! If you are from the midwest and miss good Italian beef sammies GO HERE NOW! 

I used to go to Niro's at least twice a week when I lived in Champaign, IL. Niro's opened in an old Rally's just 2 short blocks from my house. I became friendly with the owners. About a year later told them I was moving and they wouldn't be seeing me anymore. They asked where too & I said Phoenix and they said they were opening one in Phoenix not sure where. Well I found you again Niro! 

Love the Italian beef it is what I am used to from Illinois thanx!
