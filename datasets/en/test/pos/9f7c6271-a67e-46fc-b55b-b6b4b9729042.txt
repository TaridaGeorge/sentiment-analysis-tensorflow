This is well outside our normal stomping ground, but we stomped in while in the area based on Yelp reviews and were not disappointed.  We did not eat anything remotely health, but everything was spectacularly tasty.  

Big loaded hot dogs and tasty Italian Beef... it's a good thing I don't live in Chicago (or near Boomer's) or I'd be in deep (fried) trouble.
