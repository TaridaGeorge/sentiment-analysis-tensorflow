Not that PB needs another review, or that mine will do justice, but PB is wonderfully amazing. Everything I've had here is TO DIE FOR and is definitely worth the wait. Nothing like going next door to Bar Bianco and polishing off a few bottles of wine before feasting on the best pizza I'll have this lifetime! Seriously people, wait. It's SO worth it.
