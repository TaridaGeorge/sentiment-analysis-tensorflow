Chili's is one of my favorite restaurants.  It is casual and relatively inexpensive and there is usually little to no wait time.  The staff is always very friendly and the food comes out very quickly.  My favorite dish is the Quesadilla Explosion Salad, but i have honestly never eaten a bad meal here.  This is a place my family and I tend to frequent, and I definitely recommend it!
