Contacted Red Mountain Renovations after reading their reviews on here because I needed my bamboo flooring installed.  I have to agree with all of them.  

Scott and Alex were great to work with.  They are very personable and flexible.  My moldings didn't come in time for when they were installing my flooring, but they came back when I finally got them and didn't charge me for the extra work as well as time they took to come back out to my house.  They also had the best prices for installation as well.  

I highly recommend them to anyone that is looking for a company to install their flooring.  I will definitely be using them again in the future.
