Drove myself there with a bag of frozen peas on my possibly fractured and very swollen nose.They were the only urgent care in the area still open at 7:45 on a Saturday night.
Not only did they get me IMMEDIATE attention,they didn't even worry about getting my billing info before getting me seen.
They had 2 medical staffers take a fairly thourough look see and sent me to the ER.
While I was in the room,I filled out the paperwork,but because they couldn't do anything for me,they didn't even ask for a co-pay.
I thought that was impressive seeing as they did perfom an exam and discuss my injury with me.
They will most likely bill my insurance,but to not ask for the co-pay was incredibly human of them.
