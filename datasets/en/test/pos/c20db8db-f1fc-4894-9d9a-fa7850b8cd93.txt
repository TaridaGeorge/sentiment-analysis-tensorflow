I love this place. Everything is great. The tomato bisque is to die for, and the chicken panini is a regular order for me. Their bruchetta is comparable to Postinos, if you've been there, and the other cheese, olive, meat, etc. appetizers are big and delicious. I'd recommend this place over any in Downtown Chandler. It's my favorite! Seating is good inside and outside (huge fire pit is fun for big groups to sit around). I heard the Sunday brunch specials are also really awesome. It's a little pricier, but worth the quality and amount of food you get with each plate.
