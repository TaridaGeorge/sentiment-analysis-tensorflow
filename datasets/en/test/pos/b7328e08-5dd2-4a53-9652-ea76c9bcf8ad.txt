I was mailing a couple things out and didn't have tape for the boxes or a pen for the mailing labels .... It was a long day and I changed purses. There was a lady next to me tapping her boxes and she was so generous by letting me use hers. Realizing at this moment I didn't have a pen and there happens to be none around. There was a man standing inside that let me borrow his. Everyone here was so nice and generous!!

I used the computer mailing system and loved it!! I recommend trying it out if you haven't yet.
