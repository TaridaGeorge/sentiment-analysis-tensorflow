This is the most authentic Thai you'll find in Arizona! Simple, powerful flavors and genuine service. I love it here. It's the closest thing to going to Thailand. Recommended to me by a friend from Chiangmai, I take all my friends who would appreciate good Thai food here.  and you have to have a coconut sticky rice dessert .. whether its with custard or mango, its so so so good.
dont tell any one else to come to this little secret place though.
