Hillside spot is a great place for lunch. I have been there twice. First time I had the burger, which was juicy and everything I needed to cure my hangover. The second time I went for a healthier option and got the suki rice bowl - holy cow was I blown away. Perfect size and tasty! It comes with a small salad which was also very good. My boyfriend got the pulled pork sandwich which had a really good smokey flavor. Besides from the food, we had the best server I have had in awhile. Her name is Erica. She was fast, nice, charming, and on top of her game. I can't wait to come back and try hillside for dinner!
