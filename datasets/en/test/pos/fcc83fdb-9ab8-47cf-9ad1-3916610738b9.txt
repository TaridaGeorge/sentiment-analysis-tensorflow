Wow, this place is great.  I've lived here since 1997 and have been searching for good Chinese food ever since, and seriously, this little hole in the wall place is the best!  We order delivery or pick up at least once a week and are always happy with the food. The scallion pancakes are THE BEST!  You have to try them.
