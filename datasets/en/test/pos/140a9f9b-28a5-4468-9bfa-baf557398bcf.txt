We went to Joe's while we were visiting family in AZ.  The atmosphere is great!!  there is limited indoor seating and extensive outdoor seating that is shaded.  The burgers were awesome.  The sweet potato fries and onion rings are a must when you go here.  They have a great kids menu, my son's pizza was delicious.  Really big portions!  We went with a party of 6 and everyone was satisfied with the menu and their meals.
