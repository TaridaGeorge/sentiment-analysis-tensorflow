I really, really like this place. Several people have mentioned this place to my husband and yesterday we finally gave it a try.....what took so long?! 

Yesterday we stopped by for lunch. We started with the white bean hummus and warm artichoke appetizer served with flatbread. Umm, so good! For my meal I ordered the veggie sandwich on toasted focaccia bread with a side Meditterean salad. Ummmm, so good! My husband went with the chicken sandwich instead, it was sweet and spicy at the same time. For dessert we split the chocolate bouchon. Ummmmmmmmmmm, so incredibly good. Why did I let my husband have the last bite? Next time I will order my own, it is simply too good to share.

This will be the new place I take friends & family when they come to visit.
