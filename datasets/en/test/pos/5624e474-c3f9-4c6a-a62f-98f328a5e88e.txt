I usually dismiss Phoenix as an excellent culinary scene but Petite Maison really has shown me another side. Their CATERED beef tongue with delicious bone marrow mash potatoes is smooth haunting perfection and on par with food I have loved at Boulud and Jean Georges in NYC. I am so happy to find a delicious hidden gem!
