This was a fresh take and a nice change from the "normal" fast lunches I am used to. One my first visit I asked the lady helping me what she recommended. She said the steak kabobs are excellent and so are the chicken. My partner and I got one of each, lets just say this has become a regular stop for us. Food was fresh and tasty and the staff have always been very pleasant.
