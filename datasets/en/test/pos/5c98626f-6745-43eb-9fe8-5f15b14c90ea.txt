I am a die-hard Grimaldi's fan.  This Scottsdale location is the best one hands down.  It's Neapolitan style pizza, cooked in a coal fired oven, with fresh mozzarella sliced on it.  I've always been satisfied when I've went here.  The toppings are fresh, a bit pricey, but the pizza here isn't supposed to be loaded by design.  

I always suggest getting extra cheese, because I'm a sucker for bomb fresh mozz.  The sauce is perfect as well.
