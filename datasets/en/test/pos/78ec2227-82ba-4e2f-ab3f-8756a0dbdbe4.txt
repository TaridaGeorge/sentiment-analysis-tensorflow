Worth the 30 minute wait in 105 deg Phoenix!!  Everything is fabulous!
Had the bacon & eggs (Hog & Chick)...absolutely best bacon & eggs I've ever had.  High quality food and I'm not even a breakfast person.  Griddle cakes were fluffy and delicious.  Homemade bread for their toast and fresh farmers market cherry jam for spread.
