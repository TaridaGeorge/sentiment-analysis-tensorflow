I had not been to a dentist for 7 years until I experienced excruciating tooth pain. I have been going to Dr. Longwell for about 2 years now after a friend of mine recommended me to him. He is one of the friendliest guys I've met, and made the whole ugly process of visiting the dentist easy. I'm actually going to start visiting on a regular basis (every 6 months) and not waiting until I have problems.
