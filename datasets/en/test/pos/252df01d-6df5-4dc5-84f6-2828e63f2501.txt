I have been several times now to see movies here, and it is by far the best movie experience out there. The food is decent for the price, and the service is mostly great, but has issues when really packed. I give them a break on that since it was crazy the one time we had so so service. The seats are very comfortable. I recommend reserving for fisrt weekend premiers and using groupons for second week showings. Where else can you order a bottle of wine or pitcher of beer, even mixed drinks. We even took my parents in their 60's and they said it was the best movie experience they've had. They said they would drive from Anthem again passing up like6 theatres just to go there.
