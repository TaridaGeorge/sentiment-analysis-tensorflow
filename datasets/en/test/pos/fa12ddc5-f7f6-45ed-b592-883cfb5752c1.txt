Seriously soo good! Drove 60miles to come here about 5 times in the 3 months that I lived in AZ. 

I came here because of the triple D episode and it was soo worth it! Burgers, fries, onion rings, sweet potatoe fries and pizza are ALL GOOD! 
and check out their bathrooms.. its pretty cool too. 

Tried Joe's Real BBQ, which is their first restaurant but it was just OK. 
Joe's Farm grill is def. one of my fav places..
