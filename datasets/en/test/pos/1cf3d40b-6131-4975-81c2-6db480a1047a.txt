Best place in downtown Scottsdale for breakfast. The nutty waffle, Holla for Challah French Toast, bacon, and  and eggs benedict are very good. The breakfast burrito is the best deal in downtown Scottsdale. I have never had a bad meal. 

Is always crowded on Sat and Sunday AM and the wait is about 15 minutes. Good wait service and timely delivery of food.
