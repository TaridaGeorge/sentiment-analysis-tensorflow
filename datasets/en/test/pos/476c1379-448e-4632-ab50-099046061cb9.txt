Believe the hype.  The first time I ever made it in to this place, the same Calexico song playing in my truck was playing on their stereo as well, so they immediately scored some brownie points.  My favorite here is the tomato and mozzarella sandwich, and I generally believe that nothing can be good without meat.  This sangwich disproves that theory, admittedly weak and simple-minded to begin with, but still... amazing, amazing place, especially when the weather's good and you can sit outside.  The staff are usually rude, but fuck it - another case of holier-than-thou hipster a**holes saved by 6-star food.  The owner seems like a good enough dude.
