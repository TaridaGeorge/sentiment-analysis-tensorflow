My wife, my son and I had a FANTASTIC lunch today at Italian Restaurant.  My wife and I are Brooklyn born and raised and It DEFINITELY met our New York City expectations.  The prosciutto was EXCELLENT, the homemade mozzarella  was to die for, and the flour less chocolate cake was the best we had ever had.   The bread reminded me of what I used to eat at the famous Carolina Restaurant in Coney Island when I was a kid. I give this place 5 stars and highly recommend it!
