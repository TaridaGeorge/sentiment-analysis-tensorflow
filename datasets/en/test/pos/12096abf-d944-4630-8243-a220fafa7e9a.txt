My 2.5 year old son and i signed up for a mommy and me class in october.  It was really great, the group size was small enough to hear/see everything.  He really liked feeding the animals in the petting zoo area.  I'll admit, I had a good time catching chickens. They are really hands on at the farm and it's nice to see such transparency with regard to local food production.  No more costco milk for us anymore!  

and Toby the farm dog = best dog, EVER.
