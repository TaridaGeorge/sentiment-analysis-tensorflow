Absolutely the best ice cream around. I stopped into the shop on a lazy Sunday after hearing so many Twitter about this place. I tried both the Salted Butter Caramel & the Almond Toffee Crunch. Both were amazing. I have yet to try the Sorbet but I can attest to the fact that the ice cream is the best in the Valley.
