Like no other place in the neighborhood! This colorful little restaurant really stands out in Arcadia. The patio is just plain WOW!!  Hanging out at the bar, sitting next to the fireplace and enjoying a Coffee beer just can't be beat. The food has been great, most recently I enjoyed the Ragu, which was really great. The sauce was tasty and the meat was different than I was expecting, but way better than anything else I have tried elsewhere! I have also tried a few of their Pizzas and have always been very happy. From food and drinks to a great staff, this place has really outdone themselves. I am a fan and will be back.
