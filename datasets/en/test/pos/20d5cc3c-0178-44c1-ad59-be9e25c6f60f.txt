My wife and I stop often for Saturday lunch.  The sandwiches are awesome but if its your first time definitely get the fresh mozzarella, tomato and basil.  Everything is grown fresh and made by Bianco.  Its my fav get it every time.  We also stop in just to get their baguette's which are awesome for an egg breakfast and my personal fav cream cheese and fresh smoked salmon. mmmm.  Bianco's is a must try!
