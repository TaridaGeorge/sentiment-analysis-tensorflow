How have I not reviewed Pita Shack? I can't begin to tell you how perfect their gyro is. You just have to go eat it for yourself.

The meat is not greasy at all, but not too dry. The gyro has huge, spicy, fresh white onions on it, along with some nice big tomato slices. Their pita is absolutely divine.

Their side greek salad is generous and the dressing is phenomenal.

The price is also right. It's not ridiculously cheap, but it's more than reasonable, and I absolutely love coming in to order my food.

I love Pita Shack and eat here almost weekly. I cannot recommend them enough! Do yourself a favor and come have their gyro!
