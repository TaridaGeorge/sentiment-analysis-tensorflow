We've been coming here for years with all of our autos. Ray and the boys are as good as it gets. Always fast, friendly, and honest. My sister got quoted some ridiculous number at another shop so I took her car here and they fixed it for half the price and without all the fluff the other shop said needed done. 
I'll typically leave a few cold ones on the passenger side for them for when they're finished with their long days. They have my business for a lifetime, and i'll shun any family member that doesn't agree.
