Love to eat cheese enchiladas and have a margarita here. I used to live in Tucson, so when I visit family in Phoenix I try to get a visit here. One time my enchiladas were cold and I ate the beans and rice which were piping hot. I brought it to the wait staff attention and they brought me a whole new plate!!!
