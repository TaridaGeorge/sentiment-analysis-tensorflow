This place is amazing. We ordered the pulled pork nachos and 18 hot wings, along with a slury of drinks. Our two waitresses, yea I said two, catered to our every need, even posing for a picture to show our friend brad that we are way cooler than him. Overall great experience, the ambiance and the decor were impeccable.
