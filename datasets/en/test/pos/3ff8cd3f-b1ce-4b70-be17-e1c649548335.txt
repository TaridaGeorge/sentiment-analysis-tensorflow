I can't say enough good things about this place.  I literally have never had a plate here I didn't like, they also have a interesting and ever changing list of specials (I usually order off the specials menu).  This is definitely one of those places I could eat at every day.  All that and I don't even drink beer, my friends really like the beer here though.
