I love Penzey's Spices! I first discovered them in the late 1990s, when I moved to a small town in NC where the spices were black pepper and catsup. They saved us from culinary disaster becasue we could order their products in the mail!  WHen we moved to Tempe, I would purposely arrange a whole afternoon to drive up to their Scottsdale store to get everything I needed. Now, they are much closer to our home, and I love popping in for smaller spice requirements.  I love that they have hard to find spices, I love that they have great prices and you can buy large portions for small cost, yet the spices are still fresh and delicious. I recommend Penzeys to everyone!
