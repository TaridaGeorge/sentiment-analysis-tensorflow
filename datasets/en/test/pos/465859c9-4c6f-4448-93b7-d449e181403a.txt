Utterly fantastic!  Seared Ahi on a scorching hot Himalayan salt brick... Are you kidding me: makes my mouth water just thinking about it.  Duck Confit in a mesquite bean crepe... Say what?  This chef is as creative and focused on flavor as any in the state.   The wine list was well crafted, thoughtful and fairly priced.  I rarely give 5 stars but this place rocks!  Great  ambiance and outdoor seating that borders on perfect.
