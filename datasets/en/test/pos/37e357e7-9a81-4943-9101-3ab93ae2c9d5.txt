Worth the wait-- because waiting on a picnic table in gorgeous Arizona with a couple glasses of wine is nothing to complain about. Get there well before 5 to line up to put your name on the list (which for us, meant a table almost 4 hours later). Then just enjoy yourself and the nice random people around you.

The farmers market salad, when I was there, was shaved fennel, orange, grapefruit and herbs. Refreshing-- but next time, I'll save room for pizza alone. The Rosa-- parmesan, rosemary, red onion and local pistachios is fantastic. After 3 pieces, it's a bit rich. But then move onto your buddy's pie. The Margherita was light and fresh. Pizza Bianco is the ultimate because of the dough-- it is tender but chewy, crisp and charred.

Unlike others have reported-- we found the hostesses and the servers to be incredibly friendly and helpful.
