Vivid, grand, and oh- so- lovely.
You can literally spend half the day just perusing the property and sitting at every possible seating area. It's that scenic.

So much detail and so much open space...
I also love the elite, carefree vibe that the crowd gives off.

There are a lot of privileged families and businessfolk that stay here, so most people are left alone to do as they wish. 
...Roast marshmallows, splash a beachball around in the pool, drink wine by the fire, or be on a laptop while watching the sun set...

There's a strong sense of freedom and enjoyment that runs throughout the hotel.
You can visit for yourself and see what I mean, but please, be respectful and keep the Biltmore tasteful. This place is a dream.
