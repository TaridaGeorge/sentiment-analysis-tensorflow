Rates aren't always going to be as competitive as some other companies, but I like benig able to bundle everything under one company so I don't have to worry as much about billings with multiple companies.  Plus, the intangibles at this branch are great - Parisa is an excellent agent, they are always looking to help you get discounts wherever it's applicable, and even a free goodie bag when you join the family!  Plus with Allstate's safe driving plan, your premium can only go down... so what are you waiting for?
