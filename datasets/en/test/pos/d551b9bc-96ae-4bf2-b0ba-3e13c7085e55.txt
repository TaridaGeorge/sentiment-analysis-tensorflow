Lovely restaurant with exceptional food. I immensely enjoyed their recent $27 Prix Fix meal - BYOB of course. The ambiance and service make this restaurant a MUST for special occasions. 
I've done Mother's Day, Birthdays, Anniversaries and more and have been pleased with their extraordinary service and food.
Highly recommended in my book if you're looking for a romantic, quiet restaurant that serves only the freshest, best local food available.
LOVE IT!
