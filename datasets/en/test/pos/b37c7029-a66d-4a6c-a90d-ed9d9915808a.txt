Wow- Super great!  I had the Hot and Sour Chicken- Awesome.  My wife had the Szechuan Beef- Awesome.  My 6 year old has the Orange Chicken- she loved it!  My 3 year old had the Chicken Egg Foo Young- Really great!  Egg rolls and crab rangoons on the side were yummy.  Didn't even get to the Won Ton soup- looking forward to that tomorrow- Lots of leftovers- total bill was $46- a bargain!  Highly recommend.
