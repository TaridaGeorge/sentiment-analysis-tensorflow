Wooohooo!  Great service, great atmosphere, great change from last movie house that was there.  The place has been completely redecorated and updated to Scottsdale chic.  Popcorn was served in open basket, easy to eat w butter on the side (love it!).  Good drinks, and free refils on the soda.  This was a good purchase and a great value for the money.  I advise anyone to try it.  :)
