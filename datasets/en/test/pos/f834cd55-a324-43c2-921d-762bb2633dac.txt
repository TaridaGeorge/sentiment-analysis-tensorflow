Postino is an amazing place to chill and relax with good company, good food, and amazing wine. 

We had a nice Friday afternoon lunch outside with a glass a wine, and it was a perfect atmosphere. The Arcadia location makes you feel like you're in a small town rather than a city like Phoenix. 

The cheese board - amazing!
