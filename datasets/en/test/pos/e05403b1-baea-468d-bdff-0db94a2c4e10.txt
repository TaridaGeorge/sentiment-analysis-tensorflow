I have been attending the social circuit at Second Chance FitCenter
for a few months. It is a fun, intense, and highly satisfying full body work out packed into 30 minutes. It's the perfect amount of time! I've never laughed or worked harder during a work out. Heather is very knowledgable and encouraging. Plus it's affordable. I highly recommend Second Chance FitCenter.
