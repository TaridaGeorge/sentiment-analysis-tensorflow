Visiting Phoenix and decided on Fez for brunch.  I had their Eggs Benedict special.  Delicious and beautifully presented with a generous portion. It was uniquely their recipe with a Mediterranean flare.  The bread used for the Eggs Benedict was a pleasant surprise and added to the foodie pleasure. Now, add to the great food some great service.  My waitress was so considerate and checked in on me several times and kept asking if I wanted refill on my coffee, a big plus for a busy place.  I also enjoyed the light and airy environment despite the light industrial decor.  Definitely would recommend Fez to friends.
