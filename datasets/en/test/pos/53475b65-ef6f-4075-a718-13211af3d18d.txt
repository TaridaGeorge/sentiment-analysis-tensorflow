Thumbs up to Copper Star. My friendly neighborhood coffee shop is a haven in an urban jungle. It's great to know that there are local coffee joints in Phoenix and CS is one the best. The converted gas station is a great place to hang out, get some coffee, and use the free wi-fi (woo-hoo!). The staff is friendly, the decor hip and the cupcakes tasty! Do yourself a favor and visit Copper Star.
