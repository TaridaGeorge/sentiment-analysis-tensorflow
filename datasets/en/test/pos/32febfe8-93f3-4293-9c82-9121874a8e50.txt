I have had such a great experience with this place! Miss Chris the owner is AMAZING, she is what every child-related professional should be like. She genuinely likes teaching kids and has the patience of a saint. She is such an upbeat person, and surrounds herself with equally engaging employees. 
Eveyone I know who has gone here raves about it. I would recommend this location to anyone who wants to get thier child engaged it fun and learning with movement. The open Gym times are also great for those afternoon hours where there is nothing to do!
