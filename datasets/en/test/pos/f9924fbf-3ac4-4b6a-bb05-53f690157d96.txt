Had a chance to visit  Al's Beef and It's better then Ever. New to the Menu is The Jumbo Char Dog Chicago Style. Fanatastic, nothing like this in the Valley and reminds me of The Char Dog Back Home In Chicago. Only this may be Better. Stop by and try one, you won't be Disappointed. Only $5.95 with Fries a Great price for a Great Hot Dog.
