Love Love Love this place! Forget those sugary overpriced Jamba concoctions and get over to Inta Juice! The service is personal and exceptional. I love the freshness and thoroughness that is put into every drink. Tuesday is double stamp day and they now have tumblers with straws for purchase if you want to go green. The owners are so kind and definately know their stuff. I had a terrible cold and their recommendation helped me through the day. They have matcha smoothies as well as holiday flavors.Mmmm pumpkin! I only wish they were open earlier so I could pick up before work. Otherwise pass up the coffee and the line at Starbucks and stop by Inta Juice!
