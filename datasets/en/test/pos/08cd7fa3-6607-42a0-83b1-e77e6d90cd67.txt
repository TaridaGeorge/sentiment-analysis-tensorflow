Such a fun store!  They have all kinds of gifts like jewelry that I haven't seen other places, and a ton of books!  In my opinion an inordinate amount of floorspace is taken up by hippie/ spiritual/ new age stuff.  The science fiction, fantasy and science sections are somewhat lacking especially as far as used books go.  I do love to go there though for gifts or to buy books for myself!  It is always fun and they do usually have books I want.
