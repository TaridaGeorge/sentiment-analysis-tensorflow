My husband and I just moved to Phoenix from NYC, and everyone told us that the food in Phoenix will never be as good as the food in New York.  We COMPLETELY disagree - the food at Postino was far better than the food at our "go to" neighborhood wine bar in NY.  We could not believe how delicious the food was at Postino, and the service was incredible too! The artichoke dip put Houston's to shame, and the bruschetta, and vegetarian panini were all mouth-watering.  We greatly look forward to going back!  My husband woke up this morning and said, "Let's go to Postino again" and it hasn't even been 24 hours since we were there...
