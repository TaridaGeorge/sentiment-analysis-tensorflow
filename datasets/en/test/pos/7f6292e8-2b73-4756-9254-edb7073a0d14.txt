This place is a lot of fun! The girls wear costumes and everyone is so friendly. When Dodey is there, she greets every customer and there is a feeling of community in there. Prices are very reasonable and they make good Bloody Mary's! Can't describe it totally but you should go and get "initiated". It's too funny. I like to take new friends in and watch their reaction. I wouldn't call this a "dive bar". It's clean. Maybe a neighborhood bar? You decide!
