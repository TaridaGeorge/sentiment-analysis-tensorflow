Another great job by Chip Off the Old Block, formerly Al's Tree Service!   

Al's previously removed a mature tree for us.  Another time they thinned and shaped three huge pine trees - a professional and aesthetically pleasing job.

This time we had a 50 foot tree that needed removal.  Chip Off the Old Block's crew had the tree removed and the area cleaned up within a short time.  

We were glad to do business with this tree service again as they do excellent work.
