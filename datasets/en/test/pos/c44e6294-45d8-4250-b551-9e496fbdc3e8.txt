Consistently good food and service. They also put coupons in the news paper from time to time. My favorites here are the thai hi chicken salad, orange shrimp, and creme brulee. My husband loves the jambalaya and burgers. 
Tim is a fantastic server and I always ask for his section when he is working. He works very hard and provides excellent service. The managers always come around and ask if everything is ok. I also love the atmosphere here!
