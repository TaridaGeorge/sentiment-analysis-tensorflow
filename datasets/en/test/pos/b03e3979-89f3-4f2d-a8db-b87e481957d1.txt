I'm loving this place!!! this is why people move here. a little rain, and not much more. the sun shines when the snow falls elsewhere. i can ride my bike in January...un-heard of on the east. i like that i get to wear a sweater, wigs and sometimes gloves-because i'm an accessories W----re. i now have the train at my beck and call...its making the city an even more beautiful place to be. i should stop complimenting this place or our population will triple again. YIKES. thankfully the sprawl has losts its glow and we are moving on up!!! the downtown sky rises and new housing is doing wonders for the city. i remember when the sunset=desolate baren city of phoenix, not anymore!!! gotta love this place, tried to leave so many times, but always end up right back here. maybe i'll stay....maybe.
