I admit it, I fell for the hook.  The big old yellow lab who greets all passersby every Saturday at the Old Town Farmers Market, and will cram his equally big head in your bag to see what might be appealing.  He was particularly fond of another customer's collard greens yesterday.  So there's the 5th star.

As for the fish, it's pretty fantastic, too.  We've been purchasing both the king salmon ($22/lb) and the silver salmon ($15/lb) regularly for the last few months and have never been disappointed.  It is so good, in fact, that it was still edible even after it caught fire last week on the grill, though not my recommended serving suggestion.  The only problem is once you eat this fish, you will forever be tied to a higher price tag than what's available in most grocery stores.  Is it worth it?  Absolutely!
