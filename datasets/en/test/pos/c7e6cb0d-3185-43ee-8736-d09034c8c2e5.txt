Super hungry after a day sightseeing. Inadvertently skipped lunch, so dropped in here around 4pm to have an early dinner. I love good BBQ, and Big Earl's did not disappoint.

Started with a couple happy hour $5 appetizers, including chicken and waffles. Damn good! Fried chicken pieces, waffle,maple syrup and hot sauce. 

Main course was brisket and pulled pork, cole slaw, and an unbelievable mac and cheese with bacon sprinkles on top. Throw in a Pabst Blue Ribbon and I was loving life. Ended with a banana pudding that was off the hook..Nilla wafers and all.

Great place, friendly staff, nice atmosphere ... about the best BBQ I've had in the Phoenix area. Will be back
