First time at Mabel's. Good music, an upbeat crowd, and top-notch cocktails. Got a tour of the private room by Greg who knows what customer service is all about. Great to see our friend Charlie tending bar. He's an artist with liquor, and nothing beats a perfectly made cocktail to end the night. Highly recommended.
