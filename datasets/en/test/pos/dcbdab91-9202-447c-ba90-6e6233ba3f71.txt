The Biltmore Ear, Nose and Throat office is great.  I've never had to wait very long to see my AMAZING doctor, Dr. Arya.  Even though he doesn't have too many appointment times available (because he's that good and in demand), he's always been extremely thorough with my medical care, while having a friendly, caring manner.  The waiting room is comfortable and spacious.  I have taken my stroller in the office with no problems at all.  I recommend trying to get an appointment earlier in the day, as the office does tend to fill up, like all offices do.  If you're in need of a great ENT, I highly recommend Dr. Arya in this office.
