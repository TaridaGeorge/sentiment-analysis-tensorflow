Coming from California where the ZPizza concept was started this ZPizza franchise is among the best run and highest quality. Having run restaurants it's not easy but this husband and wife run a great shop. We've been here many times and is my son's favorite place. Try any of their pizzas, as they are all really good. If you happen to go on a Tuesday you buy a pizza and get the second for $2.
