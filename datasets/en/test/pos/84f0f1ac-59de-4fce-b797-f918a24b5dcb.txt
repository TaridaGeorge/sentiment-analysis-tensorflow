Some good friends recommended Kinfolk's to us and wow do we owe them big time!  The bbq sauce is darn near the best I've ever had, honestly.  And the portions are huge so with the leftovers you can eat for days.  We split the super sampler platter and all of the meat was just falling off the bone; the baby rack ribs were among the best I've ever had.  We will be going back!
