I got the biscuits and gravy with a side of bacon. 

A wise decision indeed.

The bacon is some of the most delicious I have had in a long long time - cut so thick you almost needed a knife. Being from the deep south I can certify that this was legitimate authentic gravy made with the requisite amount of care. Rich, smooth, and savory - I can't say enough good things about it. Eggs and hash browns were both VERY fresh and perfectly cooked. 

My girlfriend had an omelet that had some of the most amazing tender and flavorful ham. Evidently the ham is made fresh in house - it really does make a big difference... the taste is exceptional.

All in all a wonderful place for breakfast or brunch!
