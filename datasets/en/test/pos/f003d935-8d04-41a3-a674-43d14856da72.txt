This place is awesome!!  This was my first time here and the food is grub!!  Sandwiches here are huge and is less than $8.00.  best bang for your buck!.  Be warned that these are no average subway sandwiches.  These will feed you lunch and dinner.  I got the beef and italian sausage sandwich which was really heavy and delicious.   Good Stuff!.
