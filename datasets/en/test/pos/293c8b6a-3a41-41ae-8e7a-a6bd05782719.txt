I do all my long runs for my training on the canals.  It's packed dirt, which means it's easy on the joints.  Probably the best surface you can run on!  And it's away from cars (except for crossing a road every so often).  

It is not very scenic (as others have noted) and can be downright boring in sections, but it's easy to put together a route of 10-15 miles or more, if you strategically place your water/sports drink.
