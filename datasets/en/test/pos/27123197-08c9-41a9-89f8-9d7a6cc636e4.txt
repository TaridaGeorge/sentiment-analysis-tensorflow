Jessica is an excellent aesthetician! I went in today for a Brazilian wax, she was very friendly and made great conversation throughout which totally distracted me from pain and made it go by so quickly!

She did an excellent job and had great attention to detail and is educational. She is also affordable as she charges $55 for the wax. I will definitely be back and I'm so happy I finally found a great place to go for routine waxing. Thanks Jessica!
