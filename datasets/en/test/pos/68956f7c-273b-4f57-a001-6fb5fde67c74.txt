What an experience! Super cool vibe, laid back server and the food - to die for. I had a burger with a side salad and a margarita. Not only did I have a margarita, but I ordered them from a menu that featured several different kinds of margarita. It was happy hour still, so that made them taste even better. The place is trendy - lots of artists, gay folks and tree huggers but also groups of friends and business dinners happening. Really great!
