Before eating at Lobby's I had never eaten Chicago style food, and man it is delicious! 

I ordered an Italian Beef sammie with hot peppers and cheddar and it was basically a giant meat sandwich dipped in sauce and it was so good it's making my mouth water just thinking about it. If you go there, make sure you order that. Also, the fries are super crispy and great with the fry sauce.

You will love it.
