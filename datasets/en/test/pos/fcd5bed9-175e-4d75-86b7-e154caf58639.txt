I love this place!  My family and I always love getting Shabu-Shabu in California but we couldn't find it in AZ (except Sushi on Shea which was just so-so and terribly expensive).  I was thrilled to find this place on Yelp!  We drove from North Scottsdale to Chandler just for dinner tonight and we were not disappointed.  We all loved the beef (ribeye and shabu-shabu beef), chicken, and the shrimp.  I loved the spicy lemongrass broth and my family preferred the traditional/house broth.  

The waitress was super friendly and knowledgeable.  She helped explain the difference between Hot Pot (Chinese) and Shabu-Shabu (Japanese) - basically the broth is different and the vegetables and meats are ordered individually vs. a platter of meat/veggies like at Shabu.  Either way, this is delicious and if you love Asian food, somewhat healthy food, or Shabu-Shabu, you will love this place!
