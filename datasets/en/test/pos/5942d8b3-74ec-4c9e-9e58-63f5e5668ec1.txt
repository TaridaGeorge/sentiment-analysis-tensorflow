My dog Lucky and I had our first visit to Priority Pet Hospital today and I was extremely impressed with Dr Burns and her staff. The office was quiet, comfortable, spotlessly clean and Lucky was calm and at ease. I was surprised at how much time Dr Burns spent with us during the exam. She was pleasant and unhurried, taking time to make sure all my questions were answered and explanations understood. The exam was thorough and detailed. There was no pressure for unnecessary services and the bill was reasonable. Oh, the Keurig coffee maker in the reception area ain't a bad touch either. Lucky says "two thumbs way up".
