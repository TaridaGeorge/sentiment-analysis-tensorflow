Fuego Bistro is AMAZING!  I normally do not write reviews but I cannot get the food out of my mind.  My husband and I tried this after purchasing the Groupon on a weeknight around 5pm.  BTW this is a tiny little place, so a reservation is a must. Hands down one of our favorite places! Shortribs  cornbread casserole and Sangira!!
