My friends came in town from St. Louis, we tried taco tuesdays, and the meals were all outstanding.  The freshly made guacamole, and three different salsas were the best.  The fresh fire roasted chile salsa is the best ever.  The owner is also the chef and she is both nice and a great cook.  This is one of our favorite mexican places in town.
