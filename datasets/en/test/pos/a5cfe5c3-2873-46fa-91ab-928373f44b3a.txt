I recently popped in here on my way from to Tucson from Phoenix.  It's right off the I-10, in that Pavilion area on the east side of the freeway (there's a movie theater, tons of shopping, etc). This place is located right next to the Target.

I hoped to stop in and get a pedicure.  They were able to take me right away.  The decorations were very nicely done, and you could hardly notice a smell at all (thanks in part to high ceilings and fans running).

My tech was Ricky, and she was wonderful.  Friendly, thorough, and did a great job (despite incredibly long nails herself!).  

I would definitely stop by this place again!

PS:  I got a standard pedicure for $25.
