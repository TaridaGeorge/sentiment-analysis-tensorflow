Stopped in with my boy when we went to the pizza place next door.  Got to say, the cookies were OUTSTANDING and we really enjoyed the treat!  Prices were reasonable and they had a number of other treats that we did not get a chance to try yet including cupcakes.

Short story, per my son, try the chocolate explosion cookie.  (To me it seemed more like a brownie) He raved about it and really enjoyed it, so I know it was good.  I had a white chocolate chip cookie square and it was pretty darn good.  Good enough I want one again.  : )
