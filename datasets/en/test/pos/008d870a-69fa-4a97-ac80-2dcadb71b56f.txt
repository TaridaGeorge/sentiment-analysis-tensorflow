I love this place! I've never had dinner here, but it is a great place to go for happy hour and a night out. 

Primebar is spacious with three bars, a dinning area, and a stage for live performances. The decor was modern/contemporary. The crowd consists of mostly people in their mid 30s to 50s, with a sprinkle of people in their late 20s.  

I love the happy hour. The average price for happy hour is about $5/item and the portions are good. The drink specials are even better. Wines by the glass (really big glass) are half off and there are good deals on the cocktails as well. I highly recommend the margarita and the berry mojito.  As for food, go for the sliders and steak quesadilla. 

Live performances start at around 10pm from Thursdays through Saturdays. The bands and type of music change week to week.
