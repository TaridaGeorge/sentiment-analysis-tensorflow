Denise is rocking some gourmet ice cream sandwiches for First Friday.  I sampled the vegan triple Ginger cookie with coconut milk and lime ice cream.  Super yum!  My friend had the Hot Chocolate:  organic rice milk, cinnamon, hot peppers and dark chocolate bits.  There was another, more savory offering, which featured figs, nuts, and cheese.  It sounded intriguing, and I'm sorry my description doesn't do it justice.  We were able to enjoy primo people-watching from the porch or front yard as we enjoyed our frosty goodness.  Big tastiness!
