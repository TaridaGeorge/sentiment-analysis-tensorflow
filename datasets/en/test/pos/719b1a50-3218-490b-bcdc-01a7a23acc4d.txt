We arrived here on a Friday at high noon and the place was hoppin'! That's okay, service was quick and friendly and people were in and out leaving seats available for us to dine inside. It was a bit toasty outside. Our party enjoyed two of the specials of the day with buffalo chicken on dill bread and two orders of the turkey, avacado, etc. sammie on whole grain wheat. Both sandwiches were so fresh and delicious. Veggies on the sandwich were fresh and delicious, and the bread tastes homemade. Is it? I don't know. But... if you're hankering for a really good sandwich, Sacks is your spot. Only issue - tiny parking lot but Worth It!!!
