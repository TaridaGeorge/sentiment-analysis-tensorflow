It was my first time at Yogurtland and hopefully it won't be my last. At 30 cents an ounce, it's very inexpensive. I had the pistachio, taro, strawberry, and berry flavors, and each one was very good. The mochi topping was very soft and chewy and tasted very fresh. And the service was very friendly as well. If I was an ASU college student, I'd be eating at In N Out and Yogurtland everyday.
