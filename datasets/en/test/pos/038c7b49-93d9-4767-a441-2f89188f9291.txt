Had some family legal issues that required the assistance of a legal team that deals specifically with family law.  The attorneys we dealt with were knowledgeable, patient, took the time to explain all of the legal proceedings and helped to guide us through the process quickly.  Very professional, easy to talk to and stand up attorneys all around throughout their firm.  Would highly recommend this law firm to anyone needing legal advice of family law matters.
