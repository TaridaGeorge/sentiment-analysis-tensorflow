My flight was delayed again! I gotta get a better job....I actually miss sitting in traffic going to work instead of this flying for business. But we all gotta make a living. 
So I had a couple of hours to spare and I figured by the time I get to my destination and hotel everything would be closed and I would end up up putting the feed bag on at the snack machine. 
I found this place La Grange Orange. I think there another one in town. So I gave it a whirl. I had the BLT. Great!  

Pros
The food tasted great and was satisfying. 
Staff was courteous and pleasant. 
The bill was not expensive compared to most airport eateries. 
The atmosphere felt like any eatery out in town. It didn't feel like a airport eatery. 


Cons 
No cons.
