This particular location and the staff are the jam.  When I have a problem I like to go for speed, the comfortable low tech explanation and price.  I've had problems with my tires in the past and every time I've come in its been straight to the problem to get it fixed.  The staff who have assisted me and others around were always very courteous and inquiring to whether everyone has been assisted.  I love that type of service and friendliness.  I'm a solid two thumbs for their business and staff!
