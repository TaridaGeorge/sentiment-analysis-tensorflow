Yelp reviews come through again - love this site and love this sports bar too!  Lived here for over 30 years and visited tons of sports bars - this one ranks up as one of the best I've been to yet.  Don't let the outside fool you with it's pretty fountains in the middle of "yuppy" Scottsdale.  Nice decor inside but nothing over the top - t-shirt and shorts kind of place.  If you're into sports - more TV's than you know what to do with.  Hubby and I ordered more food than we needed just to check out different things and all were incredibly good!  Monte Crisco sandwich, fries, onion rings, chicken tenders - all some of the best we've tasted and the prices were surprisingly decent. I think we've found our new "hangout"...you've got to check this place out.
