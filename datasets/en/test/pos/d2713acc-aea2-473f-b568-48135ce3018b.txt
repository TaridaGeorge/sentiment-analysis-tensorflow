Excellent independent bookstore. I've been going there for years, and followed them from their original location on Mill Ave. The staff are helpful, friendly, knowledgeable, and well read. I've always been able to find the niche book I happen to be looking for, and usually, a couple of additional ones "land in my basket". They have both new & "pre-read" books, so you can often pick up a gently used copy for 1/3 the price of new.
