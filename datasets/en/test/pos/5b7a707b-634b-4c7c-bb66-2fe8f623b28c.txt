I don't know what all the gruff is about the prices! The portions are large enough for me! And the prices are dead on! It use to be an old Wendy's but is very modern and cool, the transformation is amazing! A great place to take a date! I've had several dishes and they have all been  excellent!  If you order spicy,  Be warned... It can be spicy!!!! The crab wontons are AMAZING! By far the best I've ever had! And the thai iced tea is so addicting!!!  I've been back and will keep coming back! Thanks SaBai!
