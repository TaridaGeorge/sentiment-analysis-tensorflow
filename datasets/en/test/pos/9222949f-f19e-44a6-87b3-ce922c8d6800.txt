I agree with Kristen E. when it comes to reviewing the ice cream.  It's ICE CREAM! And this place is ridiculously cute and nostalgic and a PERFECT date place.  I always sit at the counter, I feel like a kid or something.  As far as price, unless you're buying a pint at Bashas' you're spending this kind of money anywhere you go.  SOOOOOOOOO CUTE! love it.  

I cannot speak for their food and this is not the primary reason to enter the doors at a place called SUGAR bowl :)
