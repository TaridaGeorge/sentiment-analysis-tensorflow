Seemed very tame this year, but it's kinda nice to not walk into a festival/pride event without overextending my jaw tendons for the next six months.  The drinks were good tho.

It was very family-like, which is great.  It's the "real" gays and lesbians out there.  The ones that stay away from pride events usually.

It was nice.

The only sad thing was that I stopped at the Human Rights Campaign booth and they told me about the lack of funds to go against Prop 102.

That was the most depressing part of the whole thing.
