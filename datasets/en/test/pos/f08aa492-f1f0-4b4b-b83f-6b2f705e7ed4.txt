Get ready for a one-of-a-kind dining experience. Bak'd isn't an everyday kind of place, but perfect for a birthday, anniversary, or uber-impressive first date. Set in downtown Mesa (yes, Mesa), Bak'd has a beautiful, intimate dining room featuring leather couches, low lighting, and shag area rugs. 

The concept here is unique -- you call in advance (at least 24 hours) with your dining preferences, food allergies, and choices from the basic entree items, such as filet mignon, chicken, swordfish, veal or rack of lamb.

Then, based on the information you give them, Chef Timothy and Chef James create a custom 5 to 7 course gourmet meal. The food is delicious, artfully presented, and the chefs are a kick. They look more like bouncers than gourmet chefs, but give them a try. At $40 per person, this private dining experience is worth it.
