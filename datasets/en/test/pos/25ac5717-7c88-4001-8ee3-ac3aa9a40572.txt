Went in today. Love the service sooo much.  The owner was  behind the counter and  is soooo sweet.  I think he's from France?
The service was great as the cooks from behind the counter brought my kids' food out to the table.  It's always so clean and we love sitting outsisde in this beautiful weather. The sweet potato fries were delicious!
