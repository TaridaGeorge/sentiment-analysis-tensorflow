I take my morning walks here several days a week. Weekday mornings, the park is deserted but weekday evenings and weekend mornings, it's a different story. The fields are packed with football and soccer players. It's a great park for these types of activities. The maintenance crew does great work to keep the grass lush and green with so much traffic at least once per day every day of the week. 

The hills down to the soccer fields on the west side of the park are amazing for ice blocking too. You can get quite a bit of speed going down those slopes. 

Also, there are a few geo cache sites here so stop by for an geo cache adventure with the kiddos.
