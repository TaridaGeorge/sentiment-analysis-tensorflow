I am a regular here when in Arizona - a must stop.  For $30 you really can't go wrong.  Foot massage is intense - just enough pressure to get the tension out.  Very relaxing and nice atmosphere.

Only downside is the foot traffic outside the building which can get loud...but once you enter the doors and sit in the chair, all "sounds" usually disappear!
