Sam, Sean, and Carlos. Nice guys.

As I meander through the desert and find new and unique places specific to Phoenix it is far and few between when the time comes that you find a business with such personal and authentic service.

Do not let the lonely nondescript "Cigars" sign disparage you from entering. It really is the best example of "do not judge a book by its cover." Because if you decided to be so superficial of its visage you will miss out on a quality local business.

I do not smoke many cigar for health reasons, but when I do, I go here.

Enjoy.

NOte: Don't be that kid or guy walking in like you are the boss. Take a seat, chill, relax, and be a gentleman.
