I am totally happy with my experience with this awesome shop! They were so pleasant and did the job quick and perfectly! I brought in 5 pairs of shoes (3 pairs of boots and 2 pairs of stilettos). The cost was $15/pair to repair the heel and shine and polish each shoe. I've NEVER been to a shoe repair shop before, so I can't compare the prices (actually i'd be interested to know if anywhere is cheaper). This place is on my way to work, so it was convenient, although I live in Glendale, so I'd be curious about quality spots. 

Great service, quick turnaround. They have my business!
