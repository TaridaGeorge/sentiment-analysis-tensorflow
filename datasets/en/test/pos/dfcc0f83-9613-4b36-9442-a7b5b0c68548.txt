We stopped here after getting a hotel in Downtown Phoenix. The bartender was very friendly and guided us on choosing a scotch from their extensive menu. I had an Ardbeg, and at $8 it wasn't a horrible price. Beers were good - I had a couple pints of some local Arizona beer as well.

This is truly a hole in the wall type place and is very comfortable. Vintage looking but not run down at all. Great service and welcoming environment. Plus, they actually enforce the no smoking inside which is great!

I would rate at 4.5 stars given the slightly expensive price, but I'll round to 5 just because Arizona is awesome.
