If you are looking for a fantastic vibe, wine list and great pacific rim cuisine this is the place.  Even the Sushi is creative... Sushi-mi served on top of See Weed Salad is a nice touch... I would guess I sampled everything over the last year and this place does not disappoint.  The service is excellent and personal.  I can't rave enough...
