This is a great place, the food is excellent and the service is great.  Sometimes there is a wait to get in, but well worth it!  Watch out if you park in the front lot, if you park in the spots marked with the signs for the motorcycle shop next to the restaurant, you will get towed, so pay attention to the signs.
