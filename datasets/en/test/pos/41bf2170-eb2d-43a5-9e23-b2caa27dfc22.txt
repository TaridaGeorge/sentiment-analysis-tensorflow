Basis has become one of my new favorite places to eat. I've been there twice, and both times had a great experience. 

First, the bread they bring to the table comes with 2 different flavored butters (one is a pesto i believe, one is a spicy chili). I could just eat that alone.

Appetizers are also great - i've had the shrimp mango quesedillas as well as the poblano chili mac and cheese (with bacon!) and the wonton tacos.

Both times I have been to Basis I had fish - the shrimp Po Boy sandwich and last night the grilled fish sandwich. They come with your choice of sides, but i have always picked sweet potato fries, which are awesome.

Price wise it is on the more pricey side of the scale, but not too bad.

Recommend this place highly!
