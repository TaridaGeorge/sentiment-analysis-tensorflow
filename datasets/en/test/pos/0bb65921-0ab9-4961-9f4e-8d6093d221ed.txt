This little market has true spirit!  We've found ourselves near it 4 times in the past 3 weeks for various unrelated reasons just before returning home and decided to drop in for the 'bottle of milk / loaf of bread' errand.

They're open until 11PM some nights.  They have food trucks some nights.  The staff are all wonderful. The variety is admirable for such a small store. 

I wish I lived close enough to shop there regularly.  I have to manufacture excuses to be in that neighborhood more often just before heading home - like tonight for instance : )

See you there soon I hope!
