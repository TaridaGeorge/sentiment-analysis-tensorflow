Very good lunch specials, and the food here in general is delicious.  The lunch specials include drink and are very reasonably priced.  Service was great.  The vegetarian dishes are the best to get here, and the injera is always good.  I like Blue Nile better than Cafe Lalibela, I think the dishes here taste better.
