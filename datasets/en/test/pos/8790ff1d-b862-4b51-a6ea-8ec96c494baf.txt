This neighborhood sushi bar is one of the best in AZ! Fresh fish, good portions, and great service. A place where not every single roll is filled with imitation crab and drenched in sauce! Majority of their sushi menu is pretty traditional...but the sushi chefs takes special requests if you give them an idea of what you like. I especially like the Cucumber Fiesta, which is a salmon/yellowtail/tuna roll wrapped in cucumber instead rice.

The staff is also very attentive. They check on your need often and clear out empty plates promptly. The thing that stood out most was the number of customers who are regulars. As I wait for a table, I always see people greeted by name and received with hugs. There must be a reason why people constantly come back, right? Check this place out and judge for yourself!
