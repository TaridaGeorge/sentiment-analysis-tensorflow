We celebrated our dad's birthday this weekend, complete with a cake from Donna's Bakery Cafe (as per mom's suggestion).  Boy, we were not disappointed!  Ordered a few days beforehand... pick-up was as scheduled.  We had an 8" strawberry cheesecake mousse cake... soooo delicious!  The birthday guy was happy.  I was bummed that our weekend stay was over so quickly--I didn't get a chance to go for the leftovers.  Thank you Donna's Bakery Cafe!
