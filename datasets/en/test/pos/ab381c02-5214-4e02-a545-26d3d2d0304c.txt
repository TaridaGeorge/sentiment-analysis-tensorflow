Since my broheim was kind enough to enter this CF location, I guess I should write the review I would have yeaterday but was too lazy/busy to add it. 

I love this place. The place is clean, friendly, quick and good. 
They had a manager out in the front of the registers directing traffic, answering questions, making sure everyones food was quick etc. RIGHT ON

The only bad thing is the playland. I swear some kids will loose a finger in the door. 

Try the Buffalo Sauce on the chicken.... delish!
