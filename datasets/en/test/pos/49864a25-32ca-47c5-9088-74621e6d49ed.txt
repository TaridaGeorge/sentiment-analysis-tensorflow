One of the best in Phoenix. They did a really good job repairing and setting up a guitar for me, for a low price. I had the guitar back within a couple of hours.  The guys who work there and run the place are way nicer than what you expect from most music store employees. They never hassle you or tell you not to touch guitars etc. This place is highly recommended.
