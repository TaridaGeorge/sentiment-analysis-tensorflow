By far the best authentic chinese food I have had, keep in mind this is no PF changs, but it's the real deal. Polite on point service, and the food is fantastic. My drink was never empty, and my stomach was full and I was seriously pleased with my expierience, this place use to be located next to chipotle on 33rdish ave and peoria by metrocenter, the same family still works there minus the huge fish tank. I enjoy the general tso's chicken,  the mu shu wraps, and the orange chicken. This place is it!
