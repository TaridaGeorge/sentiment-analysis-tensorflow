Sutra may be the PERFECT yoga studio.  The owner and her husband couldn't be more inviting, and the instructors are not only friendly and warm,  they kick butt!! Sebastian's classes make my legs quiver and Danielle has me sweating my buns off, and loving it!! The prices are some of the best I've found for my crazy expensive yoga addiction! You MUST check out Sutra ASAP!!!
