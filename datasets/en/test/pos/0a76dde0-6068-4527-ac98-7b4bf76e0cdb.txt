Amazing Experience. Chris- the chef and owner was knowledgeable, funny, inviting, and accommodating. We were in for our law firm's Christmas Party. Chris made the whole experience wonderful. The soup, entree, salad, and dessert all tasted like they were made with love. I will be back.

This is a great place for date night or out of town guests with a hard to please taste. 

Make reservations, this place is small and fills up nightly.
