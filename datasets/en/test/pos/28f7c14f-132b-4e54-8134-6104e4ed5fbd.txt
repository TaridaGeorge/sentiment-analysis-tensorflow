Been going here for years.  First to their original location, which is still my favorite.  For some reason, the food just seems more yummy there.  Maybe it is all the memories of eating with good friends over the years.  The west valley location (in Peoria) is our main location now that we frequent.  My kids LOVE their food.  It is their first request when I ask where they want to go out to eat.  I love the prices and the food, so that is usually where we end up.

My fave used to be the Oaxaca special, but as I have gotten older, I can't do it, maybe it is the combo of spice and grease of the chorizo.  Their chimichangas are great, too.  My kids love their bean burritos and bean tostadas.  Yum!
