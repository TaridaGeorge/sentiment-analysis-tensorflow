This Vet is outstanding!  My dog was very sick and I called in on a Saturday and told them the issues; they were conservative on treatment and said to nurse him the next few days and if he wasn't better to bring him in.  They called me at 8am Monday morning to check on him and I said he was still having issues.  They scheduled me in right away to check him out!  The staff was very friendly and the Doctor is very knowledgable and you can tell he has been practicing for a while (over 20 years).  I was well informed about his tests and prescribed medications.  They made the trip to the vet for my grumbly, sick dog as smooth as possible!  Within a few days I could tell my dog was on the road to recovery :)  I highly recommend AC animal hospital for any animal.
