My husband and I went on a Monday night for the bottle of wine/bruschetta board for $20.  This is the BEST deal ever.  The wine was good and the brushetta is fabulous.  There are many to choose from and to only pick 4 was really hard, but they were all fabulous.  I would come back any Monday or Tuesday for this deal.

Get there early - we did wait about 30 mins when we arrived at 8.  Luckily we were able to get seats at the bar!
