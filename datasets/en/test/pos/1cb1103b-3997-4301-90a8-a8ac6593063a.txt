This is hands down my favorite ballpark I've ever been too. There is nothing like Chase Field at an Arizona Diamondback game. The roof is AMAZING! What a genious idea! A/C in a baseball stadium?! There's a game to play, but it's 110Â° outside... close the roof and turn on the A/C! Haha! It is really spectacular to watch as well when the roof is in motion. Every seat is great, the food prices are high, but now include a value menu, light rail station right out front to get you on your way and free of traffic. Almost no flaws at all. Even ticket prices are reasonable. Like I've said, nothing like a ballgame at Chase Field. Everyone should be here once before they die.
