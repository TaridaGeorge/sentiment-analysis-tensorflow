Any chance I have to make it to Liberty Market with friends I will! I love this place! They make a fantastic cup of coffee and amazing panini sandwiches. I particularly like the array of vegetarian options since I don't eat meat. As a garlic lover I can't get enough of their garlic hummus! Oh yea, and yes the bathrooms are indeed very cool. :)
