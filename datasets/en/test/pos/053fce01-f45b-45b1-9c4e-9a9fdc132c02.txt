Very good for a great price AND a variety of vegetarian selections! I was excited, my BF took me here for my b-day and we were not disappointed. I could only eat half of my pasty and so we skipped desert. Beers were reasonably priced too. 
We will be back but I am afraid my kids would be scared "everything is touching" eeekkk!
