I love the Pita Jungle so...SO much. I have had probably everything on the menu over the years and it is all divine. I love their curry chicken salad, their tabouleh, chicken del sol, black bean burgers, nachos, pitas, pita chips....the hummus is a gift from heaven. I have no idea what they put in it (magic? love? Unicorn tears? Crack? It is all possible) but it is one of my favorite things on this planet. I could eat a drum of it. This location is loud, but it always has great, prompt service. The hipsters are always smiling and attentive and make this place just a little funky. Do not ever stop doing what you do Pita Jungle!
