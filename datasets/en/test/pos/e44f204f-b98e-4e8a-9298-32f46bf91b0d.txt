went down to Scottsdale for Spring Training (Go Giants!) and we decided we wanted to have a nice, sit down meal instead of bar food or ballpark food every day/night.  Eddie's House fit the bill perfectly.
Food - excellent.  Tuna Tartar "nachos" were great.  I had the scallops and they were perfectly cooked.  Also had a size of Fiddler's Ferns which I've only tried once before.  they were excellent.  Berry Cobbler for dessert also excellent.  
Service - excellent.  very nice waiter who was very attentive.
Location - close to downtown but not on the immediate Scottsdale Road path.  
Atmosphere - also excellent
Prices - being from San Francisco, the prices were unbelievably reasonable.
