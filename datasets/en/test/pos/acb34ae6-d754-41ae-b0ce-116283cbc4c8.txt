Art One mostly showcases the art of students, mostly high school and college students.  It also has the most interesting art on Marshall Way.  It's definitely the place on the block that is willing to take the most risks.  The art is also affordable enough that regular people are able to buy it.  I highly recommend stopping in here, you're sure to see something that makes your day.  There's also a hairless kitty that lives there, if that's your thing.
