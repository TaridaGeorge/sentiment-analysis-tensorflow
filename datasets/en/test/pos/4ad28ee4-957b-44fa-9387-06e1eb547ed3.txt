I really love this place!  They have really good sushi and the best Onion Soy salad dressing ever! The service could be better, I usually sit on the patio and there is one girl who is a waitress there who pretty much doesn't smile and is short when she comes to the table to wait on you but other then that I can't think of anything else that I would be able find as a con to this restaurant...I wont knock them a star due to this one girl...I love the place and they deserve the 5 star rating!
