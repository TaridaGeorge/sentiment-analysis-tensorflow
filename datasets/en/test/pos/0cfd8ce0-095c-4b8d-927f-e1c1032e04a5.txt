Who would have thought that one of the best salads I've had in a long time would be in the Phoenix airport?  

The kale and quinoa salad is a must-order for anybody craving vegetables and looking for something to take on a long flight toward the east coast.  The kale and other sturdy vegetables stand up well to sitting in a plastic clamshell without getting soggy.  The quinoa adds an incredibly pleasant nuttiness and crunch.  The dressing is tangy and rounds out the dish.  Over a week later, I am still thinking about how to replicate this salad, and I can't think of the last time I've felt that way about airport food.

(I didn't care for the grapes and thought the salad would have been better without them-- but I'm not docking this review to four stars, because IT WAS AN AIRPORT.)
