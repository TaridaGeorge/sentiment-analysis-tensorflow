Good coffee good atmosphere and a good place to meet up. 
I like finding these quaint hidden independently owned coffee houses they are great! 

The staff is great since whenever I come in I am only half mast and they must decipher what it is I am trying to request. 

Give them a shot (no pun intended) they are worth it!
