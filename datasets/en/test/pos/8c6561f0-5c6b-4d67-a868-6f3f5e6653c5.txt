Ye Olde Pipe & Tobacco is one of my favorite cigar shops.  They have a pretty good sized walk in humidor and a great selection on quality cigars.  I'm no expert but the guys who work their know quite a bit and will help you pick out something new and give recommendations.  They also have a lounge where you can kick back and smoke a cigar if you have time to kill while you watch tv.  The store sells everything from personal humidor boxes to pipes and torches.  I'm looking forward to stopping in for my fishing trip this weekend.
