One of the best museums I have been to. The audio tour adds to the excellence of the worldwide instrument exhibits. There is also a neat contemporary band and singer section downstairs that gives great insight into the influences of singers in the music industry. They also had a Taylor Swift exhibit which was small but still fun to see. The cafe has excellent food, especially the pizzas.
