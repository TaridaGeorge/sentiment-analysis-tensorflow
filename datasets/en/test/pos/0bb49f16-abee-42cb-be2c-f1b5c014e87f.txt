Oh Cibo, how I love thee...

1) Pizza...fresh, light, flavorful perfection. 
2) Crepe...is there a word that is BETTER than perfection? Heavenly? Orgasmic? Scrumpdiliolusciousness?? Well, call it whatever you want, because it was all that and more. 

There isn't alot of room there, it's a renovated historic house, but they make every bit of space work for them. Sorry for the short review, but I'll be sure to update this next time I go!
