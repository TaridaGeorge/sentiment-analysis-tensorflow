I have been going here on and off for the past 3 years.  It is just a 2 minute bike ride for me from home, or 6 minutes when walking Jack my dog. Everyone here is friendly and attentive.  It has a cozy family atmosphere and they actually remember your name after your first 2 or 3 times coming in.  I usually just have a drip coffee but have to admit that it is always tasty, never too strong or too weak.  The pastry case always looks awesome!.  They have a variety of coffee drinks from hot, cold, to frozen.  They also have sub sandwiches and artisan sandwiches as well.  I highly recommend the curried chicken salad sandwich, the recipe is actually Bill's mothers.  You gotta check this place out!!!!  I give all of my 10 thumbs up...
