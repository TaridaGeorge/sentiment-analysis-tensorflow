OK, I've lived here 5 years and never heard of the Scottsdale Green Belt. One day while searching yelp for biking trails I came across the this place. I searched to find where to start, where to stop. 

We've tried the first part of the "greenbelt" starting at 92nd St. and Shea and rode our bikes to Chaparral Park and back. What a nice way to spend a Sunday morning. 

The second time we started at Chaparral Park and took it to Tempe Town Lake where we stopped, watched the boats, enjoyed a light snack and headed back. We had so much fun. 

I must tell you I am so disappointed it took me this long to find this place. I love it and can't wait to get out again.
