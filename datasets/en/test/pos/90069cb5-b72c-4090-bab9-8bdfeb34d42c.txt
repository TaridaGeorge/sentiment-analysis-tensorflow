I'm going to keep this short and sweet - The Breadfruit is absolutely delicious. One of the best meals I've ever had, anywhere in AZ, hands down. We had the Appleton Rum Sea Scallops as our appetizer, which were the best scallops I've ever tasted. Very spicy and very flavorful. I had the jerked chicken as my entree, and my boyfriend had the jerked pork. Both were excellent.

Loved the space, loved the vibe, service was great, loved the drinks, LOVED the food. I can't wait to go back.
