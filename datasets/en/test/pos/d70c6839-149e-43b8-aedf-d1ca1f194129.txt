When it comes to food and service, Houstons is as consistent as it gets!! This Hillstone Group restaurant should teach Fox Restaurant Concepts a thing or two about this notion. 

Anywho.... I just wanted to let all Houstons soup fans know that they just changed the Sunday soup from Mexico City style to Mushroom Artichoke. =-0 I'm personally very disappointed with the removal of this favorite. However, I love mushrooms and artichokes. This soup is two thumbs up! 

Bon Appetite!
