My family has been going to Mr. Hong for over 20 years, when he used to work out of a small office in the Chinese resteraunt that used to sit on the corner of Scottsdale and Camelback! 
Mr.Hong is the real deal -he is a taylor and a skilled craftsman. Over the years Mr. Hong has altered everything from my wedding dress to my husbands class eights and everything comes out perfect. IN addition to being a fantastic taylor, he is a really nice man, with a facinating life story having originally been born in Cambodia during the Khmer Rouge. Anyway, Mr.Hong is amazing.
