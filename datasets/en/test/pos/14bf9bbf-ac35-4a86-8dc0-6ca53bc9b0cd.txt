No Lie I Have Been To Every Pizza Hut In Phoenix And Surrounding Cities And All In San Diego I've Never Had An Issue With The Food! I Love Pizza Grew Up Eating It And Will Never Stop Eating It. I Love The They Have The Multi-Grain Crust; The Big Bites, Small Price Menu; And OMG The Edge I Remember Back In The Day When They Had It By My Favorite Pizza! Everyone Need To Try The Edge If You Haven't Yet I Promise It Will Become Your Favorite Pizza; Eat-it So It Won't Go Away Again!  And We All Know Pizza Is Good For Every Meal. And I Agree With Perry The Pastas Are Awesome I've Had All Of Them!
