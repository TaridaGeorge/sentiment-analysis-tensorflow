My husband and I came here for our wedding anniversary on a referal from a friend.  And I have to say, it was a great choice!  I got the Lamb Chops and my husband got the Elk Tenderloin...I have never eaten such amazingly prepared food in my life!  And for the price...I may ask to go back for my birthday!
