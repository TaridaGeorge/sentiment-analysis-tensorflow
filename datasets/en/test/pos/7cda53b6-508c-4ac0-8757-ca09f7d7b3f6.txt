A real dive.  CHEAP drinks!  4 cocktails and a beer came out to $14.50!  The bartender was at least 75 years old, and she was a sweet as a southern belle, but I bet she doesn't take crap from anyone.  She said she had worked there for 30 years, and I believe her!

Hell of a great place.  Friendly crowd of regulars.
