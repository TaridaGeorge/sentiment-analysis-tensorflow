I have 3 girls: ages 8, 7 and 5.  Dana has been cutting their hair since my oldest got her 1st haircut at 1 year old.  She gives great cuts and is so sweet with the kids.  They love her.  Of course she has games, movies and treats.  We love Dana.  She can handle any kid and make them comfortable getting their hair cut.  Dana knows how to help the kids get comfortable.  She is not just a hairdresser, but also a MOM.  And they always leave with a great cut!!!  I highly recommend.
