LOVE LOVE LOVE! Good food, Great Service, even better specialty cocktails. I've read several other reviews of Windsor and am SO sick of hearing people complain that "it's not Postino"...um hello, it's not supposed to be. Fun Fact, restaurateur's do occasionally open restaurants with different concepts, this isn't a cheesecake factory people!! The #29 cocktail is totally unexpected and I may have a small addiction going on, and I drool over the Fattoush Salad (ps, I add chicken and Skrimps :), yes Skrimps), and the vibe there is just so fun and laid back. All the servers couldn't be nicer, and my server last time, Lisa, was the best...on top of things, friendly, and FAST.  My new fav hang out, and no, no intervention necessary please!
