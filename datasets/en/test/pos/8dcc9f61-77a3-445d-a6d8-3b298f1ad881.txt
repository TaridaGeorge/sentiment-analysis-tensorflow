KW Plumbing was the first honest plumber I dealt with out of 10.  They told us when they would be able to come out.  When we told them what the problem was they told us that it was needing to be fixed right away.  They then instructed us on what to look for to find somebody to fix our leak.  Due to the great customer service they will get our first call the next time we need a plumber.  Honesty is refreshing!
