I`m coming back here for more!! Stopped in for lunch while I was out and about. Everything was fabulous!!  So much to choose from, I had such a hard time deciding on what to order- ended up getting the roasted garlic and goat cheese pizza, which was amazing! 
Christopher doesn`t disappoint and I have been to his other restaurants, and this one is on my top list to return for more!
 I watched some of the other dishes people ordered, wild mushroom soup, truffle fries, vanilla dusted scallops, delicious duck and a knockout chocolate tower that has my name on it next time I come back! Open for lunch, happy hour, and late night goodies, perfect!
