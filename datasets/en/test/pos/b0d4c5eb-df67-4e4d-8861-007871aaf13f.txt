How many places can you go get spare keys made AND talk about bike parts with someone?  I bought spare keys AND got some brake & shifter cables for a bike I got at the thrift store.  

They've got some used bikes, some bike parts, keys, and it looks like the previous reviewer said- some blower & mower parts?  

And good advice!
