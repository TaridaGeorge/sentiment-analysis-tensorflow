Excellent.  Ate lunch there today and had a Monte Cristo sandwich, which was apparently a special.  I am finicky about Monte Cristo sandwiches, but this one was superb and was served with a side of blueberry jam or syrup that was a wonderful accompaniment.  A bowl of fresh cut fruit was also on the plate and it was a nice side, as opposed to french fries.

I can't wait to go back soon for more.  Parking may at first look challenging, but I found plenty of street parking on Pierson (sp?), the street  along the north side of the small center in which Maizie's is located.  Adam was our server and he was excellent.
