Every day on my way to work I drive past Dobson and Ray. Why didn't I stop by Golden Donuts sooner??? These donuts are AMAZING-fluffly, fresh and way better than any donut I ever ate at Starbucks. Before tasting a decadant Apple Fritter here I thought Bosa Donuts had no match but now I'm not so sure. 

When we stopped in for the first time I wanted a cup of coffee but the coffee wasn't ready yet. We didn't mind but the thoughtful employee gave us an extra donut "for the wait". You can't beat awesome donuts AND friendly service.

I will be stopping by here on my way to work instead of Starbucks from now on. We got lucky Chandler!
