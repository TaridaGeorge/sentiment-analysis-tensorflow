Who doesn't love Crackers!?!?! This place is great. Service is top notch, even when it's busy they are very organized. Only open for breakfast and lunch but they do both INCREDIBLY well. They have a very different menu than most places and they do it very well. I would try this place for breakfast first but if you can't make it, lunch is just fine and I believe you can get everything on the menu all day anyway.
