We can't say enough about these guys.   It's just so nice to find a nice, reliable and honest company like Flores A/C.   We had to have them out twice this year for two different and unrelated problems.  Both times they were on time, professional, and took the time to explain what needed to be done and why.  Their work is great and they seem to go that little extra step to make sure their work is the best it can be.  Above all, Miguel, Michael and his assistant were genuinely nice guys who seemed to truly have our best interest in mind.  The added bonus is that their prices are very fair.  These guys are a find.
