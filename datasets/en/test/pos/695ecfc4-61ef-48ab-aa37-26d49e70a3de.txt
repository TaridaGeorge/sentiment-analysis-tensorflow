When I lived a block from Pane Bianco, I used to make it a point to spend (and eat) as little as possible throughout the week just to be able to grab one of their sandwiches (preferably the mozzarella, tomato and basil sandwich) on the weekend.

A little pricey, but worth every penny; the food is crafted so well that you start to dream about it and wonder when you can run back for more. If you're a coffee or tea fan, it's perfectly paired with Lux right next door; ample seating to eat your sandwich in peace and enjoy the people watching.
