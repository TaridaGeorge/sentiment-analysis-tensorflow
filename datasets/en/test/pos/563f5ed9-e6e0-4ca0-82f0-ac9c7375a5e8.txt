Where els can you go for 2 slices of pizza and a drink for under 5 bucks??  This place was awesome 20 years ago when I came here for lunch in high school and  is still awesome when I bring my kids here now.  I just recently had the buffalo chicken pizza and it was better than i was expecting.  This is also the go to place if we are watching football or just chillen with friends.
