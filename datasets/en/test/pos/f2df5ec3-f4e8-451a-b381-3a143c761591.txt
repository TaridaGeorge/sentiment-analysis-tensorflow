Delicious! Great sandwiches and you can buy their "day old bread" to make you own sandwich at home. 

The really do have "freaky fast service" both in-store and delivery. The staff is always very friendly too and they have really reasonable prices on their sandwiches. 

Add hot peppers to any sub for an extra kick!
