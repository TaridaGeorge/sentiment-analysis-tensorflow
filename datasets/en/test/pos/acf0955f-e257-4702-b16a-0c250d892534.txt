Is anyone a big Bruschetta fan like me?? They have some of the most creative and tasty varieties...total palate pleaser! You have to order a bunch to share with friends. And I love the midday $5 wine specials! Oh, why not encourage a little day-drinking??!!! Hahaha! 

Fantastically social and quaint atmosphere. You guys know I love the indoor/outdoor thing! :-) Its an old post office w/ what I believe are original wood floors. I love how they creak when you walk around. I especially like going at night when the candlelight is flickering throughout & groups of friends gather on sofas.

Enjoy!
