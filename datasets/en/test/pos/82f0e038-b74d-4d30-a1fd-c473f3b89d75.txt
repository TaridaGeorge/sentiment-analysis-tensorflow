I've already reviewed REI before, but this is my review of the one in Tempe, Arizona. 
Again, I love this place. I recently bought a ski mask/balaclava for snowboarding in Denver's REI. I used it once but didn't like how it fit my face, so without any tags or receipt I go into REI to return it. Bam, no problem, here's your $ back on your credit card. They seriously have one of the best customer services around. 

I also like the website as well b/c they have more items that some stores do not carry. Give REI a try and become a member!
