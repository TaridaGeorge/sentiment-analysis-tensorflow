Nena was FANTASTIC!! The minute that I walked into "Soma Intimates" at the Biltmore Fashion Park, I received first class service until I walked out.  

They do have a small selection of 42 D; however, I was satisfied with my purchases. Minimizers were comfortable, appealing, and the matching "no ride" panty was absolutely a CHARM!!  Personalized attention to exact measurements are key to comfortable intimate clothing, and I received all the services with a smile and special attention to comfort, and size.  Not sure what type of service one unhappy reviewer received at "Soma" in the Biltmore; however, I completely disagree with her review. EVERYONE was attentive and NO ONE was on a cell phone.

Thank you for the OUTSTANDING and ATTENTIVE service I received Nena! You're truly an asset to "Soma Intimates" and a true gem to those in need of first class customer service!! Thank you!
