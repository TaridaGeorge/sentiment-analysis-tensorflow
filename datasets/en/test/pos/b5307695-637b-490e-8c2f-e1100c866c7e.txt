I love this place!!

Granted, I've only tried their spinach&artichoke dip and their fish&chips, but golly both of those are DELICIOUS. They've got a great drinks selection, and the dining setting is really unique and welcoming. They've got loads of TVs, so it's got a cool sports-bar feel, but more restaurant-y if that makes any sense.

I need to check out their happy hour as it includes a GIANT chunk of their menu at a great rate! 

Also they've got an agreement with the movie theater in the center. On Mondays, you can get a brick-oven pizza of your choice (normally 11.95-12.95), two non-alcoholic beverages, and two Harkins Theatres tickets for ONLY $19.95! If you're going to a Monday movie, you can't beat it.
