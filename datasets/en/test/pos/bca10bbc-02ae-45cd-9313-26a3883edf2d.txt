Love, love, love this place.  Everything I've had on the menu is amazing.  Pure genius.  I especially love their salads, the Big Beefstro and the Pablo Picasso.  Too bad they got rid of my favorite salad which was the spinach salad.  The pizza and pastas are also excellent.  Never had a bad food experience or heard any complaints from others.

The service is great, although we usually just order take-out for home or work.  It can get very busy (expect a wait, especially on weekends) and parking can be limited as the parking lot is shared with multiple asian food restaurants.
