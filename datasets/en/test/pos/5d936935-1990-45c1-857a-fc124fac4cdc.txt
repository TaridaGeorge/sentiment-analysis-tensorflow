Great place for a hike! Like other Yelpers have mentioned, this location is not crowded at all. We actually parked at the park at the end of 18th Street on the south side of the mountain. The trail from there joins the Lookout Mountain trail that loops the mountain. The other parking lot South of Greenway on the north side of the mountain was also pretty empty so you wouldn't have a problem finding parking there either. We chose to do the hike to the top of the mountain which was great but gets really steep at some areas so be prepared. The good thing is it's a short distance to the top. I really enjoyed hiking here because it wasn't too easy and wasn't too difficult. I plan on including this location in my regular hiking schedule.
