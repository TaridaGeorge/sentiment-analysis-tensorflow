Nom nom nom!  The honey blue cheese is insane.  I usually get my sweet republic fix at whole foods, but that pales in comparison to the ice cream served straight from the source.  The texture of their ice cream is akin to gelato--very smooth mouth feel.  In addition to the honey blue cheese, the jalapeno avocado is great too!  Basil lime is a great fall back, and the honey flavor is great as well.  My boyfriend hated the rose flavor--said it tasted like soap.  Despite his resistance, I enjoyed it, and could not recommend this place enough!
