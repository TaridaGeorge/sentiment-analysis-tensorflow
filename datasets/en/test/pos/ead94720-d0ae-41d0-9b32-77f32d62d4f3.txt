Stopped in for our first visit on our anniversary.  The service, atmosphere, food, and drinks were excellent.  We enjoyed some delicious bruschetta, pizza, pasta, and a decadent cookie desert.  The server was very friendly, let us sample some of the items, and gave us some advice on where to go and what to do in Tempe.  Looking forward to our next trip.
