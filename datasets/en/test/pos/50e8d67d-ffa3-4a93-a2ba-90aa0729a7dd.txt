My favorite place on a Monday or Tuesday night!  $20 for a huge plate of bruschettas and a bottle of wine....need I say more?  The atmosphere is just right.  Low key and classy feel.  I almost want to say Starbucks for wine, but I think it's pushing it.  I don't mind attending this fine dine and wine place any other night, but if you're free on Monday or Tuesday...why not?
