Simply fantastic !!

We stopped in and ordered some food to go and the menu was somewhat overwhelming at first with all the choices.  Sat night is oxtail special night so my dear lova went crazy for that and got two orders and i tried the pulled pork. We ordered all three of the rice's as well since we couldn't make up our minds and we loveeee rice and beans :)

Everything was great..from the meat quality, to the different rice's to the different plantains.

We will Definitely be back
