Ok, sorry...it took me several days to collect myself. 

1. Best service I've ever received in a hotel. EVER. 

2. A fish named "Tierra" was in our room. Cool. They said I requested her...but I know for a fact I did not, as I did not realize that fish requests were accepted. Now I know. 

3. Arizona has an unfair advantage. The weather is stellar. 

4. Two pools, a hot tub and a lagoon. A sand beach pool. Comfy couches, chairs, chaise lounges, tables, etc. None of this cheap plastic stuff up in here. Pure relax mode. 

5. Patio room. Free Wifi. Great restaurant. Beautiful. 

6. Comfy bed. Clean room. VERY clean. Tastefully decorated. 

Can I please go back now? Tierra needs me.
