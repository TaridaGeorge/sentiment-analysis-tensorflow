I was in Scottsdale for 2 weeks a couple months ago for training and came here for happy hour about 5 times over those 2 weeks. The sushi here is super fresh and there is plenty to choose from on the happy hour menu. The girls that work here are beautiful and the service was great. I love the atmosphere here as well, you walk in looking down at an aquarium!!! I wish there was a place like this close to home.
