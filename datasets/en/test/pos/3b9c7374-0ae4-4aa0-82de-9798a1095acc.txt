I'm a regular, so its pretty much guaranteed i'm giving it a 5 star. But its more than that.
A) Its pretty much the same price as Starbucks, but they don't have confusing sizes, I want a large not a grande viente whatever the "bucks" has. Small, Medium, Large; easy peasy. And if you've never been there before they don't look at you like you're crazy
B) Friendliness, I've never had a single employee be rude to me, and they're all down to chat if they're not to busy. And they act this way to everyone, regulars or people who have never been there.
C) Free coffee: Buy 10 drinks get the 11th free, and if you go Tuesdays its 2 punch Tuesday, so if you went 5 Tuesdays in a row, free coffee. Does Starbucks do this? No.

I've had one bad drink, ever. Beat that Starbucks
