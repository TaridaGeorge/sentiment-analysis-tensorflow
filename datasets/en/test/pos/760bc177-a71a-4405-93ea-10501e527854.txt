Best vegan restaurant in Phoenix/Tempe. It's a jewel! They need to open more locations!

The only drawback is the name... try Googling "Green" when you're trying to find this place. I even had a hard time finding it on Yelp to write a review! I'm just saying...

Not the healthiest spot, despite the animal-free fare... But a good place to bring a non-vegan if they're trepidatious  about trying veggie food.

Try the vegan version of the DQ Blizzard called the "Soynami", the Buffalo Wings are INSANEly delicious, and don't be afraid to sample a special. They always have something creative and pallate-pleasing on the chalkboard.
