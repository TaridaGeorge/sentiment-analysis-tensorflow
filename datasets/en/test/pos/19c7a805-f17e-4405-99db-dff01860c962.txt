This was my first visit to Lee Lee's Asian Supermarket.  I was down from Sedona and thought it would be worth stocking up on some Asian products.  This is really a world market, as almost every continent is represented.  And there is an entire aisle for just soy sauce and chili sauce.  Just incredible!  Nice selection and prices compared to what is available in a standard market.
