Went there this evening for supper.  What a treat!  What a delight!  Service was good.  Was reluctant to go based on what others said about the waitress but  ours, Rachael, was a delight.  The other waitress seemed quite nice albeit a bit reserved.  I had a Bianco's Pizza which was worth 5 stars by itself.  My wife had a pasta dish with vodka as a sauce base.  It was also excellent.  
But I'm getting ahead of myself. First the decor is very, very nice.  There was live piano music with a blond singer.  Quite nice.
and then.....warm bread with a spread of something that contained pimento's I think.  Very good.
Then the dinner.  Wow!
You can bet we'll be back again.
