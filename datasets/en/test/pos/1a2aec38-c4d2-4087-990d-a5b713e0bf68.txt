Lucky and I love this place.  Dr. Bracken and company are like family to us.  I've been taking my little teacup maltese to see Dr. Bracken for the past 5 years.  He is very caring and concerned about both me and my doggie's welfare.  

Lucky often boards here when I take out-of-town trips.  The staff take really good care of her, especially since she has some special health needs.  I never worry when I leave her.  And they are very patient and courteous when I call to check in on her.

I highly recommend this clinic if you are looking for a great veterinarian who cares a lot about his patients.

We love Dr. Bracken and the Arcadia Animal Clinic family!
