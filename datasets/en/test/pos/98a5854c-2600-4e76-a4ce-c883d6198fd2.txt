This place is a little tricky to find but definitely worth the effort. Their sandwiches are made with Boar's Head meat and generous fixings. The side of fruit actually includes berries. The drinks are high quality; I prefer the fresh brewed ice tea. The decor is boldly rustic with a strange mix of heavy materials harvested from the wreckage of a late 1800's southwestern mining town, and well balanced with the feel of a high class bodega from that same time period. A garage-sized door behind the bar opens up into the landscape of our beautiful Sonoran desert.

They also offer live music performances at night.
