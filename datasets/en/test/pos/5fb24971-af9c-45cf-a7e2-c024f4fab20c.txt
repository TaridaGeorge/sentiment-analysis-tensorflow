Hands down the best cake I have ever had!!  We went for our tasting and kept trying to find a reason we needed to go back for another! :) The staff at Piece of Cake is extremely friendly and helpful.  Our wedding cake was beautiful, as were the coordinating cupcakes we had with it, and they were all just as delicious as what we had during our tasting.  We were beyond thrilled with our choice of Piece of Cake for our special day and can't recommend them enough!
