My credit card statement does not lie: I love Changing Hands.

Everything about this place is great. The staff is relaxed and helpful. Since it's highly trafficked, I can usually find whatever title I need. The events are fun, too. Definitely check out their calendar as big names come through regularly. I got to meet the creator of The Oatmeal here last March!
