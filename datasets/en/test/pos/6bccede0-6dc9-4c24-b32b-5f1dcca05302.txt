Sadly enough this restaurant closed.  I really enjoyed both their lunch and dinner service and they had a Reuben sandwich to die for.  I began to get concerned about them when I realized that nearly every time I was there the restaurant was empty.  I figured they just had a raging weekend business, but alas it was not to be.  Here's to Yorman and his wife, they were always gracious hosts, and the food was first class.  I wish them well and hope they come back soon!
