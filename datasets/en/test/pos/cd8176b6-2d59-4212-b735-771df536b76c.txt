Five stars just for the helpfulness of the staff.  I am not a pro shopper so when I need help it is nice to get it.  Kohl's does not have the feel of Sears or JC Penney's where you get the feeling like there are more security guards than customer service folks.  

Bottom line, Kohl's actually helps.  Customer service on the one time I had to return some slacks was easy and helpful.  The amount of effort I have to put into doing business with Kohl's is low.  I like it!!!

Fair amount of easy parking at this location.  Good selection.  And right across the street is a Paradise Bakery and Cafe for some soup and sandwich when done shopping!
