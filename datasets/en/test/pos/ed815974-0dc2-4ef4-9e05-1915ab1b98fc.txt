This little store is located within the Arizona Center here downtown.  I have shopped here before, as it is in the area that I work at.  It is locally owned by a couple, and they actually have two locations...this one and another location in Gainey Ranch in Scottsdale.

This place carries mostly touristy stuff.  I think thier prices are a little high, but the store is well kept, the people that work here are wonderfully nice and kind, and you can get a garden variety of items to choose from.
