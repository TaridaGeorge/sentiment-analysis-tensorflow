Everything you could want in a cozy neighborhood fine dining establishment.  The restaurant looks to be converted from a small home, so seating is pretty limited--but that just adds to the charm.  Location is very central to downtown Scottsdale, but enough off beaten path that it feels hidden.  Decor and atmosphere are a fun mix between country garden and creole soul.  Food excellent!  And if you sit inside, you get to enjoy watching Chef Chris work only a few feet away.  Its like dining at the home of a close friend--who happens to have an industrial grade kitchen, and can throw down in it.

To know, before you go: Cash only and BYOB.
