Three words: Thai Chicken Dynamite!!!!
Two more words: extra limes.
One last word: divine!

I could probably eat here three times a week and still not feel like I'm getting enough. I used to love going to P.F. Changs, but Pei Wei is so much more convenient and affordable. I don't care that it's not "authentic" (I've had enough "authentic" food in my life to know that it's not my favorite) I love it. Be sure to grab a dozen fortune cookies for the road.
