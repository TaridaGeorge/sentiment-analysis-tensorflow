Excellent food if you know what to expect (steaks, burgers, cowboy fare). Their BBQ sauce is awesome. I plan to buy some and bring it home with me next time I'm in town. I love that the drink choices include sasparillo, flavored teas and creme sodas. This place is very kid and family friendly.

Our waitress Bonnie was very nice and her outfit and attitude was a nice compliment to the cowboy atmosphere. You have to try this place. It's a  Phoenix tradition. 

The location was once a decent section of town but that was long ago. I didn't feel unsafe here, even though we were there after dark, especially with all of the new construction in the area. But it's right next to the icky side of downtown Phoenix.
