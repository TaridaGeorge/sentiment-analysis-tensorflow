I really liked this place! You go in and the server is exceptionally nice. He suggested a dish he said would be spicy but it was slightly mild but very flavorful. They use Lemon Grass sticks as the "bone". This place actually rivals my favorite vegetarian restaurant in Portland. The price is right and the food is great! If you're considering not going...GO! Don't be scared off by the ghetto neighborhood and trashy strip mall. This place is a diamond in the rough.
