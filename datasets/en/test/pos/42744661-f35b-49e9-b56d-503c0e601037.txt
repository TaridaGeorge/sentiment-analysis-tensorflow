This is one of the few traditional Japanese places in Phx.  It ranks as good as Roka Akor,but cheaper and more casual.  The decor is is nice and simple-- very traditional.  The food is very unique in that you are not getting your traditional bento box with salad, miso, and chicken teriyaki.   They have $5 tapas menu before 7 PM.  The lamb chop is amazing.  Expect to spend about $50+ per person.
