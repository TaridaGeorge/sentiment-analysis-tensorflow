Forgot my cell phone at home... decided that I needed it and some good Chinese food for lunch!  I'm not sure why Robert M. only gave it 4 stars if its "the best thing he's eaten all month."  The Express part is that they are setup like Kentucky Fried Panda (Panda Express), but they also have a long list of other stuff on their menu like any other Chinese restaurant.  

There are only 2 negative things that I have found:
1.) The restaurant is setup more like a fast food or take out rather than a dine-in place so taking a date there probably isn't the best idea (other than take-out).
2.) Pepsi products! :P
