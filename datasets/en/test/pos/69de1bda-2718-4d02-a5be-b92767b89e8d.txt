Coffee, soda, and energy drinks are not for me. A good iced tea makes my world a better place, and Souvia Tea is the best place to get freshly brewed tea. 

Every time I walk into Souvia Tea I feel like I am in a modern East India Trading Company outpost. Hundreds of different teas line the walls, and the place smells so rich. Choosing a flavor is usually pretty difficult, and mixing teas is allowed which makes the process even more difficult. 

I LOVE the Souvia Sushi (like the green tea served in sushi restaurants) mixed with Mango Dream. Every flavor is available served hot or cold. I am usually just purchasing the tea for myself, so I am not well versed in the whole pot of tea option that they offer.
