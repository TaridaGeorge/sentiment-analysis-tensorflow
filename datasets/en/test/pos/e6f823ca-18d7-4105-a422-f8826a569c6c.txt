A Saturday morning breakfast at Crackers--or Crack Whores as my uncle and I jokingly and lovingly refer to our favorite breakfast place--is soooo filling.

I also like to order from the lunch menu as well (if we go after 10am)...cream of spinach and artichoke soup!  the drunken chicken sandwich! the spinach salad (with green apples)!

Hidden in an industrial complex off of Country Club in Mesa, Crackers & Co is a great place to meet, a great place to take people, and has a surprisingly mild wait--even at weekend brunch time (the longest I've waited is about 20min...mostly there's no wait at all the farther from noon you get)

Ask for the fries well done and the spicy mayonnaise!
