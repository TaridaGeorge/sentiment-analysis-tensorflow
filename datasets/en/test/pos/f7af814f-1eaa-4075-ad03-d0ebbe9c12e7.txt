In short: Amazing fresh food, at a good price, and awesome customer service to boot.

I went here by accident but probably the best accident ever, if there is such a thing.  It's unassuming and simple, even the menu isn't elaborated, I think 10 items total.  It looks like just another chicken bowl place, wrong!!! It's anything but that, the food was amazing.  They use really fresh ingredients, seasoning is perfect.  You don't get the cardboard chicken doused with teriyaki sauce like other places.  Texture and doneness of the meat was perfect. I tried the combination plate which had rib eye beef , chicken, lots of vegetables, a slaw style salad and half an orange.  The portions are huge and filling, and  the prices are great too, and I love their emphasis on good healthy food.  This is great place for a fast lunch or a good healthy meal.
