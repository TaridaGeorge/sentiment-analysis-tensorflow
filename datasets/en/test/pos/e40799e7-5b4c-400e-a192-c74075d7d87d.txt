Not the best pizza in the world, but it's pretty good and VERY convenient! 

I like ordering online and watching the "pizza tracker" so I know how soon my pizza is going to be delivered. Usually it arrives within 20 minutes! I love being able to have it delivered, since I'm too lazy to drive a few miles to pick it up.

Of the few times that I did pick up my order, the staff were quick and friendly. I like the prices too!
