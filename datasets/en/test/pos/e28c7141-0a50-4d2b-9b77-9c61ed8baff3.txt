We stopped by this great wine bar last weekend.... Loved it! Brix has great decor, a super-friendly bartender, and a nice selection of wine. You can buy by the glass or buy a bottle to enjoy there (their bottles are very reasonably priced). Their "menu" option is a cheese and charcuterie platter to nosh on. But you can order in or you can bring in any food you'd like. Brix obviously has a following of regulars, but is very welcoming to new-comers. I'll be visiting again!
