Dillard's clearance center is my favorite place to shop.  You can get some crazy deals at the Clearance Center.  I got some dresses that were 50% off with additional 40% off and then some tops that were 60% off with an additional 40% off.  Now that is a great deal.  It is even cheaper than the thrift stores.  If you are looking for a place to go shopping in the Mesa you should head over to the Dillard's Clearance center.
