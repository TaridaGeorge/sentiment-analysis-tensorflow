I can see why people are just packing it in here. A great place for visitors and locals.

Wonderful atmosphere. Quality wines and great gnoshing dishes. There is a friendly, knowledgeable staff to advise folks about there options. Top notch bruschetta with a great combination of fresh ingredients. Brie and apple, dates with pistachios being my favorites.

Make reservations because the beautiful crowd is huge. 

Best deal ever, happy hour - $5 wine by glass is the best deal before 5pm
