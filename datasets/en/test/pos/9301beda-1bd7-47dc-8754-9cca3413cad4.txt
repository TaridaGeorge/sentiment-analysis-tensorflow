We were spending part of the holiday season at the Arizona Biltmore. Every morning we had breakfast at Frank & Albert's. Good buffet spread with fruit, bacon, omelet bar, and more. Kenneth was our waiter twice. He remembered that my wife had chocolate milk and what all of the children were drinking. That service was the extra added touch that separates the Biltmore and this restaurant from others.
