Did take out for lunch.  Ordered the Pastrami Burger, was our favorite at the Sandwich Shop in Page Az.  Really good burger!  Saved the BBQ Salad for dinner, taste tested it before putting it in the frig.  Chicken had a very good flavor and the ingredients were fresh.  Live in Central Phoenix always looking for local restaurants to support.  Staff was very friendly.
