I love this place for happy hour. Take advantage of their 1/2 price drinks and appetizers, best deal on Mill Ave. The atmosphere is great, a large patio with long tables and bench seating, plenty of room for a large group. The inside is nice too, big bar and side walls that roll up to make the inside seem like part of the outside patio.  They have a nice selection of beers and have found the wait staff to be friendly and attentive.
