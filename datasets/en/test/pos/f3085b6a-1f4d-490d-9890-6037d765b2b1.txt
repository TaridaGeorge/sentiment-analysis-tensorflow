Hopi Animal is the best around.  The veterinarians are young, hip, caring, and concerned.  They all go the extra mile to assist and provide information and comfort.  The office staff are all great, but special praise to Sylvia and Melissa.  Marji provides the best grooming experiences ever, and is very attentive to detail and perfection.  I highly recommend Hopi Animal Hospital to anyone who really loves their pet and desires a stellar veterinarian experience for both owner and pet.
