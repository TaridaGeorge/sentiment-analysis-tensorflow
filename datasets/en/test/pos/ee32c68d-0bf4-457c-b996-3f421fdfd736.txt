I just love the Salvation Army & Store. They make donations easy and pick-up a breeze (They pick-up at my house and on MY schedule!). 

Every time I want to donate something, I just go online and type in a pick-up date. Then they come and get the stuff and leave me a donation receipt. They make it so easy to give back to the community and really help me out a lot when I am cleaning out the closet or house. 

If you want to donate clothing, furniture or anything, they will take it... and you just have to use the online "Schedule a Pick-Up". It is so easy and quick.
