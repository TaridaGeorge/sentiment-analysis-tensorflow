Love the Camelback mountain!  This is one of the must stops if you are in Phoenix.  There is two way to reach the top of Camelback.  The easier way is the Cholla trial and the harder but shorter trial is Echo Cayon trial.  I have been on both trails many times... but I prefer the Cholla trail because the Echo Canyon trailhead parking is horrible.  

However, I would suggest the Echo Canyon trail if you are looking for a great work out and don't mind to wait for parking.   The view on top is simply amazing!  You would be able to see the 4 peaks... Supersition Spring Mt... and the entire Valley of the Sun.  Both trials get very busy during the weekend so you might want to start early!  All in all, this is the number 1 Phoenix's attraction in my book!
