Man, I love Pita Jungle. I found them as soon as I moved to the Valley in 96 and have been a customer ever since. The atmosphere is chill and the food is awesome. Get an order of the jalape√±o, cilantro hummus! It's pretty damn good! I've never ordered something I didn't love at Pita Jungle. Get in there!
