The super cute barista with tats and blue eyes is way chill, in the southeast Portland sort-of-way!  It's refreshing to find some peeps who don't look like Kevin Federline and are genuinely friendly & helpful. 

The ambiance is a chill, post-modern meets restoration hardware esthetic.  Great flavored coffee roast & perfect break  around the corner from Apple & H&M, down from AX. DEFINITELY worth the walk across from Kierland Commons.
