I've been told it's phenomenal...guess what it is! I have hard time finding vegetarian dishes out that are actually good and not fried. There are SO many options here, obviously, and I am now hooked! I'll definitely be back. 

Do not let the little strip mall area it's in keep you away. You step inside and you're transformed to a totally different place. It's super clean and even better the food is DELICIOUS and better yet priced just right! I definitely recommend it.
