This place gets better and better with each visit. For the most part, a group of us head down often for the Wingless Buffalo Dip and drinks, & fabulous conversation. We vowed that we would get together more often in 2010...and this has become one of our fave hangouts. Love Tina at the bar! Perfect atmosphere. Happy that Maizie's Cafe has become one of our fave spots. Cheers!
