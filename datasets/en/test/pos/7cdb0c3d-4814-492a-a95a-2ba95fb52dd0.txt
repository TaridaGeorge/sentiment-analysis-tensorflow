Now this is what I call a good hot dog!...Not just good, they are GREAT :) This what a ballpark hot dog is suppose to taste like...and cost. The  value is amazing for everything you get. 

Oh, and I tried the onion rings after reading all the great reviews and they truly are some of the best onion rings I've ever had. 

By the way, I am usual not the type to get up to order seconds, but this time, I couldn't help myself...just had to have another!
