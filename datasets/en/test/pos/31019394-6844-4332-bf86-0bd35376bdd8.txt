I love this place!! It has not changes for 20 years!!! Crazy I know. 

The story behind this fantastic little martini/restaurant bar is that it is owned by Karl Kopps from Milwaukee, WI and it has sister bar in Milwaukee that is called Elsa's. Both have the same vibe and menus. What's interesting is that the artwork rotates from place to place and keeps the vibe changing. 

I highly recommend the burger!  Yes, I said BURGER... as in Hamburger!  It's awesome. Therefore, kick back and savor a martini while chilling to good tunes and munching on a hand-packed piece of Americana! 

The bottom line: if your looking for a chic little place that always has a a great vibe. Than this is your spot. 

PS. Be prepared to wait for a table or come early as they so get packed!!
