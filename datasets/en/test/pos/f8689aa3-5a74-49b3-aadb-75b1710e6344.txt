My new favorite breakfast spot! Let's start with the Nutella crepes... Yum, Yummy in my tummy!  My friend and I were nursing a little hangover, so we were ready to chow down and ordered the crepes to split and our own meals =).  I had the omelet with a variety of cheeses, served with a fresh green salad and hash brown patty, it was cooked perfectly and I really enjoyed the salad on the side. I was also very impressed with their coffee, the strength was just right and served in a huge mug, so I only had to ask for one refill!  Because of the time we made it to the joint, other patrons were eating lunch, and I couldn't help notice a mouth watering bowl of tomato soup ... that will be on my next visit for sure!
