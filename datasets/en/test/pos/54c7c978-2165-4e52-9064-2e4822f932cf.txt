I've been coming to Yuphas for about three years, and an absolutely addicted to their drunken noodles! Their staff is really quick for lunch service (which comes with a small salad bar and vegetable soup, and spring roll), which is great for a workday lunch. I'm really excited that they're now open for lunch on the weekends too. My friends and I are regulars and the staff always remember our orders and bring us extra hot chili sauce. I highly recommend Yuphas!
