I had a great time at Deseo with my boyfriend this weekend! The chicken pozole was incredible!!! The mojitos were delicious! And the Kobe beef flat bread melted in my mouth!! The server was very friendly and helpful, and let us stay well past closing time! For dessert we ordered the creme brulee and it was soooo creamy and delicious! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who enjoys a good time!
