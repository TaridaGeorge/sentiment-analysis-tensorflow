I usually eat pizza as a guilty pleasure, but not anymore! The personal sized pizzas, which are big enough to share, are light yet filling. While you can create your own pie, I order one of the pizzas listed on the menu and modify it if necessary. I love their ingredient combinations; simple and clean tasting. The staff is extremely friendly. And you can't beat the location! Just make sure you have enough money in the meter if you parked on Mill. lol
