This place is like home (not home away from home, literally home.)  I left for a year and a half to California (to do some prospecting or something), and this little brewery was top on a very short list of places I actually missed.  You know how nothing ever tastes quite the same as the way your mom made it, even if the food you're eating is much better than your mom's cooking?  No, I'm not saying something bad about your mom's cooking - I'm making a point here.  This is how Four Peaks beer is for me. 

My resolution this year is to spend 4 days a week here in November when pumpkin porter is out.  I think I can pull it off - I -generally- show up for work 5 out of 5!
