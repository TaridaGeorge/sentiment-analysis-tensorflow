Fun music store...what music stores should be. It reminds me of Empire Records. Fun finds and they have new and used...mostly used though which is great because you can find a great variety of new and old music at better prices! They do sell records here but I usually only look for fun since I don't have a record player. They also have an amazing selection of movies. I have sold/traded here a ton in the past...cash won't get you nearly as much as trade though FYI... I really enjoy walking around ZIA. I like that they have a loyalty card too.
