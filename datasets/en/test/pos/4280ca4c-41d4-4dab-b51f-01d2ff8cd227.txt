I really like this place, for numerous reasons.  It has the most unique atmosphere.  It actually reminds me of a review I wrote for Ganem Jewelers because there is this duality that is interesting to me.  Normally for me, "wine bar" would invoke thoughts of pretentious sommelier wanna-be type people.  But these guys are pretty down to earth, tattoos and all.  They have somehow created this atmosphere of cool by the unique blend of class along with a little "bad boy" thrown in.

I went for Happy Hour...a $7.00 glass of pretty good wine...and generous pourings (is that a word?) made me a very happy customer.

I cannot wait to try this place again over a Friday/Saturday.
