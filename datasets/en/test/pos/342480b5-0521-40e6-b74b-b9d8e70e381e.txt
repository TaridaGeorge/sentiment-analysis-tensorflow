I have been here several times to eat before, and have always had a great experience.  This IHOP is located off the I-10 and Ray Road.  For some reason, its listed as a Phoenix location when I consider it Awatukee.

I like this place because I have always had such wonderful service here.  The waitresses are always nice to me, I'm always seated quickly, and I dont have to wait forever to get my food.  Decent selection of food night or day, and the place is open 24 hours.

I know its considered a "chain resturant" but honestly, I don't hold it against them. Sometimes, I think we could all use some comfort food (like I needed today) and I think this is a reliable place to get it without sacraficing service or price.
