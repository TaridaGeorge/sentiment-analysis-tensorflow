I love stores like this where I have no idea of what I am looking at. I really do not mind the set up in regions as I enjoy looking at it all. I bought several things and will be back. The folks here are extremely helpful as it took five persons to find what I was looking for, but they never gave up and found it with me only asking one person. It is still not close enough to my home but I will make the trip.
