I love this place. It's close to home and we go there often. they are very accommodating and the drinks are reasonable and the food is very good. It was great to find a good sports bar here in Scottsdale.  

The pizza is fantastic if you haven't tried it before. 
The Prime Rib Wrap is great.
Burgers (including the turkey burger) are awesome
The grilled wings are awesome as well. 

Also, they have a good brunch on the weekends.
