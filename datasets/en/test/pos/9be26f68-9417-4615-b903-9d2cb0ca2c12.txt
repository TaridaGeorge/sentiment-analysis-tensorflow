I have lived in Hong Kong and Singapore (two years each) and I still travel to Asia frequently.  I think the Great Wall is the most authentic and best tasting Chinese restaurant in Phoenix.  It is a popular place for wedding banquets among the Chinese community of PHX, and can get quite loud when one of those events is taking place.  As with most Chinese restaurants, the best meals are on the Chinese menu, not the English menu.  A freind who reads Chinese turned us on to the set meal #1 on the Chinese menu, which is what we order almost every time we go there now!  It is very reasonably priced and with a famly of 4 you will probably be taking some of it home.
