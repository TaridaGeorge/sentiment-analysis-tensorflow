Awesome bar! Probably my new favorite spot this side of town! What the new owners have done to this place is amazing. I live on the west side of the valley now but after a friend introduced me to this place about 6 weeks ago I try to make it up there at least once a week! Great drinks, great drinks, and good looking women behind the bar! This is by far the best, cleanest and most fun bar on this strip of McDowell. 2 great pool tables, a dart board and a really fun crowd! You won't know fun till you check out this place!
