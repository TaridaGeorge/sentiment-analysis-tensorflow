A good friend of mine told me about this place. He started drulling every time he would say "Lukes" so I though I should check it out. Luke's most def. lives up to the hype. Great food and fast service. everyone in the place was talking about how good it was. Ive never seen so many people drulling over hot weiners all at once.
