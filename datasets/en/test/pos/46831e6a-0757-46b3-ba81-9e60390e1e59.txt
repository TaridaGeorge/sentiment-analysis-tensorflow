This is my favorite italian restaurant!! It's very authentic and all of their pastas are amazing! The meatballs are to die for, they are the size of tennis balls and i would definitely recommend ordering a couple of them. It's BYOB and you have to pay in cash. This is honestly the best pasta in scottsdale, definitely better than all of the overpriced, fancy italian restaurants.
