I have been absolutely blown away with the quality of this gym. I recently transfered to the DC Ranch Village from the Camelback location. While I will miss the polar plunge and the bar by the tennis courts of the former location, you can't argue with how nice this location is.

Sure, some might complain that the monthly rate is too high, but the equipment is nearly brand new, there are a variety of classes to take all the time, there's tons of towels and water refilling stations, the rental mountain bikes for the local trails are free, the place feels like a resort (very much like the Montelucia), the locker room looks straight out of a country club, and the pool with the mountainside views is spectacular.
