I have taken my car to CarGuy for service and I am very pleased with their work.  I am a car guy as well and work on my cars myself however if there is something that I cannot do I always take my vehicles to Gene.  I ended up losing a printout of my allignment but thankfully they were able to get me another copy.  Gene always goes above and beyond for me and any of my friends that I send over to him.  Great guy and great business person.  I highly recommend CarGuy.
