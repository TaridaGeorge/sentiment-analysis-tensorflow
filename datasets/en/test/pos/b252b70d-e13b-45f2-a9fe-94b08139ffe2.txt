You might miss this place the first time you drive by, or even the 2nd or 3rd time too. This quaint little home turned tavern is an excellent neighborhood watering hole, too bad I just don't live in the neighborhood. It's got a cozy atmosphere along with an excellent beer list and a small but good menu. Items like an all natural hot dog, gooey grilled cheese, savory tomato soup, bacon wrapped dates and a few other dishes should keep everyone's taste buds happy.
