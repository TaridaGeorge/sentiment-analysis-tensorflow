I like veggies but I don't like buying them. Following this simplistic logic trail I decided to plant a garden. Since I don't know a damn thing about gardening I sought out some professional help. To the Baker Nursery! 

I could easily spend an entire day wandering through the nursery. The place is huge, with an amazing assortment of indoor and outdoor plants, flowers, trees and veggies.  The quality of everything was great, everything was healthy and well tended.

The vegetable selection is fairly extensive and very reasonably priced. In no time at all I had the beginnings of a nice little garden picked out. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable, answering the questions that I had. 

The garden is really coming along, I picked my very first strawberry yesterday. Thank you Baker Nursery!
