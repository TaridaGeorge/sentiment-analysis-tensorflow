I love this place. I have been in my home for just about two years and I am sad that I found this treasure just about seven months ago. What was I missing? So much goodness, that's what. I order everything with a few boudin balls!!! The people who work there are really nice. I was not sure if I wanted to order dessert and they offered me a taste. The bread pudding is wonderful. It has no yucky raisins and the greatest sauce ever to pour on top. If atmosphere is your thing than this may not be the place for you. Forget that...it's the place for anyone. I get takeout from them once or twice a month and they never disappoint.
