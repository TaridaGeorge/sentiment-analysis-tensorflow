First time having a dog. I've had him for 3 mths and see why ppl say dogs are like a man's best friend.

Jennifer groomed my dog twice.  First time, I was unsure of the different type of dog cuts and told her to cut it. He came out good with a clean cut. Second time around, I was more educated of cuts and told her  I want a teddy bear/round face look. She did a great job!!!! Just tell her what you want. I love the teddy cut! My Hurley seems to like it there a lot. I drop off & pick up later. Cheap prices and good service.  I like that I can call her and make an appt same day! I love not having to wait.
