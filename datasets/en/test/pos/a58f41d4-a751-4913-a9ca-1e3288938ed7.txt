Oh yeah. This place rocks! Definitely authentic. I felt very pressured to order in that New York nice kind of way.

As a frequent NY traveler (just read my other reviews) it felt every bit like I was in a New York deli, except there was room to move around and not a lot of people talking very loudly.

The subs are huge, fresh and tasty. I am definitely planning on sampling as much from the menu as I can. So far, I would say this is the best sandwich shop in town.
