I LOVE this place! This was one of my first foodie finds when I moved to Phoenix. It was everything review sites described and more. The bakery has an endless array of treats, all delicious. The sandwiches are huge and worth every bite. They offer 20 different kinds of cream cheese! I'm a huge food lover and I love this place. I bring all my guests to eat here and it never disappoints.
