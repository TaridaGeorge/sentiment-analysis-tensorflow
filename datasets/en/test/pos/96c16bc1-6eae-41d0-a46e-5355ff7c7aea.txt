I just went to the bar to meet some friends for happy hour after work and we could've stayed all night. The bartender was awesome! Very attentive, made a great mojito and funny as hell! The happy hour special were decent, nothing amazing but the people watching was good. Mostly conventioneers swirling in and out for a cocktail before dinner. The ambience was nostalgic and warm and there was a an old war movie playing on a projector screen in the lounge to the side of the bar. I like this hotel bar for starting a night out if you're in downtown and are not in the mood for all the celebrity owned sports bars.
