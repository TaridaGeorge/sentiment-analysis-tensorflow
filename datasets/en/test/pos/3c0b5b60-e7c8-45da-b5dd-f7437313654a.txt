I have never left Lolo's not beaming with joy.  I love fried chicken and I love waffles, though not as much as chicken.  I believe that Lo-Lo's not only has the best fried chicken in Phoenix, but the best waffles as well.  If you enjoy either, you must come here.  You can also buy a mason jar of red drank.  This is available nowhere else in the valley.  The macaroni and cheese is pretty good, but not my favorite style.  The real show stopper besides the chicken and waffles is the Red Velvet Cake.  Indulge.  Seriously.  But make sure you share.

Also, this is a bad place for first dates because it takes a really really remarkable person to tear your attention away from the food.
