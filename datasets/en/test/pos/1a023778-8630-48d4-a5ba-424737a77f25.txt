We discovered Arrivederci several years ago while on vacation and have  continued to come back.  We have never been disappointed: The food is wonderful from the fresh baked rolls to start the meal (with a delicious pesto, olive oil dipping sauce) to our meal - tonight we had cioppino and a wonderful Vitello Gorgonzola; the service was excellent; we were too full for dessert but the ending limoncello was the icing on the cake; we will definitely be back!
