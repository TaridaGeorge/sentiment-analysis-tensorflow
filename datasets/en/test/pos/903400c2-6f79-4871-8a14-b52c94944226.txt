I had the Southwest Cobb Salad again. It was just delicious. My only suggestion is to have them mix the ingredients. I am sure the presentation would not be as nice but I think it would be easier to eat. 

I had it mixed today. I prefer it unmixed. I am sure it is psychological but it tastes better without mixing it together.
