My ALL time FAVORITE Fro-Yo place! 

The yogurt is the perfect texture and many flavors to choose from. 

When I'm trying to be good I get the Original Tart Flavor with pineapple and kiwi. But.....my favorite SPLURGE combo is Irish Mint, Oreo and Brownies. The Brownies is AMAZING. I often get a single piece or two just to curve my ultra sweet craving.

An extra bonus = the guys here are super friendly and pretty cute too!

A huge cup of Fro-yo with a side of eye candy? Win-Win.
