Another great Park just a short drive from anywhere in the Phoenix area. 

We decided to take it easy on Easter Sunday and took the short drive (about 45 minutes from 51 and 101) to the White Tanks. There were lots of families picnicing and great trails to hike. We took a couple short hikes, but will be back soon to check out more.
