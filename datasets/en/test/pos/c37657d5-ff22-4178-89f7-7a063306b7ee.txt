I have no idea why the reviews are so low. The food here is always great. I take the family and split the Sunset Fire Grilled steam pot for two and its exception. Best seasoning I've ever tasted and the crab legs are always big and fresh with great shrimp to top it off. The atmosphere is very fun and family friendly. Can get a lil pricey but that's how seafood usually goes. Love this place!!
