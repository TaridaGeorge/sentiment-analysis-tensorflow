Great time here. Went hoppin' along all the places on that Chandler corridor: Sushi Eye, Murphy's, San Tan and Siracha. Bellied up to the sushi bar and was greeted by a smiling chef VJ. Really nice guy and later we discovered was the owner. Great conversation and great food. 

We had a few happy hour items. We had a couple orders of dumplings that were accompanied by an incredibly tasting sauce. Edamama is edamame but it was served pipping hot and steamed just right - I don't like over cooked beans. We also had a double order of spicy tuna rolls that were out of this world. I'll go back just for that! Kirin Light saki bombs rounded off a great experience. 

Thanks VJ! Great place. Look forward to checking out the patio seat too.
