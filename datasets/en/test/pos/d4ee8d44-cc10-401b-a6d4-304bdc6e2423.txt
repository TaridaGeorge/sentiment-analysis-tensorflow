Now that Sekong has reopened after their early summer break, we wanted to make another visit.

As usual, delicious food.  Extremely nice staff.  And, I think the menu has grown, too... I see more sandwiches and crepes now.  But, alongside the lok lak beef, and katheaw, I've found a new favorite: the giant wings.  Whatever they marinate these in (I think honey and cinnamon are involved somehow) makes them absolutely fantastic.

(By the way, I'm completely confused by Jade M. and Nick L.  Whatever you guys are smoking, please, don't bogart.)
