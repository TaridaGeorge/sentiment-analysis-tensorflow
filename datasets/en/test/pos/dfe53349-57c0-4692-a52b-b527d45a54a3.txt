The single best place to have lunch if you're in the Paradise Valley Mall area.  

This family-run eatery serves up traditional Mediterranean classics  but they make each one their own.  The ground beef kabob is nothing short of spectacular.  In many places, that dish is an afterthought but not here.  Their house rice is an aromatic yellow rice with almonds and raisins and absolutely delicious.

It's also a proper restaurant - not your typical gyro lunch counter vibe.  Lunch for two runs $17.00 and we usually take food home.  Everyone I've brought here loves it.

Highly recommended!
