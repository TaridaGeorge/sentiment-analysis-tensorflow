They apparently closed at nine tonight. But stayed open just a few minutes past so I could pick up my delicious. Crispy made to order pizza. And pear gorgonzola salads. 
A Tuscan pizza and added sausage. We ordered it crispy when i go there the woman was concerned she over cooked the pizza and already had another one cooking in the oven! But i liked the one she had ready to go.  I almost walked out without my salads but she ran after me and made aure i got them.
 The blonde haired older woman was berry polite ready an willing to please
The place was clean
My order was correct
I am now full and happy.
