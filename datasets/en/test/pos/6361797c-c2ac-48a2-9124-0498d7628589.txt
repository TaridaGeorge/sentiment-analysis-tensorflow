AMAZING.  I would have literally bought every. single. item. in this lovely little store!  I walked out with way, way too many things (I seriously couldn't put things back), and I have received compliments on each piece I've worn.  
I also love that this shop has vintage luggage, wall hangings, macrame plant holders, and more to buy!  The vintage clothes selection is very well curated, and they offer a pretty good sales rack.
The person in charge while I was shopping was absolutely delightful, and she made me feel very comfortable!  I WISH this place were in my home town of New Orleans, and I will definitely be back next time I'm visiting Phoenix!
