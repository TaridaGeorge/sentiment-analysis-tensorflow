The desert Botantical Garden is a must if youu want to the dessert plants and describution of them while seeing them growing in nature environment.  I have not been there for awhile but dropped in with my visiting friends from CA & found how amazing it is once again. It was natural beauty & education review of the desert plants.  If anything dont miss this place while visitng Phoenix or those who live here pease go back and see nature & all its beauty.
