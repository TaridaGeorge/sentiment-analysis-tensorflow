This is a great boutique in North Scottsdale.  Ruby has such cute dresses to go out in and is a little jewel box inside of this shopping center.  As the two other reviews said they carry great brands like the established Tibi or even new brands.  One  that I saw and loved from Phoenix Fashion Week was Smoke & Mirrors Clothing from Los Angeles.  Ruby carries a lot of what I saw and loved on the runway.  Ruby is always getting new stuff in so it's a great place to check in with anytime you need a dress or a kick start to your newest fashion routine. Two thumbs up!
