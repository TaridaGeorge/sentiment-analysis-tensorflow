I have a shopping problem. Really, I do. I blame Saks for my credit card woes, but also credit them to my closet of couture. 

Shopping at Saks is just an experience. The golden doors, the scent of new merchandise when you walk in the door, the suited employees who enjoy informing customers on what they can't afford to buy, (but do anyway). 

Every time I come here, it's a bank-breaking, lovely experience. The customer service is always top notch, but sometimes you have to find the sales associate. I forget her name, but at the Louis Vuitton booth, the woman there is fantastic. And they have a better selection than the actual LV booth at Fashion Square. 

Come to Saks, to reach your credit limit, and reach an entirely new wardrobe.
