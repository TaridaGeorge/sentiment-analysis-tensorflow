Took my brand new Retina Macbook Pro in for service because of a minor issue I was having.  So, after waiting 3 days of having it gone for "repair" I got pretty anxious to get it back.

I called the Apple store not 5 minutes ago where I was in contact with Amy, a genius specialist. Not only did Amy tell me exactly where my computer was in its repair process, but also every detail about what they did, they measures they're taking to be sure it works, and also doing an entire diagnostic of the computer to make sure everything is fluid.

Can't say enough about how friendly all the staff and support have been, not only with this situation, but in all my other needs too.
