Pita Jungle has really grown on me over the years and this location is a big reason why.  Service is always great and friendly whether it's eatin' in or for take-away.  The restaurant has a cool design and great views of the street in Roosevelt neighborhood.  Back patio is sweet and large.  I sometimes go on my own and sit on the patio side at the bar which is also nice.  

Everything I've tried on the menu is good and tasty.  Lavosh pizzas are great, the Turkey Pesto Lavash Wrap is awesome, though I think it's pretty chintzy to charge for extra dressing (really, is it like made of gold???).  Many good options for vegans and vegetarians too; the Lentil Fattoush Salad is a particularly good stand out.

  A great place to go for a healthy and affordable meal.  Enjoy!
