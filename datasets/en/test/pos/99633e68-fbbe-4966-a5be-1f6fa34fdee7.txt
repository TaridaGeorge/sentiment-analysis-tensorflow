Wow!  I ordered the Louisiana Blackened Catfish topped with pecan butter and spicy pecans with dirty rice.  The fish was done just right -- succulent, moist and flavorful.  I also had the fried alligator appetizer.  The meat is tender and scrumptous.  If I can eat it, so can you.  Oh, you haven't tasted a roll until you have one from Pappadeaux's.  Hot and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.   

If you're in Phoenix, be sure to make this your top restaurant visit. You won't be disappointed.
