Hands down, the BEST yogurt shop in the valley. I've been to quite a few and I love this Yogurtland because they always have really tasty flavors, the shop is always clean and the best part - the staff is amazing - so friendly and never chintzy on the samples. I come here at least once a week - Love it! (Plus, it's right next door to Sprinkles Cupcakes! Yum!)
