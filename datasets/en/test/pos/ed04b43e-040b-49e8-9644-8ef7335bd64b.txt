I love Bandera. I was there on Sunday for a birthday dinner with some friends and I left asking my wife: "Why don't we come here more?"

Bandera is part of Hillstone, so it is like Houstons in a way. I prefer Bandera due to the smaller, seasonal menu and the smaller, more intimate feel to the restaurant. On Sunday, I had the ribs, my wife had the lamb (a special item that night), and both were delicious. The table got the cornbread to start (amazing), and we finished with their banana cream pie (UH-Mazing). The rest of the sides, salads and entrees that we ordered were very good as well. 

Every time I've been there the service has been spot on, the cocktails are good and the food is consistently great. I'll probably end up here again within a week or two. 

Highly recommend.
