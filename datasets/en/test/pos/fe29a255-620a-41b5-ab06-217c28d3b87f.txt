Wow -- what a find!  We thoroughly enjoyed our leisurely Saturday lunch at Elie's.  The food was delicious and filling, and he owner / chef was friendly and nice to talk to.  We had the chicken gyro with feta and the classic beef gyro.  The roasted veggies on the gyros added flavor and nutritional content.  The pitas were extremely soft and fluffy.  You must try the hummus -- it's homemade and fresh with a bit of lemony taste to it.
