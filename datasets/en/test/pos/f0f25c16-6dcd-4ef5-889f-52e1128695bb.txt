Stopped in here when my flight from Phoenix to Raleigh showed a 3 hour delay... they have very comfy lounge chairs and coffee tables that are perfect to take advantage of the free wi-fi in the airport. The staff was courteous and when they had ran out of queso, the manager brought me out complementary chips and salsa. The service was excellent with the waitress coming to check on me multiple times and refilling my drink. As for the food. the beans were spiced excellently, the rice was good and soft not undercooked, and the steak tacos were phenomenal, in the home made corn tortilla. Overall excellent.
