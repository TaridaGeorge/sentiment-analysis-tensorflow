Really dug this little place.  Good food, friendly, welcoming owner.  GREAT prices for happy hours and did I say GOOD food?  Their panini with salami and garlic aioli a terrific little treat on perfectly toasted bread and the fig, goat cheese and blackberry panini wasn't bad either!  I plan to go there for breakfast real soon.
