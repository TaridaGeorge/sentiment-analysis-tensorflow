Excellent customer service! Monday I bought the livingsocial deal for three oil changes, good until 2015, and made my appointment for Tuesday at 1PM. Jim greeted me with a smile as I entered and made me feel welcomed.

Long story short, like Andy G (see his review on 1/14/12), I have found my new car mechanic. All of the employees were professional, very friendly and helpful. Regina very kindly shuttled me to and from the nearby Wal-Mart to kill some time while I waited for my car.

Everything checked out fine with no added extra charges or surprises. (whew!) I am so happy to have found Hi-Tech Car Care! Maybe now I won't go a year in between oil changes anymore? baaaaaaaaaad
