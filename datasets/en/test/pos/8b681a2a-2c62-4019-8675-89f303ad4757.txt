I agree with all of the good things already said by other reviewers, and so will you. I was a first-timer during Yelp Eats and got to try a variety of the best dishes... teeter tots (delicious fried morsels in just the perfect sauce), yellowtail sashimi (omg the flavor combination and freshness!), pork belly steamed buns (the table had to order seconds), soft shell crab sandwich (very good). It was the kind of meal I felt privileged to enjoy.
