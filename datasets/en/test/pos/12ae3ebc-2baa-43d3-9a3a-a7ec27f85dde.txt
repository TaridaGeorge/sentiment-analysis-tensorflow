There is nothing at Lux that you will not enjoy. I've had one of the best steaks of my life there at dinner and the baked treats are some of the best I've ever had. Everything is homemade and the sweets aren't too sweet which is why I love them!

The atmosphere is very hip and laid back with lots of rooms with tables making this a great place to get some work done. Just be prepared for a crowd! This place is THAT good!
