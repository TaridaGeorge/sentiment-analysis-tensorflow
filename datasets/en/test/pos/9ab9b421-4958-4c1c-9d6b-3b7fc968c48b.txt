Natural Nail SPA is my new favorite nail salon. Why??? Because CiCi is there!!!  This gal can do it all. And, she does it right!!! Quickly & efficiently! Yes, if the name sounds familiar, this is THE CiCi from Party Nails. A nail salon is only as good as its people - BIG MISTAKE Party Nails! Smart move NATURAL NAIL SPA! Go check CiCi out (SE corner of Dobson & Ray - next to Coffee Rush) - It has taken me 4 years to find someone out here I trust enough to actually go back to. I trust CiCi with my limbs! She does great eyebrows too!  - Karen & Tom
