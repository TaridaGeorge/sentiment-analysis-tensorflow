$5 martinis and $5 manicures on Mondays!!!

The manicurist teaches at a school, so - needless to say - the manicure was great.

The drinks were good.  The bartender stayed on top of us, but also out of our way.  

The atmosphere is just lovely - chill/quiet - and the staff (including the perfectly charming (and handsome!) Owner) were really pleasant to be around.

I think Cheuvront may be losing some of its steam to the newer restaurants downtown and, granted, I've yet to try this out for dinner and wine, but it's really a very lovely place and I'd really like to see this neighborhood staple thrive!
