Revisited St. Francis with my mom and youngest daughter...

I had the same fantastic cocktail, but finished it this time. Thank goodness Mom was there to drive!

The waitstaff were all the same as the prior time, as were the bartenders... all EXCELLENT!

My daughter and I each had the pot roast with red carrots, corn polenta, and bok choy... FABULOUS! They make vegetables I crave.

Mom had the roasted chicken. She usually can find something to complain about, no matter how great a place is, but all she could complain about was the wait. I bought her a glass of wine...
