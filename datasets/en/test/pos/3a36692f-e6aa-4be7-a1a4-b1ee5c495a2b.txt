This is one of the nicest theaters I have ever been to. They have a large theatre that shows the newest biggest movies, this theatre is called the Cine~Capri. They also have great theatre food, you can choose from popcorn, pretzels, white castle burgers, popcorn chicken, churros, and of course soda and candy. I prefer the popcorn chicken. You can purchase a loyalty cup for you diehard movie goers, the loyalty cup is a 32oz drinking cup with cool movie designs on it. You buy it once for $5 and every time you come back you get as many refills you want for $1. Next if you buy a loyalty t-shirt you can wear it and get a free large popcorn  !!! Overall it's a great theatre!
