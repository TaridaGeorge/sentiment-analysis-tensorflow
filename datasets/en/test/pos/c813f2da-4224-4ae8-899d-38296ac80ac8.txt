super chill atmosphere with nice rolling door to open it all up to outside, perfect for fall to spring in phoenix!
coffee is top notch and bagels are huge, baked not boiled so deal.
lunch is great the curry chicken sammy is a delight and ice tea gets free all day refils. this is my new office away from office.
and to the guy that likes to put his shoes on the couch: please stop, its pretty lame.
