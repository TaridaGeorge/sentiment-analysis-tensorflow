A sweet taste of Italy, here in Chandler!!!

I visited Gelato 64 for the 1st time last week. Took my wife & 10 year old son. Apparently the 64 flavors available is true, it took us about 10 minutes to decide which we wanted.

The Taramisu (mine) was very tasty. A little weak in flavor as teramisu goes, but it was very good, creamy, and rich

My wife had the Dark Chocolate, which was truly a taste of heaven, and my son had the cookie dough, which he enjoyed also. 

Service was fast and friendly, prices are good, and the gelato is the closest I've had to what I ate on my trips to Italy. Next up... trying the fruit flavors, and perhaps some Lavazzo (Italian Coffee) espresso drinks.

Stop in and try them out... you won't regret it.
