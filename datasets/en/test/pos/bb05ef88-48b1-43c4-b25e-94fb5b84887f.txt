This is the best 24 Hour Fitness I have discovered in Arizona. Spotless and clean, it has my favorite eliptical. The mostest awesomest feature: the incredible stretching machine. You basically do certain poses as pictured and it stretches out those particular muscles. For this grad student too cheap to pay for a trainer it is golden.
