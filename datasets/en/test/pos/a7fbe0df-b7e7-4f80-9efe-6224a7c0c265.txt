This is a wonderful neighborhood hardware store!  The customer service is great and the people in the store seem to know their stock very well.  I came here looking for hardware to hang something; I ended up walking out the door with all kinds of things I needed for other projects: RIT dye, a new shower curtain liner, STP fuel injector fluid for my old car, and free pop corn to boot!  I will be back!
