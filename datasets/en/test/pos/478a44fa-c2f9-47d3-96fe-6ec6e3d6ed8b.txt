My only visit, about 3 years ago, was lovely.  The cinnamon raisin version of their creamy peanut butter was so amazing and the asian curry was unbelievably delicious.  

I would have visited again today, but they may be closed - website is down and the phone number is disconnected.  Hopefully I just have poor timing, otherwise it's quite a sad loss.
