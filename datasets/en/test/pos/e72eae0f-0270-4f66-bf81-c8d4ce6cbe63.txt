Alfredo sauce was awesome, they use parmigiano reggiano!
I had them make me a custom pasta, rigatoni with alfredo and crumbled sausage.
My girlfriend and I shared a single entree which was huge for both of us and cost.......$12!
Cheaper than any entree there!
Service was good, she took a while to get our initial drink order. But after that she was great. Hooked us up on some free alfredo bread dipping sauce and a cheap entree, so she got a good tip!

i will go back and hopefully it will be just as awesome.
