They do great work here. Maybe pricey but they pay attention and guarantee there services. Most of the staff I believe are Registered nurses.. and they keep the integrity of your skin by being inquisitive and professional! I have had services for the past year here and love the staff, location, and result. I agree it is pricey though..They are on a whole nether level of professional! They are like a medical laser hair removal clinic -THAT IS ALL they do, so they  make sure they are damn good at it!! 
Just make sure and book your apt before you leave each time!
