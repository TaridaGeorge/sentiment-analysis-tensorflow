I was in a bind yesterday and needed a cut since my regular girl was booked.  I stopped in this location because it is close to my house and got my cut done by Amanda who did a great job listening to what I wanted and it turned out great.  The cut was only $18 and my regular girl charges $30!  I stopped going to Great Clips years ago because once you finally found someone that knew how to cut your hair they would leave.  Anyway, this little place is pretty nice with a few other girls around (maybe 10-15 more stations here).  The inside is cool with color and the normal smell of a salon and the other staff is friendly.  It is a great location next to subway and my favorite Mexican joint Camineros.
