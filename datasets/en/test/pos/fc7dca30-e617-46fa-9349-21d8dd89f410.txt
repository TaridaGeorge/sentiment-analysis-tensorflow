La Bocca has become one of my fave places to go. A few little quirks in service the first few times we went, but the atmosphere and food made up for the very minor service issues. On a side note, these issues were really no big deal, they handled them appropriately and professionally.

Best bruschetta in town, and the happy hour is awesome!

Don't think, just go.
