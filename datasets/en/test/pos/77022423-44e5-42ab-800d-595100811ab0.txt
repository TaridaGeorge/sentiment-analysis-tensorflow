They have big wave on 11.30am and other hours too! I like it since its cleaner than the ocean so you don't have too worry about the sands!
The foods just so so. You can buy pizza, hot dogs, ice cream, Smoothies, nachos, burgers, subs, etc. 
I prefer bring my own cooler & foods.  But please call them first to make sure you can have it.
Awesome place!
