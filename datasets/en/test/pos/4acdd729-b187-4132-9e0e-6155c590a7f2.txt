Out of all the eateries settling in on the "Corner on 7th" complex at McDowell and 7th Avenue, I was most excited for the Zoyo Yogurt. This locally owned chain serves up some high-quality soft serve along with a nice array of toppings - for a great price, too. We've been by several times and have never been disappointed (except when the one sugar-free option is something like mint or coffee - ick).

What I like to do is take one of the smaller cups and fill the bottom with a layer of the sweeter flavors like graham cracker or toffee topped with something like crushed Butterfingers. Then I put a fruity flavor (peach rocks) or good 'ol vanilla on the upper half with a fresh fruit topper. Yum.
