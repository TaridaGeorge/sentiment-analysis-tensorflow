Our experience with Brand X was nothing short of awesome. 

Courteous, helpful, responsive staff. Great looking final product. Amazingly quick turnaround time (tip: it's quicker if you order the Next Level brand, and the shirts are really nice!). 

We provided the basic design and asked them if they could add an effect to our text. They said it could be done easily, and the result was perfect!

I was really just flat out impressed with this place. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a custom t-shirt shop!
