Great service.  Amazing location.  Good drinks.  A DJ booth in a coffee shop?  Oh yea...

So this place is pretty much postage stamp sized, but they make up for that with swanky style.  They don't offer many "snacks, but those can be grabbed at the neighboring business Sweet Pea Bakery.  They offer indoor and outdoor seating which is so important considering their tiny location.  

Yes, it's close to the jail.  Yes, a homeless person might walk by.  But this is coffee you can walk to before a game/event or grab on the way into the office.   

Personal note - I wasn't so into their brownies.  They look luscious, but as big as my sweet tooth is, they were too dense and sweet for me.  Some folks will love them, just not my thing.
