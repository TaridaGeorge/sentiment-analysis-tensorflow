I've stopped here several times to pick up replacement bulbs and always had good service and advice.  Recently, I had a problem with an expensive low voltage fixture and Amy and Eric went all out to help.  They called the manufacturer and then followed up with me the next day to tell me how to test it.  Turned out their advice saved me a bunch of money and stress - the transformers were fine, I just needed a different bulb.  

Love them!
