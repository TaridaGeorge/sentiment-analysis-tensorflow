The pulled pork here is very tender.  I usually have the two meat special with the brisket, pulled pork, fried okra and mac & cheese.  The decor is clean and the service is very friendly.  We used to eat there on Sundays because 1) it's one of a handful of restaurants actually opened on the day of the lord and 2) nothing better than taking long naps on a belly full of barbecue.  Top off your meal with the sugar biscuits, which are 100% times better than doughnuts.  They remind me of Hawaiian malasadas, which you definitely can't get anywhere in Arizona.  Don't even bother coming to this great meateaters spot if you are a vegetarian or a calorie watcher!
