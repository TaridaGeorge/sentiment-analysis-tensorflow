I always get the number 1 and its always spot on.  Cheesesteaks are one of my favorite foods and I have jumped from place to place and this is my favorite by far.  I've tried most in the Phoenix area.  I work in downtown Phoenix so I don't get it as much as I like but I make the trip often.  Always friendly and always great.  My vote for Best of Phoenix.
