This review is particular to the 'Block Party' that Whole Foods puts on.  I was invited by Yelp's own Ivonne B, who ended up being my block party tour guide.

She took us on a tour of the store, stopping at several locations for a tasting sample.  I've never had grilled pineapple before, and it was such a treat.  It was also my first time for Indian Candy.

Ivonne is a spitfire, and made our time spent there enjoyable and entertaining... because she has a real passion for food and nutrition.

Sure, I love Whole Foods as much as the next person, but the 'Block Party' proved to be the consummation of our love.

And Ivonne let me in on a little Whole Foods customer secret... which if it got into the wrong hands, could be abused.  I'll let you inquire directly from her.
