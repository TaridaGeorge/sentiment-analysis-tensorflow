The water card is such a good deal, makes getting water faster and easier. The water here smells like water, no chem cleaning smell like at some water stores, no chlorine water.

The nozzles and water dispensing like... hose things, are always clean, the staff that work there are friendly and it is just the best, most reliable water store I've used in Arizona.
