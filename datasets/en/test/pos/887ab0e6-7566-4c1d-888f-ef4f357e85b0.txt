This place has a top notch tuna tataki app! Great rolls out quick regardless of how busy they are. Excellent service all the way around and very reasonable on price. Green tea ice cream for after dinner treat, I think so!!!! I forgot to mention I was in and out during lunch time spending 20 dollars.
