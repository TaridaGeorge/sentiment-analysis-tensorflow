Ihave been bringing my cat Squishee here for a year or two now and I have to say, I am always impressed with Dr. Grossman's knowledge and his mild, calm demeanor when handling my Squishee kitty! Squishee is 16 years old and the staff always make a big to do about his arrival and treat him so good! 

I am getting ready to take my other ca, much younger, named Basil to him for his first annual with Dr. Grossman. I definitely trust this clinic's opinions and values when it comes to my pet's well being. 5 STARS!!!
