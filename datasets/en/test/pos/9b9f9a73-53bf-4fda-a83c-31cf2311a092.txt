Lux is one of the best places to have a cup of coffee in central Phx.  The drinks are pretty good; they used to be better a couple years ago.  Maybe they changed there espresso, who knows?  I love their new location: it's designed so well.  I love mid-century furniture, so it's still a pretty nice spot to have a cup of coffee with my girl.  I haven't had the food yet, but I will soon.  Since they now serve food and drinks, there is more of a reason to go to Lux.
