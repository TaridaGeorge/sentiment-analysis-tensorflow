I found this place due to Yelp. While we have been to the Phoenix metro area many times having lived in Tucson for many years, we recently moved to Chandler and don't know all of the great places to eat yet.

I was in the area running some errands and brought Yelp up on my Iphone to find a decent gyro.  

Ordered 2 of their basic gyros to go and went back to my office.  Not only did I really enjoy it, all of my co-workers asked where I went and said that they smelled amazing. If I would have been a nice guy, I should have shared, but I was hungry. :-)

Niro's will become a regular stop on our lunch circuit.  I am looking forward to trying some of the other items on their menu.
