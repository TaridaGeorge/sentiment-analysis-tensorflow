This very simple shop is owned by a married couple who tend to know all their regulars, what they order and how they order it.  Mostly sandwiches and salads (although they do serve coffees/espresso as well), the food is simple and wonderful. I always order the Ariete which is proscuitto, fresh mozz, fresh basil, on a wonderful crunchy Italian bread.  My husband usually gets the Leone (imported ham) or the Pesce, which is tuna, red onion, olive oil and a good shaving of pecorino on foccacia.  They serve a small cup (literally) of spring greens dressed in balsamic, that always looks funny to me, but end up being a perfect compliment to your sandwich.

All breads, pastries, and foccacia style pizzas are baked fresh every a.m.  Don't go too late in the afternoon, or you'll find yourself without.
