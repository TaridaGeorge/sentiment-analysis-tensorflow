I traveled to Phoenix often for work from the early 90's to the late 00's and the first thing I'd do leaving the airport was to hit the Pink Pepper lunch buffet, hence I've never ordered from the menu or had their dinner service, but their lunch buffet was awesome!  Very reasonably priced, including an iced tea.  It may not necessarily be the most authentic Thai food as I think they reduce the heat a bit but the flavors were excellent and the variety was good.  Loved their eggplant dish (can't recall the name) and their crispy chicken with the creamy sauce, and of course the usual curry sauce dishes.

If I'm ever back in Phoenix again the Pink Pepper will be one of the first places I go.
