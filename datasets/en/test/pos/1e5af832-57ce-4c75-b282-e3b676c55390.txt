Wowzers! This place was amazing. I shared the chicken and waffels and I had to add some side dishes: mac-n-cheese, collard greens, and gravy. It was quite the soul food experience; everything was mmmmm mmmm tasty. I also treated myself to some of the kool-aide (ohh -yea) took me right back to my childhood. The service was great!  It was tough to find parking but once inside it was an inviting and fun atmosphere.
