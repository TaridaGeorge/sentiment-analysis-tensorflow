I loved the ambiance of this place from the moment I stepped out of the car and was walking in looking at the windows.  They did a great job with decoration.  The beer was great and with half price pint night I was in heaven.  The daily specials on booze are all good, making me wish I lived closer and could be a regular here.  I will be back next time I am in Scottsdale.
