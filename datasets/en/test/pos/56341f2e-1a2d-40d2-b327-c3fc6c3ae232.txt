Talk Of The Town - Asian Diner

They have my favorite Orange Chicken and I think that their service is always awesome.  So I'll give them the extra star because it seems great service these days is harder to find than great food - not to mention at a great little neighborhood location.

The owner always says hello and will make custom orders if asked.  It is one of my favorite lunch spots as the food is always made fresh, fast and friendly - which are my 3 keys for a great lunch.  I have also had great experiences when I have called ahead to pick up food.  I like to get the dinner size for lunch turn it into two meals.
