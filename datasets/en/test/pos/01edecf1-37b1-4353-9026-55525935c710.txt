FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE!!!!!!

We had a 7th birthday party for my son here. We were there on a Sunday around lunchtime and it was perfect. The staff took really good care of us and the food was SO good. We consider ourselves foodies and it was delish. If you are not one for kid parties at Chuck E Cheese and want something different, come here. 
Still getting compliments a week later.
