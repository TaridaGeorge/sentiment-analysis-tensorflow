I love this place. Dr. Petersen is wonderful with kids - she is gentle and sweet and has loads of wonderful parenting advice for such things as potty training and sleeping habits. Her Nurse Practitioner, Mrs. Ricketts is equally wonderful. At some offices, if you hear that your symptoms only qualify for a nurse visit, you wonder if you will get a thorough checkup. Mrs Ricketts is wonderful - she takes her time and has lots of great home remedies for simple ailments instead of over the counter medicine. The office is kept very clean, and the staff are extremely friendly. I am very happy we found this place.
