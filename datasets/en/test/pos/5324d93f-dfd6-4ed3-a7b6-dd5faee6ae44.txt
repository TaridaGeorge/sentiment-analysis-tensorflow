I've always liked Delux Burger. But I LOVED Zen 32. I am so so so glad they started serving the Zen 32 sushi at Delux. I've never been more excited about anything. I've already been a few times and it's just as good... No it's BETTER! 

Try the Sweet potato fries with the Aioli sauce. One of the best items on the menu.

Also the Haagen Dazs shakes are yummy as well.
