In the grips of a wi-fi withdrawl (while visiting my grandparents in Sun Lakes) I drove through every godless stripmall in the area hoping to find a internet cafe.  I was lured into this wi-fi oasis and have setup my headquarters here.  The tea sucks hard but the cookie aren't bad.  It's a big place that gets really busy around lunch.  5 stars for www dots and for not kicking me out yet.
