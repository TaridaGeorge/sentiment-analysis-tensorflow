Amazing!  I was so happy to see authentic Japanese in the Phoenix area. 

This is not your standard sushi bar.  The chef makes you pretty much whatever he wants to.  NO ROLLS HERE!!

Memorable items:

Uni wrapped in halibut wrapped in shiso, then tempura fried. It was out of this world. 

Tai sashimi dressed perfectly. 

All nigiri was awesome.  

I am a pretty tough sushi critic, and ShinBay gives me a solid reason to come back to Phoenix. 

If I lived here, I would be a once a weeker, I would get to know this chef, because I have a very strong feeling that I barely scratched the surface of what he is capable of doing.  

Great great great!
