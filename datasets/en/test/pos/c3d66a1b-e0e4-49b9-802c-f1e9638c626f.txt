After a happy hour that turned into 4 hours at the attached Q-Lounge, we had a bite to eat at the actual restaurant.  I had the BBQ pulled chicken sandwich, it was delicious.  The pre-meal cornbread and the post meal donuts were a nice touch.

Maybe someday I will return to try their legendary ribs when I haven't spent so much at the bar beforehand!
