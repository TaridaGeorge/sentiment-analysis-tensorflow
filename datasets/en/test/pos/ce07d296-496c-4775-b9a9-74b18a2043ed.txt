super clean, surprisingly cheaper than food city on certain items...
annnnnnnnnd a huge selection on mexican ingredients/foods. 
what i love most? the "food court". didn't get a chance to try any foods (which smell/look amazing, i might add), as i wasn't hungry, but i did get the papaya agua fresca. SO.GOOOOOOOD!!!! 
so 5 stars for the amazing agua fresca and for being so gosh darned clean!
