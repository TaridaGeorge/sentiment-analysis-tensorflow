The vet down the street had referred me to Poverty's Pets, as we had found an abandoned doggie. 

I had not heard of Poverty's Pets before, so I checked out their website and was moved to see how much they have helped other dogs. 
I met up with Kim, for some assistance in placing our rescue for adoption -- she was AMAZING! No, like seriously amazing...... 

Great organization...make sure you like their Facebook page. I love, love, love seeing all the great work they do to help connect doggies with "Forever Families".
