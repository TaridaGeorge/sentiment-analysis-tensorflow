This was my first time to this place, not really knowing anything about it - only joining my friend for her birthday. Not alot of parking, but that is pretty much the only thing I could possibly complain about. Nice intimate atmostphere to just have good solid fun with good people. Customer service was good (server took my beer/glass - without asking me if I wanted another). The bathroom is very clean and can probably be described as very zen-like. Food wise - the bruschetta impressed me alot, actually the whole place did so I will definately be back. Mostly to participate in the 11-4 5$ wine!!
