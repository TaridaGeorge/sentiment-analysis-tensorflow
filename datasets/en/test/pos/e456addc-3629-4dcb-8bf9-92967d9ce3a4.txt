"Viad Tower Restaurants" 

First off, I'm not sure that this is the correct name for the restaurant.  I will tell you that this is the restaurant on the second floor of the Viad tower in Midtown Phoenix.  

What a great find.  This is a nice upscale cafeteria style restaurant.  Everything is Homemade from carved sandwiches to pizza and daily specials.  It was Chicken Enchiladas yesterday.  I had a tossed Cobb Salad that they made and tossed in front of me.  It was great and huge.  I could not finish it.

The prices are very reasonable.  I will be back next time I'm in the neighborhood!
