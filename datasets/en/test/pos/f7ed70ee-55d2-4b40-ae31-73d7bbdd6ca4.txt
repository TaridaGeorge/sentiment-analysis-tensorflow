I hate making appointments for things like getting your eyebrows threaded because it only takes 10 minutes and it's one of those things you just want to get done when you want to get it done.

Conveniently located in Fashion square. it's only $10 for eyebrow threading and if you keep your receipt, it's $2 off the next time! Can't beat it! They do a good job, it's cheap, and hassle-free
