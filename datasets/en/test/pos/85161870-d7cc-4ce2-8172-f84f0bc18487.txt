I've never been a fan of sushi for the 29 years of my life but since I've gone to yellow tail... Sushi is all I want to eat and crave for!!!!  

We ALWAYS get the dragon roll, tootsie,  Louie and my FAVorite.... The New Orleans roll! Omg. TO-die-FOR! 

What's even better (if possible) is the customer service. The bar tenders to the waitress to the sushi chief to the owner..  All greets you as you walk in the door and thanks you before you leave.  I love that. 
Ro... Is our server and she's awesome!!!  Cat also took good care of us before so we like her too! 

Anyway bottom line... I wish I could afford to eat sushi all days of the week. But I will only eat it here cause no one else compares!  BEST SUSHI IN TOWN!!!!!
