I would highly recommend taking your car here.  The staff was very friendly. We were in town for vacation and got our car back quickly and after calling around to check pricing, they were the lowest.  When there was a need they jumped on it immediately and were very responsive.  I even received a follow up call and thank you note.  I have never received such wonderful customer service from a maintenance place including the most high end places such as BMW.  There is definitely a reason they have been in business there so long!!!!
