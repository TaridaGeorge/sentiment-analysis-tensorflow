Whoa, whoa, whoa!!  Pay ATTENTION!  I'm pretty sure that was the best burger I've ever had!  The flavor was fantastic!  

I had the "bacon cheeseburger", which comes as a double, (which is standard, you apparently have to order specifically to get one patty), with fried onions, mushrooms, lettuce and ketchup. OMG!  

So juicy, so flavorful, and a really nice size, too. I didn't get any fries, but they looked good. 

I noticed two interesting signs on the wall, one: "Today's potatoes come from: ID, "Tibbits Farm"", and two: "All our burgers are cooked Juicy and Well Done". 

The restaurant looked nice, 50's style red & white, and very noisy, lots of hustle and bustle, especially with the order-fillers BELLOWING out the order numbers!  

Fun place. My wife was not happy I tried it by myself, so we're going back, tonight!!
