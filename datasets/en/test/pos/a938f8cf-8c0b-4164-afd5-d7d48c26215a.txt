I get really excited about YC's Mongolian BBQ. I love the concept, prices, and how quick it is on a busy night. They also help you choose your sauces which can be rather confusing if you dont know what you are doing. I am a picky eater so it is nice that i get to pick everything that goes into my bowl. Also, you really get a ton of food. 

No complaints, well maybe that there isnt one close to me. 

Check it out!
