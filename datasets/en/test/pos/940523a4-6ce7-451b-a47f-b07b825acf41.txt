This place is amazing. I get 80% of my groceries here. They have the best quality and prices for produce in the area. It's also a lot cheaper to buy nuts and raisins etc in the bulk section! Ever need just a 1/4 cup of dried apricots for a recipe? Well no use in buying a whole package when you can just get what you need! They have a pretty good wine selection too and you can get some fairly inexpensive labels to try. 

Their staff is always friendly and can help you find whatever you need. And for those of us who bring our own bags they give you .10 cents off for each bag. Most other stores I know maybe do .5cents or nothing at all. Go on Wednesdays when their sale flyers overlap and you get to take advantage of two weeks worth of sale items!
