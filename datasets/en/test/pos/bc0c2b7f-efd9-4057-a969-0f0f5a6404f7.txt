Easley's is so fun.  Halloween time at Easley's is a total mad house but still so fun. 

If you ever have a themed party that you need to dress up for, decorate or just "get in the spirit" of whatever (National Pig Day)- this is the place.

They have hundreds- no wait-- THOUSANDS of costumes.  I bought my Afro wig here and all sorts of random stuff.  It's super fun and the prices are decent.

If you are ever bored and want to kill some time, just head to Easley's-- that store can entertain you without even trying.
