Went with friends for Happy Hour Sunday.  We both got the Bob's Big
Burger and split with spouses.  It was absolutely delicious! We were
lucky enough to sit in Cindy's section, and, at her recommendation, got
the Bread Pudding which was the most amazing bread pudding I've ever
had.  She brought out the pastry chef.  Great decor, great service.
We'll be back lots and lots!  Fabulous Happy hour!
