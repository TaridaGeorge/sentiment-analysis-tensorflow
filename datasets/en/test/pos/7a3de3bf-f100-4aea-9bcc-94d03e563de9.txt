Impressive, usually I look for a reason not to give a place that 5th star because i dont want overate anything but I didn't find that reason not too here.

Exceptional experience, I had the empenada as a starter, very tasty(I love empenada's) the entre was the fuego pasta. This was the stand out  to me. An entire pasta dish w/ chicken, chorizo, green peppers, onions etc , layer on top of the softest most delicious tortilla I have ever tasted. You could tear a piece of the tortilla and fill it with pasta and meat. Also had the banana burrito desert and some mojitos. Everything I ate I would recommend
