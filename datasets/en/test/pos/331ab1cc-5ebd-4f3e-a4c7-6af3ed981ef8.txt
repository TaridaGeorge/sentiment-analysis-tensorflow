alright i'm not into resorts, or golf all that much.  but i found this place to be extremely accommodating (real friendly staff).  the room i stayed in for $99 had a king bed, living room, bedroom, jacuzzi, shower, 2 sink bathroom, flat screen monitors, and a patio deck.  parking is a bit of a bitch since anything past the 400 buildings you're walking your ass in the hot arizona heat.  but my buddy got married here so its good in my book.
