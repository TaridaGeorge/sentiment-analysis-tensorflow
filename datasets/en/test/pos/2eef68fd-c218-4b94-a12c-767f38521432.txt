Had to get some teeth pulled and was not real thrilled about being there but the whole staff made it a much better experience than I was expecting. Dr. Spanganberg is excellent and the assistants were all very friendly and funny. They were joking with me the whole time and even remembered me when I went back for a follow up visit. Will refer everyone I know here!
