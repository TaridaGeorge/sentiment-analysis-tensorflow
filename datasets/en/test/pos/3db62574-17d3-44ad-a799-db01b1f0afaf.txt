This place rules. Yes, I grew up in the east. Yes I have had good, wood fired pies before, and this was one of them! The wait time doesn't bother me. I go across the way to the quaint little english bar and have a soup and shoot pool. Great ambiance in that historical little area in downtown PHX. Great place to take a date. I'll never stop going to biancos!
