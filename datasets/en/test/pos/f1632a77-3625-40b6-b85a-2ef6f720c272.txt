I do not understand some of these reviews. I eat out in fine restaurants a lot here and many other cities throughout the US and I LOVE Uncle Sal's. The marinara sauce is one of my favorites...the pork chop is excellent...the short ribs are divine...and the staff are so friendly and helpful. Love it.  If you waited almost an hour at any restaurant without raising hell...I recommend you man up. I would not do that. I highly recommend this restaurant.
