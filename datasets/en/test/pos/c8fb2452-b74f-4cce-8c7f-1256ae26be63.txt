Glenda is amazing and very easy to have a great conversation with. When I first arrived at the salon she offered me a glass of wine! If anyone knows me they know I can not pass up a good glass of wine. She is amazing at what she does and I would recommend everyone to go check her out. Her prices are great, she pays good attention to detail when doing my nails. The best thing I like is it is not like every other nail salon. There isn't a ton of people in the salon, you are just one on one with her so there are no distractions. Glenda is such a sweet lady and I am looking forward to going back to her again. 

Check her out, she is located by the Arrowhead Mall next to Total Wine in the Salon Boutigue!
