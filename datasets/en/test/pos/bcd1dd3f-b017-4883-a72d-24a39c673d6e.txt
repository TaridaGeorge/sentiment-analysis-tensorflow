Great, small, family owned and operated restaurant.  Some days I just don't want to go to a full sit-down restaurant but also don't want to settle for fast-food.  This place fills that void.  They offer typical grilled teppanyaki food cooked to order that you can eat there or take home.  Some of the combo plates can be a bit pricey, but the portions are large.  I went there on a Friday evening and the husband was in the back cooking, the wife taking orders at the counter, and their little daughter was giving high-fives to customers like myself.  I was provided with a sample and conversation while I waited for my food to be ready.  Very friendly folks and great food to-go.
