This is a place to go to feel appreciated and have great coffee or tea. I have not tried their food yet. Many times I go and have a great conversation with someone working there who will offer suggestions or samples. I love it when they do that! They have put a lot of heart and thought into their business and customers. I love that they do a free paperback book exchange.  On certain Friday evenings they are open late and have music.
