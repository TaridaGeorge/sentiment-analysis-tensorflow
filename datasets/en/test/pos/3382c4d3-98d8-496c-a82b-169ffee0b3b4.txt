Any place that serves breakfast past "breakfast time" gets an immediate gold star from me. That being said, one of my favorite breakfast meals is eggs benedict. Imagine my happiness when going there today for the first time to find they had like 4 or 5 different variations of the traditional Benedict. I chose the Eggs Benny Florentine - english muffin topped with sauteed spinach, grilled tomato slices, grilled turkey, poached eggs and a delicious baja sauce. Mmmmm soooo good. I saw about 20 other things on the menu that I would have loved, but this was a real winner. I will definitely be back here again.
