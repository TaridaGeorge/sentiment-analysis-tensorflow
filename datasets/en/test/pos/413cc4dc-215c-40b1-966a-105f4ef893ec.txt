Excellent sushi. Fresh and delicious. The atmosphere is nice too. 

I've been here a couple times and have ordered several different things. My favorites have been the potato spicy tuna roll, veggie tempura, creamy baked lobster roll and the chocolate lava cake with asian green tea ice cream. 

When they are really busy, they tend to forget about you, but if they're not busy, they are usually on top of things (refilling drinks, taking plates away, wiping off the table, etc, etc). 

This place is pretty expensive, but I heard they have happy hour now from 3-6:30pm everyday. Can't wait to go back for it!
