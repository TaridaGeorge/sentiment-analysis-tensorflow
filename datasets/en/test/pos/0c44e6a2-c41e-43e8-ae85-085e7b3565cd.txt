What an amazing lunch deal!  As a vegetarian, I absolutely love this place!  All of the lunch specials are available with meat or tofu, so I don't have to worry about limitations.  The menu is vast, and there are curries and noodle dishes to choose from, in addition to other Thai favorites.  At lunch time, your noodle dish will come with either a salad or soup and a vegetarian egg roll.  All of that for under $5!  It's unbelievably delicious!  My personal favorite is Pad See Ew, and it's served well here, with a healthy amount of flavor and plenty of fresh vegetables.  It's my favorite place for lunch, hands down!
