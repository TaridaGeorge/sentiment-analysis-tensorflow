All the reviews tell it straight! The 'What's a Burrito' was delicious. Ingredients amazingly fresh and succulent.  Very friendly staff and the use Square Up as their cash register ...which means you never have to pull your wallet out. Just smile and state your name then they'll email you your receipt!  

Cartel is another great reason to be downtown
