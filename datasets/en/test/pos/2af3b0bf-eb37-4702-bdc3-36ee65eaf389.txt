Nice!

Cheap, fast, great pizza.  $5 will get you a one topping large, and $9 will snag an extra large.  For the price, you can't beat it.  They'll do pizza right, and deliver it to your door in less than an hour.

I would call this more of a delivery or pick-up place than anything else.  They have only a few tables, so I wouldn't recommend this as a sit down pizza joint unless things are slow--they fill up very quickly.  The floors and walls are concrete or brick, the table and chairs are spartan.  Never mind the furnishings or the decor.  It's all about the pizza here.  Service is great.
