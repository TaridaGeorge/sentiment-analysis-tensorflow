Quality trumps quantity. That's their philosophy regarding menu design, a ballsy move for any restaurant. Fortunately for us, they can back it up with amazing craft! Their sandwiches are top notch, thanks to amazing freshly baked bread and quality ingredients (Soppressata, FTW).

Notes: Outdoor seating with misters only, nothing special; You won't find high fructose corn syrup in their soda selection; Their sister restaurant, Pizza Bianco, is also ridiculously good and nationally recognized.
