Friendly, great food and great attitude.

My boss and a client went to L'Ampore and didn't know what to expect.  What we received was excellent, friendly service and a great meal.  This quaint find was delightful and as we walked away, the words came out of our mouths, "that is the way to run a restaurant"!

The food: Each of us had a something different;  Gnocchi made with pesto (they don't have it on the menu but the owner asked the staff if they could make it fresh.)   Ravioli with sweet Italian sausage and steak.  All were cooked to flavor and perfectly.  

Even the wine was unique... "If you see Kate"... 

What a wonderful place with a great, take care of the customer attitude.  I will be back and I don't live in Phoenix.
