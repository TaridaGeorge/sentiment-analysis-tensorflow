This is peace!  This is quiet! This is letting go of your hectic reality and just relaxing (remember that wonderful feeling).  An alternative to staying in a chain and getting away from airport/city/work-work-work.  Phoenix is less than 45 min away and Tuscon just an hour.  So get the work done, finish those meetings and put your feet up....wi-fi if you must!
Six rooms around a courtyard or one and two bedroom casitas with full kitchens and living areas.  Yes, there's a pool, yes, there's a jacuzzi, yes, you can BBQ.
