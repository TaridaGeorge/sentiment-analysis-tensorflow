I was in Phoenix for work and Sweet Republic came up as a place I had previously bookmarked on Yelp. I walked in and there were a ton of people inside! A very good sign. They have a ton of options, even vegan and gluten free friendly. My friend told one of the owners I was from out of town, who then came over and said hi and thanked me for coming. She also gave me great tips on where to get the best ice cream in other parts of the country! Super friendly. I ordered the dark chocolate and peanut butter ice cream, both delicious. I love that they use the freshest ingredients, it definitely makes a difference compared to other ice cream shops. Highly recommended if you're in the area.
