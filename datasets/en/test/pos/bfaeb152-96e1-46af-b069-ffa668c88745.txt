I went during a weekday so I didn't find the place packed.
I did leave my cart for 5 mins and it was gone by the time i came back. Never ever leave your cart even for a minute folks.

This was my first time here. It's pretty small.  The Last Chance in Miami is twice as large and better I thought. I bought a pair of boots. I really really wanted to buy clothes because I don't know when I'll be back in Phoenix but I couldn't find anything I liked. Oh well. 

I give it a 5 stars because I love a good bargain.
