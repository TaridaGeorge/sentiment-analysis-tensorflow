This place is awesome. It's my new favorite Indian restaurant. My boyfriend and I eat here so much we worry that the owners will think we're stalking them. My favorite new discovery there is the Samosa Chaat. I'm extremely picky about Indian food and am rarely impressed, so for this place to be right in my own neighborhood is a dream come true.
