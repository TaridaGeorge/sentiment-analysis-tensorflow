Don't worry about the fact that this is in a strip mall, or the Chinatown decor, sit down, preferably near the window & get ready for the show.  I ordered pan fried pot stickers, which were easily the best I've ever had.  Then the fresh mango juice, best I've had since I lived in Brazil & cut the mangoes off the tree.  The spicy pan fried noodles with beef (#34) were flat out incredible.  

With prices that are pretty close to what they charge at Panda Express, the food is easily ten times better.  The noodles are scratch made, fresh for every order, and you can watch them slapping & pulling the noodles through the window if you have the right seat.  Go here, even if you order ahead & take it to go.  You won't regret it!
