Wow. What can I say? One night after work I was driving home and I was so hungry I stopped at Burger King. Jesus Christ this stuff is awesome. Flemings, City Hall, Mortons are all childs play compared to Burger King. The Apollo Missions, The Pyramids are not mans finest achievement but in fact it is the #1 Without Pickles. I went through drive through and ate my entire meal while sitting in my driveway without my wife knowing. I should have probably called her to ask if she wanted anything, after all she did mother my child but I am just so selfish when it comes to my fast food burger I couldn't help myself. Long Live My Beard
