Fantastic crepes, strong Americanos, and overall great experience. The location is a small house next to Lost Leaf. While the coffee is great, the five stars are for the crepes! I always get the Nutella, banana crepe with whipped cream. While it might not be the greatest for a diet, it was well worth it!!
