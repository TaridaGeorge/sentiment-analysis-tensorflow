I went to this restaurant about a month ago with my fiance and was very pleased. I am GFCF and have a few other miscellaneous food intolerances and the staff were very knowledgeable and helpful. The food was very good AND healthy. My fiance who is not GFCF really enjoyed his food, so don't let the allergen-avoidance culture if you don't need to eat that way.. I'm sure you'll find something you like on the menu!
