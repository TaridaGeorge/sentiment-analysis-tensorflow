I'm so glad after going to so many terrible restaurants recently that Tarbell is not just hype!

The portions are pretty tiny.. but every bite I tried of every dish was pretty much Italian as good as it gets.  I had the ribbon pasta with sausage and spinach.  Also tried the bolognese.  Also tried the chicken.  The bread pudding I wasn't a huge fan of.  

I can't wait to come back - definitely a special occasion restaurant of choice for people who appreciate good food!
