Passing through Scottsdale, arrived at my hotel room and discovered I have left my pipe tobacco at home. I yelped tobacco shop and boy was I in for a treat. Mike was not only knowledgeable, he open the doors to his store and made me feel at home. I ended up chatting with some of the customers, and enjoying two free bowls of my choice. THANKS MIKE!  I purchased a pipe and a variety of tobacco to take back to Frisco.

Highly Recommend Justin's Blend
