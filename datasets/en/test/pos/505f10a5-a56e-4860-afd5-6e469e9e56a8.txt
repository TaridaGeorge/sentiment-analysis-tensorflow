This is definitely one of my favorite spots to spend a lazy Saturday or Sunday afternoon. And especially it's right next to Pane Bianco!

Lux has a very cozy deco, nice atmosphere, regular tables for who come with laptops, and comfy couches for who just want to relax and enjoy the day. And did I mention free Wi-Fi?! 

I enjoy my coffee to the strong side, and Lux definitely brings that natural flavor to every single cup. I always order the Hazelnut Latte (hot), it's my fav! The presentation is very pretty , just like the picture, the barista always draws the leave pattern with the form. The coffee taste is very bold, with a light hazelnut flavor, delicious! (if you're comparing the sweetness level with Starbucks, this is no where close to that sweet!)
