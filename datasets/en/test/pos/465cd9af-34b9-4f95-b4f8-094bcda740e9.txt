If you have a kid, you are going to need their services so I called a few places if they carried face painting supplies and they said no. Finally I called Arizona Fun Services and sure enough they said yes. When I got there they had tons of selections for face painting supplies. The lady patiently explained all the different options and price structures. We did end up getting a high quality but reasonably priced item and it has worked out great. 
They are really easy to find. Just take the exit on to broadway west off of 101 and they are on the right hand side. 
They carry costumes year round and also for little ones. I will be going back their for lil'un's halloween costume this year.
