I love this place. I'm not sure if it's the solid selection of cigars, the patrons that you can chat with for hours, or the fact that Virgil is awesome, but it's my favorite place on Mill to hang out with friends. 

There's nothing better than nice weather, a patio, awesome new & old friends, and a delicious cigar. 

My only wish is that they carried pipe tobacco since I'm a pipe smoker.
