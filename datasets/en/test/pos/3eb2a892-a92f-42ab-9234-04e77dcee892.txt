I never get bored of their spaghetti a la capri. I love the spaghetti here and also white wine. Another thing I love here is their bread and salad. I always go to Pino whenever we think about pasta and pizza.

We found the BEST antipasto in town, like our waiter told us. This is a special menu and I would like to know when they will have it again.

I never have any problems with paying for dinner. I use my credit card.
