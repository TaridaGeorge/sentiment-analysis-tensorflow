Who hasn't written a review on this place?  What's another 5 star review going to prove? LOL

Anyway, everything on here is true.  The bruschettas are simply heavenly.  It's as simple as that.  When you combine locally baked breads, with the best toppings around, you just can't go wrong.  The bruschetta and bottle of wine special can't get any better.  Their soups and cheese platters are yummy too.

Beware, parking stinks but they do offer complimentary valet during limited hours.
