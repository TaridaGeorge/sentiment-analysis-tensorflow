This place is fantastic! Its a small family run place that specializes in chicken tenders and that's about it, but what they lack in menu diversity they make up in quality.  Either in a salad, on a sandwich made from buttery Texas toast, or just on a plate alone the chicken tenders are moist and extremely delicious. They are never frozen, chicken breasts, lightly battered and made when you order them. Along with the tenders you get to choose from 8 different sauces. You get your typical ranch, buffalo, and mustard dipping sauces. But its their special sauce stands out as the best compliment to their chicken. Because its family owned it can be a bit pricey, at about $10 for a regular plate and drink, but the pleasant service, great food, and casual laid back atmosphere make up for it.
