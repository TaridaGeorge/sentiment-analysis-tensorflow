We had Brunch at the Biltmore's "Wrights" last weekend. A very interesting concept that offers both buffet and plated brunch fare. The buffet is all cold with wonderful selections like shrimp, king crab, sushi, and salmon caviar. The desserts were good and selection plentiful. Buffet is $30.
  For an additional $4 to $9 you can have a plated hot meal. Hard to pass this up, we got the pork sandwich topped with poached egg. Jeff,  the steak and eggs. Both were amazing! Had we not been on vacation, there would be plenty to take home! 
  Beautiful setting and first class service. Wasn't sure why it wasn't packed, perhaps the season is not yet in full swing. 
  I feel bad for the McArthur, architect of record, loads of F.L. Wright accolades for a man who only consulted on the building.
