Here is the breakdown. Fresh squeezed oj and goose, the salmon , and the filet! This is all you need. The sides are awesome too. I'm not going to say I have never had a crappy server here, but that happens anywhere at times. I will give 5 stars for the quality of the food and the reasonable pricing.
