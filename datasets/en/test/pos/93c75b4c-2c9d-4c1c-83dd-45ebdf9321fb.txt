Had the Omakase at the instruction of my waiter, since it was my first visit and I have to say that it was a brilliant choice!  I had just had the omakase at Nobu in Honolulu about two weeks prior to my visit to Roka and I still cannot believe that without a doubt I had a better meal with better sashimi at Roka in Scottsdale.  The Toro served with Himalayan rock salt was one of the best things that have ever tasted!  Highly recommend ordering the Omakase!
