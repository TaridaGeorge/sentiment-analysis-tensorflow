This place is awesome! 

I used to have a 2005 G35 and they took great care of it!  They know these cars so well because they all drive similar vehicles.  

Pricing is spot on as well.  

I have not run in to any problems with my new vehicle, but if I do, 350z Motorsports will be the ones to service it.
