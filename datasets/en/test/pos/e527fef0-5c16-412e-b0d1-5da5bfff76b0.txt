BEST CANOLIS & PIZZA & everything else!!! I'm from New Jersey so I know good Italian and this place is sooo good. The owner is so nice and personable and gives this place the personality a real Italian place needs! When I first came I thought it would be just another "Slices" type pizza place and boy was I wrong, my boyfriend and I have ordered 30 canolis in the past 2days! So fresh and yummy! Don't let this places location and exterior fool you like it did me, Vincent's is authentic fresh and delicious Italian food! So happy I found it!
