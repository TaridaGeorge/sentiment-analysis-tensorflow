I'd give it more than 5 stars if I could.  This place is a bit out of the way for us, but we love it so much it's worth the drive.  The food is scrumptious - the best Middle Eastern in town!   I especially love their falafel sandwich and tabouli.  The fresh baked pita bread and zatar bread are incredible!  We always end up bringing home some groceries as well.  And the owner is so very nice.  Highly recommended!
