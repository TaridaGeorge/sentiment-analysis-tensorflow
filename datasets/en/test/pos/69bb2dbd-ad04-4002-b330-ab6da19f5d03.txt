This has been our go to place for birthdays, and events for several years. It has always been a great experience. This is one of the few higher priced restaurants that IS worth the money. They do great specials all the time. Love the $5 happy hour  menu. Try them all. There is something for everyone.  LOTS of wine selections. Do not expect HEAPING plates. The portions are smaller, but I have never left even a little hungry. 

I love the Poke salad. They made the best BBQ ribs I have ever had anyplace. I did actually lick the plate because it was SO good. The sushi rolls are good sized. The pulled pork is tangy, but not to sweet. All of the fish is wonderful. You will want to came back and try it all.  

This is a must try place if you want to impress a date.
