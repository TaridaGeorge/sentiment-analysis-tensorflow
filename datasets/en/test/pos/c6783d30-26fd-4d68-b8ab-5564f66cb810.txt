This is one of my favorite places in the valley to eat. Hands down some of the best Korean BBQ anywhere and I have traveled all over and had lots. Their sides are amazing and they are very very generous with them. I would recommend the short ribs marinated as my personal fav. Remember if you get a meat not marinated first that is what you are getting just plain meat. Everything is good and the services is great and if you come back they will remember you.
