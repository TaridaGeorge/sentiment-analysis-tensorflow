My review of the Side Door is way overdue. This is my go-to neighborhood spot when I feel like a sandwich and a beer. Or just a sandwich. Or just a beer. The Side Door shares a kitchen with Uncle Sal's, so you know the food is going to be solid. 
They have a great Mediterranean chicken sandwich, Stella, Peroni, 1554 and root beer on draft, and even have ice cream.
Equally equipped for dinner or lunch, as their wine selection is fairly extensive too.
