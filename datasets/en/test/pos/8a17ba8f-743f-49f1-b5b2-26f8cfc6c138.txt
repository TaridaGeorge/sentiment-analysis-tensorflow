I did a stay-cation over labor day here and absolutely loved it. Fairly priced (when I went) and such a great facility. I enjoyed the pools (water slides, adult area, volleyball, and beach) as well as the gondola rides with an gondolier singing to us on the back. Every aspect was wonderful.

The rooms were awesome. They actually inspired me with a few ideas that I may bring into my own home someday. The staff knows when to give your privacy and when to help you out - they are very friendly.
