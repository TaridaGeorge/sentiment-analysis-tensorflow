OMG!!!!!!!!!  I CRAVE boba.  Whenever I go visit my sister in the OC, we go everyday.  I have been looking for one since my last visit, Thanksgiving.
I walked into Eba and found...HOME!  I was so excited I nearly peed my pants!
They have a huge selection of drinks...tea, iced tea, milk and tea, etc.  You can choose either green or black tea.  Then, there is a wide range of "chewies" to add.  I, of course, go the boba.  I think I said "boba" at least a dozen times in there.  The entire time I am there, I'm on the phone with my sister, asking her what I order out there.
So, I ordered two of the biggest chocolate-black tea-and-milk boba.
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
I am playing Powerball today.  This has to be a good sign!
