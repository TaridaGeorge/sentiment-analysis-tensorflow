I can't really think of a metaphor that will really describe this place. My heart is really overwhelmed by the great service that I just had. This restaurant has a lot to offer, whether celebrating an event or not. They have a wide selection of wine and cheese and a unique and eclectic menu. They are here to delight all sorts of palate!
