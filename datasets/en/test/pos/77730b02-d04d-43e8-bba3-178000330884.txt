Despite the phone sex operator voice and a general tiredness from my days shopping with the huzzbend, I put on a good face and went to Fez.

Thank god I did.

Thomas was a fabulous host, the food was phenomenal, the wine was great and ever flowing, service was perfect, and the company was great. It was better than an intimate dinner party at my best friend's house, and I love her lots. Best part of it was peeking at the menu and deciding what I want next time I come.
