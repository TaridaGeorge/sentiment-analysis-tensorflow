Ahh...I love this place....such a great place to shop for cheap manga....
this is were i buy most of my series...such as Negima or Bleach...
The scent of tear-and-wear paper is in the air...such a delightful aroma to a cheap bookworm as myself...because i know i can afford the books...
The manga and books are half-off their original retail price, which is a really good deal. They also sell magazines,video games,dvds, anime, cds, soundtracks,action figures,plushies,and other collectibles that are located in the back of the store. I always come here every time i have cash in hand...and off i go! So all you need is about twenty bucks and you can buy yourself a smorgasbord of books or items...
