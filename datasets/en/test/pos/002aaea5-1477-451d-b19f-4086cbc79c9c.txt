I LOVE this place! Great food, and GREAT service! I Have been here probably a dozen times, the food is always fresh and amazing, and the service is over the top. I have never had to wait longer then 10 minutes for a table! Great for a date, brunch with friends, and breakfast with family! 

If you haven't tried this place, definitely worth your time to stop by when you can!
