I met the "gang" at Brio in SanTan after both the manager and chef took the time to visit our establishment.  I thought that was super-cool.

There was 8 of us for dinner and we all ordered a different meal and there were NO complaints.  The restaurant is beautiful, the service was great and the meals were delicious.

We all agreed that we will be back to Brio.
