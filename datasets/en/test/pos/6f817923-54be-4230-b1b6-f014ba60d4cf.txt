My daughter and I got a recommendation from our nail tech at Scottsdale nails. WE LOVE VIETNAMESE FOOD and I was so glad to find this place. It is as good as what I used to get in Oakland, CA. The location is a little strange but once you are inside the interior is nice and tranquil and the service is very friendly. We enjoyed our noodle soup and spring rolls and we will be back for more!
