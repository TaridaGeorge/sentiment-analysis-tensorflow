Urban Cookies - I love you.  Ollie Cakes - I REALLY love YOU! 

I am a girl with a massive sweet-tooth.  There is nothing better sounding to me that a shop that sells nothing other than cookies and cupcakes (well, and drinks, of course).  Most cupcakeries are a huge disappointment to me - overpriced and underwhelming.  Ollie Cakes, on the other hand, are scrumptious! They are reasonably priced (so I never feel bad when I get 2...), and seriously the most delicious in town.  I especially love the carrot cake flavor.  Mmmm. 

Must go back.  Daily.  Hmm... maybe that would be bad for me?
