Just writing a quick one to say, "Stop taking down a restaurant that just opened with nit picky and whiny reviews."  Rice Paper does a good job of serving Vietnamese favorites in a fun, hip environment. 

The thing that is 5 stars about this place is that they serve quality sandwiches.  Theirs are better than all of the other (like 3) that I've tried in Phoenix.  Celebrate the Bahn Mi, the best sandwich in the world.
