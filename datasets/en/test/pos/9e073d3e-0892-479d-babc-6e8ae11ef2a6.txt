Ordered A Sedona Suede dashmat online. The texture of this fabric is very nice...Looks great in my Dodge Charger SRT8. The custome lettering is what I expected..Laura was very helpful as well..nice girl with lots of patience..only small issue was the sensor was not cut out. I was able to take care of it easily though....The dashmat fit every vent and corner perfectly I mean perfect....I am very pleased with the product..and would recomend Dash Designs. Installed in 5 minutes...Thank you everyone that helped me with my logo's and lettering...
