I went to Southwest Urgent Care the first time on a Saturday morning... a 5 minute wait is all I met.  The second time I went there on a Thursday at 5 and it was only 10 minutes. 

The two doctors I had there  were Dr. Laney and Dr. Hochuli and both of them were friendly and knowledgeable and they showed that they really cared for me.

In the future I would go there in a heartbeat.
