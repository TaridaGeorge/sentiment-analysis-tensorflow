I have to disagree with Omer, as in any trendy high demand restraunt--you may sometimes get missed. This does not happen on a usual basis here though. I find this place great for a little unwind with friends. Used to have Anime playing in the bar area and funny writing tablets to practice your Kanji Skills--LOL. Sushi isn't bad, I recommend the Sashimi rather and try the udon noodles served in a large brazen pot. I definetely give this place props for food and atmosphere. Again this is AZ be wary of the weather, The patio can be cold in winter and hot in summer. Best times to go are during the week around 8 or 9
