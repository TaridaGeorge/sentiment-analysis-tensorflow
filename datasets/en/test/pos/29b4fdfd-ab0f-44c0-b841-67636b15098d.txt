Okay, after having several root canal procedures; my latest experience would be very trying...Went to see my dentist at Open Wide Dental; Dr. Durisek suggested I see a specialist for 2 of my teeth that needed to be "retreated" or root canals done again...AARGH; he referred me to Dr. Kevin Axx at Valley Endodontic; and it made me smile.  Dr. Axx & staff were great and they even followed up 2 days later to see how I was doing.  Just wish they had the massage chairs like Open Wide Dental...
