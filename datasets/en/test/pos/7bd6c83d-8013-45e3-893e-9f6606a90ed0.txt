Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous.  M brought be here for bfast one morning after he had his O experience with their humongous burritos.  I ordered the chorizo, potato, egg burrito and added cheese.  You can ask for a whole wheat tortilla as well.  M had the bacon, egg, cheese burrito and they chopped up the bacon, not like some places that use 2 long flimsy half cooked bacon strips in their burritos.  Plus our burritos were under $4 each!
You order at the counter in the front and listen for your number.  The place was simple, self serve drinks/ coffee.  There were enough tables, booths, plus some outdoor seating to accommodate the morning crowd.  
Next time, we will share a burrito.
