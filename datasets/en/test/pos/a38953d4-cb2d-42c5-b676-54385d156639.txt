We walked in at 9:45pm and they close at 10pm. The owners were so kind and accommodating. 
We had an order of the garlic naan. It was the perfect mix of chewy and crunchy. 
We decided to split an order of the chicken tikka masala with a side of rice. It was wonderful! The spice was just right and the flavor was perfect. I have been thinking about it ever since. 
When we were finished we had a great chat with the owners and they brought us some honey balls. They were served cold and finished the meal perfectly. 

Who wants to meet me there now? I'm hungry.
