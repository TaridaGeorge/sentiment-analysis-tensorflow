Incredible menu and every bite was delicious. The pork belly Rueben appetizer was phenomenal.  Our group of 10 included a 9 year old who was head over heels for the "really fun" fondue - it kept her busy while the adults could enjoy a glass of wine and their meals. Don't hesitate to take a well behaved older child, but not a place for toddlers.
