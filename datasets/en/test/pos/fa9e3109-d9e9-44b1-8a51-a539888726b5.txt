Tastiest food of our week in greater Phoenix.  We ordered the Indian Taco, the Red Chili Indian Taco and the UFO kids meal, with fun shaped little frybread pieces and beans and cheese.  The food was really simple and exceedingly delicious. 

The vibe in the place was cool too.  Lots of local folks were there - people who know from good.  While it didn't look like much from the outside, The Fry Bread House was clean and the staff was really friendly. Open since 1992, we're already hooked after one visit.

We had a nice time, we loved the fry bread tacos, and we can't wait to go back during our next trip to Phoenix.  Highly recommend.
