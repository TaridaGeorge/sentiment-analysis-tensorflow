This was the first Teavana store I ever went to, and what I have learned about myself since then is that I am truly now a Teavana snob. I can't even really look at other teas, they just pale in comparison! Right now I'm lusting after the Strawberry Misaki Blooming Tea, but I digress. The staff here is so helpful, they assisted me in finding the perfect morning blend which was a slight deviation of a blend I found on the Teavana blog. It is so delicious, a mix of My Morning Mate and Tiramisu Treviso Rooibos Tea. I highly recommend this especially if you enjoy sweetened coffees with the German rock sugar it is excellent. I would have never found some of my other favorite combos without the staff help from this store. They seriously deserve a raise for spending so much time with their customers.
