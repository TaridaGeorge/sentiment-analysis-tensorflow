So the pup hit the one year mark and had to go in for his shots and a well check. The doctor we had been seeing has since moved away, so I was pretty bummed....Until we met Dr. Svoboda!!!! 

HE RULES!!!! He was so good with Ladmo and answered all our questions! 

I am so thankful I found Palm Glen, the staff is always so excited to see Ladmo and they are all so friendly. Keep it up!
