In a few words BEST PERUVIAN FOOD IN THE VALLEY!!
Born and raised in Lima, Peru i give this restaurant 5 stars since its simply the closest you will get to Peruvian food flavors. Their ceviche its outstanding and the Aji de Gallina delicious, those are my favorite peruvian dishes. My husband has been in Peru only once and fell in love with Peruvian food, we have been to other peruvian restaurants in Mesa and Chandler and he definitely said the food here is the closest you'll get to peruvian food. Their prices are not too bad and the attention made us feel like home. As im writing this im already craving some ceviche hahaha.... I definitely recommend it to my friends.
