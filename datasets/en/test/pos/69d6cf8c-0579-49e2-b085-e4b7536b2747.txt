This is the hottest new spot in Scottsdale. Its very chill which is just what old town was needing. They have great music and very nice staff. The best parts are the big wheel patrons can spin and the beer bongs! My only complaint is with security. The doorman seemed to be overwhelmed and it was frustrating getting in, yes I know its part of Scottsdale holding a line and all that, but this guy didn't have a clue what was going on. They really need to get some pros in there to take control.
