Fabulous menu great friendly service and amazing food !!!! Wish they had one of these in Tucson. Thankfully we make it here a few times a year :-) thanks for another amazing meal love the additions. Had the spinach wraps with slaw and hubby had the steak wraps. Oh also a cool trendy drink touchscreen fountain. I know I'm easily amused. Anther cool thing is the awesome art on the walls from the children's hospital.
