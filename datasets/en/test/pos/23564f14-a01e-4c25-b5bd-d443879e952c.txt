I called this hotel from Denver after being advised that my airline was going to dump me off in Phoenix for the night because a flight was late and they weren't going to hold my connecting flight.
The super nice lady gave me a room for $50 (about half price) and had a shuttle pick me up when I arrived at the airport in the middle of night around 1am. 
With Hampton Inn, it's always a clean, comfortable room, with the most comfortable beds at almost any price.
The next morning, they took me to the airport after feeding me a big, hot meal of eggs, waffles, etc. Hampton Inn saves the day again.
