I came to Sonoma to see the Mystery Mansion show on a Saturday night and was very impressed!! The  dinner theater was the best I had ever seen, the charactors were hilarious and the audience involvement made the show. 

I don't want to give too much away but the show is a must see if you live in Phoenix, its great for the whole family and I plan to come back for my next birthday instead of the same old dinner thing.
