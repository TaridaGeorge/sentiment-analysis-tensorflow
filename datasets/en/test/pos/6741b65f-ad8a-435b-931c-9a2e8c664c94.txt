Yet another great experience.......though all credit must be given to Yelp....otherwise would never find some of these places.

Can recommend the following:

Warm Sonoma Goat Cheese Salad with fresh Raspberries - organically grown baby lettuce , goat cheese medallions, jicama, carrots, fresh raspberries and candied pecans with their home made raspberry vinaigrette....the pecans are truly delicious!

Short Rib Quesadilla - A special of the day.....very delicious.

Home made lemonade - very refreshing

On the way out the smell of coffee and the view of the double chocolate cookies was too much so ordered to go......very, very good coffee and the cookie tasted like a chocolate brownie.....very moist and absolutely mouth watering......

There are many choices for seating....front patio, side patio, back patio and of course inside...all seating options have a great cozy feel....doubt you could pick a bad spot.

Staff are also awesome.
