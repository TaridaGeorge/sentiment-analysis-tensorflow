I love, love, love this place!  I don't know if it's a good thing or bad thing that I live so close to one of these. 

When I first walked into Total Wine, I was in awe. There were so many types of liquor, I could not even believe my eyes. 

Whether you are a wine lover or enjoy liquor this place is great for anybody looking to kick back and have a few drinks.

Total Wine has amazingly low prices, even better than Wal-Mart and they a HUGE selection. They also have my favorite Vodka here, which is usually very, very hard for me to find. Total Wine even has hard-to-find sodas that I haven't been able to find for years! 

With the huge selection of liquor, this place keeps me coming back!
