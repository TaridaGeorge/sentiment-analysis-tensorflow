I had a morning meeting at Solo this morning. The atmosphere was great, very casual and eclectic. The coffee was also very good and they serve it up in GIANT glasses. I can put down my fair share of coffee, almost always require a refill, but this time I think it outlasted me!

I definitely recommend to anybody in the neighborhood to pay a visit to Solo.
