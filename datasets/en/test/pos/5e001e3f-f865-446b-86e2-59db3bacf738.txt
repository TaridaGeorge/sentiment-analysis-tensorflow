I absolutely love Tott's. On average I eat there once a week and I have yet to have a bad experience. The food is great, the building is clean and inviting, and the staff is very friendly.  What is more, Tott's offer student and military discounts; they even employ a ginger! Humanitarianism like that really plucks my liberal heartstrings?  Judging by the crowd that always seems to be there, and indeed, the reviews here; it appears I'm not the only southern Tempe local to have discovered this gem. If you find yourself craving Asian food in Tempe, you would be wise to skip the Pei Wei located in the same lot, and try Tott's. 

Besides, everyone knows Pei Wei is a relationship killer.
