Easily one of my favorite places in urban Phoenix. I am a member and we go often. What is there not to like? Its unique. It changes. There are events by a bundle. Even food is semi OK, for such place. 

Go there! No i mean it. Go! Stroll through major "Roads", venture to some smaller once, talk to those nice elderly (For the most part) volunteers who will teach you about surviving on Prickly Pears or how Succulent is different from a Cactus.

Do not liter, run around or yell like an idiot, please. Besides that - HAVE FUN! This place is awesome. 

"I like"
"Very nice"
