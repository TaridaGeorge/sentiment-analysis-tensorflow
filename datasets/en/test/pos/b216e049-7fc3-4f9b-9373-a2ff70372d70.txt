I came here with a group of girls for my bachelorette party, it was awesome! We were seated promptly right in front of the live band ( party crashers) The band was great and the lead singer did a couple shout outs to me and my girls. The restaurant provided us with a complimentary bottle of champagne which I thought was very thoughtful and amazing. This was the first time I had ever been there and all of the staff was very friendly the bartenders were fast with drink orders and always seemed to be smiling which is a breath of fresh air for sure. I was amazed at the quality of service from this place all without even making a reservation!!
