I have been going to Dr. Patel for almost a year and everyone at this doctor office has been so nice and helpful. I feel very comfortable and confident when I visit because I know I'll get the answers that I'm looking for and the treatment I need. Another thing I really enjoy is that they are willing to get me an appointment same day if needed. :)
