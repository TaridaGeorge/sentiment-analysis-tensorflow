I have been coming here since High School and I graduated in the early 90's.  Amin, the owner is great and remembers his customers by name.  Di Vito's is so consistent even on Monday night when Amin is not making the pies himself.  Great quick friendly delivery and they have such a great Pizza.  All the deserts are homemade and they have one of the best Greek salads around and very inexpensive.   For a neighborhood pizza that has great delivery I have to give 5 stars.
