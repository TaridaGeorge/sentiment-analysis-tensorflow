I absolutely love the food here!  The sushi and Walnut Shrimp are cravings that I must give in to.  This is a nice, small restaurant that is exceptionally clean and comfortable. Good for a casual date, lunch any day (their specials are a great deal), and the owner managers are on site most hours they are open. 
You have to try the Walnut Shrimp!
