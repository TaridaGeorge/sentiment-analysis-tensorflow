I've been here many times and always have a good experience. The food is amazing! Kimchi and bulgogi are fresh and highly recommended. The best part, besides the food, is the owner H.S. Every time we go, the soju flows like water and HS has stories for days! Dude is freaking HILARIOUS! Great location and a fun place for dinner and drinks.
