This may not be the most expensive resort in Phoenix, but I think it is my favorite!  It has more charm and personality than the larger, more well known corporate resorts.  This is the best value for your $ in the Phoenix Valley!

The service was phenomenal and the food at all the restaurants and thru room service is great.  There are plenty of activities for children, and opportunities for quiet romance too.  

Some of the rooms have a microwave and small fridge, but I believe most do not.  Last year I stayed in a room that did.  This year I was in the Oasis area which was lovely.  We had a large terrace overlooking the pool with a beautiful large soaking tub in bathroom.

The Wigwam continues to be my favorite staycation resort!
