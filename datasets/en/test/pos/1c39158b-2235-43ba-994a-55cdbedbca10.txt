If I like a restaurant, I make it popular. I have the habit of dragging all my friends to the places I like.This my mission with Fresh mint. As I have no friends in Scottsdale, I need help from fellow yelpers This place is real good!!

 If you go to Fresh mint, make sure you try the fried rice in a clay pot...it stay hot for the whole time you eat it....tastes YUM!! Their fresh rolls are to die for... to top it all off, the service is just out of the world! Go there and I am sure you won't be disappointed.
