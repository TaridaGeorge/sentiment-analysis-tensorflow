OF COURSE five stars for the Phoenix Suns! I'm psyched I can Yelp about them! Born and raised in Arizona I was taught to support the suns from a young age. I always had fun going to the games when I was young, and I still do! Going to a game is great way to have fun, and I guarantee the suns put on a great game weather they win or lose. Obviously I'm disappointed about our recent loss, but they are still an awesome team! The games as I mentioned are really really fun, and the ticket costs are not to jacked up! As far as Arizona goes The Phoenix Suns are definitely the best team in the state hands down!
