An oasis in the midst of a busy city . . . I'm not sure how I first heard of this park but I'm glad I was in the area with my family and made a point to stop.

Giant pond where people sit and fish, read a book or simply meditate.

There are guided tours for birds and nature walks.

My son and I had a great time biking around the path that went around the pond.

Beautifully landscaped, a super way to enjoy an relaxing Sunday afternoon or anytime during the week if you are in the area!
