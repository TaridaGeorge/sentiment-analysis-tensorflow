The prices are so good in this place, you feel like plowing over all the slow-zombie shoppers and loading your cart with everything you can grab! 

Secretly, I want to push the "Closet Hoarders" out of my way...there are a lot of them who shop here and they grab the "good stuff". I think there are Amazon Sellers too, sometimes you'll see them scanning ISBN bar codes with their little hand held PDAs...it's interesting to observe who shops here.

This place is cleaner and more organized than any Ross or TJ Maxx that I have ever been in...there were plenty of employees everywhere stocking the shelves with MORE treasures!!! Did I mention the AWESOME prices???

Books, toys, DVDs, clothing, random stuff that I don't really need...cheaper than Goodwill...and the folks here were pretty friendly. No wonder the parking lot was very full on a Friday afternoon....
