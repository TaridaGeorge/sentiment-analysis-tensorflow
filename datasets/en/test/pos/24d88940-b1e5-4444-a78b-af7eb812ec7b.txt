Small selection of various types of Italian ices which is made daily and exact selection changes daily. Tried sugar free chocolate, so superb that the bf and I could not tell the difference! Swedish Fish was like the candy, Smores was both phenomenal and memorable, and Mango was delicious. Staff was friendly, prompt, accomodating. One of my favorite things about PA and DE, nice to finally have it in AZ too.
