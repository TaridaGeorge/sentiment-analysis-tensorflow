Cheap and great.  

I got two of my kitties neutered here through a program called "Cat Nip and Tuck"... it was incredibly cheap to fix them.

I also got one of those kitties his shots here too and it was cheap!!!!  I was so excited that all I believe I had to pay overall for the shots were $48 for all of it, even with the follow up booster shots.

They do declaws there too.  I like to go with the laser procedure, not the standard which I believe that's what they do there, so I go to my vet on 35th and Bell for the Laser which is more humane for declaws.
