I went on this tour in November, 2012, and things have changed since some of the earlier reviews. You meet a guide at the mine on Saturday mornings at either 8-8:30 am (summer hours) or 10-10:30 am (winter hours, which were in place in November). For some reason, the website (http://www.jpc-training.com/pg06.htm) lists just summer hours...

Our guide was a young engineer named Tracy who also works at the site. She was extremely knowledgeable about mining practices as well as about the history of the place. You view the old buildings and learn about how gold was extracted and what life was like during the heyday of the mine. Really interesting.

The tour is outside in the direct sun. Bring a hat or umbrella, sunscreen, and water. There is a small gift shop, but the experience is the main draw here. Highly recommended.
