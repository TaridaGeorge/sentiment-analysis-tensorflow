Each team member at Hillside Unleashed is top-notch.  You can't find a better group of people to work with and care for your dogs.  Our 4 dogs ended up spending  22 days with them.  As much as we missed them the staff of Unleashed kept us updated.  We knew they had the best possible care and they were having fun each day!  Our minds were at ease and we were able to concentrate on moving to our new home.
