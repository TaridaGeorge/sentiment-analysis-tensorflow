I have never been to such a wonderful, Tea House. This was the best ever. I`m a Tea lover and have been looking for a place that had Green Tea Pearls, I have been looking and trying teas all over Mesa Az.. I have found the place to get all me Tea needs, and it is wonderful, and These woman are friendly and helpful. I have found my Tea room, and I will tell all my friends about this wonderful place. A little pricey, but well worth it.
