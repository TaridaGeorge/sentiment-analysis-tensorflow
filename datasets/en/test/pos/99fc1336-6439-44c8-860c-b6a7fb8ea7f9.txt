I'm a transplanted NYer who was raised on pizza by the slice cut in wedges from a round pie. My first visit to Little Sicily started out to be a disappointment until my pizza was delivered to the table. I had wanted a slice and a Coke but the owner (Dominick) doesn't do slices. He and I spent the next 20 minutes discussing the merits and drawbacks of Chicago vs. NY pizza while my pie was baking. I learned a bit about pizza, sampled some Italian beef (delicous) and went home with my pizza cut into squares. The pizza was outstanding and I have to say it beats NY pizza hands down without the aggravation of excess olive oil running down your sleeve. I'm a convert! BYOB with a small corkage fee. Give it a shot!
