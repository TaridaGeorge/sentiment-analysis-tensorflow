We went to eat here last night and it was so delicious. My boyfriend had read the reviews and decided that this was the appropriate location for some good eats, and was it ever. I had the rib tips, he had the pulled pork. Both meats were hefty portions and down right the best rib tips I've had since living in Texas. 
The mac and cheese is the real deal and oh so good. Green beans were peppery goodness and the fried okra lived up to all the previous reviews. 
The service was fantastic and made us feel right at home. I give this place two very enthusiastic thumbs up.
