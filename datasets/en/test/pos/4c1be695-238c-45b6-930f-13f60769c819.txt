They were very easy to work with scheduling an appt. 
Kevin was very punctual! 
Kevin was personable and efficiently dispatched our bee issue. 
Was very pleased that there weren't any surprise charges added after he was onsite...the quote given over the phone was the price I paid.
Would recommend and use again next bee season!
