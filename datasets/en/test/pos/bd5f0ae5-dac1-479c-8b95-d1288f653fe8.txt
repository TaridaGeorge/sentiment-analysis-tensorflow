We went to Frashers while in Scottsdale on business and were first greeted by the lovely smell of smoked meats which is always a good sign.  We had happy hour on the patio, and all of the apps were great.  What really racked up the stars for this place was the service.  Our waitress Casey, is hands down the best server I have ever seen. She was personable, polite, and very good at her job.  We were all astounded but how great the service is here. Nice to find a place with good food and good staff.
