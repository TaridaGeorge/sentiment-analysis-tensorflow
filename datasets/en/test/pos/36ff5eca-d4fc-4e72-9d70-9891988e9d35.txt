Bar none, one of the best sandwiches I've ever had.  Love the Dilly Club.  Portions are HUGE, almost enough for two, and the homemade bread is as good as it gets.

I've been bringing people from the office here, and they all unanimously agree that Dilly's has the best sandwiches they have ever had, no matter where they are from.

Its a little pricey for a sandwich shop- most combos are just under $10.00, with a drink and a side, which seems a bit steep, but oh so worth it!

Once you go Dilly's, you'll never go back to Subway!
