Very good place, the room service sooo nice. The first time I Went to Arizona, it is much more dry and dusty than LA, but after I arrived this hotel, I was so surprised that the hotel like a small park, so many green plants, and a golf course ! And another thing is they have a big bathroom , a big coffee table in the balcony, all of this is my favor .the only thing is the food not as amazing as the room :) probably I am too picky,
