My date and I attended the IB Anderson's Nutcracker last night.  I hadn't seen the Nutcracker since I was a little ballerina girl.  It was an absolutely AMAZING performance with stunning set changes.  The dancers were incredible and very fun to watch!  I would recommend this event to people of all ages as a "Must see".
