Are you kidding me? I've lived less than a mile away from this place for 3 years. I've noticed it, but it looked a little shady from the outside. A week before I'm moving to another state, I decided to try it out. 

I can't BELIEVE how perfect this place is! So affordable, clean, comfortable, and relaxing! The staff is so friendly and wonderful. A true hidden treasure. I'd be back every week if I could!
