One of the best Prime Rib spots in Phoenix, with great salads and fresh fish. Wonderful outdoor patio and bar, rarely a wait, and excellent service. I am that idiot who has to change everything on the menu, and they have never had the slightest problem making any adjustments I asked for. I would give them ten stars if I could.
