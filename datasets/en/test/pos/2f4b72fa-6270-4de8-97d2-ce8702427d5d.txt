Love me some In n Out...so, I live in a state devoid of this great burger establishment so I always enjoy an opportunity to stop in and blow my calorie consumption for the day.

Upside is consistency, customer service, freshness and fun...love it animal style. Onions by request but plenty which I love...

It can often be a bit sketchy to find a seat but be patient, generally by the time your food is ready someone has finished and moved on.
