I have been taking my vehicles to Stanley's since 1986.  I have a business in Mesa AZ and drive every one of our vehicles out to Phoenix just to have Stanley's work on them.  They are the most honest place I have ever dealt with, they never try and sell me a repair I don't need, and they have never been unable to repair my vehicles.  Everyone that works at shop knows what they're doing and their attention to detail is impeccable.  I can't imagine ever going to another mechanic.
