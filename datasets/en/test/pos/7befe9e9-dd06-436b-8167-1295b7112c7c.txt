This is one of my facorite places to eat in the ENTIRE valley. The location is inconvenient for me as I live in the Biltmore area but I can't resist. Everything is so fresh and clean and the atmosphere is warm and inviting and very family (and pet) friendly as there is ample outdoor seating. This is a feel good place with the nicest workers. Your food is done in a reasonable amount of time and it never dissapoints. They know what they are doing. They need to open another location... perhaps on the west side. It would do great. The lines are ALWAYS long but trust me.. it is totally worth it.
