WOW!!...This was the first time I tried Dim Sum in Phx and i was really surprised to find something really good. 
The place looks small from the outside but its a good size dim sum place. The service was fast and good...they came around the carts frequently. We mostly had the shrimp stuff and it was EXCELLENT!
Great find and cheap...we both had a good amount until we were full and the bill came to $16!!!
