Dear Mr. Johnston,

The trifecta that is Liberty Market, Joe's Real BBQ and Joe's Farm Grill are bad for my diet.  I'm not saying it's your fault but if the food at your fine establishments were not so darm fresh and tasty, I would be thinner.  I crave your food.  And when I went to Joe's Farm Grill for the first time it was so good, I went back the very next day!!  Obviously you love what you do and we reap the benefits so thank you!  But my waistline does not thank you.  

Sincerely, 
Lynn W.
