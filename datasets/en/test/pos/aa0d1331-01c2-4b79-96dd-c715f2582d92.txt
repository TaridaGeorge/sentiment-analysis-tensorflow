As one who has NEVER enjoyed Chinese food, the food was AMAZING!  My husband and I only ate there because we had purchased the Groupon deal (he's a fan of Chinese food and twisted my arm to go). I was shocked at the freshness of the meals and the oversized portions.  My husband ordered the mongolian beef, and I the curry chicken...equally fantastic!  My husband was more surprised that I said we should eat here a couple of times a month!  Being that I am not a Chinese food fan, I am an Eest Asian Bistro fan!  My husband also commented that this is the best Chinese food he has had in all of Phoenix.
