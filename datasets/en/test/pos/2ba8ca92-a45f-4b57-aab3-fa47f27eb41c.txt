This IS the best pizza place in town. I can't imagine a negative review. My favorite pizza is the Bulls pizza, i'm completely addicted. I highly recommend Little Chicago's Pizza. You can't beat their pizza, the quality, the price, it's most definitely the best pizza place in ALL of Scottsdale, Phoenix and Arizona as far as i'm concerned! 

Good job, Little Chicago's! We LOVE you!!!
