We just saw The Decemberists here and it was one of the best shows I have ever been to. Aside from the fact that this is my favorite band, the venue itself was fantastic. Not too big, not too small and great customer service.The acoustics were phenomenal. It is easy to find and parking is free if you find a spot in one of the nearby neighborhoods. Here's to hoping that another great band will soon perform here!
