I called in ahead, just to see if they had the BBQ chx available in slices (I love the CA Pizza Kitchen version, I know..) and they told me they had the cheese, ham and pineapple and the meatball & sausage, which sounded amazing.  I have a thing for meatball subs and my mom's homemade meatballs.  Back to my review, I walked in and grabbed a slice of the meatball and sausage and a slice of cheese.  They warmed it in the oven in about 4 minutes, and I walked back home.  The sausage on that pizza is UNREAL-FANTASTIC-WICKED-SWEET.  The price for 2 slices = 5.75 w tax.  I would recommend to anyone, so long as they love NY style slices.
