Great salads, yummy sweets and cookies, wonderful customer service!  I always get the salmon salad (nicoise) and my Sisters ordered the parmesan chicken salad, so I got to taste that one too, I will have to get it next time cuz it is soooo good!! The make their iced tea very well, and they are very attentive! Love it!
