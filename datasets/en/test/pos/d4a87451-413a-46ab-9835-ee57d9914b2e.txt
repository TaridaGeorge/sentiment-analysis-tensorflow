My friends and I ate here on Memorial Day wknd after a string of failed attempts at other nearby restaurants on the downtown Scottsdale strip. Whereas everywhere else had long lines and rude staff,  the conversational and kind doorman let us know that we knew we were in for a good night after all. Our previous frustrations became a distant memory due to:

- 1/2 price btls of wine (because it was Sunday)
- amazing goats cheese/pesto spread for bread
- quirky fun waitress
- live band that played 80s- today (and even Dick In a Box!!!)
- Great service and attitude by all staff

As out of towners, Furio really turned around our perception of eating in downtown Scottsdale. Go straight here (and be careful of the complicated front door). Thanks for a wonderful finale meal in AZ!!!
