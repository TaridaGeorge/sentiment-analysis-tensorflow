I decided to try Paul G Studio to give myself a relaxing reward for a long work week, and I'm glad I did. Paul was attentive to my needs and very professional. Not to mention he was charming and accommodating. I got my hair cut and styled as well as fully foiled. After that, Paul recommended a great hair product that works well with my naturally curly hair. 

Many hair stylists do not know how to work with women with curly hair. Paul took the time to figure out my hair type, and preferences. I believe he has the ability to work with a diverse range of hair types. I look forward to visiting with him regularly every three months. What a pleasure. I left relaxed, and looking fabulous.
