I used T&S on the recommendation from my insurance agent and I couldn't be more satisfied. They tailored a visit to my house based on my schedule and the installer (Frank) was courteous, prompt, and very nice. If I ever have to get my windshield replaced again (hopefully not) T&S will be the only company I will call.
