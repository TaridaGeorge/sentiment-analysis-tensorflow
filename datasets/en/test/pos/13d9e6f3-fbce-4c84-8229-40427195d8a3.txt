Hands down the best coffee shop in Scottsdale! I can easily spend my entire afternoon here. This place has wonderful coffee, my favorite being the Toddy, a cold brewed coffee that is 67% less acidic than a regular coffee and has more caffeine to boot! 

The staff is incredibly friendly, and the owner, Steve is always there making the place welcoming and fun. The walls are decorated with artwork from local artists for sale, and they offer "doggie dine-in's" periodically on the patio. Fun and relaxing, I would recommend this place to everyone!
