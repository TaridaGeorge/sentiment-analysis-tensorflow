This place is fantastic. I love the old school Vegas-y feel to it and the dj playing all the throwback hip hop pretty much made my night. The bathrooms are clean. Holly, our VIP hostess was all kinds of awesome. I will definitely be heading back to Mabels! Ladies - thank you for an awesome night. That was probably the most fun I've had in a very long time!
