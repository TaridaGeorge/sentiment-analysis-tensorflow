When Richard Z, Dallas G, and Brad E. asked me to join their co-ed soccer team, I thought they were nuts. I can't run. Or kick. Or successfully walk up a flight of stairs without being winded.

Butt.... I soon realized that everyone else playing in the Friday night league was in the same boat, so it made it exponentially more fun!

I like these facilities. They have  two indoor fields, and one outdoor field. There is a snack bar, bleachers all around, and plenty of restrooms. They are pretty low key and the refs are fair. 

"Season" two for us Rubber Mallets starts tonight, so if you are looking for a good laugh, come on down and give us a watch!
