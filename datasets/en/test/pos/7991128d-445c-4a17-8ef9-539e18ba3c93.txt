This review for Dollar is simply based on renting the unit, not returing it. I had to one-way a car to L.A. and my priceline request was accepted by Dollar. Once at the airport, the kind agent told me about fuel, insurance and GPS options, all which I declined and once I asked him about driving to California, he upgraded me from a Chevy Aveo to a "compact" for no extra charge. Once he directed me to the lot, there was a shiny white Dodge Caliber waiting for me. The car was clean and had around 3500 miles on it. 

This was one of the easiest rentals I have done in a while.
