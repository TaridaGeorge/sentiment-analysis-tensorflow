I'm so glad to live in an area with stores like this, and even more thrilled to have Pro's Ranch Market in Mesa! 
Their bakery is out of this world, their food is very good (tacos tacos tacos!!!!!), they have EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN, and MORE, and their prices on meat and produce are also rather spectacular. The quality is also tough to beat! Freshly roasted hatch chiles always seem to be available! Did I mention the amazing Aguas Frescas stand, with some of the creamiest, tastiest Horchata in the 480? :D
