Very clean and nice nail salon. 10 pedicure/massage chairs and lots of extras are available like sea salt, great massage(20 minutes) as one of the pedi treatments. Amazing!! Went to Nancy and she was excellent. 10 mani stations-good girls day out. Very reasonable compared to other spas in area. Highly recommend spa and Nancy!! Give yourself 1 1/2 hours for the manicure/pedicure-best $40 treatment!!
