I can't believe I'm giving a junk food pizza chain 5 whole stars..but this place is great! Probably one of the best Pizza Hut's I've been to. I always get my pizzas delivered from this place (Can't always go to Cibo!) and they are always consistently awesome! Not sure why the other reviewers have had such a tough time...and I am a frequent customer. Perfectly greasy flaky crusts, and excellent fresh toppings. Pizzas are always delivered ahead of their approximated schedule and are always piping hot. I don't have a bad thing to say about this place. I never order anything else but their pizza.  I just encourage them keep up the consistency and freshness and customers will be very happy!
