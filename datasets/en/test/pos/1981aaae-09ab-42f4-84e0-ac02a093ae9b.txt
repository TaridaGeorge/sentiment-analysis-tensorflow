WOW Yelpers!!! Looking for a good sushi buffet?? Look no more!!!!

I once went to a sushi buffet in Vegas and was so disappointed. I thought that if Vegas could not get it right..no one else could. Well, I was wrong!!!

The variety of sushi is amazing!! They also have a station with typical Chinese dishes and a small hibachi area. The dessert selection was vast. They also have this mango ice cream (gelato type) that is amazing!! I ate lunch there until I was full...all for $12 per person. Our waitress was so sweet and attentive. This place is so worth it!! You must try it.
