Yes, I went there without a reservation, and it's true that you wait for a ridiculous amount of time if you don't have one (my wait was 3.5 hours), but in the end it was worth it.  The ambiance, the food, the open psudeo kitchen with the wood burning oven and the reasonable prices made my night.  The pizza was excellent.  The oven roasted vegetables were excellent.  My company was excellent.  Set aside my wait time I will definately go back but next time I will make sure that I have reservations.
