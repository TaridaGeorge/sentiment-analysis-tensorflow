I have been a customer of Defalco's Italian Grocery/Deli for years and years and years. I love it there! As of late I have been sticking with the spaghetti and although there have been a couple of times I found it a little overly salted, for the most part it's perfect every time! The bf is a fan of the sausage and beef combo, only he adds Havarti, with a sub roll and substitutes the marinara for Alfredo and calls it a day. Last night I had the linguine in white clam sauce. It was impressive to say the least. The portion was far larger than I had expected it to be, although I had no trouble finishing it all. Of course we'll be back, we always are.
