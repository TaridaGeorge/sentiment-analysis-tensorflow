This is one of the best places in the east valley. I've been going here when they first opened a few years back. My family and I frequent this restaurant and highly recommend it to family and friends.

Their bun and pho noodle soups are the best. You get a lot of food for a reasonable about of money. This is a true hole in the wall restaurant.

Be warned though, the inside aesthetics is very outdated, but it is clean. The service isn't warm and friendly but they're also not rude. It's just a place that you go to eat and mind your own business.
