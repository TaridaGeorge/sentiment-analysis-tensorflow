I must admit I feel so uncool every time I come in here, mostly because it's hipster supreme and everyone seems to know everyone. But I sit in here and work because the atmosphere is both simple and eclectic -- I love the openness behind the counter and the openness of the seating area. Plus, good tunes always seem to abound here. Did I mention the coffee is delicious? Smooth, caramelly espresso; not at all the like the bitter over roasted crud at a certain worldwide coffee tyrant. I also highly dig that they worked the tax into all of their prices, so when I buy an Americano for $2.50, it's really $2.50. One more thing: enjoy the pastries here. They are as good as any coffeehouse I've visited.
