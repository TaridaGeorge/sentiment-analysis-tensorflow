I like to think of myself as a cupcake fanatic, but that also means that I am a bit choosy about my cake.  Urban Cookie/Ollie Cake bakes the most amazing cupcakes that I have ever had in my life (don't tell my mom)!  The cake is so moist and the frosting is perfect...not too sweet. 

The prices are great too...cupcakes are usually around $2.50, and well worth it.  

All the flavors that I have tasted are fantastic, but the Brown Velvet is better than sex.
