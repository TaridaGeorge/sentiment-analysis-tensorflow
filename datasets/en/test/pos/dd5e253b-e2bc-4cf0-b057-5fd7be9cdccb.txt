This is definitely the best gynecologist office I have EVER been to.  I see Dr. Heathcott and I absolutely love her, but if need be I would not mind seeing any of their other doctors.  She is very thorough and I never feel like she is rushing.  The atmosphere is very inviting and relaxing.  The front desk staff is also friendly and helpful.  The rooms are very comfortable and also include a T.V. with a remote that can be used to select different programs such as pregnancy, birth control, etc. that you can watch and learn more about while waiting.  No one likes to go to the gyno, but knowing that I am coming here makes it SO MUCH BETTER.
