I love this starbucks!!! I go to it at least 4 days out of my five day work week!!! I am a starbucks gold card holder lol...the girls are all so sweet...they know our office staff by name and are so nice...they make the greatest vanilla chai frappaccinos and the best green.tea fraps!!!!! Everyone needs to taste their new dessert bites they r to die for!! My favorite is the salted carmel chocolate pretzel square! You cannot get much better then that...i do noteven like coffee but there is so much more here...
