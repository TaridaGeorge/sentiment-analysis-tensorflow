Discovered this restaurant last week through Groupon, and have been there twice in a week already with friends and family. 

The food is outstanding. The owner admits to using ingredients he personally likes and delivers them with passion.

The beverages remind me to home. I personally suggest the Parchita (a yellow passion fruit juice). 

I also suggest their Sancocho (soup) and Tawny Arepa (blood sausage arepa). 

The place might be hard to find. Look for the Rosati's, it's right next door.
