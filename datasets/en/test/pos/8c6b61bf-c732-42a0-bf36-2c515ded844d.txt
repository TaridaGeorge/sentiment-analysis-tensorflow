Love PIta Jungle for lunch!  What an amazing menu they have, so much to choose from!  I love their gyros and beans!  I also love that they have smaller selections so you can share a few items or just order something small for a child!  

It is a perfect place to meet someone for lunch, so delicious and the prices are very reasonable!
