Following items on the menu are just amazing:
Delux Burger 
Turkey Burger 
Chinese Chicken Salad
Sweet Potato fries in a small shopping cart

The place is very clean, nice restrooms, trendy bar and the best thing is that they are open every day until 2am.

The only negative thing is that most of the time there is a waiting time (sometimes 30 - 45 minutes) and the other problem is that I really never can decide what to get. It's just too good...
