Amazing!  Blows Rudys out of the water, hands down

Omg! Hands down, the best bbq in AZ.

You can sample (they encourage it) before you buy it.  The creamy corn and mac & cheese are pretty much outta the park!  The brisket is mmmmm mmmmm GREAT! (3 cuts to choose from).  Everything is smoked right there, infront of you.
