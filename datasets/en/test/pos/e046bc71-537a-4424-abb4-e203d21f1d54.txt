The Baker's Daughter is a gem of a chocolate shop in the Sunnyslope district. My husband were driving by and since I am obsessed with dessert, we just had to stop. We started off with Karl's Bakery, which is attached to The Baker's Daughter. You will find more pastries, cookies and cupcakes at Karl's. Right next door is The Baker's Daughter, who is, literally, the daughter of the woman who runs Karl's. She was classically trained in Switzerland so really knows her stuff. She was incredibly patient with me and answered all my questions. There are more than truffles there, but also gourmet desserts. Next time I am wanting to splurge on dessert I will come here.
