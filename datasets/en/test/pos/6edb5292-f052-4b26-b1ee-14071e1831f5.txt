We went to Scottsdale for the first time a few weeks ago for Spring Training.  We wanted to try a restaurant we have never eaten at before.  When we went in the restaurant from the ladies at the front door to the waiters the service was great.   We had the Grilled artichokes and they  we out of this world. We get fresh artichokes   all the time right from the fields were we live in Northern Cal but these were great..  Since we were having lunch we wanted to go light (so we thought) we had the Alex's salad.  It was also great and filling.   That was the best lunch we had in Scottsdale that week.  If I go back to Scottsdale I would have to go back to J. Alexander's....
