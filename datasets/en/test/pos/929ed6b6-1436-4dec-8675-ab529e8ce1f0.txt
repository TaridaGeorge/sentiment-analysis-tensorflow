Wow, can't believe this has not been reviewed. I woke up early this morning and called my neighbor up and asked him, " you ate breakfast yet?". Thank The Lord, he said  "no".  So he drives out his drive way and into mine, off we go. I mentioned Denny's and Ihop to him, he says to me, " I know a place", and we are on the freeway headed to the west side. This place is no joke, awesome food and service. Very reasonable prices and all the food has great flavor. I had the Hungry Man breakfast, $7.50 for all you can eat pancakes, six sausages, hash browns and three eggs. Me and my neighbor are big guys and can eat, this will fill you up. If you want a home cooked breakfast, at a very reasonable price, this is the place.
