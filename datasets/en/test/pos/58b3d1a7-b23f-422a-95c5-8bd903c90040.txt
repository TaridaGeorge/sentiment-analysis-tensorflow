Awesome flavors and friendly place.  Pokket coffee, almond snicker, cookies and cream... Always favorite

Great cakes, too.  In fact, this has been the only place we've gotten cakes for special birthdays and such for quite a while now.  They're good, reasonably priced and right-sized..

Good espresso.

Very authentic, European feeling to the place.

I can't wait to go back and try out their wood-fired pizzas.
