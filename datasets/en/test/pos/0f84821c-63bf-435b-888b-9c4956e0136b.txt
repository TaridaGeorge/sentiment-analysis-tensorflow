We just had a great meal at Pino's.  For the last three weeks, they have been open 11 am-9 pm on Saturdays.  It sounds like they are trying to determine if there is enough business to open on Saturdays so this may change.  It is definitely worth giving them a call if you crave a great calzone one Saturday evening (pepperoni + meatball = pure goodness).
