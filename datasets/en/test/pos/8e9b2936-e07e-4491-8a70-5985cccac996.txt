What a fantastic music store!! They carry every type of music in here, as well as DVDs, records, posters, toys, magnets, and apparel. What I really love about Zia is that they carry Metal music. I usually cannot find any of the bands that I listen to at any other music store. So it's nice to know instead of going on a manhunt to find something that is more or less unique chances are that I can go here and usually find it. And if I can't find it here they have no problem ordering it for me. I've always enjoyed shopping here and will continue to do so as long as I live in this area.
