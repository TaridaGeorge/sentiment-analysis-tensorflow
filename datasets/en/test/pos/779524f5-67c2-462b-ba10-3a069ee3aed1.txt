I NEVER thought I'd pay this much ($90/month) but I can't quit this gym! The keys for me are their great yoga classes and instructors (just as good as any studio) and their three lap pools where I can always find a lane.

Being open 24 hours a day is wonderful and even when they adjust their hours on holidays, they're workable. At peak times, the parking lot can get crazy, but you'd never know once you get inside because it's so big, you don't have to wait for a machine or a shower. 

It's very family friendly, which to someone without kids means crawling with kids during summers and other school breaks, but they're not allowed upstairs in the "gym" so it's just dealing with it at the pool or in the locker rooms.
