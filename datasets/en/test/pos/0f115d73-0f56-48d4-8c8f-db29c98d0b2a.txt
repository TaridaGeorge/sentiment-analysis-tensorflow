I am so happy to find a quality pizzeria in my area! 

The quality of food here is top notch. The mozzarella they use is imported just for them, and it's amazing. And the rest of their ingredients are just as satisfying.

The servers are very attentive and will even serve you your pizza slices. 

The ambiance is fun; very New York/Rat Pack, classy Italian-esque.

See you again soon, Grimaldi's!!!
