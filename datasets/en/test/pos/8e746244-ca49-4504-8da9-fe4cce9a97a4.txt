Thai Pan has the most amazing Thai noodles and curries!  I love all of their curries, red, green, and yellow and the Street Curry Noodles are super tasty.  Also among my favorites are the Garlic Noodles and Teriyaki Chicken Salad.  I wouldn't classify Thai Pan as an authentic traditional-style Thai restaurant - the food is a bit lighter and not too spicy - but the flavors are definitely Thai and well done.

Oh, and while you do order at the counter and take a number to your table, the food is *so much* better than Pei Wei.  This isn't your traditional fast food, after all, wok cooking is supposed to be quick!
