I love this place! 

Yes, the wait is long. I knew that going in, so it didn't really upset me. It's not as long if you go a little earlier in the morning. 

The service is great. The owners are warm and cheery and remembered me the second time I went in! 

The fresh squeezed orange juice is super yummy! Last time I went I got the porkchop and eggs. Mmmmm....
