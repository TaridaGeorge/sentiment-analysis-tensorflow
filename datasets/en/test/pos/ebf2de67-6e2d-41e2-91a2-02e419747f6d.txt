First, I'm not a family member or direct friend of this dentist.  I've been going there for years and have been very happy so want to write a review.

Dr Dominick (I call him Sam) is the owner and only dentist there.  The guy is solid.....he always gives me options to help keep the costs down but also pick the best option.

I've had some back luck with dentists in the past.  But, I trust Sam with a sack full of money......he would not touch it.

Bottom line:  this guy is a solid dentist, and honest person with great customer service and care.
