Just what Phoenix and downtown needed -- a for-real, big, committed-to-underground music dance club.

The proprietors of this place (also the owners of adjacent Bar Smith) are house music kangs but kangs in general. The name "Monarch" is deliciously appropriate.

Amazing sound system and exciting things afoot.

THANK YOU for giving Phoenix a heartbeat.

See you on the dancefloor.
