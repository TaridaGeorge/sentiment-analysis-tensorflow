It's the same old story throughout the ages.

Guy wants girl. 
Guy never gets girl.
Guy buys a health club membership because he lives across the street.
Guy starts lifting weights for hours each day, gets ripped.
Guy gets so big, his nuts disappear.
Guy advertises on milk carton "Have you seen me?" with a picture of both nuts.
Transgendered she-male answers ad.
Guy meets she-male, falls in love and they both live happily ever after minus a pair of nuts.....just like in the movies.

It's the same old story.

Seriously...if anyone over there finds one or both of my nuts, please call me at 555-1302.
I last saw them in the downstairs weight room, near the water fountain.
