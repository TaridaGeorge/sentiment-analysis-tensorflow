If I could give more than 5 stars I would. I love this group. VMG is a free group for people to get out and meet new people. It's not a dating group, but a social group. Although the name is Valley Movie Group we do all kinds of events; plays, ballet, spots games, comedy, dinners, and of course movies. The people are incredibly nice, the group is well organized, and we always get group discounts on what we are doing. Check it out, you will not be sorry.
