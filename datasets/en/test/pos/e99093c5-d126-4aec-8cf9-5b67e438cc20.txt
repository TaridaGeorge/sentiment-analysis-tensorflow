after our first horrible experience, i had vowed never to go back.  i'm so glad i gave it another chance!  this time we went when it was busy, and sat at the bar.  the bartender/server was so helpful and attentive, completely knew how to treat customers.  the tomato soup was incredible and i have since recommended CPC to many of my friends.
thanks dean!
