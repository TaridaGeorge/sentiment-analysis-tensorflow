I tried Yogurtlogy as part of a gluten free foodies tour (#gffoodietour) and this may have been my favorite stop on the tour! I love froyo and this store did not disappoint! I sampled every gluten free flavor they had and found the chocolate/banana combo to be my fave.

The owners of this location are becoming more aware of the needs of the gluten free community and have separated their toppings that don't contain gluten ingredients from those nasty gluten-y ones! Score! Makes it way easier to choose toppings and then I don't have to worry about someone accidentally dumping Oreo cookies into my sprinkles. :)

The owners are really the nicest and asked a lot of great questions about Celiac and the gluten free lifestyle so that they accommodate more customers that need gluten free options.
