What a great place. Another instant top 5 favorite. Loved the food, the staff is wonderful, the whole establishment is quite nice. It is located in a pretty silly place but I love it. The ratatoullie is amazing and don't even get me started on the duck confit. Hands down one of the best meals I have ever had. So good.
