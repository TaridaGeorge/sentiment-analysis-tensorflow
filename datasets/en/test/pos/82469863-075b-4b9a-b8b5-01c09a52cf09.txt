I love going to AZ88 to hang out, have a cocktail, and people watch.  AZ88 is tres chic with changing art displays and live dj. I especially enjoy sitting on the patio decked out with modern white furniture overlooking SMOCA. 

Food and drinks are good too. Their menu consists of salads, burgers, sandwiches. The dishes are about $8 - $10 and the servings are pretty large. The cocktails are great but pricey...completely worth it! Try their martini or mojito.
