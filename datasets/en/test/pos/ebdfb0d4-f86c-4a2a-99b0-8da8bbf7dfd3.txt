Absolutely YUMMY!  Great place to stop to get a fresh cool treat!  They use only the very best ingredients and put lots of love into each delicious paleta!  The menu changes depending on what fruits are in season.  It is independently owned by the sweetest (no pun intended) couple.  Go out and support them and try something new!
