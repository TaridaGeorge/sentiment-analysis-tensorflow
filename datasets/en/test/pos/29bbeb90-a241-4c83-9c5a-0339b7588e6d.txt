In a former life, I managed a fine dining Victorian restaurant in Pittsburgh.  We had the occasional High Tea (this is actually the common tea for dinner, Afternoon Tea is the more formal) request and let me tell you, it is labor intensive!  

If you cut off the crusts of the bread too early, they will get crusty, unless you dampen cheesecloth and place it over them.  The Phoenician is knowledgeable about the whole enchilada and Wanda is the Queen of the tea.  If you have the fortune to have her take care of you, you are in good hands.
