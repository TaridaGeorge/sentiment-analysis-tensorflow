Great new restuarant! Will be back next time I'm in Scottsdale!

We went last night. Party of 6. One of the crew had been there a few times before so we let him order for the table. Most of the dishes were fabulous! Highlights were the filet, duck, snapper, potatoes and dessert platter. I didn't care for the spinach much, but its not my first choice anyways. I agree with the comments about bread, seems like it would be an easy addition to make. Anyways, all in all a great restuarant for a group - we'll be back!
