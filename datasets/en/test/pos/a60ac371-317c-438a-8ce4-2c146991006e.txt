I'm reluctant to review this location since it's where I find all my greatest deals and really, I don't want to share with you. But I will since we're friends.

50% off Saturday's are CRAZY. Be prepared. If you are clostraphobic you should avoid it at all costs. However, you can get smokin' deals on pretty much everything if you're willing to deal with massive crowds. This Saturday I got close to $200 worth of pristine Anne Taylor dresses, slacks, and shirts for about $15 - total. 

This store is clean and doesn't smell like dead people. A huge bonus in my book. It's well organized and the people that work there are really helpful. One of the better thrift stores in the area by far.
