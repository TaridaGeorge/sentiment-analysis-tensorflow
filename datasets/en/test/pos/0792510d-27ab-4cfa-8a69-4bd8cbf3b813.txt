If there were 6 stars I could leave I would. We have a Capital Grill back home in Chicago but have never visited. I had the lamb chops and my wife had the filet. We both split the gratin potatoes since the side portions are so big(recommendation of our server) and I'll say the best lamb chop I have ever had. Cooked perfectly and a very large portion, 4 large chops. I took our server's recommendation and tried their balsamic to drizzle over he chop and was delicious. My wife's filet was also very good, of course I had to try it. Not the best filet I have had but still worth every penny. Drinks were well prepared and tasty. If you have room for desert hands down get the cheesecake! I'll let it speak for itself. Server was great and very helpful with the menu.
