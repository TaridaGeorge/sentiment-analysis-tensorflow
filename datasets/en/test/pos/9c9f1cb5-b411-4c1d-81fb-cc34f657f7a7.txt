Beautiful Loop!!!! Been down this street many times before I even knew it had it's own Yelp listing. Gorgeous tree lined street with dream homes to your left and right. 

This is definitely one of my favorite places in Phoenix. If you have the money this is one of the best locations in the city and has that older neighborhood feel. 

Go early in the morning and you enjoy the early morning sun shining on Piestewa Peak and Camelback.
