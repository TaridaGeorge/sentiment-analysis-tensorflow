OMG their veggie burger is soo freaking good. My husband and I been here a few times and always had a positive experience. We always sat at the bar and found the bartenders to be friendly but not overly annoying. The entire space is very urban-like but not scottsdalely if you know what I mean.

Also love the name. Just being in there reminds me of my trip to Fez (the city in Morocco) and the good times that I had.
