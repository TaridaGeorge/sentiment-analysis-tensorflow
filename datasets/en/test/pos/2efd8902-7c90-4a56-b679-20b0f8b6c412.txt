China Chili doesn't sound like much, and frankly it doesn't look like much either. But then when I opened the door from the 3rd Street side I was struck with the loud noise of a full house of hungry and happy eaters. So far I've only had the spicy Sichuan prawns, and it delivered. It was a hot, spicy and a wonderful blend of spices including garlic and chilies. Most of the items on the lunch menu were labeled 'spicy', and so hopefully the others are this good too. By the look of the other diners, the smiles seemed to indicate good stuff. The service was efficient and fast, too. Highly recommended.
