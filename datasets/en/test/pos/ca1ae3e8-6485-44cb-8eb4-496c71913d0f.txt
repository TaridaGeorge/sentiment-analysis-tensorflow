Of all the times I've come here...I have received the best customer service ever! The owner of this place is so down to earth and friendly. The food is amazing! I thought it was a little weird to have coconut and pineapple as a topping on top of hot dogs, but mix it in with their chipotle mayo...bang! You got this sweet and spicy thing going on and it's so wonderful! The other time I came here he made a special request for me. I have been wanting to try their wings because of the "odd" use of his secret ingredient sauce. The wings were just as delicious as their hot dogs. I have to try the burgers next.
