I could eat this whole place up.

I love, love, love everything on the menu, although I can rarely bring myself to stray from my favorite (Crab Stuffed Pastry). Occasionally the wait time can be a little long but the servers are always frendly. Our most recent visit was Mother's Day of this year and we made sure to get there early as they fill up extremely quickly for that holiday. We've never had bad service and the food has always been excellent.
