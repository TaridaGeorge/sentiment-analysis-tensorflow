Dear holy awesome gluten free menu!!! 

I'm 100% excited for a restaurant that's been approved by a celiac association - and they display it right on their door! Everything here is awesome - I had the gluten free crush pizza and got the "vegetarian" option. I also had the watermelon mojito - with real chunks of watermelon and mint! They have GREAT gluten free appetizers as well! 

This is my new favorite restaurant, and although pretty pricey, it's a great date restaurant, or a good girlfriend date. Especially for celiacs, vegetarians, or organic junkies. 

A must visit!
