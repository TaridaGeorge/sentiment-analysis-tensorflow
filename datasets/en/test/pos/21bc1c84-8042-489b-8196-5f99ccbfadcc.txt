My very first (has been several times since) was awesome.  A friend took me there.  While waiting for the check, a waitress (that didn't even take care of us) told my friend and me to please wait.  We looked at each other wondering what was going on.  She came back with an envelope.  She explained to my friend that the last time he was there, he over paid! Mind you, this was over 3 months ago (according to him) since his last visit there.  Now THAT is impressive!  Anyone that is that honest and has ethics like that, the restaurant chose a great server!!

Since then, I have brought my son, mother (from out of town) and my friends there.  ALL love it! I even refer my customers who have come back telling me how awesome the experience and food was!
