This is a fantastic pharmacy and I have never had anything less than stellar experiences here. They really go out of their way to make sure the patient gets taken care of... gotta love that. When I lost my insurance they got me a lowered rate for my birth control. When my fiance got a really nasty case of poison ivy, they let me take care of the entire transaction while he lay in an oatmealy tub. 

They rock and I feel lucky to have them in the neighborhood!
