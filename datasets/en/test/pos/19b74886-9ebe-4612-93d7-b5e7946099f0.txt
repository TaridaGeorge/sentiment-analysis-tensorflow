Six always ends my  nights out in old town, and it usually goes a little something like this:

Stingray
Drift
Suede
PCL
Six
home

For some reason, my friends and I have an adversion to staying in one location longer than a couple of hours, and at 2am when the lights come back on, 98% I'm standing in the middle of Six. It's a dark, sexy looking place where the music is always good, you're going to run into people you know (whether you want to or not - always good for some drama) and yeah, the drinks are pricey but not by Scottsdale standards. I love six and you will too. Girls,  go through the back entrance and guys, try there too, it's easier than you think.
