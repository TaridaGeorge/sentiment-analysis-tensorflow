China China has closed due to a fire.  Don't have any word about repair time or reopening.  China China has been my family' s place to go for large family gatherings and for us all in small groups for years.  Stephanie, the owner knew my parents on first name basis and always asked about family members who were not present.  When my dad died, she sat down with my mother and offered words of comfort.   We LOVED the menu and the dishes.  Yes, the take out containers leaked if tilted.  My son always scolded me for "slanting the containers.  But it was so wonderful.  Maybe not traditional Chinese, but nothing in America is "traditional" or the way people made it at home or in their own region.  It suited my family, we all send prayers and blessings to China at the loss of their business.
