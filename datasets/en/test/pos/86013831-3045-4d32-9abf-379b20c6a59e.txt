The most amazing thing just happened!!! Nice people really do exist!! My husband just picked up our truck from SSC Auto Repair. Adam, the shop owner, was awesome and VERY fair with his pricing and sensitive to our situation. 

We've been having problems with our truck for a while and weren't too sure who we could trust with it that wouldn't charge us an arm and a leg. The mechanics are great and took the time needed to look at our truck and address the problem. I'm soooo happy we choose to go back to Adams shop! Please visit his shop (either in Gilbert or Chandler) if you need vehicle work done!
