ive heard about this place from my buddies, and i came here and read the bad reviews. so i put off going , 

Yesterday, A few friends and myself  went   and found it amazing. i actually went back today for some more today haha. not to badly priced, There beerbatered cheese, is amazing on the pizza. 

 i did feel bad for the waiter because last night we ordered slices and he accidently gave us 8in personal pizzas, yet we only had to pay for slices, so it was overall amazing haha
