This is one amazing office. I had an extremely high-risk pregnancy and eventually was treated by all of the doctors, in and out of the hospital, for my pregnancy. They were all superb, but my primary caregiver was Dr. Kwatra. She is a phenomenon in this profession. Her skills are amazing; her passion for women's healthcare and well-being knows no bounds. I believe she literally saved my life and that of my child.

Now that I am past my reproductive years, I still am happy to call her my doctor and will continue to seek Dr. Kwatra's care. I cannot recommend this practice enough.
