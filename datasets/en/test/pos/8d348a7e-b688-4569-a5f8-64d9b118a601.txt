Finally, a hotel in Arizona that isn't decorated with cow skulls and Navajo rugs.  In leiu of the typical Southwestern decor, the James hotel is very contemporary and sleek.  Brought to you by B.R. Guest, the same people who own Blue Water Grill in NYC.  The swanky lobby bar is quite the Scottsdale see and be scene place.
