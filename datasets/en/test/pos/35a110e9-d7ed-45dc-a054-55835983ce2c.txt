I'm new to the area and picked this place from the other reviews. The price was very affordable. I had a pretty bad scratch on my car and it was fixed within 2 days. They also washed the outside and the inside of my car for no additional charge. The people who work there are generally friendly. They can sometimes drive you home or pick you up to and from the shop if you don't have any other means while they are working on your car. I will definitely return.
