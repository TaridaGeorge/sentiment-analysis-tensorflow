I hesitated to review this restaurant, as I'm sure many people did, for fear that it would grow overcrowded--it's THAT good! This is where I bring my out-of-town friends to treat them to the best tandoori chicken Phoenix has to offer. And the rest of the menu is just as delectable! Perhaps the decor is lacking, and some of the booths are pretty uncomfortable, but that's really not an issue for me when the food is this tasty.
