We went to Mary Coyle's for ice cream last night and holy cow...this place looks SOOOOO much better than it did before. I couldn't believe it! The menu still looks to be the same but isn't all torn up and written over like before. The decor is super cute---stripped pink and white walls with black accents. The waitstaff is dressed straight out of a 50's diner. Ice cream still delicious! I wish they would of done something different to the outside when they changed owners because the lattice on the outside looks uninviting but I promise it is worth going into!
