I love love love their Happy Hour 5 for 6 until 7 seven days a week! They change up the happy hour menu a few times a year, but you could never go wrong! My first time at this particular location and I enjoyed the ambiance and the great customer service! This location also had an IPad wine menu that paired your meal with particular wines! It was pretty awesome!
