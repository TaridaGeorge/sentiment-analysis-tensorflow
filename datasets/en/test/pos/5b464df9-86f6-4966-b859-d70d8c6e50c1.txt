I always see this place because it is right by my work and finally decided to give it a try.  Absolutely love it!!!  The pizza is amazing!  I have also had the Chicken Cesar Salad, which is pretty yummy as well.  As an appetizer they give you baked dough pieces with a tomato vinegarette dipping sauce.  The staff is very friendly and always smiling.  I love Pizza A Metro!
