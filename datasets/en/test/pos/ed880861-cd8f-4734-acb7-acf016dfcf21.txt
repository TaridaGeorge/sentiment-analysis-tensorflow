Been a fan of Eddies through the years, even showed up for a New Years Dinner to find out the old restaurant had a fire. 

Lebanese food is awesome, more flavor than your mouth can comprehend in each bite. If I had one last restaurant to visit as a last wish....Eddies would be the place.

P.S. Moroccan Shrimp is a must.
