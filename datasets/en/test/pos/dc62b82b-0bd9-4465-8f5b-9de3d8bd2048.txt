I've been here a few times for informal meetings, and have gotten various drinks such as iced teas and smoothies.  The staff here gives exemplary service, and drinks are always filled promptly as needed.  When I've ordered smoothies, they've been very good, refreshing, and have come with a huge carafe that 2 people can easily share.  I'd love to try their food here someday when I'm not there for a meeting!
