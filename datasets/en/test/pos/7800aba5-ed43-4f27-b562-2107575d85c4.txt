Yay..my first review!

Bobby Q will not disappoint you. This place has a spacious parking lot and street parking which makes coming here pretty convenient. The hostess was pleasant and our waiter was very patient with us.

I highly recommend the St Louis style ribs. All the ribs are cooked for 10+ hours so they fall right off the bone and melt in your mouth. If you're looking for something much bigger for 2+ people to share and want to try a variety of items, Whole Hog Heaven is for you! Keep in mind the name, because that's exactly what you're getting. It's a heavenly plate of four types of meat along with three sides. We got mac n cheese (good but not great), shoe string fries (yum!), and roasted corn (ok).  *sigh*..I'm still stuffed thinking about it. 

Oh, don't forget to mention Yelp and get 10% off!
