So, I initially gave these guys (officially) a 4-star review. That was before I had dinner here, made to gastronomic perfection at Atlas Bistro next door. So far I've had the spectacular Caraway Rye Sausage with homemade gnocchi, and last night the Lobster mushrooms with sourdough crostini, and the most divine aioli sauce known to man. These guys are unique, and a gift to Epicurean delights. Where else can you buy anything in the shop, sit down and drink it at the bar, and order (quite affordable) 5-star offerings? Nowhere I know of. I've been all over the U.S. and Europe, and this place sits in a class all it's own.
