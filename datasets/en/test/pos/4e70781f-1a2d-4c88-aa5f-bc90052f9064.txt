I am on baby #3 with Dr. Leonard and his staff and I can't say enough about the high standard of care I receive from them.  The staff is friendly, the Dr. Is on the ball with returning my phone calls and answering my questions, and I feel safe knowing they put God as a priority in their practice.  I even had a high risk pregnancy situation, in which Dr. Leonard handled very well.  When my daughter was born, he took the time to check in with the NICU to check on her progress.  I am happy to be a patient here.
