This place is way better than what I thought it would be. I live right down the street and have been iffy about trying it, simply for the fact that it's rarely busy. 

I now think it's a shame that it's not packed all the time. The santa fe burger was absolutely excellent and the sauce they serve with the seasoned fries complimented the meal very well. 

Another plus, especially for you midwestern folk, THEY SERVE OLD STYLE! I haven't found any other place in the valley that serves it. 

This place was definitely worth my while and I am definitely coming back, soon. 

Great food, great service. Thank you very much Burgers & Bottles!
