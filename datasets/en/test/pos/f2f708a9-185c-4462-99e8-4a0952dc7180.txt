I had been searching for a good BBQ place (specifically a place with good pulled pork) and look no further. This place has lots of options, great sides (I got the waffle fries and pasta salad) and excellent sauce! 

The pulled pork sandwich was so tender it was ridiculous. Very tangy BBQ sauce, delicious. 

It looks small in the pictures, but there's more seating in the back, and holy cow it's huge! 

I will definitely be coming back.

*edit* I have been back a few times, and the food is consistently good. If you rated this place bad, you might have just gotten unlucky. It's definitely good BBQ. The best around, easily. If you think shanes is better, you really have no idea what good BBQ is...
