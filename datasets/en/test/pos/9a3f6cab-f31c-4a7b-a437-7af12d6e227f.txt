SUCH great prices on produce! You'll never want to buy your fruits and veggies anywhere else after going here. I am an avid "juicer" and find that the pricing and quality of their produce is fabulous! It's often a bit crowded, but everyone is so nice there that it doesn't even bother me. Plus, I like to be among the others who like to go the healthy route anyways!:) Sandwiches are bomb too, you can fill out a little form and customize your sandwich, shop and swing by the counter and it's waiting there ready for $3.50. Nom!:) Staff is super-friendly too!
