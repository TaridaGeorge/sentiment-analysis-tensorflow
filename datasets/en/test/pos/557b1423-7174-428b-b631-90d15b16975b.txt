Love the bold flavors. Most of the dishes have cream or something that makes it rich and decadent. Crab enchiladas had an awesome cream sauce. Oh and the bread pudding dessert is the best ever bread pudding. Try the cocktails- found that it went great with the food and an option to opt out of their lengthy and expensive wine menu.
