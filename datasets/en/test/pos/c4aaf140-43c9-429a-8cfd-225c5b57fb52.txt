I am not one for clubs the continual "dance dance dance," but Junkie has the best blend

The weekend extravaganza started on a Wednesday (hehe) , if it was up to me it would have ended here. 

Why I like this place: Get past the Scottsdale douchbag; you want to truly know what a Dbag is...go to scottsdale. Although, in a wonderful turn of events I must say I have never received so many  free shots from people I just met, and if you are like me and enjoy fun conversation, people here are picking up what your laying down.

NOte: I have a theory, I think people go to places lik this and clubs because of one underlying feeling....feeling on an implicit boredom. hmmm ponder.
