As far as wine and cheese bars go - this place has Postino's beat by a long shot.  The wine list is impressive.  The staff can make recommendations on the fly.  The owner actually takes his staff to visit vinyards so they become familiar with the wines.  The food is out of this world - but unpretentious.   You don't have to travel to Scottsdale to get fine food and drink -- we've got it right here in Central Phoenix at Cheuvront.   With that said - try the Macaroni and Cheese - which is what I tried tonight - out of this world, albeit a little spicy.  I've eaten there three times and have yet to try a desert because I'm so stuffed from the fabulous cheese selection and wine.  My new favorite!
