My first and only experience here was a great one!  Joseph and Jon both seemed more than happy to help me find a good pair of running shoes. Jon sent me through a short foot analysis process and then Joseph found some shoes that would accommodate my feet and were within my price range. I'm finally excited to start running again! Thank you Road Runner Sports!
