I got pretty far into writing this review, but deleted it after seeing how barbaric and savage I sounded when thinking about eating at Mike and Ronda's.

I love this restaurant and crave it constantly. It's always busy in the morning, but you won't be disappointed if you wait for a table. The servers are almost as quick as how fast the food comes out (damn quick), and even though they're constantly moving around, they'll do whatever they can to accommodate. 

The breakfast burrito is a fantastic deal for the variety of customization options and the abundance of food that ends up on the plate. The hash browns have consistently been extraordinary: crispy and crust-like on the surface, then smooth and almost like mashed potatoes underneath. To wrap up the experience, a hot cup of coffee will adhere all the delicious flavors and guarantee you'll be coming back.
