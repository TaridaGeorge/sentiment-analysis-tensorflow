i recommend making the people you go with order several things so you can have a bite of everything.

everything is good. so good. 

i think the gyro meat was my favorite, their pitas are so fluffy and soft... like little cushions from heaven sent to earth with the sole purpose of harnessing that delicious meat. 

i can't even remember everything we had but i know i liked every bite and you will too. we had like 3 days of left overs as well, but we went a little over board in our ordering.
