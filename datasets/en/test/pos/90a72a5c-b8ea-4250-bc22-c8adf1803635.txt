As an x elite mountain bike racer from Colorado and now a triathlete, I have very specific wants when it comes to "my" bike shop.  I think I have found a new home.  I was impressed with the knowledge and quality of service I received when I took my babies in for service.  "Finally, someone who understands my needs and wants"
