I dont think I will stop coming here the staff is really nice every time! Even when my kiddo decides to spill an entire root beer float all over their nice floor. If you go to the movies across the way I suggest going here first instead of spending an arm and a leg on drinks. They make custom ice cream cakes, they have sundaes, fresh fruit smoothies, vitamin water, soda, tea and they even have energy drinks like red bull. They have topping's, waffle's and cone's just like any other ice cream shop too.
