I can fairly say that I really enjoy the dining experience in this place. I started with agedashi tofu and soft shell crab for appetizer and both of them tasted good. The agedashi tofu is really soft and makes me crave for more, and the crispiness of the soft shell crabs is just superb. I ordered uni, dragon rolls, second climax rolls (spicy tuna with cucumber, topped it with yellowtail, wasabi sauce and tobiko) and crazy horse rolls (tuna with yellowtail, salmon and topped with tobiko) and I loves all 4 of them. The service is also great. The waitress keep checking and ask me to refill my green tea. Overall I'm looking forward for my next visit to this place. Thanks for lovely meal sushi eye!
