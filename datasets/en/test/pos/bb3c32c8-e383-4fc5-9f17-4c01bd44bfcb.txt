Okay, so it's not like this is the waterfront to a huge lake or the ocean, but for the Phoenix area this is pretty good.  It's basically a canal with some palm trees, but there are also tons of shops and restaraunts down here in conjunction with Scottsdale mall.  I wanted to try the Olive and Ivy place but when I came here it was PACKED so it didn't happen. I'll have to update my review again later.
