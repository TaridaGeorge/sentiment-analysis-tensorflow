This is a really cute little joint. If you're looking for an ultra cozy spot to grab dinner and enjoy a glass or two of good wine this is your place. They have a small patio, full bar, and a few indoor tables. Friendly staff help you feel at home right away. It's located on the NW corner of Scottsdale & Shea next to "Handlebar J's".
