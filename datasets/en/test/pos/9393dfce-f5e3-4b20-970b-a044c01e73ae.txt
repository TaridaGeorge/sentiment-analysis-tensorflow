Found this place on Yelp and my girl friends also come here. It was amazing. For $35 bucks and you get an HOUR massage. Its mainly feet, but they do your shoulders arms and legs. You sit in these nice comfy chairs and they go to work for you.

I don't live in AZ anymore however if I did I would sign up for there members card, you end up saving a lot more. 

Great place though!
