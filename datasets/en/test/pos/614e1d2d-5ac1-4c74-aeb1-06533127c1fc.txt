A Gem!  I'm in love!!! Food here is super tasty and fresh. The owners are Adorable!  It's awesome to find amazing and otherwise never to be known eateries on Yelp.  For a cute lil mom and pop spot, with charm and authenticity and deliciously soulful food, Mi Comida Restaurante Latino takes the cake!
