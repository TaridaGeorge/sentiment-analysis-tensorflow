Diamondback Cleaners has satisfied me completely thus far. This week I left six of my best shirts with them and each and every one came back just as I had ordered. 

One of them I had gotten considerably dirty (white of course...) and some how they managed to send it back spotless. Granted I pretreated the shirt with goat's milk and pig urine fresh from Myanmar. At any rate, they took care of me.

Their prices are good, they offer same-day service, and they have several locations throughout the valley as well. As long as they do not screw up any of my threads in the future I will most certainly use them exclusively.
