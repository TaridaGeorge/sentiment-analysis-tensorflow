I came across La Bella Vita through a daily deal site. I originally brought six vitamin b shots and have since been on their monthly plan for b-shots and this last time upgraded to the slimming shots. I have had so much more energy since I have started getting the shots with them. The staff is absolutely wonderful, friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend them to my family and friends - In fact my next visit I am taking two of my grown daughters in to start the b shots.
