This is the best place ever for some good old happy hour. I only come here for the happy hour though because it has spoiled me and I refuse to pay anything but half price for these delicious rolls. Don't worry, happy hour happens frequently. The best part? Happy hour is on Saturdays too!!! They have a ton of rolls, appetizers, meals, drinks for half off. Sometimes there is a wait, but this is definitely worth it. Every roll I had here was great. The best ones are eating nemo and dirty sanchez. The names of these rolls are pretty comical, but once you take a bite, you wont be laughing. Enjoy!
