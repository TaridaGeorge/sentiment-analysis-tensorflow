Fabulous collection of little shops all under one roof. Something for everyone. We found costume and antique jewelry, purses, clothing, rugs, furniture, antiques, reproductions, fabrics, dishes, tablecloths from France, rustic and refined pieces, decorative accents in all styles, lighting, outdoor furniture and planters, and above all else, we found Helen.

At 92-years old, she has got to be the best salesperson I've ever encountered anywhere. Adorable, sharp, totally put-together and fit as a 30-year old Pilates instructor.

Best part is this place ships anywhere.

Love it and will be back!
