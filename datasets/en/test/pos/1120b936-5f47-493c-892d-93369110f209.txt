A great little coffee shop tucked away in a beautiful nursery. I needed to get some work done and enjoy a nice cup of coffee. I sat at my own table with a nice fall breeze and great- but not overwhelming- background music . The quaint artwork and musical instruments on display were also a welcome distraction too:) A nice find that I'll be heading back to again!
