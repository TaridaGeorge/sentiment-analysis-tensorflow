Okay, I know it's just McDonald's, but I feel this particular location deserves a good review. 

After moving away from this McDonalds, I realized just how great the service is here. The staff is friendly (all the time) and fast! No waiting at this McDonalds. By the time you pay in the drive-thru, move up to the second window, your food is waiting; fresh and hot!

The food is just what you would expect from McDonalds. So I'm not going to waste my time critiquing  it.
