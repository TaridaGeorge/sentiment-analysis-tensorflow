This is one very cool restaurant, and what a great location right on Central. The bar area is large enough to support a busy happy hour, and potentially a late night crowd.

FEZ has great decor, wonderful appetizers and perfectly poured drinks. I managed to get down here for my first Yelp event last night and was equally impressed by the venue and the event. 

It was a great turn out and FEZ handled it smoothly with at least two servers dedicated to our group throughout the night. I highly recommend this place for small groups.

I will return soon to have a proper dinner.
