This place is by FAR my favorite place to be on Phoenix!!! Tuesday and Thursday's are the best thanks to cheap drinks and free pool. But, SERIOUSLY! There is a waitress named Kim and she is quite possibly the nicest person I have ever met it is ridiculous! I recommend this bar to anyone, come in the day time with your kids or come at nights with your friends. You can probably find me here I'll be the guy beating you at the pool table and being kind of a smug asshole about it.
