I agree with the reviews already posted - this place was great.  Visited recently on a Saturday morning, were seated quickly - - and what a great with the California Benny - dang!  It was just great - presentation lovely - accomodated a 1/2 order for 2 at the table, and the wait staff very efficient and friendly.
