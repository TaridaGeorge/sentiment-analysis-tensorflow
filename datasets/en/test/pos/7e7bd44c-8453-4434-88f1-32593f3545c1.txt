Took my boyfriend here for his birthday and have to say this was my most favorite dining experience.   Food was excellent.  We did a 5 course meal and were pleasantly surprised by all of the little food items they brought in between the courses.  Each course was unique and fun.  Great service as well.  Totally worth the drive to Cave Creek!
