Yummy yummy Dimsum in my tummy!

Its been so long since I've had dimsum since moving from the islands to Arizona and I was a little hesitant to have some here since I have very high standards for such little pieces of mystery dumplings :).  Phoenix has a good Chinese population so the food is pretty authentic (cant say the same for Tucson).  

Dimsum was really good here.  Reasonably priced, about $2.50 a plate.  Service was surprisingly good (Chinese service is often terrible).

The decor is very ORANGE.  If you do not like the color orange....well, you were warned.  It was set up for a very orange wedding or something.
