I'm a huge fan of the Phoenix Zoo which is funny since I don't really like kids and there are always a zillion kids around. But that's not the zoos fault. 

There are great animals here and lots to see. Go in the morning when the animals are the most active. A new exhibit is under construction for a Komodo Dragon. How cool is that! I like the Arizona Trail and the amphibians the best. And the sting rays when they are there. 

I don't ever buy snacks since prices are high. I'd recommend eating before you go. The zoo is very shady. I went last summer on July 8 and had a great time.
