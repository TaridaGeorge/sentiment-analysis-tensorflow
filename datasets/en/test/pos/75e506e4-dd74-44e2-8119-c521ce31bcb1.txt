I've been here twice for brunch and it's great! My carnivorous son got the steak and eggs and it looked pretty high quality. My girl likes the Chilaquiles and I've enjoyed the vegetarian omelet and I totally vouch for the Huevos Rancheros.

I'm excited to head there for lunch or dinner to try the margaritas and something that's not on the brunch menu.
