One of my top choices for downtown Phoenix. Always an upscale, posh vibe, but with very generous prices on entrees. Good looking people throughout this bar. 

The Kisras are VERY tasty and a good spin off the typical flatbreads at many restaurants now. 

Brunch here on Saturdays or Sundays-- great drink specials too.
