i went to this place yesterday and i have to day that it is the best service ever!!!! i have a 2 years old baby girl and she was with me and they were very nice to her. she was moving the lil chairs around while they were doing my pedicure and very gentle the lady there told her to stop and sit her on the massage chair... i felt a lil embarrassed for what my baby was doing but thjey were very understanding. 


back to the nails.....my hands look amazing and my pedicure is awesome!!!!1
