We recently celebrated an anniversary at Durant's, and I still swear by it.  Best steak in Phoenix, +1 star for atmosphere, +1 star for service (top notch all the way around).  +1 for the meat, oh so good.  +1 for the bar.  Can I just go ahead and give it 10 stars?  It is, indeed, as good as it gets!

The ribeye is just fantastic.
