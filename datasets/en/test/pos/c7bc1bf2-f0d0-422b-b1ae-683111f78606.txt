The best HAZELNUT flavor drinks of all kind here!  I got the regular ultimate hazelnut and it tastes exactly as I remembered it when I last had Coffee Bean & Tea in Honolulu.  My absolute favorite coffee shop!  As a gift, I also picked up some of their pom & blueberry tea packets.  Perfect to take back to the office. 

Two people were working.  One was taking orders and prompt to greet people.  The other was making drinks.  There was about 5 customers and the service was quick and friendly.  

Drinks and the level of service is consistant with all their locations.  Even when its out of state.
