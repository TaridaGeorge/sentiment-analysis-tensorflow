I can see why this sushi bar constantly makes the top 3 places to get amazing sushi. They have a great happy hour with options that you can't find anywhere else. The spicy tuna crunch is so good. The drinks are delicious too. 

I've been there once on a date and not only was the sushi AMAZING but my boyfriend got a filet which melted in your mouth. The atmosphere of the restaurant has a very hip retro feel and I can't wait to go back!
