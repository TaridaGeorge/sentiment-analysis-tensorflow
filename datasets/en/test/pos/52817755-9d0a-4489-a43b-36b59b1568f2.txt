I've been going since they opened. I love this place bc they are always friendly and they carry my dog's brand of food. Even though PetSmart started carrying her food, this is the place I always come back to. My dog needs solid, strong toys and this place ALWAYS has the best toys for her. This is my go to place for fresh baked treats, dinner and toys for my puppy friend.
