Homemade cookies and homemade ice creams, two delicious snacks married together to make one over the top delicious dessert. They are big enough to share and cost as much as one scoup of ice cream at the big chain next door. 

My new favorite is two sugar cookies with rich and delicious german chocolate cake ice cream! Yes...german chocolate cake ice cream!

Go, and go now.
