Wow! Service at is FINEST! They were quick, easy to work with, and they know there stuff! I had some challenges with two of my tires, and they not only provided great customer service, but fast service as well. My husband was also having issues with his tires and he took his vehicle to the dealership and one other automotive shop and they wanted to charge him a ton of money to fix it. We went to this Discount Tire and they fixed it and they were by far the cheapest! Come to this Discount Tire for great service!
