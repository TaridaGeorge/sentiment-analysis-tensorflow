My favorite place to eat in Tempe!   I love love love LOVE Four Peaks.  The food is delicious.  The beer is even better.  Every single thing I have ordered to eat from this place has been delectable.  This is the kind of place I will even gladly order soup and salad at, and I'm not even a soup and salad kind of person.  They have about 10 different types of dressings for salads, and yummy soups that change daily.  Overall, a wonderful place and a must-visit if you are in the area.

Favorite Beers: Arizona Peach Ale, Hefeweizen, Sunbru
Favorite menu items: Arizona Chicken Rolls, Jalapeno Popper Burger, Turkey Club, Chicken Salad Pita, Salmon BLT (and I don't even like fish normally!)
