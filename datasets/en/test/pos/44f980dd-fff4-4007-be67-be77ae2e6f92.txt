Wow.. It took me 12 years after living in Chandler to finally discover this place.. Damn!   I have tried brisket, turkey and chicken and all have been great so far. If you like sandwiches the bread is terrific too.  Nothing bad about this place except for the long line waiting to be served.  Just try to go during off peak times or you'll be waiting for 15-20 minutes.  It's cafeteria style of course...
