READ THIS REVIEW BEFORE DOING BUSINESS WITH ADVANCED AUTO! 

Nobody likes paying to have their vehicle repaired. If you're like me, you're clueless when it comes to cars.

I have had the best repair experience of all time with Mike and his team over at Advanced Auto. They worked closely with my extended warranty company, and figured everything out for me. They were not pushy with upsells, kept me informed the entire time, and had my car in and out in a very short amount of time.

Do your business here. You won't regret it.
