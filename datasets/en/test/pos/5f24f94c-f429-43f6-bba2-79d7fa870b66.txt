I went here for lunch with my bf. If you bike here or walk, they give a 20% discount or something. Check in on foursquare and use your amex card for 5$ off.

 It was a casual afternoon. I had the trout and he had the happy hour fish and chips. Our food was delicious. I think the only thing I had a bit of complaint was I felt a bit rushed. However, the food and drinks are amazing. The fish and chips were fresh and so crispy. The trout dish had green beans and peanuts. I ordered mash as a side too. Fish was seasoned perfectly and green beans were crunchy not soggy. 

 Overall,  I had a great experience and will return!
