I LOVE THIS PLACE! First off, it's like walking into a book when you walk through the door. It's so cozy and homey...... sigh. I wish I could be there now.

They have great coffee, tea, meals, and little snack/desert bars. TRY THE MAGIC BAR!!! SO GOOD!!!

There yoga classes are also great! 

If you ever get the chance, go!
