As a dude who loves Sandwiches, this is the place that made me love sandwiches in the first place. I love spicy food and I can eat the Jamaican Red at least once a week. Oh, that's right. I always do. Add some Mountain Dew and the best Rice Krispie Treats, outside of my own, and you've got my favorite sandwich place ever.

I also hear the pizza sub is good. I just can't be bothered not to have a Jamaican Red.
