These are definitely 5-star brownies!!!  They used to have a blondie flavor that was to die for.  It tasted like just biting into a chunk of brown sugar *drool*.  I wish they would get that one back.

I have ordered these brownies multiple, multiple, multiple times and they are always consistently amazing.  When I have dealt with Customer Service about a slip up in an order, or mailing, they have gone above and beyond to make up for any troubles encountered.  Top notch customer service, for sure.

My favorite flavors:  Toffee, Espresso Nib, Mint,  Chocolate Chip & Raspberry.  But let's be honest, they're all amazing.  I always keep them in the freezer, and never let them sit out for longer than a couple of minutes before I enjoy one.
