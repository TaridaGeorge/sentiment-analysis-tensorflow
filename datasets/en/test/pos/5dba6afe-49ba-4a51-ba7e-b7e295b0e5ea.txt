I've been to more than a few frozen yogurt places in my years, and this one is by far my favorite. The best one in the valley that I'm aware of. I drive all the way from the East Valley to get here!

Between my girlfriend and I, we sampled most of the flavors. They are ALL delicious! You will not disappointed. My favorite is the Butterfinger...with lots of Butterfinger candy on top. Mmmm! But there is enough variety here to satisfy any craving.
