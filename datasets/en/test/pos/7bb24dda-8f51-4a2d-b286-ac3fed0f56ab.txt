When I heard about the restaurant while getting my haircut, it sounded very intriguing and interesting.  When I heard that the chef/owner was a one man show, I truly wondered how the service would be.  I pictured an "I love Lucy episode."  Well, I went last night and my world was rocked, so much in fact that selfishly I didn't want to tell more people.  I know, I know it's not about me, so here I am writing, It ROCKED! The ambiance, the service, the artistry of the plate, the quality of the taste of the food was ALL AMAZING!  Icing on the cake, the "one man show, chef/owner, Christopher was also very warm, funny, quick witted and on TOP of it all.  I'll be back!" Marc G.
