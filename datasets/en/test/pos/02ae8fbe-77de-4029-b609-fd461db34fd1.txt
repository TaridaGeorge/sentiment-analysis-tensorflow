There isn't a better place to take a date in Phoenix.  The owners are always present and welcome guests as old friends.  The patio is absolutely gorgeous and has live music on the weekends.  The inside is a bit cramped, but is bursting with ambiance - low lights, gorgeous wood bar, local art.

And the food... Skip the wait at Pizzeria Bianco and come here instead.  Trust me on this one.  The pizza is delicious and you haven't lived until you've tried the Burrata.

Five stars.
