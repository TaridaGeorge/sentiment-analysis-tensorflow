No matter what you're craving, Pita Jungle can not only fulfill it, but it won't make you feel like crap after you eat it!
I've eaten here once and the ambiance is really great! It's usually crowded but not too loud. Everyone that works here are incredibly friendly, as well.
Most of the time, I just get to-go orders. They have salads that are to-die for. 

Lately I've been eating Paleo so food choices are limited, if not impossible, when I'm going out to eat. Not here! They have something for everyone no matter your diet (gluten-free, vegetarian, paleo, etc.)  

To sum it up, you can't go wrong with the Jungle.
