THIS IS THE BEST STEAKHOUSE -- I am in love. Everything is AMAZING. We started off with the ahi tuna tartare and it was delicious! I absolutely enjoyed every bite. And the bone-in fillet is a MUST. There is nothing quite like it. The marrow juice glazes the cut giving it a unique flavorful juice. Next was the lobster mashed potato and that was HUGE - mixed with butter and garlic with real chunks of lobster. We had sauteed mushrooms for sides. The amount of food for two people was overwhelming. AND for someone, like myself, who does not like to take leftovers back -- we attempted to devour everything and still managed to save enough room for the chocolate raspberry cake. Thick dark chocolate cake topped with chocolate syrup and a couple strawberries. DELICIOUS.
