Finally a gelato shop that rivals THE Gelato Spot in Scottsdale. I went to the one in tucson years ago so its nice that they finally opened one up nearby.

Clean, cool, and fresh atmosphere. It's in a good location at the San Tan Village and is open late (well comparably late to everything else in Gilbert) til 10pm.

The service is friendly, samples galore, they bring you water and they KNOW their gelato. The service here tops that of the gelato spot. 

As for the taste, it's pretty damn good. I really enjoy the stracciatella and hazelnut. Don't really care for the sea salt caramel or the amaretto. Either way, if you're in the area don't do dessert at any of the restaurants - come here instead. Great way to cool off with a treat.
