I LOVE me some good donuts.  My husband and I have even ran all over Phoenix in search of donuts only to find that most of the stores were either out of business or closed for the day, at 11 am.  Ugh.  One day I was craving donuts, this is not unusual, and on the way to my mother-in-law's house my husband pulled off the freeway and into the parking lot of Lamar's.  We were greeted by the warm and cozy smell of fresh donuts.  After looking over their rather impressive collection of delectable looking donuts, I narrowed it down to a maple bar, always my favorite, and a fritter of some type of fruit.  My donuts were absolutely delicious.  They were fresh and tasty.  They were super soft and yummy inside.  Lamar's is a fantastic place for donuts.  The cashiers are always nice too.
