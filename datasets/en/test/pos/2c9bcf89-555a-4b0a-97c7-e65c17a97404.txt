We live around the corner from this lovely little establishment. Best pizza in Phoenix. Most unique for sure. Our favorite is to get half rocket man and half roasted corn with chicken on the whole thing. The pimento cheese dip is surprisingly to die for. The commuter sandwich is the best breakfast option.
