I brought the family to share in my delight this time. We ordered the "Fam-a-ree" special. 

Egg drop soup. Good, but have you ever really had bad soup? 
Won-tons. I could go with out 
Crab puff. I heard they could be a dessert they are so good. 
Egg Roll. Better this time to me 

Chicken lomein. boring but good 
Honey Chicken. good 
Beef and Broccoli. Really good 
Sweet and Sour pork. Eh it was OK 
Cashew Chicken. Really good 
Fried Rice and White rice both good. 

Needless to say we came home with a ton of leftovers.
