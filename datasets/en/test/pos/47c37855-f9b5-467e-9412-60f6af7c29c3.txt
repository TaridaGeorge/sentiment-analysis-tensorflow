Susan (and Laura) are fantastic at what they do.  Susan did a fantastic job with our two Border Collies and Mini Doxie (who normally will pose until the cows come home).  

If you are looking for the best in Photography, don't look any further.  I recommend A Dog's LIfe to everyone I talk to wanting photos of their kids done.  But don't think A Dog's Life is all about the mighty dollar either, they've done a tremendous amount of work with rescue groups too.  Their hearts are in the right spot with talent to spare.
