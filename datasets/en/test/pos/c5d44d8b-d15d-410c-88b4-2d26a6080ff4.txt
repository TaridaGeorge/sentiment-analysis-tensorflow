Kudos to Susan's Oct 16, '10 Open House - I've been going to Susan for many years. She's a great dematologist and her office and staff are the best. Her Open Houses ...OMG! I won the very best raffle prize today - a $1350 Fraxel Hand Rejuvenation Treatments (3 in all!). Always a lot to see, sales reps to talk to, demos, samples, Susan's informative talks, refreshments/sweets, and ...oh yes! She donated $5000 to "Crossroads, Inc" Charity today. Don't miss her next Open House - a 20% discount if you bring a friend with you. Pre-buying treatments and products just makes sense!
