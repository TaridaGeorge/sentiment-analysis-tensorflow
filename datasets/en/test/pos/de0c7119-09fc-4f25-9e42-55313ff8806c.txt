I used to live in Mesa a while back and this was one of my favorite places to eat right over in Gilbert.  Locally owned and oh so delicious.  I think their pulled pork and beef brisket are the best in town.  I still give the Blue Ribbon trophy for pork ribs to Famous Daves.

The sides here are also very good...everything is homemade and I'd recommend you try a Stuffed Baked Potato....they give you what seems like a 10 pound potato with all the fixings...and just when you think the tray will break from the sheer weight of it...they pack it full of whatever meat you want.  I would not recommend eating this thing on a lunch unless you have a very understanding boss for when you fall asleep at 2pm.

I wish I dident live so far away now. I have no decent BBQ near me...:(
