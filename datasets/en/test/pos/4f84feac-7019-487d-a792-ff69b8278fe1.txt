I am a vegetarian who is also allergic to dairy.  If you have an allergy, you understand how annoying it is to go out to eat places.  With Green, I don't have to worry about this.  The best part is, the food is amazing!!! I literally crave this place at least 4 times a week.  If you go, you must try the fake chx - I think I am addicted. I should honestly go to FCAA (Fake Chx Addiction Anonymous).  Don't forget to top the meal off with a tSoynami - absolutely TO DIE FOR!  Thank you Damon for creating such amazing food.  One complaint... BE OPEN ON SUNDAYS :D
