This is a second time to this new location...  Guess what????  It's still great...  The family hit the store about 11:00 this morning and we had the place to ourself... Don't know if its because of the long weekend or the ASU students haven't found it yet...
Food was hot & good, service was great, place was clean and neat...

ASU, students your missing out on this place... old Devil...
