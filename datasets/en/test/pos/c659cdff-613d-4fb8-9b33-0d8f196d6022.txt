Kerry is one of those people born to her profession. Part clinician, part Zen mama - Kerry knows her craft and makes your visit a de-stressing experience. My husband who wouldn't notice if I shaved my head told me my skin looks MUCH better. Reduced pores, evened out skin tone and HYDRATED - for the first time, I am proud of my skin!
