I was really surprised how quickly they addressed an in grown toe-nail. I went in for what I thought would be a quick consultation, but I was in & out of the office in less than and hour with my in-grown nail removed. In addition the staff and the doctor were warm and engaging. I would highly  recommend this practice to anyone experiencing a similar issue. Plus if you're sports fan, there is plenty of great memorabilia to check out.
