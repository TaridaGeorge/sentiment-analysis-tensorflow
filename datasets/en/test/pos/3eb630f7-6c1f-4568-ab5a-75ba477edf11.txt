Lil' update:  The veggie koo koo is amazing, kind of like an Iranian quiche or frittata, less eggy though and more herby.  Delicious and healthy.  

The hummus is also made by hand and is wonderful.

When I walked in there were 5 Tempe cops finishing up their lunch.  You know a place is good if cops eat there in groups.  

Perfect for lunch.
