I also have been cautious of banfield but since I've been going to the 90th st and shea location, me and my doggies have never been happier. The entire staff is super friendly, Dr Blackman is the most caring and wonderful vet I've ever encountered, she could even handle my old dog Mo when every other vet clinic told me he was a bad dog and to never bring him back. I love them and will always bring my dogs there :)
