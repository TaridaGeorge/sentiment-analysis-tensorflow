This place never fails to impress. Every time I have friends or relatives visiting from out of town I take them here and consistently hear compliments about it. Not only is the food fabulous, but the bartenders are probably the best I've seen around town. It's always a breath of fresh air when you see someone actually enjoying what they do for work rather than moping around waiting for the time to pass. Bravo to this crew and to the music that seems to keep the atmosphere going stong. For those that think its too loud-turn your hearing aid down a bit.  And for those with one bad experience which I could'nt imagine -you're the ones missing out...especially wiht their INSANE happy hour!
