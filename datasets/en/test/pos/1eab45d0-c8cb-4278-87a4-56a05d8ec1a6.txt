This is my favorite brewery in AZ.  The food is good (I had the SoCal Burrito w/ shrimp) and the beer is even better.  I love all the beer, but my favorite by far is the Devil's Ale.  They serve the beer in a pretty awesome looking glass, which you can buy, and the beer will be 1/2 off with the purchase of a glass.
Olympia is the best waitress they have.  She is really knowledgeable about ALL beer and she's friendly.  Ask to be in her section if you go.
After the brewery, there are tons of places and little shops to visit.  The San Tan Brewery is right in the heart of downtown Chandler.  There is a winery across the street you can probably tour.
