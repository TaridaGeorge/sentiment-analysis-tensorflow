Roland hit the nail on the head here.... BREAD.  Bread is the most import part of Italian Sandwiches.  Niccoli's has it to perfection.  Everything about Niccoli's reminds me of my Italian neighborhood in Toronto where speaking in English was never needed at the local market, doctors, bakeries, service shops, or church.  It was little Italy.  

Niccoli's has some of the best tasting food in town and it is locally onwed-- which is very nice.  PLUS, it's next to Burland Jewelry.... so pick up a Mortadella Sandwich AND some diamond studded earrings all  in one stop = HEAVEN ;o)
