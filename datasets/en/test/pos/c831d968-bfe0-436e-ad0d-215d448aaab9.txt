Gosh what can I say?  I appreciate foreign and low budget films.  Camelview 5 has them - you get the point.  Aside from the films the venue is pretty old school and dinky and nowhere close to the super awesome large IMAX Harkins...but that is understandable.  I'm not there for the seats nor am I there for the concession stands.  I give this place the best!
