Dr. Chris Winterholler is a true professional and expert when it comes to the All-On-4 Process.  We started at Clear Choice and after doing a lot of research and getting a consultation with Dr. Chris we were sold.  He took us through the whole process and made us feel comfortable with what was about to happen.  It is truly amazing what he can accomplish.  He does it all, the surgery, restoration, maintenance and hygiene visits.  My husband had a severe overbite and Dr. Chris was able to completely change my husband's life in one day!  To top it all off he has a fantastic staff!  Thank you Dr. Winterholler.
