THIS IS ANTONIO'S FROM AMHERST MASSACHUSETTS.   as a UMASS graduate i was amazed to see our local pizza place out here when i moved here in 1997.  The pictures on the wall are of the UMASS location.  Antonio's sold the recipe to some grads who took it to arizona and brought the north east flavor to the desert.  

This is real NY style pizza.  The bbq chicken is my favorite.  chicken, bacon and bbq sauce turn a pizza snack into a pizza meal.  Lines are long but service is so quick it moves nicely.  Best place in Arizona to get real pizza!
