My husband surprised me for my birthday by introducing me to Caf√© Monarch.  This was the most incredible dining experience that I have ever encountered.  Chef Chris is an artist, magician and conductor of an orchestra of one.  It really is something you must experience
 
The ingredients are simple but he turns them into a work of art.  The excitement of what will come to the table next makes the evening fun. The food was beautiful and outstanding!   It really is something you must experience for yourself.  We can't quit telling people about our experience.
