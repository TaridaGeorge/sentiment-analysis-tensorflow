Wow - I was a little concerned going for the first time as the surrounding area is interesting - but this is a classic case of "don't judge a book by it's cover".  My friend and I both had the Cuban and it lives up to the prior reviews - just amazing.  The potato salad and pasta salad side dishes also were homemade and gourmet style - not your grandmas potato salad - much better!  We each had scoops of the homemade ice cream ( i had coconut rum) which were outstanding as well.  Service was friendly and prompt -not enough stars for this place!  Can't wait to go back...
