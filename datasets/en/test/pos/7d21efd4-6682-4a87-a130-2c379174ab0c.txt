This is my absolute favorite brewery.
Customers sit in the same building as the brewing vats and the atmosphere is just buzzing with conversations.

I have a little tradition here. I start with the Hefeweizen, then move on to the Kiltlifter, then finish off with the Oatmeal Stout. Then maybe another stout, then another, okay, just one more.

The food is also top notch. Everything from the nachos to the beer battered fries to the beer bread is good. I've tried them all. They also have a different list of dinner specials every night.

If you're into beer this is a place you can't miss.
