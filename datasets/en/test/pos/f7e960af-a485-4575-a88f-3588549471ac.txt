I have seen Robert 3 times so far and he has proven to me that he is an incredibly talented massage therapist. He has helped me so much in relieving tension and pain from prior sports injuries and I continue to see Robert because he produces results. I highly recommend Robert and I feel very fortunate to have met him.
