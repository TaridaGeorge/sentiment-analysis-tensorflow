SO SIMPLE, & SO DELICIOUS!  (ZERO AMBIANCE!) 

A Street Vendor & Only One Item On This Menu:
Hot Dogs Soaked With Bacon, & on the side there is Guacamole, Cream Cheese, Beans, & Several Salsas to choose from! Followed by a Mexican bottled Coca-Cola; the glass bottle & the cane sugar makes a huge difference in taste!

That's it!
