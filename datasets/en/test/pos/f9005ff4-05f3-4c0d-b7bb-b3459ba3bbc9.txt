I've been coming here for a few years. I have a lot of work shoes, primarily leather and fabric-covered pumps.  They've done a great job fixing the heels and the tips of the shoes.  I've also had them repair straps and small tears in the front of the shoe.  All of the repairs they have done have been top quality.  Prices are very reasonable as well.
