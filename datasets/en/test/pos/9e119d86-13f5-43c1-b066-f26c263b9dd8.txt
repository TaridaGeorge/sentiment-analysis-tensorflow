BEST happy hour ever!!  It's sort of hidden but has a great bar area and patio.  I dont know about the regular dinner but it looks formal and the bar is great and relaxing.  It'salways fun to try to watch someone order/eat the "Big A$$ Burger."  I thought the scallops were great.   Expect it to be packed anytime after 4:30.
