This was the first place that I tried wings post-vegetarianism and I loved them.  Hundreds of wings and a few years later, I still think they are pretty awesome.  Meaty wings, soaked in Harp, covered in sauce very similar to Franks - mmm, so tasty.  Everything else is good too, but I go back for the wings.  

Irish beers on tap - Harp, Smithwick's (Shmittick's) and the obligatory Guiness - as well as a plethora of other libations.  I adore the waitress who always seems to serve us, with her m'love's and Irish mom ways.  She accidentally gave us our drink bill, without the food included.  When we pointed out the mistake, she brought back a bill sans wings.  Maybe she forgot about the wings, maybe she was repaying our honesty, but either way we tipped well and were grateful.
