I manage a restaurant in San Diego (a tough market) and FEZ has successfully conquered the barrier between a good burger and what I would call AMAZING! 

I give 5 stars because of the really friendly staff, the precisely mixed cocktails, and the AMAZING food. Make sure you add the garlic and rosemary fries!
