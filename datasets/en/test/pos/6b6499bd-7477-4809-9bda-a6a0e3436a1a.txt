I absolutely love this Target. It is a hop, skip, and a jump away from my apartments and super convenient. They always seem to have what I am looking for. The staff is friendly and there to help. I didn't even have to search to find an employee to help me, they are pretty much everywhere. They even had a college night last week where they closed the store down and let ASU students come in and shop their butts off. They were pretty wiped out when I came in last week because of all the kids moving in but they replenished everything that night. As you can see by my amount of check-ins this is where I do most of my shopping and I will continue to do that as long as I am going to ASU!
