Great food...check, Great atmosphere...check, reasonable prices...check! How can you go wrong with Cibo. This is one of my favorite places for lunch downtown. I have been there numerous times and I am never disappointed. 

I always tend to have the Salciccia sandwich which is sausage, onions, peppers and mozzarella cheese with a great house salad.  At dinner they serve delicious pizza.

The wait staff is always nice and very helpful. This is a great date place if you want to avoid all the chain places that occupy most of Phoenix.  Definitely try it out.
