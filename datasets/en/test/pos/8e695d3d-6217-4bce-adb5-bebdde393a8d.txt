I just went to the official Grand Opening of Jam last night and was thrilled to watch Scottsdale's Mayor Lane cut the ribbon.   The house was full to the brim and a great band was jammin out back.  The owner, Shauna, is super sweet and energetic and really makes everyone feel at home in her space.

If you haven't been,  Jam is an absolutely adorable space with unique one of a kind retail.  Local artists showcase their works and it is so nice to walk into a store and see so many different and cool things.   I know this will be THE spot everyone goes to from now on.  It is such a great concept and the classes sound really amazing too.  I highly recommend that you check it out!
