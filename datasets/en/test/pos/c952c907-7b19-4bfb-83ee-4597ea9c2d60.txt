When I have the craving for pizza, which isn't that often, Z Pizza is the best spot in Central Phoenix.  Our guilty pleasure is ordering on Tuesday nights when it's buy one, get the second for $5 (or is it half-price?  some kind of great deal)....and eating pizza while we watch Biggest Loser.  I'm always a fan of pepperoni, and their crust is crispy thin...the best way.  Also like the Casablanca...artichoke hearts, mushrooms, ricotta, parmesan, mozzarella...so tasty.  Great to have Gluten-free crust as an option, and the ingredients are fresh.  Yes, it's a small west coast chain...but they do it "right".   Friendly staff, speedy service, easy location.
