Wow, I was impressed!  Upper Crust is a family style restaurant; the owner and staff are very interactive and make every guest feel right at home.  

We ordered a 'small' pizza and a 'personal' calzone; both were absolutely delicious. The ingredients were fresh and the service was excellent, it felt like I ate a million calories but I guess that's always what if feels like when you eat something this good.

The portions are huge so expect to have leftovers!
