This was my first trip to a Pita Jungle .. but it definitely won't be my last!  The service was great.  And the food was better!  I had the salad with seared tuna, my friend had the black bean burger and we split a sampler plate of hummus.  The hummus was incredible!  Everything else was great too.   

We'll definitely be back ..
