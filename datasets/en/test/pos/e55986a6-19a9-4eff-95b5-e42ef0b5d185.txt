This is a must stop for us when we're downtown Chandler. The employees are super nice.   Cool shirts, dresses, costume jewelry and shoes!  I also love their many collections of bags and purses. Great shopping for gifts and for yourself.   Oh, and check out their clearance rack in the back!

Love this local shop!
