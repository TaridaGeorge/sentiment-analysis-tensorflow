I can't comment on the hiking trail itself as I've only done the drive up AZ 88, but Canyon Lake is absolutely gorgeous. I've always wanted to do the hike, but don't quite have the proper gear. Word of caution: AZ 88 is fairly treacherous in some parts; I wouldn't advise doing this drive without a four-wheel drive.
