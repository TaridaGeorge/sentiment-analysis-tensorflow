This place reminds me of Phoenix of old, as in 15 years ago.  Campy but fun.  Beginning with the name which is a pun on Carlsbad Cavern and the bat motif, complete with a corny yet fun newsletter you'll find on your table.  

The food is awesome.  Don't know of any New Mexican that compares either in Phoenix or Tucson.  The carne adovada is out of sight.  Portions are large at reasonable prices.
