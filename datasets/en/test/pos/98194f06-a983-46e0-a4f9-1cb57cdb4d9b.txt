I love this place. Excellent value for money. Great service. Wide range of selections. Lot's of them vegetarian. Plus, they have a 'fit fare' menu that's pretty delicious too. I would particularly recommend the Veggie Skillet.
What I like the most about this place though is the fact that it's always open!! Literally always, 24*7 even on Thanksgiving, Christmas, New year's day.
