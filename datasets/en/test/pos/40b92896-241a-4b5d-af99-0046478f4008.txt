It has been difficult to find a Chinese restaurant in the Chandler area that has really great hot and sour soup - Chen's definitely has the best recipe we have found since living in the San Francisco Bay Area.  We really like the Orange Chicken, egg rolls, soup and salad that is served on their lunch menu.  Also, the prices are very reasonable for lunch!  Hope you try it and enjoy it.
