I love this place! The food is amazing.... mashed potatoes, cream corn and wine.. HEAVEN... the dumplings are amazing, the artichoke is awesome, and of course the chicken is divine! The wine choices are fantastic and I love the small quaint interior. I ONLY wish you were closer, I would grab a chicken dinner to go more often!
