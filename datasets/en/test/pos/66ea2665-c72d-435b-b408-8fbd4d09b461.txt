My family love this place for their Bibimpap! Being vegetarian, they allow us to omit the meat and substitute it for tofu! Their fried rice is tasty as well! Each person is served with miso soup and there are Korean side dishes to share! Service is great and they are always welcoming. Note: I would stay clear of some of the side dishes if you are not familiar with Korean food. I prefer the potato, cabbage and cucumber kimchi!
