I went here on Friday night and had an excellent time. Our waitress was extremely friendly and attentive and the food was phenomenal. We got an order of wings and the firecracker spinach artichoke chicken (I think that's what it was called). If for nothing else, I will be returning to eat that again! They had a big open room wit pool tables that you can rent, so we played for a bit. Although I suck, it was still pretty fun and the tables were nice. After our meal, the manager came over t ask us how everything was and gave us a card for a free appetizer on our next visit. 

This was the best food, service and overall great dining experience I have had in a while. I will definitely be back!
