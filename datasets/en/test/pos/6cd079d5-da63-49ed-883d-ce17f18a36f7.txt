Tryst is a hidden gem that everyone should try at least once in their lifetime. I was amazed at their decore , service and food presentation of this fabulous and delicious ORGANIC food that simply tastes out of this world. I never knew organic meals tasted that much more appetizing ; their menu from breakfast to dinner are extremely flavorfull and addicting. Once you taste  good organic food  in Tryst , you no longer want to return to hormone and pesticide laced food products. The operators of this place are extremely helpfull and accomodating ; it's owner , who introduced himself to our group is very knowlegeable and funny at the same time. I would visit this restaurant everytime I'm in phoenix . My hats off to the staff and food at TRYST.
