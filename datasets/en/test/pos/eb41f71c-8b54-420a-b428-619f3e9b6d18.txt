After reading all the reviews I decided to give it a try today as I drove into work and I am happy I did!  I ordered a medium Carmelizer for a little less than $5 and wow was it good!  The staff was extremely kind and cheerful.   She asked if I had a stamp card and told her it was my first time so she stamped most of the card which was sweet!
