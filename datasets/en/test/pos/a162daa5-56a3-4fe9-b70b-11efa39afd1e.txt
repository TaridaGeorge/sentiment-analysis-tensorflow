Went in for dinner a couple weeks ago with my mother and infant son. They got me seated right away, with a high chair in tow! Everyone was very accommodating, especially considering my son. Most servers scoff at having children but our server was wonderful with him!

me and my mother split the house salad and she had the pasta with eggplant, and i had the shell pasta with ham. All dishes were delicious and full of favor. Wine was very reasonably priced as well. 

For being a busy night the place seemed really calm. Love this place and can't wait to come back for more!
