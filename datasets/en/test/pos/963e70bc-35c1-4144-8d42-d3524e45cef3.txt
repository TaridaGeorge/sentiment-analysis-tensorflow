Ice cream and yogurt--step aside and exit please.  This place is tops in my book.  Their are tons of flavors to choose from, you can also take in some samples and they have a flavor of the month.  Seating indoors is a little limited but when the weather is decent plenty of spots outside to people watch and check out eye candy.  This is perfect way to skip the dessert at whatever restaurant you are at, and get one much more flavorful and worth the price.  My favorite flavors to date are the Roche and the Vanilla bean, perfect contrast.  Staff is friendly and the music is kind of loungy.  I've also Gelato from other spots and it is no match, this is the most creamiest, flavorful gelato I've had to date.
