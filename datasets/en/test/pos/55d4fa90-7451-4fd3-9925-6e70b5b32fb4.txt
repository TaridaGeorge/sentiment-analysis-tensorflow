As an avid sushi lover, I can proudly say this is my ultimately favorite sushi place. My boyfriend and I are always on the hunt for good sushi places and were thrilled when we stumbled upon this place! 

The location was a bit difficult to find and park at when it's busy. The atmosphere is quaint but cozy. We typically sit at the sushi bar where service is great.

The rolls are unusually large (it takes me two bites to finish just one piece!) and the price for these rolls are inexpensive. I recommend the philidelphia roll. The salmon is always abundant and you can taste the smokiness.

In comparison to the chain Ra Sushi, Sakana's rolls are fresher, larger, and cheaper. 

Best. Sushi. Ever!
