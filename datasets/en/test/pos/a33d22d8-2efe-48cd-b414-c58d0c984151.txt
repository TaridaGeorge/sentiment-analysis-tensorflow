Alright, so you can get coffee anywhere, right? Then let's talk about everything else....

You really can't beat the friendly baristas and great customer service at this location.

I've been a regular here for a few years now and for good reason! Besides it's convienient location, they are SUPER fast when making drinks and if there's a line it moves pretty quickly. And the staff, I cannot say enough good things about them! They are all super nice and always have a smile on my face. 

Be warned though, it does get very busy here in the morning so make sure to allow yourself enough time if you are heading to work.

They've got a great patio too that expands around the whole building!

Sometimes, too, they'll be able to tell if I want an extra espresso shot in my drink even before I've said so. Haha!
