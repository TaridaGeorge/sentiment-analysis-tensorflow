I really love this store. I always hit up their sale rack and usually find something cute for $40 and under. The petites section is a nice touch for us short gals and the staff is always really friendly to me. I don't look like the typical Ann Taylor customer (oh no piercings and tattoos) yet they treat me the same as anyone else.
