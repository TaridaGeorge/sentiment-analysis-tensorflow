I took my 4runner in for a general tune up and some preventative maintenance. They were extremely friendly. They took their time to explain my options in a way that made sense to me and the final bill was reasonable. They were courteous of my time, so I didn't have to wait around at all. Also, when I had some questions about something after the service, they were great. I was invited back to the shop where they listened to my concern and double checked that everything was okay...and it was. Thanks Whitey's!
