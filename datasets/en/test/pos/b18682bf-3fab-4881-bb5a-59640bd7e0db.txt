Ridiculous place...there's just so much fabric to choose from that, if you're a fabric whore like myself, you could be in here for half the day.  I can't control myself around fabric...so those of you who belong to FLA (Fabric Lovers Anonymous) know I've broken down in here and bought fabric like five years ago that I still haven't used but promised I would find something to use it for someday or if not you can bury me with it.

ahem...anyway...great for cheap awesome finds.  much better than schlepping out to BFE to go to JoAnn's.  Gigantic rolls of fabrics and some hard to find items--like black out material for our curtains.  Ribbon selection is huge.  Staff can be kind of brusque but only because they're swamped with work, but they are helpful when it's your turn.  Would highly recommend it!!
