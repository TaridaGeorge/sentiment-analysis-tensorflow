I really enjoyed working with Amerizona. They came to our house to give us an estimate. They were very friendly, knowledgable, and answered our questions. Once we decided to order the sunscreens they came out the next day to measure. The service guy was by quick. Originally they quoted us 3 weeks to get everything done, but they were so amazing the screens were installed the following week! The screens look beautiful and I've already noticed a difference in the temperature of our house (since its been hot already!) I'm so glad I used them!
