This is a beautiful facility. I just saw my first show in the Ikeda theater last week and was impressed at how comfortable and spacious it was. After exploring as much as possible before the show and during intermission, we discovered the art galleries and the gift store which were equally stunning. The fountain, the landscaping, all of it is a treat for the eye. This is such an elegant evening out, anytime a show comes here in the future that I want to see, I'm getting tickets immediately!
