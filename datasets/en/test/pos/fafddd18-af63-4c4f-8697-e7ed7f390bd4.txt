Here is all I can say about this place:

* Phenomenal ambiance 
* Top notch service
* Delicious food

Everything I tried was excellent and there wasn't one thing I wouldn't order again.  I could eat a bucket of the mac n' cheese alone.

Chef Beau Macmillian stopped by our table which was awesome.  He really is a great person and excellent chef.

Also, the Edge Bar is one of my all time favorite bars and when the weather is nice I can sit out there all day and all night sipping drinks and enjoying the view.

Can't say enough great things about this place.  I can't wait to return.
