What's not to like about ice cream (unless you have a lactose allergy, of course!).  The inside is adorable and it offers a ton of ice cream options, so there's something for everyone.  Great staff here as well...our server was fabulous!  To the reviewers complaining about cleanliness...I have a bit of OCD--especially at restaurants.  Was the bathroom the cleanest/nicest I've ever used?  No--I would say more "old" than "dirty", but at least it worked and had soap (ever been to a restaurant where there's no soap in the bathroom...how gross.).  I didn't notice any crumbs on the floor or on seat cushions...In my opinion though, I'd rather have crumbs on the floor than have someone sweeping or vacuuming next to me while I'm trying to eat.
