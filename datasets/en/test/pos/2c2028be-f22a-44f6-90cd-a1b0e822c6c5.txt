I brought my stepdaughter (Kenzie) here for labor day and the place was packed! My stepdaughter is 10 years old and an adventurous eater and I have been wanting to come back for dim sum and she offered to come with me.  We got there and she was asking how it worked and if it would take long for the food to come out, I just told her to sit and wait and voila not even 2 mins later a lady came to our table with the cart.  At first Kenzie seemed alittle put off but tried the sticky rice and spare ribs she loved it! The food was good, I wish we had more of a selection but I have to remember we came when the place was full and food was flying off the carts.
