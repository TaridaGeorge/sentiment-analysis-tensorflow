I wish that we lived in Scottsdale just so that we could frequent this store. Yup, that's how much I loved this place. I tagged along on a business trip, and I happened to find this store!

They've got TONS and TONS and TONS of fun things to browse through. Clothes, accessories, treats, etc. We made sure to pick up a couple of toys for our dogs when we came here, and they absolutely loved them.

The customer service was great too. From the moment I walked into the store, I was greeted. I felt completely welcome. 

If I'm ever in the area, this will definitely be on the must visit list!
