AMAZING PIZZA. Loved everything about it, best I've ever had. Brick oven is the only way to go. My husband if from Pittsburgh and he raved about how good it was. Warm, cozy, friendly, only one drawback. We dropped in on a Monday and forgot they were closed. Darn! Go there you WILL NOT be disappointed. Promise......
