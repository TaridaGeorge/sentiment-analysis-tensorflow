Last night was my second time at Tryst (first time for Breakfast) and I have to say that this place is awesome. Great presentation and great food. I got the Kalua Pork Sandwhich, which comes on a Brioche Bun, and ordered it with a side of Sweet Potato Tots. My wife ordered the Shrimp Tacos, and they were both so tasty. We also had 3 other people in our party and their food looked equally amazing. Will be back, and will be ordering this to-go in the near future!
