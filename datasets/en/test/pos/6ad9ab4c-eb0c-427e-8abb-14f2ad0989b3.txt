Great store and Great location.  Very Friendly staff and I have a lot of luck finding the supplements that I use there.  
They will put stuff aside (if you call ahead of time) and they will order things (if they can)
Definitly a place to check out and WAY WAY WAY BETTER THAN GNC......GNC isn't an option compared to them.  GO THERE!
