I'm very surprised I'm the first to review this awesome West Valley spot.  
I went with a big (14 people) group after a movie last Saturday.  The service was about at full capacity and therefore my drink laid empty a little longer than it should have, but it's not as if anyone was slacking by any means.
With such a big group I was able to sample many dishes and there wasn't a loser in the bunch.  My chicken zingarella was fantastic, as were the stuffed mushrooms.  I must go back to try the gnocchi!
