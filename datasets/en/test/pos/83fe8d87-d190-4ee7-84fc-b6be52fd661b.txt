If your looking for a great little Italian place this is it.  Food is top notch, the service is friendly and caring, and the prices are reasonable. All the pasta dishes we have had have been great as have been the veal dishes.  We have never been disappointed in any of their wine recommendations as well.  Most of the times we have had to walk in we have been turned away so you should make a reservation first.
