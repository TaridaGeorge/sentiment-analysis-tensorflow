This place never disappoints me.  My sister introduced me to this spot, and she usually has the best advice.  I normally get the Veggie Stack with a kale salad and french fries.  Mmmmmmm.  So yummy.  The menu is a lil eclectic...from fried okra (when was the last time you saw fried okra on the menu and you weren't in the south) to a modified version of banh mi (vietnamese sandwich).  I have tried both, the banh mi is just okay.  Love love love this place though.
