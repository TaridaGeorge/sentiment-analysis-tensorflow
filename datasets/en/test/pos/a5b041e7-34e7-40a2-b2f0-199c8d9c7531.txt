I got a membership for this gym a little over a month ago and have been going almost every day since. Compared to my previous gym Bally's, and every other gym I've been to, this gym rocks!

The guy who signed me up and spoke with my dad over the phone was super nice, the facilities are great (far more than I was expecting), and the staff is really nice. Have gone to a few classes here and there and the instructors are very knowledgeable. 

I'd recommend this gym to anyone.
