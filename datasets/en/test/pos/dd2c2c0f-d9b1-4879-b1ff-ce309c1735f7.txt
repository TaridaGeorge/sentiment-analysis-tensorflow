I don't even like coffee... yet I find myself here ALL THE TIME. It is totally out of my way too! Why do I come here? Because the service is OUTSTANDING! Nicest people around! I find myself talking to them like they are my close friends (and I'm a quiet dude...). Great people, great coffee, all around great place to be. Thanks to the great staff, you really do make people's days :)
