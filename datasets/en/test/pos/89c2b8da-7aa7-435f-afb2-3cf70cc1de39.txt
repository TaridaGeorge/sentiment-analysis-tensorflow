One of the few restaurants in the valley that I would recommend out of town guests to check out.  Very few places can make pizza crusts like Bianco.  5 stars despite the horrendous wait time.  If you want a comparable minus the wait time, check out Pomo Pizzeria in Scottsdale.  It's another valley standout.
