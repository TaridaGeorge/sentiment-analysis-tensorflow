We have lived in the Valley since 1997. We've eaten in many Mexican Restaurants - high end to low end. Tee Pee Mexican is the best Mexican Food we have eaten in the 15 plus years. We just went to the Tee Pee in December for the 1st time. We will be repeat customers many times more. We won't be eating in any other Mexican Restaurant from here on. We have found the best Mexican Restaurant in the Valley!!!
The only improvement is they should serve "Fried Ice Cream"!!!
