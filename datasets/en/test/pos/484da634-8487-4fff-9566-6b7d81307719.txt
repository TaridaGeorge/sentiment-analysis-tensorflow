What a gem this place is. Stopped in for lunch and had a Italian Stallion sandwich and my wife had a Roberts Special. Both were outstanding and there were many items on the "hot bar" that I'd love to try so I will definitely be back.

The best part is along with the deli there is an Italian bakery and market. We got a couple of cannolis that were very good. A nice little old italian man (I think the owner) showed us around and we purchased some sauce, meatballs, bread and italian dressing for a big pasta dinner tonight that I've been looking forward to since buying all the stuff.

Highly recommend this place and I sure wish it wasn't so far from our home as I'd love to have access to a place like this on a regular basis.
