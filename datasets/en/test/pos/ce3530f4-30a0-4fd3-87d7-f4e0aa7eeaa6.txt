I hate going to mechanics!! However, Bumper to Bumper was recommended to me by a friend and I've had only good experiences there. I took my car in for a basic repair that only cost me $25, but I expected to pay around $100 for it. I'm glad they were honest and didn't try to upsell me anything...they just fixed what was wrong and did it as inexpensively as possible. Highly recommended!
