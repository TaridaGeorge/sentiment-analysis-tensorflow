I went to a football game here with the bf awhile ago. We had cheap tickets, but still thought that the view was pretty decent even in the nosebleed section. We also parked waaaay out in the boonies, and there was a shuttle service that was easy and accessible. 

The new stadium was clean, has your standard concession stand, and the bathrooms here are the only place where there's a longer line for the men's restroom than the ladies restroom. I've been to a few other stadiums before, and this is by far the nicest. I also dig that its an indoor/outdoor stadium.
