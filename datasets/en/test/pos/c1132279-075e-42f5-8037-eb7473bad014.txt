I was in Phoenix for the weekend and got a massage from John.  It was one of the best massages I've ever had.  He was very professional, yet personable.  His studio is off of his house.

The massage was very thorough and concentrated on the areas I told him needed attention.  The pressure was neither too firm nor too light.  He used a lot of different methods to get my knots out.  I felt completely relaxed, and I had a lot more mobility afterward.  This is day 3 and I still feel great.

I totally recommend!!
