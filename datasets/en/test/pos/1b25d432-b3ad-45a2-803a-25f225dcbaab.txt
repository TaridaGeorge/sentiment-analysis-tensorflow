I have been wanting to go to the one and only "Cambodian" restaurant in the valley for quite a few months and we finally made it and LOVED it from the moment we entered. An aura of love, peace and harmony welcomed us in. LOVED the food!!!!!! It was my husband's 1st adventure  into Cambodian cuisine. He is an adventurous spirit and loves most cuisines so I knew he would treasure the unique flavors of Cambodia. It was cooked by Mom who used to work for Intel. Served by son and daughter. Even though it was busy he found time to converse with us. It was one of those lingering, thought provoking, conversation provoking experiences that stays with you until your next visit.
