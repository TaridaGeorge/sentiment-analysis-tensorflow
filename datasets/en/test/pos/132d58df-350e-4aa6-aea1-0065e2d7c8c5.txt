I really enjoyed the lunch I had at The Orange Table, and the service was actually quite attentive.  The menu has a large variety of sandwiches, burgers and salads. There are additional items available for dinner but I can imagine it is tough to get a table.

We went late in the noon lunch hour and did not have to wait long.  We were assured a couple of times that we would be seated soon but I wasn't too worried as we used the time to read over the very descriptive menu.

I would give it four stars for the great food and friendly service.  The fifth star comes from their great selection of beers.  Beer is just as good to pair with a meal as  wine and The Orange Table obviously recognizes that.  I will definitely be going back.
