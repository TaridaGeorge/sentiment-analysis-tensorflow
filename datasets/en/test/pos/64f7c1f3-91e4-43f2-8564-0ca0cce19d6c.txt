I love this place,the staff is friendly and the prices are way better than whole foods or any other" organic" market.its got a good beer and wine selection and always fresh mini deli and olive bar.never used it,but cool to sneak a snack.they have a really nice health and beauty selection as well.two thumbs up and a wave
