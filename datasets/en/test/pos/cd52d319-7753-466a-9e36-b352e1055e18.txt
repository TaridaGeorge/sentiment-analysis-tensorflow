SMoCA is great. I take a bus load of HS students there every year and while small it packs their brains with questions and answers about art and society.

A must see when ever you are in Scottsdale. The people at SMoCA get it right. They expose people to current art in a relaxed interesting setting.
BTW if you only spend an hour at the SMoCA you are not looking at the artwork nearly long enough.
