Clean rooms, comfy beds, free wifi, breakfast included, free parking... and the list goes on! Christopher at the front desk was lovely and made check in a snap!

Super convenient to everything, across the street from awesome food, and very quiet.

The icing on the cake? A buy 2 nights get the 3rd free! Brought the per night rate down to $63! Our friends were 1 mile away paying $389/night plus for parking and wifi and no free breakfast. I don't mind paying for excellence, but this place is awesome so why pay more!?
