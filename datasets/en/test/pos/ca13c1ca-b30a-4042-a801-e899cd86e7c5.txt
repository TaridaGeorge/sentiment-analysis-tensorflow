Wok In is one of those unassuming places that doesn't look like much from the street. I was very pleasantly surprised to discover how delicious it is!

The restaurant is very nice and clean. It has been fairly empty when we have gone, but I've just been there at odd hours. The food is very cheap, most items under $6, for a lot of very good flavorful food.

My absolute favorite item on the menu are their potstickers. They absolutely melt in your mouth, and are so delicious. I have liked pretty much everything on the menu so far. It is great to experiment here.
