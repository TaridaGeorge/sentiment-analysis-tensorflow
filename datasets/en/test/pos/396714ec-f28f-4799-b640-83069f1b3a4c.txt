This place has everything on the grounds: 6 swimming pools, a water slide, ponds, the Gila River, a boat taxi, spa, casino, equestrian center, golf courses, a gift shop, a deli/coffee shop, a lobby bar, and 4 restaurants. All the rooms each have a balcony with table and chairs. The rooms are equipped with 52" flat screen TVs. The bathrooms each have a tub and standup shower. Even though it was my first time in the Phoenix area, I didn't want to leave the resort. And even though we did spend 2/3 of our time on the resort (we were in town for a total of 4 days), we didn't get enough time to enjoy all the facilities. For $95/night (thanks, Expedia!), this was worth every penny! The spa is way overpriced, but the price of food was fair, especially at Hanyo Pool Bar & Grill.
