Ya this place is great, Me and my wife have 4 kids and if were looking to get lunch this is the spot, tacos, whole chicken much more, juice bar and with $20 to $25 all six of us walk out of there full. And the grocciers are great, prices are even better, we stopped shopping at walmart or costco for meat, this place has large packages of fresh meat, chicken, pork very cheap. And the place is always full but were never in line to pay for more then 5 minutes, so many lines open and the cashiers are smart and know what there doing. And for a birthday party you can walk in grab a cake, carne asada, fresh tortillas, drinks and a pinata and your done.
