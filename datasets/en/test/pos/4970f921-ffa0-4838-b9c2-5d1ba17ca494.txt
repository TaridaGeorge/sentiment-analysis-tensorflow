Friendly service, excellent food.

I didn't know what a pasty was until I came here.  The food is filling and actually very flavourful.

The first time I came here, I got a Bangers and Mash.  Second time, I got the Oggie.  I recommend skipping the beans if you're used to the typical Boston style baked beans.  

Fries and mushy peas are a good thing to start with.  Finish off with the Apple Pasty.

Very vegetarian friendly.

I recommend going early as this place can get very crowded.
