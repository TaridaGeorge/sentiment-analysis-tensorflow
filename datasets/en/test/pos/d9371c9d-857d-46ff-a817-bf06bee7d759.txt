will return!  my husband and i had such a good time.  we went on sunday around noon and didn't run into any traffic.  the directions from the website were easy to follow.  there's tons of people but the lines flow well and the wait wasn't long.  cost $15 to rent a tub and for the bus ride to and from your car.  i read the tips on the website twice so i didn't forget anything and the tips site covered all i needed to know.  i would take a sheet next time to cover the tube since sheets are lighter than the towels we had and the tubes did get hot during the ride.  took the 4 hour ride and it was just long enough.  take more drinks than you think you'll use since we ran out and luckily ran into unopened beers along the way.
