I have been coming to this place for a while now. I love coming here for a glass of wine and a big bowl of pho. All the dishes I have tried here are flavorful and priced just right. The restrooms are decorated beautifully and are always clean. The staff is always friendly and willing to answer any questions on the menu. I highly recommend this place for a relaxing yummy dinner.
