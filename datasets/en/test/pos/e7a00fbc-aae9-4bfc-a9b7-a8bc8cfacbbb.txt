One of my favorite nice casual restaurants.   This is the type of Italian food you'd get in great little out-of-the way Tuscan hill town restaurants that serve the locals (not the tourist traps).  It's always a relaxed friendly atmosphere and the food is always awesome.  As several reviewers have mentioned, don't forget to BYOB - but no worries if you do because you can grab some at Sprout's next door.    The owner plays in the Phoenix Symphony, and he knows his Italy!
