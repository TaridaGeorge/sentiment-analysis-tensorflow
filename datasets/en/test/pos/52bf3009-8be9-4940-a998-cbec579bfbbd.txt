In-N-Out has never let me down, whether I've had it in LA or  AZ. I'm especially fond of this location because it's never that busy when I go and the service is, as always, fast and friendly. I usually get a double double, animal fries and a Neapolitan shake. I've yet to attempt a crazy secret menu order, but I have a feeling they would be more than happy to fullfil it here.
