We stayed for an anniversary weekend and were very impressed. We usually go to a resort in Vegas and this was on par to superior. Service was a highlight with absolutely no missteps. Very high beginning to end. 

We recommend one og the original bungalows called "traditional adobes" here for a Ricky and Lucy vibe, you can easily imagine the atmosphere in the heyday 1950s. 

The lodge pool was immaculate and poolside service was fantastic. Prices were reasonable for a resort, much less than you'd spend in Vegas. If you want a pleasant weekend in a well kept resort, look no further. Highly recommended
