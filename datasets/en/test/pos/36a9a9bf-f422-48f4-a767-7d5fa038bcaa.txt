This place is beautiful, great patio with classic decor.  Went to Happy hour...of course and had a few glasses of wine and  yummy calamari.  Service was off the charts!  We were sitting on the patio...a little hot and Schwetty...and the server kept moving the umbrellas to shade up as the sun set...WOW!
