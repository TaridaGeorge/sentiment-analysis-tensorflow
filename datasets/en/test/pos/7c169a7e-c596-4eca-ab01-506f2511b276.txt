Amazing.... These meatballs are to die for, Joe the Owners Husband is Very Nice...LOL He will even play a game at the end of the night with you, if you win he buys you dinner. The wine list was kind of pricey for my blood but, was there to eat more than drink. However, some more affordable, good quality wine would have been nice. Overall the experience was  5 stars. Very Romantic spot for a date...
