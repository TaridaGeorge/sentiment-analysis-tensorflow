Love this place.  With it being less than a mile from Yogurtini and 9 cents an ounce cheaper it is the only yogurt place I go anymore.

I love the flavors- taro, coconut, bananas foster, pistachio, green tea, ghiradelli chocolate.

I love the toppings- lychee and pomegranate

I could seriously eat here everyday.
