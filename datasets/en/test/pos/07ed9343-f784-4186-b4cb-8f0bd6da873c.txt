What is bingsoo? well, here's how it went down

you select 3 fresh fruits
1 fruit puree
yogurt or icecream (the yogurt isn't tart and what they recommend, it's sweet and delicious) 

then they take a bowl, put in shaved ice, the yogurt/ice cream, the fruits, and puree. you mix it all together and enjoy.

my recommendation is to ask for light to medium ice shavings, mine got a bit too cold and it started to numb all of the flavors. but i enjoy the texture from the ice so it's definitely a must. 

allll of this for less than $5!!! any other yogurt place would cost you much more for all of these fresh ingredients, even extra toppings are only $.25

the guy who was working was very sweet, great place. i cant wait to go back
