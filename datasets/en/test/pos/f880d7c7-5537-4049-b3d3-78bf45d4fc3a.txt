Large Asian market, in fact the best I have found in Arizona.  Being originally from the bay area in California I miss some oriental foods I grew up with.  I found most everything from my childhood here.  It also has fresh produce and a variety of meats that I have experimented with.  
It also has other imports at this store and if you are looking for something "different" this market is the place to go.
Also if you are craving BOBA drinks they have a small shop to the right as you enter.
