What a little gem! I love scouring the web for new ethnic recipes to try out knowing full well that I can pick up the normally hard to find ingredients here. The Chinese restaurant inside is tasty as well, their fried oysters are de-lish! From Korean, Japanese, Thai, Indian, Vietnamese to Middle Eastern, Ethiopian and Latin/Mexican, this market has a plethora of goods to satisfy your taste buds. Meat is decently priced, so is the produce. This place has fast become one of our favorite places to shop.
