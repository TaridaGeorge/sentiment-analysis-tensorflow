This Urgent Care office was covered by my insurance, and with lab facilities and an X-ray at the office, I thought it would be a good choice in case I needed labs drawn or an X-ray done.
As it turns out, it was a great experience (for being a doctor office visit)... the staff was friendly and went out of their way to take care of me. And Dr. Williams took plenty of time for the exam and to explain everything, also going out of her way to be sure I had everything I needed to make my recovery more comfortable.
With a great staff and the facilities to really take care of their patients, I highly recommend this office for your urgent care needs.
