My favorite breakfast spot, by far! You can't go wrong with anything you order, but my favorites are their eggs benedict, their english harvest omelet and their breakfast salad. It's a good family restaurant, but if you are bringing a group on a weekend morning, call ahead so you don't have a long wait! The staff is always great, and usually the owner is there, seating guests himself! 

Tip: You can order reduced portions of their omelets and a half order of the breakfast salad!
