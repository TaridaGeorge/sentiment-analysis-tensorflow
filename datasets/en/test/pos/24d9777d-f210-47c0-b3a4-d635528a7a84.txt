EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE! 

Even with Happy Hour in full swing and the place full of parched Winkies, the service at our large table was spot on. We barely had time to settle our bums and push the silver out to claim our table territory before iced H20 was before us, our drink orders were taken . . . and one quick blink of the eye and the "peacemakers" were before us!  

Now that's what I call HAPPY HOUR!

Bravo Thirsty Lion!
