Frank Lloyd Wright is one my favorite architects.  He was a futuristic visionary of his period.  Even though his designs were popular after the turn of the century, today his style can still be considered contemporary in the sense of the word Modern.  You can take a docent guided tour in which you are lead to his living quarters, theater, the school, the reflection pool, and landscaping.  There is an apprenticeship training by the architects of the Taliesin Fellowship as well as professionals in the field.  As you are guided through the home, you'll hear how tragedy struck his family.  

This is a must see if you are traveling to Phoenix.
