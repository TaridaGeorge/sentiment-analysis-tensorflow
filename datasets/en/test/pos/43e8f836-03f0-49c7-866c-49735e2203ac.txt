Thanks to Gracie B in SF, I was able to attend Insight Bowl this year.  Not that I am a crazy football fan-- I really know NOTHING about football, but the entire vibe at a bowl game is really cool.

From the National Anthem that always brings tears to my Canadian eyes to the jets flying overhead to the $5 bottle of Dasani water (the small one) to the band playing fight songs to even the actual game-- IT WAS FUN and I am really happy I went!

I love that AZ hosts these kinds of events, it brings in great revenue to the cities and just plain fun and camaraderie for everyone.

Indiana lost, we were rooting for them but we were defeated.  We still had a blast-- but I think the most fun of it all was watching the band leader work his magic.
