I'm really sorry that I missed out on the one in Scottsdale as I heard that it was a bit nicer since it was on grass/dirt lots.

I'm from back east and there the Drive-Ins have gone the way of the buffalo.  Attending this place this past fall was the first experience I've ever had with a drive in......and it ruled!

Bring your own food (pizza at Luna Pizza nearby), some lawn chairs, beers...I mean..uh....sodas, and see two first run movies for next to nothing.

If you havent' experienced this yet you are truly missing out.
