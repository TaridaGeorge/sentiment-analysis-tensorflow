I've been to this little gem several times now and I must say I'm in love. Plenty of options vegetarian options for me as well as vegan options for my boyfriend. The food is gourmet, the atmosphere  is rustic and eclectic while maintaing a very clean feel, the owner is lovely and congenial. And OMG I am addicted to their coffee!! The iced almond milk latte is the best in Phoenix. Do yourself a favor and enjoy a nice brunch here :)
