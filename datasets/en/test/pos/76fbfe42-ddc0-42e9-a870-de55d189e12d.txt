I love the girls and the clothing at this place. If I had a bigger budget I would go there every week. 

They seem to bring things in that you just don't find any where else. Every time I wear something that I bought at this fabulous local business, I get asked where I got it. The girls have a great eye for what is hot right now and they keep me looking fashionable even though I'm gettin old.

Keep up the great buying girls so you can keep us in great clothes!
