This breakfast place is very hip and happening!  People line up and wait for a reason.  (That is why you should definitely call ahead for reservations!)  The food is incredible . . . try the BC's B&G (Breakfast Club's Biscuits and Gravy).  It is not your standard Midwestern home-cookin'.  It's fresh with a little spice and some yummy cheese.  My only real complaint about this place is their coffee.  Their espresso drinks taste stale.  They should definitely upgrade to Illy or another gourmet brand.  So, if you prefer a cappuccino, swing by Coffee Bean during your wait, and enjoy!
