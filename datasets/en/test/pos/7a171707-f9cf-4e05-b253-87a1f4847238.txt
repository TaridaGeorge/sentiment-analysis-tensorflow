My first thought when I came here was, I hope the food is worth the wait. And It was.  My fellow yelpers never do me wrong, so I had to go with the California Club and Breakfast Buzz.  Both lived up to the numerous good reviews.  I just loved the Breakfast Buzz's hint of peanut butter flavor. I am pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food considering they have a drive through.  This place is most definitely not your typical fast food restaurant.  If you have not come here yet, give it a try you won't be disappointed.
