Fresh Mint is a really great place to get a warm, filling vegetarian/vegan meal! I always start out with some of their garden vegetable soup - it's made with a ginger broth that tastes and feels amazing. I always get it when I'm sick, and I highly recommend it!

I also love their stir-fried noodles. The service is great and everything is delicious! Definitely one of my favorite restaurants.
