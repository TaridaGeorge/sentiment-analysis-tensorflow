I've been to the Wy-Knot Cafe twice.  Each time I've walked away feeling full, satisfied, and inspired.  The full, satisfied part came from eating healthy, delicious, freshly-cooked foods.  The inspiration came from talking with Jackie.  She's a dynamo!  I love the creative energy of the place.  There's something special going on there, and I recommend it to anyone who is tired of the same old restaurants, the same old foods, the same old.  I wish there were more places like this one in the valley.  You go, Jackie!
