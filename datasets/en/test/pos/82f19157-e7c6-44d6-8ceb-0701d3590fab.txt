OMG OMG OMG, the happy hour hamburger is so delicious (I think it's the bacon that does it). 

I've only been here twice, and both times for happy hour. They have an excellent happy hour for the quality of food they serve. I've tried, obviously the burger and also the crab cakes, both which were yummy. The drink specials are great too, they make a great margarita and have an ample wine list. I'll be back!
