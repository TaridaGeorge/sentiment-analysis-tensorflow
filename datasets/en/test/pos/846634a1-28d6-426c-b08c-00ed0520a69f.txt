Well, I love it here. I love the fact that I can visit and have a lovely small meal while sitting quietly and either reading a book or NYT, studying or chatting with friends in a cozy little room. And, feel appreciated for stopping through!

Additionally, if there's a foodstuff that I can't live without, I buy it. 

Usually heirloom tomatoes.

Damn good stuff.
