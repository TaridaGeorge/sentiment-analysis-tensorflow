Did I say this is the best Walgreens ever,  ok it is!!! They are remodeling the store, I hope they are finished because they need to restock some of my favorite things. I can't why it needed a remodel but ok,  I will hold further opinion until it is finished. They have been open for business 24/7 as usual and my prescriptions are always ready or they say wait we'll do it now, this is before it was supposed to be ready.  I love this location,  keep up the good work!
