I love this place! The atmosphere is beautiful, trendy and comfortable.
The food was incredible! I had the crab cake sandwich with the Kale salad as a side. The Blackberry gin drink was amazing. Love the swizzle stick with the blackberrry skirt. Nice detail. There are many healthy offerings like a grain salad and fun sides for $3. The service was also wonderful. The waitress was very attentive during a busy lunch and moved the sun shade on the patio to make sure we were comfortable without even asking her to do so. I can't wait to go back and try more wonderful items and just relax in the fun atmosphere.
