This is one of my favorite places to get what I think is the best Prime Rib in the valley. The service is always very friendly and efficient and the atmosphere is lends itself perfectly to couples looking for a little romance. Everything is a bit pricey but worth every penny. When you order Prime Rib you get a salad and a choice of two sides. Plus their spinach dip is awesome!
