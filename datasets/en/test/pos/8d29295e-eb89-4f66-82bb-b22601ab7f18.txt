where do I start...I have been there now a dozen times and am never disappointed.  Great food-great portions.  We tend to always order the Red Chile Roast even if it's not a dinner entree, it's taken home and mixed with eggs for tasty breakfast burros...seriously 4 meals.  The ceviche is light and fresh, the North Central Chicken is dee-lish, the Pork Osso Buco totally awesome.

Cute patio, great service, kick ass food...and I just heard there is a brunch menu on the weekends...all around win
