I've been a Grazie fan for a few years now and I definitely don't go there as much as I should!

I love the quaint, cozy atmosphere and enjoy eating inside or on the patio. Their Emiliana salad and Dolce Della Casa dessert (sweet calzone filled with nutella, bananas and ice cream) are amazing. As far as pizzas, I've never tasted one I didn't like here. On my most recent visit, I had the Toscana and it was great!

I've been here on dates, with girlfriends and large groups for birthdays and bachelorette dinners and would recommend Grazie to anyone!
