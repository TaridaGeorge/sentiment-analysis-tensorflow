I really enjoyed my mani/pedi with Trisha!  She took her time and taught me about manicuring my nails from home which I loved.

I went in for the Groupon basic mani/pedi deal and left feeling like I got a lot more! It was the most pleasant experience I've had at a nail salon. The conversation was easy and Trish is a great person. I will be coming back to Trish for nails again! 

The entire staff was friendly and professional. Great Salon!!
