I dropped in to have a watch sized. The gentleman at the front was fast to buzz me through the big iron security gate. He was very polite, and took the extra links out of my new watch quickly. It was only $6 and he did it while I waited- only took maybe 5 minutes. They were also really helpful when I had questions about having a more expensive watch serviced. I plan to bring a necklace and ring back here to be sized as well. Fast, polite and inexpensive!
