It is truly an oasis!  
The 11,000 sq. ft. building houses desert critters, exhibits, environmental classes for children and adults and a gift store that sells Seeds of Change!   Lots to do for the kiddos.  
There was even a "Meet and Greet" the animals class going on when we were there.   The staff are very friendly and helpful.   
Four miles of paved and dirt trails for walking, hiking and even biking paths intertwine the park.   Plenty of trees for shade.  
Fishing with an urban permit is allowed.  Just don't know what the maximum you can keep.
No jungle gym around.  Just a little pony wall for the kids to walk and balance on.  They still had a blast!
The Ramadas are open for reservations.  I would say they hold about 30-50 people.   
Check this place out and don't forget to go online for class schedules.
