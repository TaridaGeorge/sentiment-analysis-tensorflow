I love this place! It first caught my eye driving to work.  Their logo includes a shazzam lighting bolt which is rad if your into comics. I went in the place and they had comic art on the walls. The staff made some suggestions of what I should try. I got the slider pizza - (kinda like a cheese burger pizza) they actually used a little brown mustard on top. Anyway it was delicious. I can't get over the helpful staff though. It is very rare that I get that kind of service at a pizza joint.

Any way every time I have visited the place there has been no patrons and it breaks my heart because that is a good sign that it isn't going to be around long. 

If you get the change PLEASE check this place out.
