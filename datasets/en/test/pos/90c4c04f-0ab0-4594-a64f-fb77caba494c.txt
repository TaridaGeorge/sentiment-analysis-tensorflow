A phoestivus for the rest of us. 

Air your grievances and dance around the phoestivus pole.
As you shop local for your family, friends, and that weird guy named Cole.

With samples to tempt your palate; pickled celery, cookies, tamales, and more. 
If you're getting hungry, don't wait. There's plenty of food trucks galore.

Forgot to get that yearly family holiday photo for display?
The social station (booth) will hook you up with an action shot or kissy face, no delay.

After picking through jewelry, baked goods, and hand made bow ties.
Get your gifts wrapped free by Lindsey F, the Yelper in disguise.

I had a blast eating shortleash dogs and chatting with friends.
Hope to see you there next week, hurry and get there before it ends.
