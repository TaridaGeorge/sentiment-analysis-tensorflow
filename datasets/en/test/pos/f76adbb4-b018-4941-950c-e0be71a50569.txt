Your know your favorite pair of shoes that are comfortable, the perfect color, the right style, all you want in a shoe but there is one small problem.  They look like they have been up Camelback Mountain 102 times.  You don't want to get rid of them because you can never find them again so what do you do?

YOU BRING THEM TO COLONNADE SHOE SHOP & REPAIR.

My favorite heels have been worn so many times that I have the little heel cap replaced at least 4 times and the front part of the shoe re-soled twice.  All at this shoe repair shop.  The heel caps are only $6 for the pair AND he does it while you wait usually.  I was in and out in less than 5 minutes and I am wearing my favorite heels today.
