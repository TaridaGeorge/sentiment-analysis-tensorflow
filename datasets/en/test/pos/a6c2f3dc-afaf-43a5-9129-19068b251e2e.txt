The first time I went here was for lunch with my boyfriend and we ended up staying for dinner it was so good! The sandwiches are unique and tasty, the organic burger is delicious, the asparagus soup is an explosion of wonderful flavors in your mouth, and the filet mignon was as awesome as the price, and I don't know where to start with the pastries! Just YUM. I was very pleased with this place.
