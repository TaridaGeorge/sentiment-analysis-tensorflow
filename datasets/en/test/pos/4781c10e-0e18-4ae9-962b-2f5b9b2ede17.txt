APPPLLLEEEEE!!!!! I heart you. You are the best. 

This is my version of shopping heaven. The buzzing people in their pretty blue shirts are my angels. 

Clean. 
Easy. 
Fun (you can play with all the shiny objects). 
Stress-less. 


I think it is exactly that fun experience that always leaves me a few dollars lighter when i walk out. So, if you are not prepared to spend money on these wonderful gadgets, my best advice is to leave your wallet at home.
