The staff was amazing with timely drinks and hospitality appreciation. The crowd was good. The bathrooms were immaculate thanks to Nick the service attendant professionale in the men's. The decor was beautiful with the new renovations. And the lights on the dance floor were amazing. The music was a good mix. Though I wish there were more new jams. Overall the place to be on a Thursday night. Thirsty Thursdays at Devils.
