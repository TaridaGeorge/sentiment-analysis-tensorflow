My job is about 1/2 a mile from this place.  I drove by one day and decided to go in and eat lunch.  Best choice I have ever made.  My boss buys our lunch from here once a week.  The salads are the best around, are huge and a great price.  Gordon & Mary are the best.  The place is always crowded/busy no matter what day I go in.
