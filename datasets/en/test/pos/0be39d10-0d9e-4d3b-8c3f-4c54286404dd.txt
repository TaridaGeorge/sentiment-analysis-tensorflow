YUM YUM YUM.
5 STARS!!!!

The best filet minion in town! My hubby and I always get the split plate and have mash potatoes and corn to save room for desert.

They have awesome wine. I love the bar. Sit in the bar for sure.  The other side is a bit Ihop-ish...I know, I know thats harsh...but true...The bar is where its at.

The crumbly bleu cheese salad is amazing.
The hummus rocks!!!
The Dirty Martini's have blue cheese olives! YUM...
Staff is very friendly, bartenders are generous, prices are good.
The new updated patio is beautiful....
Great for watching sports, they even have couches around the bigscreen!!!!

This place could for sure use a new stereo system as the one they have cracks and pops...but that is the only thing I can find fault with.

AWESOME! EAT HERE!
