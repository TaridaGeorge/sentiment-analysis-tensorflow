This place pretty much rocks! Our friends introduced us to the place last night. Our experience was so exciting that we went again today for lunch. The first meal was a philly burger, amazing, and a gyro burger, an another amazing! Both burgers were spot on with big flavor! The burgers are great, but the other thing that made the place pop for me was the selection of artisan sodas. The place has a giant selection of sodas that are so rare to find. I'm from Maine and they had Moxie. I can't get Moxie soda anywhere here in the valley, that is except at Rocket Burger! This review isn't for the soda Moxie, it is definitely an acquired taste. Rocket Burger on the other hand is not a place that has to grow on you. You'll fall in love with it right away.
