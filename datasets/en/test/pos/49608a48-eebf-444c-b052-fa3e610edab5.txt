I was given DJ HartBreaks name from a friend a called him with a random request. Can you spin tracks for us at an outdoor yoga event called Yoga Rocks the Park? Oh, and no pressure, but I have you paired up to DJ with a nationally recognized yoga teacher that is known for his hip-hop playlist.

DJ HartBreaks was easy to work with and kept the class moving and people feeling good! It was a new experience for him and he handled it like a true professional! I hope to work with him again--It is not easy to find a DJ that can keep up with us yogis!

Thanks for everything!!
