As often as I go here (about 2 to 3 times a month) I can't believe I haven't written a review! 
I LOVE AZ88!! I go here for lunch with girlfriends and have the fabulous AZ88 salad with ice tea, or martinis with friends (the best in town!) and an appetizer or two to share. The food is plentiful and delicious, a big step up from 'bar' food, but not fancy and not pricey either. The staff is always friendly and attentive. When the weather is nice, they have a lovely patio that actually looks out on a green belt/park area and not a parking lot! But indoors is also a treat with fabulous art and a modern design. If you go at the holidays you can also see their annual "tree" in the dead center of the restaurant. Always a wonderful work of art!
