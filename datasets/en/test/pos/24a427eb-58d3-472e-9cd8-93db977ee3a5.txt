St. Francis gives the impression you could be dining in one of the finest cities in the world, instead of the 5th largest cities in the USA.

Start with their cucumber gin drink, and then order another.  Goat cheese on crostini follows.  Insist on extremely memorable whipped potatoes--a side order-- to accompany your salmon on red quinoa.  Dessert MUST be the chocolate cake with peanut butter gelato accompanied by carmel sauce trailings and carmel corn garnishes.

Try dining at the bar for an uncluttered view out the picture window opening, minus the glass.

Loved it!  Will happily return.

They split our entree for us AND were gracious about the extra trouble we caused--not a wimper.  Truly superior service !
