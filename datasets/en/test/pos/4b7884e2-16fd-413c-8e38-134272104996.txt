I totally understand this is a hate it or love it place. Well I love it! It's really small so no matter where you stand you have a good view. And the sound system is pretty good. Drinks are reasonably priced, and made really strong which is nice. Get some pre-show pizza it's really yummy for 3 bucks a slice!
