A great cafe.  A welcome surprise to find in Phoenix.

Local, good coffee, friendly service, good ambience, free wifi.  That's what I'm looking for in a cafe when I'm hitting the computer.  I was glad to meet and chat with Don, the owner, both times I visited.

The prices are a little higher than that chain coffee place that shan't be mentioned, but if that's enough to keep you away, this place ain't for you anyway.

I'll definitely be back
