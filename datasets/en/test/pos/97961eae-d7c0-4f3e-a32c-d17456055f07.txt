Absolutely Amazing!
This was by far the most spoiled I have ever felt at an Elite event. 
Upon walking into the room I know it would be different, two long tables set beautifully said "you are about to be fed like royalty".
The champagne started flowing immediately followed by tastes of great wines and handcrafted cocktails all night.
The food just kept coming some of my stand out favorites were the carpaccio, scallops, crispy brussel sprouts, bolgonese, fillet and the hand pulled mozzarella just to name a few.
I'm not sure how anyone is going to be able to top this event and the service we received form the Tanzy staff was impeccable.
I cannot say thank you enough to Lindsey and the GENEROUS staff of Tanzy and iPic. 
I'm so excited to use my tickets!!!!
