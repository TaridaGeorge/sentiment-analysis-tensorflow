I have been the token metal head to the original Lolo's for many years. I ventured out to the new location with my sister, brother and my niece and nephew. 
This place is about 4 sizes bigger than the original. We were quoted a 15 min wait on a Saturday morning. We were sat in 5. 

The menu is the same, the china is the same, the "drank" glasses are the same. Feels just like a slightly more sterile original Lolo's. 

Waffles were cinnamon-y delicious, chicken was hot and crispy. The catfish was also hot and crispy. Everything except for location felt the same. Which is comforting. 

I'm still a fan of the charm of the original location and will dine there before I dine at the Scottsdale location again.
