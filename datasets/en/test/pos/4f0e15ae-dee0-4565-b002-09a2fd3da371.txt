This place is amazing! I've eaten here countless times and can honestly say that I've never had a bad experience! The people are extremely friendly and attentive. 

The lunch buffet is where it's at! The food always tastes fresh and never seems dried out from heat lamp exposure! The chicken tandoori and chicken curry are to die for!! 

I really can't say enough nice things about this place. If you like Indian food or want to try it, eat here. You won't be disappointed!
