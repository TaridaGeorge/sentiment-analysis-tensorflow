I love hiking this mountain! For me, there is such a great feeling of accomplishment upon reaching the top. Not to mention the amazing panoramic views of the valley. It doesn't get better than that.

Not only is this a great workout, but there is always a wide variety of friendly people attempting this hike. From hard-bodied, shirtless regulars to local families--it is a great place to people watch and interact. 

I have to also say that it is a must to bring a cooler of beers and celebrate after your hike at the base of the mountain. My friends and I decided to do this once, and a neighboring group ended up inviting us over to join them in their weekly tailgate potluck. Gotta love some good food and drinks after an exhausting workout.
