I can't remember the last piece of jewelry I bought that wasn't from Eric at Gemsetter.  He's alway a huge help and has so many unique pieces that I see no where else.  When Eric is working with you, clearly you are the most important person in the world to him.  That feeling helps so much when trying to find the right gift and he's never failed me.

Gemsetter has been part of the community for years and his loyal customers are a testament to his hard work.  I can't recommend Gemsetter enough.
