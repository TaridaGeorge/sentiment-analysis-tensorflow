I wish this place was closer to me because I would be a regular for sure!  Came here to support Gabi K. because she was raising money for CF and for my support I got ice cream... yay:).  The owners of Sweet Republic are yelpers too and they were so wonderful for donating a 100% of the proceeds for Gabi's cause.  I tried the honey yogurt and I think it was a Mayan chocolate... they both were spectacular!  I also brought home some cookies for my sweetie which he loved also.   When I am in the neighborhood I will definitely stop by again.
