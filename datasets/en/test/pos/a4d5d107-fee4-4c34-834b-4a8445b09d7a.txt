I'm in love with this place. They have the best salads, and they are HUGE! Even when you get the soup and salad (great tomato soup!), the "side salad" is still huge! It's a little pricey for salads, but I think it's worth it. It's the only place I know where the "build your own salad" comes with seven topping options, and they don't charge extra for avocado. I've never tried the pizza or sandwiches, but they look great, and back when I used to eat chicken, I thought their pesto chicken (on my salad) was really good.
Enjoy!
