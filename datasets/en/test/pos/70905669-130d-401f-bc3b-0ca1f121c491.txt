I have heard so much out these salons I was really wanting to try one. I'm so glad I did. They did and amazing job! The atmosphere was great. Very friendly staff. The only negative I would say is I went on a Friday night, they were very busy and they didn't get to me until 30 minutes after my appointment. I think going earlier in the day, would solve this. I booked another appointment for this week.  This is so worth the $35. AMAZING place.
