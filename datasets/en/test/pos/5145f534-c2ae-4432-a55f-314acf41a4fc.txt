I've only been here once, bit I'll come back. Why? Depot Cantina gave us A+  service for our graduation party!!!

PROS: a portion of outside patio area was cordoned off just for us; ASU colors; appetizers delivered on cue and they were hot, fresh and tasty; Trevor did a great job to ensure our 25 friends and family were taken care of--no one was w/out a drink all nite!

CONS: nothing to report

Thanks to Staci Braza and Trevor for making our grad party a lot of fun! 

Cheers!
