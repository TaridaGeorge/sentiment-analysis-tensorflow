I wanted to write a big thank-you to the staff at Frasher's for allowing us to host the bachelor party dinner with them.  All of the staff were so great to work with.  I have been going here for years, and when the groom is in town, he makes it a point to have a steak here.  So naturally, for his big night he wanted to start here.  Always one of the best steaks in town, and again, the staff is tremendous.  Thanks again.
