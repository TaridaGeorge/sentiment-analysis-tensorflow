Great East Coast Italian subs! Order your sub, "Mikes Way"....it's great!
Friendly owners and staff, go out of their way to be friendly and personable. In fact, my young son is such a fan they recognize him when he comes in. His dream is to work at Jersey Mikes when he turns 16 so he can eat Jersey Mikes every day!
Yummy!
