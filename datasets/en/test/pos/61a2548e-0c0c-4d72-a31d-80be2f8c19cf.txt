Awesome visit! It was super packed in there but the two cashiers got through the massive line quickly. When it was our turn, the cashier Savannah was super nice and helpful! Our food was fantastic and the employees that were bussing the tables were also really cheerful. I will absolutely go back and tell all my friends in the process. Go eat here!
