After reading other more recent reviews I thought I would update my original review. I still feel that this is a great airport. I have traveled through here probably 400+ times and I will continue doing so (for my job.)

Compared to other airports this one is by far the easiest for it's size.

It seems as though the most common complaint is how far you have to walk. I guess that is a fair criticism. I actually enjoy the little amount of exercise you get by walking, but to each their own.
