We used to shop at the other big baby store, but we had so many bad experiences that we decided to drive the extra distance and try out "buybuy Baby." Since that time we have been lured back into the other store by gift cards and great coupons, but found that even with those attractive offers we still regretted going back.

"buybuy Baby's" service is top notch. Their staff are very knowledgeable about the safety products. Everyone is over the top helpful and nice.  We have also found that we like the products at "buybuy Baby" better.
