This is the epitome of a hole in the wall and I love it.  I have had several dishes and each one of them were fantastic.  The papaya salad is one of my favorites and I am also a great fan of the Tom Yum Gai and Squid Salad.  The service is super friendly and the prices are reasonable.  I am afraid of the future of Siamese Kitchen because on my last visit they said they may close it down, which would be such a tragedy. I'll keep my fingers crossed.
