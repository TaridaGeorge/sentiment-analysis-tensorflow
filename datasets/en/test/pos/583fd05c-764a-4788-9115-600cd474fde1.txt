On a recent conference visit to Scottsdale, we decided to have dinner here - what a GREAT choice!! The bar was full on a Monday night with live music-upscale vibe and a romantic ambiance. The service from start to finish was 5 star. Our server Eric made our night special with meal and wine recommendations for our group of 6. I'm well traveled and have several fine dining experiences, but this is the first time I ever seen Bone Marrow and Arugula Salad with Pecorino on the menu. I was in absolute heaven!! This is certainly a special occasion restaurant - so my advice is to FIND that special occasion and visit Mastro's Ocean Club.
