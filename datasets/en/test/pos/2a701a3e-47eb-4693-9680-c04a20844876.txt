Love this cute little studio! They have barre, yoga and spin classes (the spin is amazing because it is on RealRyder bikes that also give you a great core workout)! Your first class is free so why not try it? (And trust me, you'll love it!) I also like that they offer mid-day classes all throughout the week-as some places do not. I would definitely recommend this studio to anyone-- beginners all the way to the very experienced! (I've only taken spin but I plan on trying Barre, for the first time, as well as the yoga classes) --- they also supply you with the towels and it's nice and cool in there! There is also a cute little fountain in the Yoga room!
