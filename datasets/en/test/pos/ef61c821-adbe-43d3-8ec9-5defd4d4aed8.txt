Rand H. and myself went here today for the buffet and it is only on the first Wednesday of the month. Well I wish it was every day of the month because everything I had was great, pulled pork,chicken,beef briquet,smoked rib tips,baked beans,whole kernel corn,potato salad,coleslaw and potatoes. For dessert I had bread pudding and chocolate pudding with strawberry syrup on top.Everything I had was great and I can not wait for a return visit. I think they might just need an update every month (lol).
