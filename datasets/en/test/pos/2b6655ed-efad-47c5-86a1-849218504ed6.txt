This is a small location but still packed with everything I need.  They did start stalking more womens vitamins I liked without iron because they were always out when I went in.  So I thank them for that!

Staff are always nice and for the most part an answer all of my questions.  They take an added effort to get to know their customers.  They always ask about my son when I go in and this keeps me coming back because I feel valued as a person not just a customer.
