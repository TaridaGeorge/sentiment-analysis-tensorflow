If this place had wi-fi I would gladly bring a laptop and camp out here all day while grazing on delicious food and bottomless mimosas. But they would probably frown upon that. Seeing as how this place opened up accross the street from my house recently, I'll have to settle for frequent visits and slowly getting fat over time.
