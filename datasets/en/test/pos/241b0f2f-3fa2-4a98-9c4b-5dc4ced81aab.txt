Robert at Rosa's Alterations is the best tailor in town.  I am an extremely detail oriented and picky professional and I wear suits everyday and have to look good.  I have had Robert do at least 20 alterations for me - from suits to jeans and he is quick and is a step up from any other tailor in Scottsdale - I would highly recommend Rosa's Alterations to people who want the best.
