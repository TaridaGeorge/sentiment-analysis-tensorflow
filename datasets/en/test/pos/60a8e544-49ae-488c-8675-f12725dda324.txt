Soooooo Tickled Pink is now my FAVORITE salon ever since the best hair stylist ever started working there -- Kristen McLean. She's done my hair for quite a few years now and every time I've cheated on her due to scheduling conflict -- I've regretted it! Kristen is my Jessica Simpson's Ken Paves.

If you want hair like Beyonce, Jessica Simpson, Kim Kardashian, or any of those AMAZINGLY beautiful stars, go to Kristen!

She's great with color, cut, style, extension -- everything -- on women, on men... she is THAT good!

Oh and the owner seems to be just as awesome! He's super nice and everyone that sees him leaves looking even more gorgeous afterward!

Can't say more nice things about Kristen and Tickled Pink! :) I'm tickled pink over Tickled Pink!!!!!!
