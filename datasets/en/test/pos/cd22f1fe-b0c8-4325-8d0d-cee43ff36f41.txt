This place is ALWAYS a great time.  They have great bands roll through and the cover charge isn't bad either.  I come here whenever I feel like dancing the night away, there's always room on the floor.  As for the d√©cor, it's a bit of a dive, it has the feel of a legion club or something along those lines.  Aside from that, the crowd is cool and everyone is quick to make friends and join in friendly, fun-loving conversations.    Drinks are stiff and they always have specials... plus $2 PBR, just sayin.
