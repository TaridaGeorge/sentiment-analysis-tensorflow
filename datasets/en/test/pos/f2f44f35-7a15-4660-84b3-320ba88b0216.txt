Italian and Japanese are my TWO FAVORITE cuisines. 
I am VERY indecisive when it comes to finding a place to eat- even if I am craving a certain item.

THIS PLACE GIVES ME THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS, thank you LORD!

Friendly and attentive staff. Cute atmosphere; almost like entering another world. Great menu / drink selection. *However- they did not carry  Kirin for you Japanese Beer Lovers. 

We were seated right away- even during what I thought would be busy dinner time hours. I love restaurants that give you bread and butter. The banana nut bread was absolutely perfect. The Italian and the Japanese noodle selection was just enough for my indecisive mind.

Oh, AND the ladies restroom was clean! 
Please, bring this place to CALIFORNIA!
