It's a little pricey but it is definitely worth it! I love this restaurant! The atmosphere is amazing I always feel like I'm on a nice date even when I go with my mom. I like to get the dinners because you get a really nice selection of different dishes. Their tandoori is also amazing its not super dry like most places. Try anything you like and you won't be disappointed. Get it as spicy as you can stand!

They also have extensive vegetarian options. Extensive, delicious options.

I recommend this place wholeheartedly!
