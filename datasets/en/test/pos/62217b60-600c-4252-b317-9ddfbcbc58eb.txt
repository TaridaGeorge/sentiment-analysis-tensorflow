We love Rosatis! We used to get delivery and takeout from the location on Baseline and 24th street. The pizza is great, pastas are pretty good and they have great Italian beef. If your looking for a REAL pizza, try the Rosati's monster. Bonus***The Entertainment Book has a few coupons for 50% off of a pizza!!!
