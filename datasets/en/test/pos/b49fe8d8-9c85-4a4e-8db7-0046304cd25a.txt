First off.....  One thing: if you ask for more tzaziki sauce, they are happy to give it to you. Just gotta ask!! And, it has lots more flavor than some other  tzaziki I have had.

Now for the review:  Great place!!! The food is very good. Large portions in the gyros as others have said.  There are many pasta dishes on the menu that sound really good. I will update when I try them.

Ted, the owner, is a super friendly, happy guy. The place is right nexy door to the Fedex. Kind of hidden away, but search and you will be happy you did!
