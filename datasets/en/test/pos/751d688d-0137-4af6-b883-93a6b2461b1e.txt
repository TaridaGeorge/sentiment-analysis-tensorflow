Just bought my first BB suit at the new Scottsdale Quarter location. The store is beautiful and the sales rep was awesome.  She was infinitely patient with me while I tried on at least 10 suits.  I finally picked one and sandals to match . The bikini's are pricey but are worth it when you see how unique they are.  I forget the sales girls name that helped me but she had bright red hair.  Just want to give her a big thank you and commend her on the great customer service I recieved.  I'm already planning my next purchase.  I hope BB is around for a long time!
