This is as good as it gets. I went here with two of my best girlfriends for lunch before our shopping spree and fell in love with this place.  It's a perfect place for lunch with the family or even if you are on a date. The eating area is surrounded by plenty of trees(orange maybe?) I forgot for a second that I am in Arizona. Almost all of their food are locally grown and the produce are harvest on the same day....from their farm to your  plate.

I had grill salmon with asparagus and it was delicious, my friends had a BBQ hamburger(6 oz., thick cut bacon, blue cheese, hand-breaded onion ring, Joe's Real BBQ sauce.) and from the expressions on their faces it was DELISH. I recommend the zucchini fries, garlic fries and onion rings...it was a feature on food's network.

Enjoy :)
