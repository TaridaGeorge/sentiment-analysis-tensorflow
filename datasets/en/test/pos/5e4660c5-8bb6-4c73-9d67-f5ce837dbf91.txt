Love everything about this place.  There is lots of parking and the store is not overly busy.  The employees are warm and welcoming and especially helpful in the wine section.  

I do not know much about wine and was buying a Mother's Day gift.  My Mom is a fan of the Coppola's wine and I described the flavors she liked.  The employees were able to match up my vague description to a wine she will like.  

Also, they have a huge variety of everything you might want to decroate your home with or eat off of.  Thank you Cost Plus and the fantastic employees.
