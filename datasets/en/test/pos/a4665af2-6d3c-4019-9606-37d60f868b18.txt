Why can't more shows be played here?!  This place is awesome!

I love the atmosphere of this place, the building is fantastic, and the acoustics are great.  The only complaint I have is that the only beer they offer is pretty much the same fodder you will find at a local sporting event.  The Light Rail makes it incredibly easier to get to as well.  In general, every event I have been to here, from concerts to plays, has been great.  I always jump for joy when a band I really want to see comes to the Orpheum, as I know that I will not be disappointed.
