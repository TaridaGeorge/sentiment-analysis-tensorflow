I can't believe I haven't yelped about these lovelies yet!

Here's the skinny: if you're a member of Massage Envy, you get one massage (full body/one hour) for 39 bucks a month and if you don't use your massage they just accumulate...which for chicks like me is a good thing, cause I loves me some two hour massages.  I yelp five stars based on my experiences with two therapists, Yvonte and Mike T.  Yvonte is my go to guy when I need some deep tissue help and Mike is great for stretching or when I have sciatic pain.  I have never had a bad experience with either sir and I will continue to visit this house of tranquility.  I have always received great customer service here, from the call to schedule my appointment to the fond farewell as I leave all fuzzy and drunk with relaxation.
