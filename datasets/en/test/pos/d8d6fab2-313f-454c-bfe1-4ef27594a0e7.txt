YAY! I Found another Tart Treat!

This place is located in the shops of San Tan Village it's well hidden on a back corner behind Fossil, no wonder I have missed it every time I've been there. I just happened to see the name on the map and decided to give it a try.

Refreshing Real Yogurt Flavors, Plain (tart), peach, strawberry, raspberry and green tea. Fresh fruit and dry toppings. You can also get your yogurt blended into a drink.

I got the plain with strawberries of course(see pics) and it was perfectly creamy and icy with just the right amount of tart. I also tasted the peach and it was equally good with the subtlety of fresh peaches in a tart yogurt base.

I was told they have plans for 5 more location around the Valley I can't wait.
