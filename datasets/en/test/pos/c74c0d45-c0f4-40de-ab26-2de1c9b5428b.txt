What a little gem!  I heard about this place via Yelp.  The reviews really do speak to the experience you will have at this place.  The food is very good and very unique (which is what I like about it).  For instance, instead of typical free bread or chips, they served baguette bread with this salsa/bruschetta like topping.  Very tasty, as was the food we ordered.  The atmosphere is great, small town deli style.  it's not very big and can get crowded very easily, but it's still worth the trip over.   I'm glad the location is not convenient, or else you would be waiting for hours!  It's one of those places that as you leave, you are sure you will be coming back.
