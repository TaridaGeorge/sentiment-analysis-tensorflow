I was amazed at some of these reviews. I never realized that a name can make Gelato taste better. I have had one experience where someone in my party wasn't really liking their Gelato. The manager came out right away, went back and tasted it himself, agreed it wasn't up to par and gave the person in my party a gift card and apologized. 
I'm a fan of yummy old-school Thrifty ice cream and Paciugo. I find the flavors to be rich and the Wedding Cake just kills me. I think the best way I can describe the taste is beautiful. It's creamy, rich and a sin to eat!
