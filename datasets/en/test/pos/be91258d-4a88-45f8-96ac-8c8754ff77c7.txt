I always prefer a Holiday Inn Express whenever possible.  Normally I would have stayed at the Surprise location, but this particular location I was traveling with pets and, unfortunately, the surprise location does not allow.  The Peoria location was more than accommodating with our two pets.  The was supposed to be a small additional fee for them, but it wasn't even added to the bill.

As always, with any HIE, the rooms, service, and breakfast were great.
