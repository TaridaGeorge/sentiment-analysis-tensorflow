I just moved to the area a year ago, and had a hard time finding a mechanic I could trust. Sun Devil Auto solved that problem for me! When I needed a major repair on my car, they did only what was necessary and charged me an extremely fair price. Tim is always very friendly, and recently when I called inquiring about a service light in my vehicle, he was very helpful even over the phone. You can always expect that the work will be done on time, and they've never kept me waiting. This is the only place I will go for oil changes or any repairs for my vehicle.
