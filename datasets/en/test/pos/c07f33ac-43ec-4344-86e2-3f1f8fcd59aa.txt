The most relaxing bed and breakfast in Southern Arizona.  Linda, the owner, is wonderful.  She really goes out of her way to make sure you have a comfortable stay.  And her dogs are charming too.  You get so much more than what you pay for.  The breakfast is technically a continental breakfast, but it really leaves you satisfied - yogurt, toast, fruit, juice, coffee, cereal, oatmeal, all kinds of good stuff.  The beds are comfortable and the rooms are spotless.  My favorite feature is the pool area - a two person hammock, spa with a little waterfall, and a grill that guests can use for BBQs.  Lovely place to get away for a night or two...and really feel like you took a vacation.
