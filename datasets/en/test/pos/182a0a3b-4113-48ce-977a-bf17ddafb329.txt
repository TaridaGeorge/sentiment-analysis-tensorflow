This was my first time for Boba! YAY BOBA!!

It was surprisingly good!  I ordered a green tea with milk and sugar syrup with regular boba....I Loved the flavor of the tea and the boba was cool, chewy like a gummy bear but doesn't stick to your teeth.

Cute and comfy atmosphere with a ton of different ways to order your boba. They also have  a small food menu which I didn't look at but saw what people were eating and it looked pretty good.

And if you've gotten a little tipsy after all your Boba drinking they even have a karaoke machine!

I can't wait to go back!
