This is a centrally located restaurant, I think with the best customer service of the Oregano's in the valley, that I've been to.  They are always welcoming, and instantly greeted upon arrival by anyone who sees you.  The only thing that exceeds their great customer service, is their incredibly menu full of fantastic different options.

They offer a healthier pizza crust, which is a thin, whole wheat crust for those looking to indulge a little, but still stay on the healthier side.  They have enormous portions so sharing is a great option.  They feature a lunch special from 11-3 which is really a great deal, and great food.

Last but certainly not least is the Pazookie.  This is the most intensely satisfying and delicious part of Oregano's.  Everyone who eats there ABSOLUTELY needs to order this... it is out of this world!
