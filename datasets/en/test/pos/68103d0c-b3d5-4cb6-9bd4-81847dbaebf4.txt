By far and away the best Italian food in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  
I have been going to this restaurant for the longesdt time and will not eat Italian food anywhere else.
Pasta made fresh every day and knowledgable and attentive workers around to make certain everything is perfect.
Make a reservation and be sure to be there on Saturday nights as the live music will make you want to stay for hours.  The singer has a fantastic voice with great traditional songs
