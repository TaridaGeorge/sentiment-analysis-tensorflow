This is an update to my previous review. To those who have commented and mentioned coming back, please do! Come in on Thursday night, The Karaoke is a blast! It is only on THURSDAY nights with Thom. Starting at 8pm you can sing your favorite songs. If he doesn't have it he can download it, if it is available for a fee, please tip him the amount of the download so he doesn't lose money on the night. He has over 13,000 songs so there is a lot to chose from! So get out and sing on Thursdays!!
