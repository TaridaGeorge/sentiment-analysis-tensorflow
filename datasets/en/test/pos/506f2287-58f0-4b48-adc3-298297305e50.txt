This place is legit bbq. I was here couple of months ago and found my receipt for this place and felt i had to write a review. 

I ordered the bbq sampler, cornbread and soda for less then $18. It was so much food, i couldn't finish everything.

Next time i'm in AZ, i will definitely be back!

P.S. The place is set up like a high school cafeteria. You wait in line, grab a tray, your utensils, fill your drink, order your food and pay at the end of the line. Kind of unique. But the wait is really long during dinner time. Waited 45 mins, but well worth it.
