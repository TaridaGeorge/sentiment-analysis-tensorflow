This butcher has the BEST fresh meats!   The meats from here are superior to anything you can buy from anywhere else and it is delicious!  Especially after hearing about all of the "fillers" most stores put in their meat, you know you're getting the good stuff here.  We even get our Thanksgiving fresh turkey here and marrow bones for our dog too!
