This place is amazing!  We go all the time, the food is just so good it leaves you craving more!  It's run by a husband and a wife, and they are so sweet.  They know exactly what we want and what drinks to get and always serve us with a big smile.  The rice they serve is so yummy, I could eat it all the time.  I myself am not big on Japanese/Chinese food, but this stuff is so yummy.  I always order the Chicken teryakki bowl, which comes with a huge serving of rice, chicken, a few vegetables and it's drizzled with some teryakki sauce.
