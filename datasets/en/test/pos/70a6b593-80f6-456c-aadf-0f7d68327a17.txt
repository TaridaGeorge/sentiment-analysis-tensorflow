This is my favorite coffee place in Phoenix. Its nice to finally get my coffee in a real coffee cup and saucer, not in a paper cup. To top of the amazing white chocolate mocha, they have homemade whip-cream that is to DIE for! The workers are nice, the atmosphere is great, and the crowd is fun. My band did an acoustic set there one night which was really nice. I love local music at a coffee joint. Nothing wrong with this establishment in my book!
