We got here for lunch at 11:45 am on a Saturday and were seated at a table for two right away. The service was stellar - all the wait staff were hustling. We split a Sonny Boy, and it was awesome. We also asked for an order of bread and olive oil (it's free), and were happy to munch on that while we waited for our pizza to cook. The bread was airy in the middle and crusty on the outside.
