My friend needed something to do while her car was getting worked on and she owed me a meal, so we both came to try out Bertha's.  A friend had recommended it and because it is tucked away in a shopping center, I had never had the opportunity to dine here.  First off, the place is adorable with a counter full of fresh baked goods.  The breakfast menu is small, but packing some heat.  I got the Brioche Egg Sandwich which came with pesto, argula, baked eggs and bacon.  Everything was right about that sandwich.  Their lunch menu looked even more appetizing.  The best part is that all of these triumphant sandwiches are between $5.50 and $7.50.  Cheap, delicious, and a certifiable local business.  Count me in, Bertha.
