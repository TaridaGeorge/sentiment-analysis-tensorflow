Simply great.  Excellent array of beers on tap and in the bottle.  Decent wine list.  

Food was fantastic.  Was with a group so I had the luxury of sampling a number of entrees.  The carne adovada was phenomenal.  Whatever dish you think you want, get it the second time you go and have the carne adovado first!
