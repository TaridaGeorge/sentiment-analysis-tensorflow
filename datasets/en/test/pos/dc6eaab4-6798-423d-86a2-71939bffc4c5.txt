My husband and I went with some friends for dinner and we had a great time. We sat outside, so I didn't get a good feel for what the inside was like, but my overall impression was clean and comfortable.

This place has great pricing for EVERYTHING during their happy hour. We got entirely too much food and drink, but we definitely left happy!

The food was really unique and had fun twists on old favorites. It's nice when restaurants put thought into their menus!
