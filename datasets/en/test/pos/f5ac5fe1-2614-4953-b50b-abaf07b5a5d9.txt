OK, I've decided that other coffee shops sell swill. I think about Dazbog coffee in a dreamy sort of way, like unstressed people think about sex. I mourn often that they open so damn late in the morning. Seriously, I would be there every day... 

The chocolate cappuccino rocks my world and perks me right the hell up, even on the mushiest afternoon. No bitterness, not overly sweet, just blissful- in an I've-just-been-bitch-slapped-by-caffeine sort of way, of course. 

Oh, and the sandwiches I complained about? Replaced by real deli looking ones in clam-shells. Far more appetizing. But what the hell do I need a sandwich for when I can have a giant red velvet cupcake? 

Don't make me break out the voodoo, Dazbog. Just open at 6:00 am like any other coffee shop and we'll be BFFs.
