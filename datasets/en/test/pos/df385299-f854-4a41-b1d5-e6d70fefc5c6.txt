La Grande Orange or LGO is where I take each and every one of my out of town visitors.  Why you might ask? The environment is chill, the food presentation and quality is exceptional and the staff is friendly.  I probably should get paid for all the free word of mouth advertising I do for LGO but it's well deserved.  The Commuter Sandwich (sub may for goat cheese) appears in my dreams from time to time -- it's really THAT good.  I also appreciate the eggwhites/turkey :Daybreaker for my health nut days.  I promise you won't be left unhappy after visiting this incredible establishment!
