A hidden treasure!

We try to make it to this place once a week, a great place for a quick lunch or a nice dinner, often times dinner comes with live jazz.  You will not run out of wine or liquor choices here.

Must try's include:
Crab Wontons  (Best in town!!!!)
Most of their dishes are great and can be had with rice or noodles.
