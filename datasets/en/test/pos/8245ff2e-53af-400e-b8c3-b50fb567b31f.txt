Went here for a 5-course wine pairing dinner at the beginning of May. Everything was perfect, from the wines that were matched expertly to each course, to the presentation of each dish. Will never hesitate to go here the next time it is suggested. Unless you have a particular aversion to a specific dish, you will be pleased with whatever you order. One of the best meals I have ever had.
