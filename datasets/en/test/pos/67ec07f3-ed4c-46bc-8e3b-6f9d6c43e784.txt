I brought my 2 year old son to Dr's Express because he was complaining about his wrist hurting due to a fall the night before. I figured I should just be safe and get it checked out. I picked Dr's Express because I knew they had in-office x-rays, which I know alot of urgent care offices don't offer. From the minute I checked my son in, we were taken care of. The staff was AWESOME!!! It's difficult to entertain a 2 year old, and the x-ray tech, Dr., and office manager were so patient and helpful. Turns out that my son actually did fracture his arm. The Dr. not only referred me to an Orthopedic Surgeon, but even made the follow-up appointment for me. Unparalleled service!! No doubt, with a little rambunctious boy, I'll need urgent care again... I will definitely be coming back!!!
