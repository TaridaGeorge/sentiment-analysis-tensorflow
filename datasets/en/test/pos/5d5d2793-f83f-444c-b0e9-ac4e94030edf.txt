Can't say enough about this place. We were amazed by the room and it's stylings and even more amazed with the pool and the view from it. We were on a mission to chill and found the perfect place. Views of Camelback Mountain and a staff that knew what they were doing. Try the brie quesadillas and the Sanctuary lemonade.
