Very good food! Fresh vegetables, fresh breads! Amazing! I was visiting AZ and a friend recommended I check it out and I was soooo pleased with the environment, cleanliness, and quality of everything. I had a goat cheese pizza with cherry tomatoes and basil that was soo delicious.  I also, recommend the smoked bacon apple tuna sandwich and seriously took tuna to another level! Their desserts!! Where do I begin!! .. from the chocolate chunk sea salt cookie to the red velvet cake! I couldn't leave without taking more home for everyone. I cant wait to go back to AZ for another visit!
