ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE. I've only lived in Scottsdale for 3 months, but have already been to almost every sushi joint in town, (Sapporros, hiro, pure, sakana, and stingray) yet none come close to this place. The fish is as fresh as when i eat it in california, The service is impeccable, and the atmoshpere is just down right cool. I highly recomend this place to anyone who is looking for QUALITY fish, great service, and a good time.
