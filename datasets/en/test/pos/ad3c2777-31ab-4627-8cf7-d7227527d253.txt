All I have to say is thank goodness they don't have this store back where I am from or I would gain soooo much weight.

This store generously gave both my mom and I a full size candy to try (not just a sliver) and even gave us an extra one for my grandma who was waiting in the car. 

Everything we brought home was really really good. I will miss this place but I am sure my waist won't.
