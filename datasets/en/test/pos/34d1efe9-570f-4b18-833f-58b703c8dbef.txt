Best brownies I have ever had the pleasure of meeting! I stopped in here after breakfast at The Gilbert House, and fell in love. Their chocolate macaroon frenzy brownie was heavenly.  Definitely a treat, and they ship too! They have a list of their flavors on their website, but its better to stop in, smell the delicous goodness, and view their cute gifts!
