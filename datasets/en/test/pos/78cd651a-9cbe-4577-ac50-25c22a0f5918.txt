Maybe it was just lucky timing, but I walked into Cigna Urgent care at 755 E McDowell and within FIVE minutes was brought back by a nurse for some screening.  Within ten minutes, i was seen by Dr. Michael Esmay.  Everyone had great customer service and generally positive attitudes.  I was very impressed and everyone was polite with great bedside manner.
