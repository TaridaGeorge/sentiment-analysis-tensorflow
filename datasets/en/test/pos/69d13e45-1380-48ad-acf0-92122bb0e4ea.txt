I am belong to those who are really picky about the glasses, and I used to spend weeks to look for one that I really like (and my wife does too :-) Anyway, I cannot have much to say about this but just GREAT store: great service, great glasses, great people, price: hummm a bit expensive, but i think that it well worth it for the new, fit and good look of your face.

I will definitlly take my wife there for hers later.

Thanks for reading.
