Love the variety and quality of food offered here. You can come here to shop for groceries, grab a meal, get some drinks, or my favorite. . .dessert. Every time I am invited somewhere for dinner, I always bring a fruit tart from Whole Foods. It is a big hit. The service here is great. It is never crowded too. The Whole Foods back in Los Angeles are always packed, so this location is refreshing. I also don't think it is expensive. You pay for what you get. They have plenty of options of less pricey goods.
