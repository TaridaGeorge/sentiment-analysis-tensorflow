I really love this place!  I found Yogurt Builderz because it's super close to my work.  Coworkers and I have popped in on more than one occassion for an afternoon pick me up.  They have some pretty standard flavors always on hand, but they also introduce some new ones into their lineup as well.  If you're unsure of what you want, don't worry, you can try some out before you make a final decision.  They have a wide range of toppings consisting of fresh fruit, cereals, nuts, candy, sauces, anything your wonderful little heart could desire.  Staff is always friendly and nice and it's always clean.  No toppings strewn messily around the bar and no yogurt messes either.  For repeat offenders they have a frequent buyer card, buy 9 get $3 off.  If you've never been, you're missing out!
