Visited this hidden gem on a Sunday night. The biggest downfall is that, if you are not familiar with PV mall, it is so hard to find! There are virtually no signs in the parking lot of the entire mall telling you where the theater is. The best way is to park on the bottom floor of the parking garage, and the closest entrance will lead you straight to the theater. 

The prices are here are some of the cheapest around - and why pay more to see the same movie? When I was there I bought two hot dogs, a bottled water, and a large soda and only spent around $8. AWESOME compared to some of the bigger movie theaters. 

Seats are comfy, usually isn't very crowded, and staff is friendly. Definitely recommended!
