Love this place, when I need my Indian fix, this Royal Taj is the cats meow! If you like/love Indian food like me, you have to try it! Their garlic Naan is amazing, The chicken Korma is possibly the best I have ever had (among the many other delicious morsels). The service is great, and the staff, which I think are the owners and immediate family are welcoming and genuine without fail! Royal Taj is a gem, and its good for big groups too!  Did I mention the food is even better a day later as left overs!!! Oh Yea! 

As a side note, last time we were in there, about a week ago, they were doing some renovations, and updating some decor, which already looked great!
