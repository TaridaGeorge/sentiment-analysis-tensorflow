I visited this place on a client's recommendation with my fiance.  When we arrived we were greeted and seated promptly.  We ran into two of our friends who were there for lunch as well!  The lunch specials are great.  They were very accommodating to special orders and substitutions.  It makes me happy when I can have brown rice rather than white, and tofu rather than meat.  I enjoyed the pumpkin in the spring rolls and the cucumber slice in the water...might I also mention my love for the bendy straws.  I will be back for lunch again.
