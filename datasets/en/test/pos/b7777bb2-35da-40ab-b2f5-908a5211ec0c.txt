I tried the Margharita pizza and it was delicious!  The atmosphere inside the restaurant is pretty cool as well, and the service was great.  We sat out on the Patio and our servers name was Andrew.  He recommended some type of "mashed" cocktails, I cant remember exactly, but they were phenomenal!  Did I mention how cute he is? ;)   I can't wait to go back when the weather is cooler here in Phoenix and sit out on the Patio.  I will definitely be going back to The Parlor soon.
