Honestly I'd have to give the place 4 1/2 stars if it were an option. The pizza borders of great, but not quite there. Still, you's have to drive a good distance and pay a lot more for better. This place is our favorite neighborhood pizzaria hands down. Amazing that the chains like Dominoe's can even survive in our neighborhood with Slice of Sicily here. Give it a try!
