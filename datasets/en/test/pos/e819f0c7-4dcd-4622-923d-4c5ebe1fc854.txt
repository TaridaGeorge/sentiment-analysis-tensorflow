Four of us had dinner at Nandos on Saturday night. We were graciously greeted at the door and escorted to our booth. The decor was pleasing and I was happy to see the wrought iron tree in the middle of the restaurant. The service was great. The staff was very upbeat and customer oriented. The food was delicious and all of us enjoyed our meals. We will definitely return. I wish them all the best in their new venture!
