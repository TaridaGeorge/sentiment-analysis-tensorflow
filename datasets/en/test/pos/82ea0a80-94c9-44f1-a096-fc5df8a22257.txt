I love this museum. The architecture is gorgeous. They have great collections. My girlfriend and I went to see the Modern Mexican exhibit last Wednesday when admission was free. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. It was my third visit to PAM and I always leave feeling energized and inspired. I highly recommend it.
