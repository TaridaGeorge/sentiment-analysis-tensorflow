A GEM tucked back in a strip mall corner, this restaurant has it all, excellent food and a glowing ambiance. Warm and inviting, from the moment you step in, you'll start drifting away from the world outside. 

Have a cozy, intimate meal or bring in a large group. Either way, service is efficient & unobtrusive. Yesterday, we were 10 and everything was hot & delicious. 

Marinara is chunky & fresh. Gluten free pasta and crusts are available. The pizza ingredients, with the sourdough crust are superb. Cheeses are the cheesiest. Could be the best pizza in Arizona.....
