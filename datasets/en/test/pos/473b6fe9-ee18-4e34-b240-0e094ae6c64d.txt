First found Roy's in Maui and then on Kauai, and then... WOW... Phoenix. Always enjoyed the one in Scottsdale and the one here at the Marriott is closer and great. Almost a feeling of Hawaii.. but not. Food is always great, the service is professional and the best. And now at the Marriott in San Diego on the Bay...great outdoor patio, drinks and food.
