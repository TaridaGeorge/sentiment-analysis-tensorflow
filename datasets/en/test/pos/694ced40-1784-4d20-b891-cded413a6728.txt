I just moved here from L.A. and although have visited a few local spots in search for some good music and talented musicians in these last few weeks, I have to say that this place is the first to accomplish that. The no frills grittiness of this place knows better than to take away from the amazing artists that come through there. I was there this week on Friday and back again on Sunday and I was not disappointed either night! just checked out next months line up and I am looking forward to seeing some great stuff!
