I really loved this restaurant.   I love fresh noodles and I ran over after seeing they make them to order.  They do this in some areas of China and the beef noodle soup tasted just like I had when I was in Bejing for the first time 15 years ago.  I recommend bringing your children in to see this man make noodles and have a nice, casual, well made, delicious,  inexpensive bite!
