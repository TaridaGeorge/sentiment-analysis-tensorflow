Unfortunately, I am not of legal age to drink, so I got a pretty legit Sharpie "X" on my hand before entering.

The group I came with was sat in the back towards those huge fermenting canisters. I love the atmosphere of the restaurant/bar and the servers are super attentive...even when the place is packed!!

Every time I've been here, their food tastes amazing, and their soda is super fresh! Highly recommend their chicken strips dipped in beer batter.....mmm my mouth is watering just thinking about them. You'll absolutely love their fries too!
