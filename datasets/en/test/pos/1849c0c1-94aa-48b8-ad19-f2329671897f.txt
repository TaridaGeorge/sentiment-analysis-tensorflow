The friendliest, most comfortable place to grab a bite in the immediate area!

I go to this Chilis at least once a week. Every time, I get great service. The servers are attentive. The atmosphere is pleasant - not too noisy. It's just a great place to get lunch with a friend or a colleague (dinner too).

One additional plus is that they have their own free parking lot. Being so close to the university, parking is at a premium. This makes it easy and stress free to get to the restaurant.

I would comment on the food but it's typical all American fare. Everything seems to be of high quality. The hamburgers are particularly tasty. Plenty of variety.

Although it's a chain restaurant, you really get a neighborhood feel. I highly recommend this Chilis.
