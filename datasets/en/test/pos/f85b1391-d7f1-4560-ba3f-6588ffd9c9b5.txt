I'm always interested in a bargain.  This is a good place to start.  They have most everything that I generally need to get by in a week starting with produce, energy drinks, cleaning supplies, books, plates and even Belkin carrying cases for my Nano ipod!

They open at 8:00 a.m. on Sundays which is ideal for running errands with my son.  They even have fun toys and puzzles that keep him occupied.

Once we are done here, next stop Fresh & Easy......
