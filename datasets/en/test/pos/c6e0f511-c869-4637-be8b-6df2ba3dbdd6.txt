NICEST movie theatre I have been to. This Place is AWESOME! They took a rundown theatre and made it into something special. When you walk in it smells like leather bound books and rich mahogany. The seats are leather or pleather not cheap cloth they have real food here and even serve beer in select theaters. They have D-Box seating where your seat moves with the movie, so if they are driving in a car it feels like your in the car. This place ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!
