O.M.G.!!!!!!  My mouth is drooling just typing this review.  

Back home (San Diego), the best bbq place to dine at is Phil's BBQ.  This place is 100 times better than Phil's.  We ordered the "Whole Hog Heaven" and it was plenty for two.  Their pulled chicked, brisket, ribs and beef ribs are delicious and came with 3 sides.  The Mac N Cheese (Yummy), the beans (Tasty) and the roasted corn (excellent) were a hit.  

When I go back to AZ, I will MAKE sure to come back to visit Bobby Q.   Trust me...You will NOT be disappointed.
