Very good Italian sandwich in the New Jersey/East Coast fashion. Italian meats, shredded lettuce, onion and tomato and that awesome Italian blend dressing (oil, vinegar, salt, pepper, dried herbs, etc) The dressing was perfect and classic combination of tart, sweet and salty. Oh and Provolone cheese. Again. Very traditional. 

 Let the dressing meld into the sandwich a bit before eating. Very good, very crusty bread that won't get soggy with the dressing. 

The line was crazy long when we got there. But it moves real fast. People literally eat and run so seating is available. Lots of cops and lawyers.
