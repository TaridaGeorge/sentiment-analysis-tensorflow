I abuse my bike and the chain is often out of alignment making a constant clacking  /grinding noise and running pretty rough.  I took my bike in just to get new tubes put in since I'm also really good at running over nails and wood staples.  I went back a couple hours later and not only had they put in the new tubes, they tuned it up so it ran smoothly and quietly.  Sure i get from here to there easier now, but it now it takes twice as long to work off the same number of calories.  Damn you Landis Cyclery!  Daaaaaamn Yooooou!  Great service, good price.  Highly recommend.
