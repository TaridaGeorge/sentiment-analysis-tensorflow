Awesome, awesome, awesome! I am a regular customer to this store and am always updating the interior design of my place. What's nice is we just bought our first home and I am having no problem finding help with all my bedroom and dining room furnishing needs. If they have an item out on the floor that is damaged, they'll give you 10% off of it. They've helped me carry and fit many awkward items in my car on serveral occasions. They know when to help you and when you just want to be alone to browse.
