Was in Phoenix for a softball tournament on the weekend of April 9th-10th and we had the pleasure of stopping in at FEZ for Brunch on Sunday...well if you know softball tournaments, you'd know that if we were there for brunch our tournament didn't go all that well lol.  Anyways...FEZ was recommended to us by a player on a Phoenix team and it was on the way back to the hotel so Brunch as FEZ it was.  There was 10 of us and they sat us pretty quickly. Service was fast and friendly. Everyone was overly satisfied with the food and I enjoyed my mimosas.  We had an awesome experience at FEZ and I would definitely go back if I'm ever in Phoenix again.  Fun little side note...we ran into our server at a bar later and he was a hoot...not to mention a cutie lol
