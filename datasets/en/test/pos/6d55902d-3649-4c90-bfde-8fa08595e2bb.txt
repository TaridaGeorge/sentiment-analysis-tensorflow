went to the Saturday seafood buffet here and after a two hour wait in line i finally got a seat. When I got seated I was starving and it was a good thing because this was the best buffet i have ever been to.They had piles of crab legs ,steamed clams,mussels,grilled salmon.crispy frog legs and various shrimp dishes as well as a mountain of peel and eat shrimp.There was also prime rib and a couple of chicken dishes. As far as veggies go they had bok choy with shitake mushrooms,brussel sprouts,corn on the cob. they sure now how to put on a good buffet. As far as the two hour wait , well it was worth it this food rocked. I would recommend this one to anyone and it is on Fridays and Saturdays 4pm to 10 pm
