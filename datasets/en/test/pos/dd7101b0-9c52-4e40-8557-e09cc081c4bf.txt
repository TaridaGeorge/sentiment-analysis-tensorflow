OMG for a Wednesday night the place is pack. 
Our waitress was great, she was happiness from the beginning to end. for that they get a extra star. ;-)

I started with hot tea and rock sugar, which is a great way to warm up on a cold night.The lentils soup was awesome.
The Lamb Kuzi was GREAT! The meat falling off the bone, the only down side was there wasn't more of it. 
To finish off the meal with Baklava.

Great way to end the middle of week
Definitely will go back!
