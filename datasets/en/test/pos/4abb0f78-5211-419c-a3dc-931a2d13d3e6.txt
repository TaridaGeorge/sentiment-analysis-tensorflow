The sushi here is SO DELICIOUS!  People gave it fewer stars because they don't take reservations and the service is sometimes slow - but that's because people love this place and it is always buzzin with people.  

The best rolls are: the Morning Dew (takes long to cook, but SO worth it), the Summertime Roll, and the Las Vegas Roll

The fish here is always fresh and the sushi is always on point.  If you're looking for the best fish and the most innovative rolls, Stingray is the place.
