Ok, I have not been very good at staying away from this place.  In the past month I have been there at least 3 times.  That is a lot for someone who is trying to avoid sweets.  Yes, yes, I am in denial.  I had pistachio when my mom came to visit.  My daddy used to love pistachio and as a child we always shared a cup.  It was really great, my mom had the Dolce Latte, that was to die for.  The sugar rush was awesome.  My twins had strawberry, of course, my little boy ends up eating half of his sister's cup.  He is an ice cream/gelato junkie.  Today, I stopped by again and had to have the Dolce Latte, YUM!
