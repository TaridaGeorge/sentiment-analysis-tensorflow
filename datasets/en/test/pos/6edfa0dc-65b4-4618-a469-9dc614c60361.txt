As always, Chandler Pools are very reasonably priced.  $2.25 for adults, $1 for kids.  You can't beat that.

This pool is clean and has a a very kid-friendly environment.

There's a slide for kids that are better swimmers.  It dumps you about 3 feet above the pool and it makes quite a splash.  For my daughters, that is the selling point of this pool.

There is also a taller slide that is meant for smaller kids. 

At the other side of the pool is a zero-depth play area that consists of a giant water spout that spills out water from about 15 different places.  There's a concrete statue of a whale that spurts water out of its blowhole. There is also a slide structure that is meant for toddlers.

They have a couple of lap lanes.

The facility gets an A for cleanliness.
