Believe the Hype!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This place Rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Definitley in my Top 3 BBQ I have ever had & I've been to Texas & the rest of the South! Best Pulled Pork & brisket hands down!! Also the best Mac & Cheese. Only complaint I have, is of their 4 sauces, I only loved one(Sweet & Mild), but the meat was so, tender juicy & delicious, it didn't need much sauce, if at all. Keep up the good work. I live within 5 miles, so they have a new regular customer for a long time!!!!!!!
