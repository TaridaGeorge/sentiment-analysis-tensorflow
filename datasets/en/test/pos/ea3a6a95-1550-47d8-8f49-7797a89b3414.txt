Everyone else should be at least moderately concerned about female breast health....

I was a little concerned about my first baseline mammogram today, but let me tell you, ladies, it was nothing. Piece of cake. No pain, not even any discomfort. The office of BenOra was very nice, the staff was very efficient and pleasant, and the technology was top notch (digital as opposed to film). I was in and out in less than 45 minutes, including first-time patient paperwork. 

So even if you are healthy, current protocol is to have a baseline mammogram once between the ages of 35 and 40. The vast majority of the staff here is female. They do some other types of scanning as well as biopsies. I would recommend BenOra highly- they are complete professionals.
