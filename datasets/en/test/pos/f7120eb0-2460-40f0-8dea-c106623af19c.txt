The staff are very friendly and remember you when you visit repeatedly.  Beautiful open dining area inside and umbrella tables outside for when you want to enjoy the view of the mountains or take in some fresh air.  Pastries are just as delicious as anywhere else you will find and even have sugar free or low cal options.  I'd highly recommend supporting this local bakery and coffee shop.

I have to edit this because I can't express enough how fresh the baked goods are ... I "reverted" to a "popular coffeehouse" once and was instantly reminded why I like Brubaker's ... the muffin was cold and had that "just thawed out" feeling.  Spend the same amount at Brubaker's and get 300% better product in the baked goods.
