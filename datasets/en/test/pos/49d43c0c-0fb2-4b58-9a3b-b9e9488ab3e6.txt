One word, INCREDIBLE!!!! That describes everything i have tried at Haus Murphy's. If you want to experience complete bliss then try the gnocchi, theres is really fantastic. Its definitely the best i have ever had. Also, there sausage is great and (I cant believe im saying this because I am someone who used to hate it but) There sauerkraut is amazing. I couldn't stop eating it.
   The place has a very nice historic feel to it which adds to the experience. They have a nice outdoor seating area and some nights they have a band that plays out there. 
    Just try Haus Murphy's, I know you wont be disappointed.
