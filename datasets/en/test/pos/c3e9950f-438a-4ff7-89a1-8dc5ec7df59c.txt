Love, love, love this place. It is boutique-y, sweet, contemporary, and a little piece of paradise. 

The pool is fun, the staff is approachable and friendly, and the restaurant, ZuZu rocks. I could live on the granola that they make in-house. 

On the granola topic, the last day of my stay, I had to leave the hotel at 6:30am in order to catch a flight. I woke up at 4:30am to hit that granola up one more time before leaving. That's how good it is. No joke.
