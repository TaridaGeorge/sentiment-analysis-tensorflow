I had the misfortune of having and abnormal pap since then have recently spent a lot of time in this office. I cannot remember the actual doctor I was slated to see, but he was unavailable so I was given Shelley Cross the PA. I cannot sing her praises loud enough. She took a very scary experience and turned it in to a normal process to go through. She took so much time to explain everything to me, from the precancerous cells in my body to the actual procedure to remove them. Her attention to detail and kindness were amazing.  She followed up with me personally and called a few times to check on my recovery. I would recommend her to anyone. The entire staff in this office really helped to turn a not so pleasant experience in to something bearable.
