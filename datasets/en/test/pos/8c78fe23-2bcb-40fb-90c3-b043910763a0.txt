LOVE Lustre Bar! It's on the 2nd floor of Hotel Palomar at Cityscape. Hotel Palomar is already on top of Cityscape, so the 2nd floor offers a great view of the city! We went for happy hour on Friday and had a blast! They have $6 signature cocktails, 1/2 off most wines and several apps and flatbreads for under $6! I had the pulled duck flatbread with apples and Gruyere, which was dynamite! I also had this drink called Ruppels somethingorother that's my new fave drink, for now. it's prosecco, honey, allspice liquore and I think lemonade...awesomeness! the atmosphere at Lustre is super chill. Open air rooftop bar with a great live DJ a bit later in the evening and a pool to have drinks by. All in all, I couldn't ask for more out of a cool downtown rooftop bar!
