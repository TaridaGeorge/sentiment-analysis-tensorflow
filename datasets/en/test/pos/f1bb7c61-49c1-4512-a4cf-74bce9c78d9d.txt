Ok, the gyros are out of this world. We eat gyros everywhere we can find a place that looks good.  The gyro meat here is not dry, it's nice and moist and fresh.  The veggies are perfectly crisp and portioned out. The sauce is better than the average and compliments the gyro.  The pita was as fresh as it gets and slightly grilled making it nicely warm.  If you get the combo plate, which is really a good deal the french fries are really excellent and I'm not a huge fan of fries.  This is a small family owned and run place and I hope the community will do its part to continue to support this local business so we can continue having good local food.
