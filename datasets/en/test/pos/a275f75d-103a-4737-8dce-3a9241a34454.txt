I go for the big burger -- only $5 on Wed. -- and happy hour at Rico's at the Pointe Squaw Peak.  I love it when Elle is the bartender.  That gal knows how to make drinks!  So friendly and efficient and always remembers your name.  Hmmm, sounds like a TV show.  Get the sweet potato fries and the wings and the BBQ chicken flat bread.  All good.  Ask for the wings hot and spicy.  The bar is always full during happy hour.   Definitely a good sign of a great place to hang out.
