I just came from having dinner at J&K Gourmet. The food was absolutely FANTASTIC. I  ordered a small Wonton soup. The portion was very generous. It did not only have wonton in there but lots of vegetables and chicken. As an entree I had the Asparagus Delight. I can truly say, that this is THE VERY BEST Chinese food I have ever had in my 50 years! I will be back!!!
