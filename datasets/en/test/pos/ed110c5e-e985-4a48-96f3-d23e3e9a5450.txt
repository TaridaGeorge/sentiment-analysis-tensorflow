Great place... i went there for lunch... I found the menu not real large but the food was excellent... they basically had sandwhices that were made with pizza bread and then a choice of side... i had mine with a salad and it was 9 bucks... not too bad of prices for the amount of food you get... i am really looking forward to tryign it at night... you should check it out!
