OMFG, I would give this store six stars if I could!!  Awesome find in a city with an ethnic food profile that would be described as lackluster at best.  Plus this place is CHEAP.  They have filet mignon for less than six bucks a pound and they're pretty dang good!  Are they Ruth's Chris good, no-but for the price (or even twice the price) I doubt you'll be able to find better.  I sure haven't and I go all over the Valley to visit food stores.
Produce, noodles, sauces, tea, spices, flour there's little you CAN'T find here! 
I need to quit my job I think...LOL!
