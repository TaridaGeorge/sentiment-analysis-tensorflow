I don't know what's going on with these guys who work here... Free beer at lunch? Who knows... But, every time me and/or my Wife have been in this place, the staff is REALLY helpful and friendly! I went there this afternoon to have a battery checked (dead as a doornail) and get an air filter for my Prius. Exceptional customer service as always. They will even help you in the parking lot with things like windshield wipers, etc. I wouldn't go anywhere else for auto parts!
