I recently found this place online and decided to give it a try. I was hesitate because it was a 40 minute drive from home, but my boyfriend and I were looking for something new to try. I was so impressed with this place. It looks newly remodeled and has a very cute feel to it. I ordered a carmel banana marshmellow bowl and it was to die for. Defiantly worth the drive, it is a little pricey for ice cream, but worth evey penny! Wish this place was closer, it rocks!
