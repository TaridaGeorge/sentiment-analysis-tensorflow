Vito's is the decendent of White Cottage Pizza in Wood Dale IL, a suburb of Chicago.
Vito and his wife retired a few years ago and transitioned the Pizzeria to other family members from Chicagoland.

The deep dish is authentic and WONDERFUL. It is tasty, the crust is flaky and the toppings are high quality. This IS the GO-TO place for Chicago style deep dish pizza. 

Call ahead and avoid the 45 minute wait for one of these bad boys. While the strip shopping center is a strip shopping center, I have never had a bad experience and have found that parking is usually available right in front of the restaurant. There is a liquor store in the shopping center where one can purchase adult beverages to be enjoyed in the pizzeria.

Abondanza!
