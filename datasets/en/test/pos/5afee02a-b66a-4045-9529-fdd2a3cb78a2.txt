Enjoyed my experience with Scott, Jill and all the others at Scottsdale Fine Jewelers. Everyone was very knowledgeable and easy to work with.  I needed to resize a few rings, update a few pieces and  also had a  custom piece of jewelry made for me.  Everything turned out just perfect. 
I will be back!
