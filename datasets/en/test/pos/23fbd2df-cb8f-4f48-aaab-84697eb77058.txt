Thai House excelled - again. Two months ago I placed a take-out order of the spicy noodles w/ chicken, spice level 2. It came out being a 6 or 7 - inedible. Called to complain and was promised they would make it right next time.
Came back a few days ago and mentioned the incident. The guy behind the counter went through some notes, found my name and offered me another spicy noodles on the house. Bravo! And it was excellent; perfect spice-level and flavorful. 
Kudos, Thai House.
