You're transported to that little restaurant around the corner from the train station in Doko-demo, Japan - the Japanese version of Cheers - where everyone knows you like sushi and eating the simple, good things. We loved the crab sunumono, agedashi tofu, calamari, fried smelts and gyozo to start, and then fresh sushi - in the desert - was wonderful - especially the uni. I had heard about this place for 2 years and finally went - and it became of our best new discoveries in the past year. Hiro Sushi is not fancy, but it's good. Highly recommended.
