After my dogs nueter at another vet, some swelling, and a receptionist telling me that basically my dog is going to die from internal bleeding I rushed to this office after a recommendation from a coworker. Dr Carr and his staff were incredible and eased my mind quickly. They took great care of me and my dog, and sent me on my way with the medicine I needed right from the office, no other stops necessary. My dog was fine as the staff had assured me over the phone. I will not take my dogs to another vet again, this office is far superior.
