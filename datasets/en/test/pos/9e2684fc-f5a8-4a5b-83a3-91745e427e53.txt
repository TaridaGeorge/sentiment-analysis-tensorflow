Five stars. (updated from my earlier post). The owner contacted me and encouraged me to return. We made a special stop for the butter cake and found it to be perfect. The staff was warm and welcoming. I think that 8.50 is pricey for lunch dessert but the quality and presentation is there, so I will continue to be a happy customer and order the cake. Kudos to the owner for following up with a customer with grace and style. Recommend that you give this Caffe a try. They have marvelous  selections in addition to the cake.
