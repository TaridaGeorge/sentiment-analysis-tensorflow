I'm not a chocolate person (I know there must be something wrong with me), but their chocolate souffle is h-e-a-v-e-n-l-y!!!  I go there now just for that and their martini's....oh and the outdoor resort atmosphere!!!  Pair that with great company (**wink wink**)...and you have the perfect evening!!
