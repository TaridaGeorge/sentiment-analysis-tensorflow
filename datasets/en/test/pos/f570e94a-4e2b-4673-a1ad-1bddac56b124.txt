Love cheesesteaks? Love sweet potato fries? Then you've yelped the right place. My fianc√©e and I stopped in here yesterday because I had a craving for some sweet potato fries. The employees are very friendly and helpful. We ordered a Large plain cheesesteak and a side of sweet potato fries. Everything was delicious, like others have said the steak was not dry at all. My only complaint is the price you pay for sweet potato fries and the amount you get. Other than that this place was freakin' awesome! We will defiantly be back
