I use this location for a quick wash all the time. I have always been happy. Only on occasion do they get a bit in a hurry and don't properly pre scrub my bumpers and windshield. Generally friendly folks and I like the towel down at the end - I always tip a dollar to the guy. The full Cobblestone wash location at Bell and AZ 51 is pretty good too. Yes, too much pressure for the window scratch guy and the upsell as well as the "boss" designation - but for all that, compared to my very negative experiences with Danny's I come here.
