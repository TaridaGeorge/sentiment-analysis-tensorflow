I'm always on the Lookout for Nice Cigar shops, as my Husband has become quite fond of them and I like to bring them home and surprise him.

This shoppe was particularly nice because not only did it have a large walk in with tons of cigars (see pics) 
They also had a nice selection of table top Humidor boxes, a couple large standing Humidor cases, a variety of other accessories and the best part, A dedicated Smoking Lounge in the  back complete with Plasma TV and several leather chairs and  a couch.

If you are in need they also rent Humidor Lockers.
