My kids had an absolute blast here.  There's a big glass window between the customer area and the cutting area, and the butcher in the back continually threw scraps of meat at the window.  They would stick, and my kids would laugh hysterically.  Alright, my kids aren't like other kids.  But the steaks (cut to order) and bacon cooked up wonderfully.  By far, the most fun I've ever had at a butcher shop.
