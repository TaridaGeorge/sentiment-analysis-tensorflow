This place is amazing!  Genuine Szechuan specialties, virtually unavailable in most of AZ.  The authenticity is unmatched, so don't be surprised by the heat level...traditional Szechuan food is loaded with chiles.

Try the cumin beef, or the water-boiled dishes.  Go for the Szechuan dumplings in their spicy sauce, and you'll never see pot stickers the same way again.  Be adventurous.  

If you want Panda Express, go to Panda Express.  Don't go to a real Szechuan place and order orange chicken.  it's like going to a great Italian restaurant, ordering the chicken parmesan, and complaining about the lack of breading.
