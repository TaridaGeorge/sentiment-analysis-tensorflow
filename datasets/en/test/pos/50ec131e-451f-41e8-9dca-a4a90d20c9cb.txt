This is the spot to get Gyros when I'm in AZ (will be back there in a few days).  I've been going here every time I visit for the last few years and it's been very consistent.  The same owners, same great food and service.  I've tried almost everything and the only complaint (if you can call it that) was when I got the Gyros salad, there was TOO MUCH meat on it.

Definitely a place I can trust when taking a friend to get some gyros for the first time..
