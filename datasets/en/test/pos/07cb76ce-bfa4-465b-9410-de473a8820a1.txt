um as far as brunch goes, it does not get better in scottsdale!! this place is so good...i have tried so many different things on the menu and all of them have been amazing. They are really good at making things unique which i love. I have taken many ppl here and everyone still talks about it! This is definitely one of my top 2 favorite brunch spots and the other one is in chicago, so go here if you are in the area, it is worth the wait
