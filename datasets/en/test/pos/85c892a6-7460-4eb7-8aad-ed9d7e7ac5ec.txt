Little Miss Amy D.  just turned me onto this great trail. What could be better early on a Sunday than a luscious slice of the Phoenix Desert?Lots of space and choices on which way to go.  Beautiful views  on many sides and not tons of people.   For those who don't like rocky trails this tends to be flatter and not real bumpy.  Give it a try ..Call me I 'll meet you there!
