Man, this is a college foodie's dream. Incredible, inexpensive food. I used to go so often that the cashier knew I wanted a tabbouli to go with my meal. 

Favorites: tabbouli, hummus, lamb tongue sandwich, falafel, kafta koobideh. The plates are a great deal, especially the chicken shawarma. Rice, chicken, garlic sauce, hummus, tabbouli, and pita. It's a mountain of food. Enough for at least 2 meals. 

And it's connected to a little grocery so you can stock up on pita, feta cheese, and spices. They used to have a really good peach malt drink, but I couldn't find it last time I went. 

Sunday it's only open for takeout, but you can still grab a table and eat there. You just won't have waiter service.
