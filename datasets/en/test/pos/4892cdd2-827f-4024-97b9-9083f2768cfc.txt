My boyfriend and I found this place when we were visiting his family in phoenix recently and what a find it was. 
I tried the pecan and mango popsicles. The bf had the chocolate and the peach mint popsicles.  (we had seconds because they were so good!)

Calling these delights a "popsicle" is almost an understatement. The fruit paletas are like fruit frozen on a stick! The paletas only use freshly cut fruits ripened on the shop's shelves. Everything is homemade.. they told me that they even make the cookies in the cookies 'n creme popsicle!

You can just tell that the owners pay a lot of attention to detail.. as seen in the unbelievable gourmet flavors of the popsicles, to the bite mark mold, to the shop itself-- spotless, white, chic. 

It's great. I'll definitely be back to phoenix just to try more of these paletas.
