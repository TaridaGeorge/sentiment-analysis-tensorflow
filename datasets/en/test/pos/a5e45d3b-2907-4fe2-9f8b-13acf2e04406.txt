I hired Sorensen Heating and Cooling for regular air conditioning service.  Brian is very knowledgeable, honest, and he explained everything clearly to me.  There were no hidden costs and I never felt pressured into paying for anything extra or unnecessary.   He called me 30 min prior to let me know he was on his way and arrived within the allotted window of time.  In addition, he brought his own ladder and shoe covers!  I am very pleased with this company's service and will definitely hire them in the future.  I highly recommend Sorensen Heating and Cooling.
