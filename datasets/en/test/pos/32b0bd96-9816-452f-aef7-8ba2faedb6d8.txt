This place is really in the middle of nowhere and it's too bad because I'm sure they will be out of business soon. I probably eat there at least once a week and I have yet to have a bad meal. The chipotle steak sandwich is my favorite and the people there are as friendly as they get. Hurry up and help save this place.
