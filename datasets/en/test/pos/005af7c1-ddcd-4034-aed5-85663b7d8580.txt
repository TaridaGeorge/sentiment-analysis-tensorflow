Truly an amazing meal.  Great space, open kitchen is very entertaining.  Sincere, warm, friendly service.  And outstanding food.

The chicken is phenomenal - perfect example of how a humble dish can excel with great execution.  Someone in your party has to order it.  The lamb was similarly terrific.  The braised leeks are well covered in other reviews here and are a great choice, but the fennel was even better - the ratio of various ingredients perfectly balanced and with just the right amount of dressing.

If you consider yourself a "foodie" - or whatever annoying term we use to describe ourselves - you owe yourself a trip to FnB.  This is a restaurant that could thrive in any market in the country - Phoenicians be thankful it is in your hood.
