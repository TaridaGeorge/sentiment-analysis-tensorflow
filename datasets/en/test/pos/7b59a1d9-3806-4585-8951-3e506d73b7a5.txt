My husband and I had the pleasure of eating dinner here recently.  I have to say the fish was very fresh and delicious.   My husband and I both knew it was going to be a pricey night but we also both said "You get what you pay for".  

We spoke with the owner and he was very attentive as was the wait staff.  We both enjoyed our sushi and I have to say the combo my husband had was delicious as well.  I had to try it.  

My favorite was the Crazyhorse Roll.  All I can say is YUMMY!  And the Philly Roll was really good too.  

If you want some really good sushi you have to check this place out.  The cost is so worth it!
