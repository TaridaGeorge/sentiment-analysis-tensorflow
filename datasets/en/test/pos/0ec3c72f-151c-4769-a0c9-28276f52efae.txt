Chicken wings and cheeseburger meal... Yummmayyyy

ever since i've moved away from arizona, i can honestly say that china grill is what i miss most.. their chicken fried rice is really good and so is their cheeseburger.. their general tso's chicken extra spicy is my bf's favorite.. almost everything is good here!!
