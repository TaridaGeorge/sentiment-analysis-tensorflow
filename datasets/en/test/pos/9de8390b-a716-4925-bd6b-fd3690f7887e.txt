This place has the nicest people working in it!  No kidding!  You have got to check it out.  Great for gifts, and they have some really awesome home accessories.  It's not just French stuff, really - mostly French or French-inspired.  Anyone who wants to throw a little "chic" into their interiors should definitely pay a visit.  I know.  I'm an interior designer.  Take my free advice.

Also, the prices are reasonable, and they have this really cool new line of colognes that are great for gals and guys.

Oh-and some of the women's clothing is unusual AND gorgeous.

I highly recommend this place.
