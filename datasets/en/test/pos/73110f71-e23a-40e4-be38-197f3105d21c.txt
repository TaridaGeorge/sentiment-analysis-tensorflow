Absolutely amazing, EVERYTHING we had was delicious and my only compliant is that I don't live closer to a Bandera! All the apps were delicious, cornbread it to die for and the deviled eggs, salad, meatballs were all scrumptious as well! We had the chicken and the macho salad which were also yummy! Margaritas were also great as well! I will be back next time Im in Scottsdale or wherever else I can find one (I've been to the one in Chicago and plan on trying the Corona del Mar one too)
