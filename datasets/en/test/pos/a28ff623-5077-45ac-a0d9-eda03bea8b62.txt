My wife and I went here last night after dinner for some custard.  We split a small cup of vanilla which was a mistake because after taking a few bites I wanted scoops more.  Anyway, the vanilla custard is fantastic!  Very rich, creamy, sweet and delicious.  I honestly cannot wait to have it again!!
