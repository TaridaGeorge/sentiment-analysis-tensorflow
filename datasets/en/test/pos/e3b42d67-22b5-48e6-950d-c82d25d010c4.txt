Vintage now has a new menu(Fall/Winter) with a great list of choices.

The salmon dish is outstanding with brilliantly unique flavors.

The beef tenderloin is very good and an easy favorite.

The tomato bisque is second to none.  On top of it, they put grilled cheese croutons  in with your soup that are over the top good.  

Of course...All day HH on Wednesdays plus great music from a very good duo makes it my every-Wednesday-spot.
