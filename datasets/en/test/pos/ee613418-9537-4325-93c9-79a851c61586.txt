I've eaten A LOT of Pho around the country and have never had better.

It's the only thing I've tried here, but with soup that good, why try anything else.

The owners will also customize your soup as per request.

My wife loves the Pho and is a fan of the lemongrass tofu EXTRA SPICY!

The spring rolls are amazing.  Again, the best I've had.
