Awesome, fresh, home-cooked food. Mostly salads and sandwiches for lunch. Plenty of ready to heat/eat take-home dinner selections as well. Fantastic desserts from scratch. And a small, specialty grocery store to boot! 

Had the beef brisket on special for lunch. Perfectly cooked, served hot with swiss, mustard and red onion on a Kaiser roll. I liked it so much, they let me buy what was left in the kitchen to take home. Now that's service.

A lunch consisting of the daily special, a turkey wrap, two sides and two drinks and ran about $20 for two people. Maybe a bit on the pricey side, but the quality and service were worth it. For a neighborhood lunch/takeout dinner spot, this place is hard to beat.
