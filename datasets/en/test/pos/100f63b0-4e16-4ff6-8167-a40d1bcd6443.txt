Antique Trove is one of the best places to dig for antiques in the Valley. Whenever I have an afternoon with nothing to do, I come here. I've found an awesome selection of 100-year-old postcards, an end table, an old tapestry, old shoes and some nice plates all here at Antique Trove. Unlike some other places that claim to have "antiques," this place actually has mostly things that are at least 50-years old -- not just shelves and shelves of crap like Smurf collectibles or Precious Moments figurines...thank God...
