I LOVE this place! We live right around the corner from one and I could go there everyday. I've had a lot of items on there menu and I have enjoyed each and every dish. The service is outstanding and I enjoy the selection they have for beverages. I'm a beer girl so I was pleased when I found out that they carry a nice variety on tap as well as seasonal shipments. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone, whether you go with your family or you go to watch the game with friends because it is awesome. If you like peanuts, they are available at your table and you can just throw the shell on the ground.
