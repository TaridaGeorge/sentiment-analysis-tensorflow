Best. Frozen. Yogurt. Place. Ever. Period.

Love that they change up the flavors every now and then. The seasonal oatmeal raisin and pumpkin flavors are amazing. They let you control all your toppings (NOT like that other place). They also have seasonal toppings too. Right now they have Cracker Jacks as toppings to celebrate baseball spring training Cactus League.  If the number of flavors overwhelms you, there are free sample cups that you can pick up at the register upon entering the shop.  The price per ounce is also very reasonable. I love this place and I always try to think of excuses to come here :) 

I can't wait to take my sister here when she comes to visit me!
