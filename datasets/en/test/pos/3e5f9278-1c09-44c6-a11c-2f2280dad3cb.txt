Not very often do I crave a nice polish meal but this past weekend the craving hit me solidly and I suddenly found the urge to get some perogi smothered with sour cream  and no I'm no pregnant nor have the proper organs to be carrying a child. So I went with a friend to this cool little place near downtown glendale.
The day was cold so sitting outdoors was out of the question but the outdoor seating looked like it would be perfect on a warmer day. Inside the place was, dare I say, cute, quaint and cozy.  
The food was delicious. I had Perogi and white borsht. At the end of my meal the craving was satisfied and I could go on living. The owner and staff were very friendly.
