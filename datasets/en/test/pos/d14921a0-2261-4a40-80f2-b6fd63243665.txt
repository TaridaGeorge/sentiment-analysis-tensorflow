What a wonderful place. They make chocolate, pastry, cookies, pies and on Sunday they make omelets for breakfast. You are handed a card with a list of ingredients, you circle what you want, and in a few minutes a yummy omelet is set before you. It was light and creamy, with all fresh ingredients. It is served with hot yeast rolls and fresh fruit. I wound up taking half of my omelet home, and finished it the next day. The coffee is really good, and the chocolates are wonderful. This is a true neighborhood gem, it reminds me of San Francisco.  It was so good, I think we are going to be regulars here.
