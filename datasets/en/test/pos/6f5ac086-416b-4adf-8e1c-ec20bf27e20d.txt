I've been visiting quite a few frozen yogurt places in the past few months, and so far, this is the best.
Not only are their flavors delish, the texture of their yogurt is creamy and wonderful. The toppings rock, as well. It's next to Sprinkles Cupcakes, and in my not-so-humble opinion, it's a better bet than the cupcakes next door. 
I visited the Yogurtland in Waikiki this week and it was absolutely delish with local flavors that I bet we won't get here in Scottsdale (boo) but this is by far the best I've tasted in my area.
