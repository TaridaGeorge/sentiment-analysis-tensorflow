I have been seeing Dr. Caserta for years and am very surprised at what Alie C. wrote.  I've NEVER had to wait an hour for my appointment.  Dr. Caserta and his staff have ALWAYS been nice and polite.  Perhaps you were there on an off day, or maybe they squeezed you in when they could.  There are two doctors there, so it is possible that people are seen in different order.  Were you rude or demanding yourself?  After all these years I've never heard anyone say what you did about the doctors, or their office help.
