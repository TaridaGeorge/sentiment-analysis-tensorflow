I love this place. 

It's not just all college kids.  There are plenty of people in their 30s and upward that come here to enjoy the brewery, and food.  I love it because it's big, lots of seating, water mysters for outside, tons of people, very laid back, no dress code..  The guys can watch their sports on tv's, and the girls can just sit back and relax.

The food is great too by the way.  

Seriously... I don't know what else to say but that I love everything about Four Peaks.
