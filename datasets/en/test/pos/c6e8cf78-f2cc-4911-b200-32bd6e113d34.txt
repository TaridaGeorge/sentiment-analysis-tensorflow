Women: Don't let the name fool you. Alongside the barbershop is a wonderful women's beauty salon, separated from the guys by a wall. It's small, intimate, and comfortable. My stylist, Erin Leastman, did a great job of undoing the damage done by another stylist in Phoenix (a bad cut), and I absolutely love both the cut and the style. The price was very reasonable for the service I received. I am really happy with Erin & CNC and definitely will go back many times.
