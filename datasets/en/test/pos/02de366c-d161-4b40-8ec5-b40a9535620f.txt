This recently reopened chinese buffet is awesome. Salt and pepper shrimp, all types of pork and chicken dishes, salmon, delicious sushi, even some american food for picky kiddies. There is a mongolan stir fry area, and all the food is very fresh, constantly replenished and the desserts and salads are included. You are really tempted to over eat. The pricing is very low, lunch in the six dollar range, dinner at nine dollars. Decor is essentially generic oriental, and the place is always filled with asians, an excellent review in itself. Beverages are extra, but inexpensive. and refills are speedy 
My wife and I have eaten there four times at lunch, and havre yet to be diaappointed. I would give this place 2 thumbs up. Don't be put off by the exterior,the building once housed a "Hometown Buffet".
