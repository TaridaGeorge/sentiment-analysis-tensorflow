five five.... FIVE.

i love love this place, although admittedly it has some nostalgia to its credit, but thats not the reason you can find me eating there once a week. I've eaten at 4 different pizza factory's in my travels (2 in CA, 1 in WA) but this is by far my favorite! its a little on the smaller side but its worth it. My husband eats lots of other things there, sandwich's & pizza and likes it to. I bring everyone here, out of towner's & in towner's and they are always pleased. The owner and his family are on staff and they are always nice. Please stop by and let everyone know how tasty this place is and Be sure to try the garlic beadsticks... delicious. oh and did i mention i travel 15mins from goodyear for this place. i think its that worth it.
