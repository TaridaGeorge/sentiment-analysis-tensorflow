This is one of the best Asian restaurants in the valley. 

When you first visit you will notice that the decor and lighting is superb - suitable for a date night. The staff are gracious. Most importantly tho, the food here is fantastic. From the spring rolls and kung pao to the egg drop soup. Every meal I watched come out (to other tables) looked better and better. Now that I trust them I will return to sample some less clich√© dishes.

This also happens to be one of the least expensive lunch places in the area.
