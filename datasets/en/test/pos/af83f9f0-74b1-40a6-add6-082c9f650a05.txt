*********** THE VALLEY'S GREATEST  ************
             *********** 5 STARS *************

       Every purveyor of Hot dogs, Hamburgers and Italian Beef Sandwiches
       in the Valley, needs to MATCH THE CHC EXPERIENCE.

    CHC, is THE GREATEST PURVEYOR of the above sandwiches.....BAR NONE.

          For those of you who believe, you found NIRVANA ..... because you
          spent $10 to $15, for a burger elsewhere ....... You'll come to
          realize ........ THAT YOU'RE NOT THE BRIGHTEST BUN in the oven.

Put CHC, on your "To Die List" .....as for the other places ....a SH*T List, will do.

                                     I rarely give 4 or 5 star ratings
                       More Than One Star .....  HAS TO BE EARNED

The Food is Right On .... never a negative experience.
     The service is outstanding.
         The entire staff, has a great attitude.
               The only problem ......... their way to busy.
