I love pita jungle so much. I have been to pita jungle locations plenty of time before and am never disappointed. Whether its a salad, a pizza, or their awesome hummus! I like they decor of this location the best! Our waitress was awesome! She brought out bkalava for one of our guest because it was his birthday on her own.
