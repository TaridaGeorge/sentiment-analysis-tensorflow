The Herb Box will not disappoint you at all.  If it does then I really don't think you know how food should taste.  Seriously, the food here is something anyone should look forward to in there day. The ambiance is very nice and quaint which adds to a very intimate experience as well.

The wraps here are all works of creativity.  Using fresh and/or organic ingredients making a delightful meal.  There are many wraps to choose from and I think you can't go wrong with any of them.  As and added treat your order includes a side of sweet potato chips...and yes they are wonderful!

This place surely knows what they are doing and without a doubt has a bright future.  I'll be back many times and I'm sure it will be busy every time!
