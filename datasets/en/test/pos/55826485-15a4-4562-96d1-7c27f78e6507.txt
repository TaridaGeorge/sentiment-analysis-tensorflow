I got brunch here on a Sunday, and it was amazing in so many different ways. I loved the environment, which was kind of like a more unique down to earth version of Postino's/Livingroom. The food was delicious. We had the breakfast flatbread and breakfast burrito. Of the two, the burrito was the best! It's quite possibly the best breakfast burrito I've ever had. An added bonus was how the brunch menu was paired with a beer or mimosa, which reminded me of our European travels like how in Paris our lunch was paired with wine or beer. The best part is that they're dog-friendly complete with a water station!
