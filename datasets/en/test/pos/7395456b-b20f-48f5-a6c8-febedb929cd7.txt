In my never ending quest to find a good nail salon, I found the best hands down! They were so nice and took me in quickly. The owner was polite and convinced me to try gel nails and she explained it so well unlike all the others that never have. Hanna applied my gel nails and was so sweet, professional, and careful! They came out looking amazing! I will be going back from now on! They even took their time to know my name! Awesome!
