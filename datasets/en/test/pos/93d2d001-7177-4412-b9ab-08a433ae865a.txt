I've had two massages with Chad, and they have been excellent both times! Chad is not only extremely talented, but he is very friendly and professional. I have a terrible time with my back and Chad has been able to create lasting improvement following both massages. I love that he listens to what you need and whats causing the problem, and then addresses the issue, rather than giving a standard massage like you commonly get at the chain places. What's even better are the prices! There are frequently Groupon deals, but even the non-deal price is a steal for what you get.  I haven't had the pleasure of meeting Chad's wife and fellow masseuse, but from what I hear she is excellent as well. I will gladly be returning and referring friends to MyoSymmetrix!
