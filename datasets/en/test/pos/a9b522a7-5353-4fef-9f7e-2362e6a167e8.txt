I basing this rating only on the two types of spinach pizza they have because that is all we have ordered from them. Those pizzas are delicious and absolutely addictive. I usually don't like sweet pizza sauces but their sauce is awesome. I usually don't like spending that much money on pizza (a large spinach is $20) but it is so damn good that they have me wrapped around their finger. 

Service is good too. We have only ordered take out but they have always been friendly and accurate with their time. We have shown up early before and ordered a beer at the bar while we wait for our pizza. It seems that they have good beer specials most of the time. 

Delicious pizza and worth every penny!
