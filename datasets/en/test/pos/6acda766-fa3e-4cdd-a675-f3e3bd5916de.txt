Lisa is AMAZZINNNG!!! I always thought it was normal to have this pain and burning sensation in my shoulder. Last week, I made an appointement with Lisa, besides that she is super friendly, she is caring and knows what she is talking about.
She didn't just make my pain go away, she educated me on what was causing it and how to take care of it. 
Thank you Lisa for giving me back my sleep, I wake up with no pain and very energetic.
Making another appt, go see Lisa, she is the one you should see here in the valley:)
