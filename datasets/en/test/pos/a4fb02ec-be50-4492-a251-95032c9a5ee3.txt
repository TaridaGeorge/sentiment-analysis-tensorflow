Not a ton I can add that hasn't already been covered.  This place is suhweeeeeeet!  When you make reservations, which you should definitely do, make sure to request the patio.  It's spacious and although I get colder faster than any Phoenix native, I was fine even in early February weather.  The food was phenomenal - I had the Tilapia and my lovely companion had some sort of stuffed chicken deal that was too complicated for me to figure out. 

The drinks are strong for being in a restaurant - a huge plus for me.  The mojito is definitely worth a shot.  

Take great food, a great atmosphere, attentive wait staff, and throw in a guy playing acoustic covers of slower indie songs (think Decemberists) and you've got a winning combination!
