Dinner 7-20-11
THE GOOD:
The best pizza ever!  

THE BAD:
??25-30 min wait??  (not really bad)

THE LOWDOWN:
In recent years, I have had some pretty good pizza, but.....this sets a new standard.  I believe that the crust makes the pizza, well this is by far the best crust I have had.  Serious Pie has good crust, but this one is better - hands down.  The toppings come next and man they were fresh and delicious.  Everything was spot on.  A must when you are in the area.  They have an awesome old house right next door that you wait for your table at.   

Just go!
