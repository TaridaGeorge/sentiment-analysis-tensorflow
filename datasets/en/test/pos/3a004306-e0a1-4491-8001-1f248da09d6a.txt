Stopped off in the deli area for some "breakfast" and picked up vegan chicken salad, a corn salad, and a sweet corn tamale. 

WOW was the chicken salad amazing!!! vegan or not, this stuff tasted like the real deal. I am not vegan but I am always willing to try new things and boy am I glad I did. It is a bit pricy but well worth it because it does not have all the "bad" things like cholesterol in it. 

After having a bit to eat, you can walk around and do some shopping. I like the way this place is set up. It is good for morning brunch and then grabbing your weekly food.
