i agree with the other reviewers, this is a great place to hookup with friends or just hang out.  Nancy & Bryan make Wifi available so you could work from there while you quaffed your fav wines, which they have a bunch of.

The Happy Hour prices are insane for the product they serve.  No corkage charge either if you bought the bottle there and want to drink it now.

I'll be going back AND taking friends!
