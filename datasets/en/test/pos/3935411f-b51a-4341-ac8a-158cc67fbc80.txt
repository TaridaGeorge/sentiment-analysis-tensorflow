This review is for the CUBAN FOODS bakery/restaurant, not the Mexican one formerly at this location. Ana and Manuel, the owners, took the time to introduce themselves and make sure that each of the 10 members in our group got great suggestions and had a very fine and delicious Cuban lunch. Highly recommended (I'm a former reviewer from Chicago). Nice variety, informal but attentive service from staff, everything prepared very well. I wish I lived much closer.
