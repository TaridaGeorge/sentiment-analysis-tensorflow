Having grown up on muni golf courses, I constantly look for the best dollar value around. 

I am a very active member of the Dobson Ranch Golf Association, this course has become home for me. 

Dobson Ranch offers one of the best values in town. Not too mention a very well kept and quality municipal courses.  A challenging course that requires some accurate drives to avoid trees, some lenghty Par 3's when played at the tips, and some tough greens, you won't find a much better value.
