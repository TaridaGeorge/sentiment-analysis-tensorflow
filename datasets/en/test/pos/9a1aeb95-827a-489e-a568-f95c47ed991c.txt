This man can do amazing things with his hands if you know what I mean ;-) He was a fantastic entertainer and balloon maker at the Yelp Pleydate event at the Phoenix Children's museum last night. 

We laughed our rear ends off he was so amusing and he made some fantastic pieces. He's able to come up with great ideas for both children and adult themed items, He made everything anyone requested last night. He even fulfilled our request for the dirtiest balloon creature of the night. He did not disappoint!

Hire this man.
