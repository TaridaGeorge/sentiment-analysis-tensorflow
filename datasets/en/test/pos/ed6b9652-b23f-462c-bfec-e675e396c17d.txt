Great place for a delicious breakfast, lunch or dinner.  They are open until 8pm Mon-Sun.

The owner works the counter and is always friendly.  He seems truly appreciative to have me as a customer.  The bagels are fresh and you can have cream cheese or eggs/bacon/sausage ham on it.  They have white/wheat bread if you don't want a bagel sandwich.  They have Boar's Head meats and yummy egg/chicken/tuna salad.  They also have have pizza and wings, but I have not tried them yet.
