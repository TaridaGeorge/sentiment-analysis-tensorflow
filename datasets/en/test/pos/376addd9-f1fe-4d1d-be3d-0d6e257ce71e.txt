I went to Sakana for the first time this week and had a great experience!
Decided to sit at the sushi bar, and quickly ordered my 3 favorite sushi items. The rolls were HUGE! So delicious and everything was really fresh. Our waitress was nice... I told her I wanted a nice glass of white wine and, ironically, she ended up bringing me my favorite white wine of all time - Kim Crawford Sav. Blanc. Perfect! I love when restaurants have that on their menu. 
The sushi chefs were fun and entertaining, and even handed us some fun, new, off-menu stuff to try. 
The food and service was great. I'll be back again!
