Let me preface this by saying...I wasn't even that hungry! Discovered the most amazing restaurant today. Tucked away in a nondescript dusty corner of nowhere in Queen Creek, it is the best place I've eaten in the whole Phoenix Valley. If they had a central location, there'd be a 2 hour wait to get in. Prosciutto wrapped homemade warm mozzarella appetizer to die for. Cuban pork sandwich that makes you want to become cuban. Chicken sandwich that tasted so good, you don't want to swallow...just let the flavor mellow in your mouth. And to top it off, homemade ice cream for dessert...Honey Jack Daniels and Cinnamon Brown Sugar. If you live in Gilbert, Chandler, Queen Creek or even Tucson...GO EAT HERE!!! I want to go back when I'm really hungry with a large group of friends so we can try the whole menu. -- at The Deli Queen Creek.
