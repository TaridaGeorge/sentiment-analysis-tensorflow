This is one of the best Borders locations I've been to. It is located in Biltmore Fashion Park facing Camelback. The store is two stories and has a huge selection of books, magazines, DVD's, and other things. I have yet to find a Borders in NE Ohio that compares to this. Seattle's Best Coffee serves great latte's and snacks. It may be soulless, but it's a great store nonetheless. Overall, if you need a book or want to spend some time in a Phoenix area bookstore, head over to Biltmore Fashion Park and stop in at Borders.
