Although I'm currently sitting in the pedicure chair, I have been here a grip of times and absolutely love Smiley Nails!!! 

Super convenient (right by Bank of America, Sakana Sushi, AND my office), reasonable prices, great service, and SUPER friendly staff!!! 

8 pedicure chairs, 8 nail stations , and a waxing room. Relatively small but I have never had a wait.

You can consider me a regular!!!
