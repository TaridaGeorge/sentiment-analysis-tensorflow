I apologize to my fellow yelpers, but anyone who doesn't give this place 5 stars is out of their mind.  I am a Southern California native, I KNOW good sushi, and this is by far the best place in Tempe to go.  I am willing to say it's the best sushi I've had while living in Arizona.  These rolls are not like the skimpy ones you'll find at Ra and they're cheaper, especially during happy hour.  I will say that a lot of the rolls are spicy, and I love spicy, so that could be why I am obsessed with Sakebomber!  The staff is the best, too!!  If you have not tried this place, and you love sushi, you are definitely missing out!
