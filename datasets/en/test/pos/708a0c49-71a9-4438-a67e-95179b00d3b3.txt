Ummm....delicious, that's all i have to say about this place. small and quaint, had the owner as my server, who was very knowledgeable about the products being used. 

once again the food was exceptional, I had the seven course tasting menu and everything was light and very fresh. the highlights would consist of a red Alaskan snapper dish with quinoa and melon dish wish a wonderful rhubarb sauce, and a cheese course of purple haze and peaches that went perfectly together. 

The time in between dishes took a little longer then I would have liked but with all the attention to details it was worth the wait.
