This restaurant has the most creative AND DELICIOUS menu! There were seven of us and each of us loved what we ordered.  The warm pretzels and cheese fondue is to die for, as well as the Pork and Beans (don't let the name fool you - it ROCKS!)
We sat in Chips section and I was so impressed with his knowledge of the menu considering they had only been open a few days.  All his recommendations were right on the mark and his service was impecable! Thanks Chip for a wonderful dining experience!!
