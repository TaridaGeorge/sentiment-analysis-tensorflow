Glam Lounge easily compares to boutiques you would find in New York or San Francisco!  They stock all the brands you read about in magazines, but just can't find anywhere in the valley.

Needless to say, I literally want everything!  Every time I go in, their super easy-going, knowledgeable staff introduce me to something new.... like I just bought nail polish top coat that dries your wet nails almost instantly.... who knew a product like this even existed!  

Ahhh!!  I'm just so excited about a place like this because I really love finding out about up and coming brands and products, and the girls who work here actually know what they are talking about- there just isn't any other place like this!
