I gave it 5 stars because from start to finish it was an excellent experience. We ordered the lobster dip, SO GOOD and the egg rolls to start off with. Shared the lobster hamburger, to die for. Beers were delish, I believe I got the Blue Moon and some sort of pomegranate beer. YUM! For dessert we ordered the brownie and ice-cream YUM~ I will be back. Our waitress was AWESOME!
