i am writing this review almost exactly 1 year after maryam did my extensions and i wish i could leave her a 50 star review. my SAME HAIR that was initially "installed" is still shiny and beautiful. ONE YEAR LATER. these are not disposable hair extensions that other stylists do. nothing shoddy here at all. i am still incredibly happy with them and i cannot give a more glowing review. they are low maintenance, easy to deal with and LOOK AMAZING. my girlfriends who opt for ''cheaper' extensions and think that i overpay while they are stuck replacing all of their hair every three months are fools. this is about value and getting an amazing product with amazing results. i have saved money in the long run. i am thrilled. 

THANK YOU MARYAM!
