Went here for lunch for the first time today. When I saw the list of ice creams on the board I was tempted to just start with dessert the flavor combinations sounded very interesting. I had the cuban pork sandwich. The pork was very moist and tender. Everything was very fresh. The portions large. I was only able to eat half of the sandwich because I was saving room for dessert. I had the peanut butter and chocolate covered pretzel ice cream. It was wonderful. I wish I would have found this little gem earlier. I will be going back again very soon.
