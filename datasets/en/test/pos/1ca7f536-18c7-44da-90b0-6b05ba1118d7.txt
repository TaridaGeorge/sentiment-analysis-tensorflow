I'm sorry, but if you put "Red Drink" or "Purple Drink" as options on your menu, you pretty much can guarantee I will be a fan.  Luckily, the food didn't disappoint, or I would have been pretty sad.  

Chicken, waffles, and grits?  Yes, please.  I didn't even look up except to nod when she asked if I wanted a refill on my purple drink.  Lots of combinations on the menu to make anyone happy, good portion sizes, and fun waitstaff.  Wish I could go back tomorrow!
