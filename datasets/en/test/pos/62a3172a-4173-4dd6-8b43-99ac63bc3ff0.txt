Went to this wonderful place tonight and will definitely by coming back!!   My husband had the Jerk Chicken, Rice and Peas, and Plantains.  I had the Curry Chicken, Mixed Caribbean Vegetables, and Plantains.  We both enjoyed our meals and the unique caribbean flavor.  Tip:  If there are any meat patties left...be sure to get one.  We got the last one on the night we visited...boy was it good with just the right amount of heat.  

The restaurant is clean and service was great. As someone previously mentioned, the owners are very friendly and explained each entree and ingredients.  If you are looking for something a little different, then try this place. Definitely a 5 star place in our book!
