This is a great place to climb in Tempe!  There aren't as many kids here as there are at AZR, so it's easier to navigate.  Never done any trad here because the bouldering is just so good!  There are tons of bouldering routes for all skill levels, and I find them a bit more challenging than I'm used to (but thats probably due to the fact that the rating system is a little different than AZR), but its fun to push myself here with tougher routes.
