I've been back a couple times since and has had a great experience each time.
Rumor has it that Chef Cole left :-(
He is what really made my first visit so memorable!
Anyway, it is still great without him. Last time I was there for brunch, my friends and I split the brick oven backed cinnamon roll. It's only $5 and MASSIVE. Ssoooo good! Tons of gooey caramel, golden raisins, kinda doughy in the middle.
It's amazing.
I was only planning on having a single drink but that didn't happen. Our server talked me into something summery and refreshing. I had something with vodka and cucumber and bit of lime in it. Well, I had three of those. They were so good!
The Prickly Ricky is really good too!
This place is quickly becoming a staple.
