Top's really is what it says.  The beer selection really is unrivaled, period.  The staff is a little odd, but are very knowledgable and reliable.  The prices are hit or miss, but just ask them what the best deal is and they will tell you.  24 packs of microbrew for under $15?  All the time. They get new deals on Thursdays, but might not have them all out til Friday.  The middleaged man there during the day is the owner and a talker.  Ask him to recommend some wines and get a great deal and story.

Top's, you are responsible for making me a higher grain of alcoholic.  I love you.
