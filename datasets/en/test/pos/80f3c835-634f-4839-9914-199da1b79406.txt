ABSOLUTLEY THE BEST TIME I'VE HAD AT A RESTAURANT IN A LONG LONG TIME... With that out of the way, my future wife and I couldn't have enjoyed the food any more. Our server Brandon was very informative and patient, as we had never done fondue before. Make sure to try a dessert one too! Ours was phenomenal!!! 

Food: so delicious you melt into your booth... Service: outstanding and fun... Atmosphere: Romantic and luxurious... Overall experience: Wow, we have to digest this so we can come right back...
