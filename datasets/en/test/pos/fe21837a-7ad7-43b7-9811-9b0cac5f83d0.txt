The bagels are soft & chewy; the spreads are fantastic (I love the honey-whipped peanut butter); and the coffees are surprisingly excellent. I don't know what part of the food I love more.

The service couldn't be better; the owners & managers are personal and friendly, and the staff is well trained and attentive. My favorite place to eat for any meal.
