Four Peaks is an awesome place to go with friends for dinner and of course great beer!  They have an awesome selection of ales ~ IPA's that are brewed on site. The atmosphere and decor and decor are cool. 

I recommend setting on their patio ~ weather permitting and getting some apps and try the sample orders.  Then pick a beer you like best ~ I like the hop knot but then there;s the kilt lifter, and then order some great grub!  They have really good sandwiches and other good eats.
