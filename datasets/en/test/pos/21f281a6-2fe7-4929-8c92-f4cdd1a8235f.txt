What a terrific spot to enjoy lunch in the cozy dining area. The Greek salad with grilled chicken is excellent...fresh, light and filling. I would also recommend the roll up dinners for four. We get a variety of roll ups, chicken, steak and spinach. And their chocolate cake is amazing. This place always provides top notch service.
