I can't offer an opinion on a one time pest issue, because lets face it, living in Arizona you don't have just a one time pest issue.

I've been using AZEXT for 6 months.  I was in the market to switch pest companies because I was not happy with the level of service I was getting from HomeTeam (a whole other review that I need to write).

Ken is my tech.  I get the same tech every time.  He's prompt, never late, and does a great job.  

Their online website is great.  little rough looking but functional.

They are locally owned and not a franchise.  These guys rock.
