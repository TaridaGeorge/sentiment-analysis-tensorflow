Loved the mac and cheese, the cornbread, and the green beans. The pecan pie was TO DIE For.! I would love to buy a whole pie for Thanksgiving!!!! Try the pork belly and the fried mac and cheese or just go for a sangria and an appetizer!!! YUM! Don't forget the gourmet sides for the appetizers like tomato jam. James was kind enough to come out and explain some of the dishes and how they were prepared :)
