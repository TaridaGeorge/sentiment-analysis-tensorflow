I'm hesitant to say that this is the greatest Yelp find of 2011, only because I want to keep the goodies ALL TO MYSELF! But then I realize that maybe one day I can't get down there, and then they close, and then how would I live?! 

The people who operate the newly dubbed "La Promesa" bakery are AH-MAHZING, and the food is just as equally AH-MAHZING! I came too early to grab the fabled green burrito but I did snag a few green chile tamales (moist and packed full of shredded meat), assorted fruit pastries (flakey and DELISH), and some homemade tortillas. My only regret is that we had stopped here on the way to the State Fair and it made all of that would-be delightful fair food pale in comparison. That, and La Promesa is closed on Sundays... WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?!
