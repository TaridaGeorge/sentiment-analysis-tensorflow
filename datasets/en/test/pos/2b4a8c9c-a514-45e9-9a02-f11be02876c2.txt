This Flemings is one of the best I have enjoyed.  The manager and staff go out of their way to make your meal the most pleasurable experience possible.  You can not go wrong with this restaurant.  We recently celebrated a birthday there on a Saturday night and they made my family feel like they were the most special group in the restaurant.  OH - and the food was excellent.
