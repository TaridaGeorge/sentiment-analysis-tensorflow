What can I say, I love whole foods or whole paycheck as some call it.  You have to be a little particular because it is pricey.  The produce is phenominal, service always good, beats starbucks when it comes to a mocha or coffee, and they have so many cool things.  It seems that they are running sales more because of the economy, which is a good thing.  We go there 2 - 5 times per month for this or that, love it.  Also, the berry smoothie they make at the coffee stand is very good.
