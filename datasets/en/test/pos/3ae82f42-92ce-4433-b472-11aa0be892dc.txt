Wahoo! This place rocks. I had been meaning to stop by this place for some time and so I just did it today. I pulled in and there was no parking so I parked next to Jack in the Box. I ordered the Magic Burger combo and was not disappointed to say the least. The burger was one of the best Mushroom burgers I have ever had and even the fries, which are dusted with moon dust, were yummy. The best thing is that it all came with a drink for only $5. and I couldn't even eat all the fries. You will see me there again.
