Absolute great bagels, the kind you can really just eat without anything on.  Fantastic selection of stuff to put on the bagels including Boarshead meats and a variety of cream cheeses. 

We routinely get NY Bagels at work with many different types of cream cheese, and then I come here a lot for the Nova Lox bagel.  

Place is clean, selection of bagels is great, although I wish there was a wholegrain.
