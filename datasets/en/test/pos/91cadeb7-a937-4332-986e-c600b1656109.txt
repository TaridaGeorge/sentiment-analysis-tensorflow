I've been getting fatter at Redendos since Jr year in Highschool when their only location was in Fountain Hills AZ!   Still. The. Best. NY. Pizza. in. AZ.  Hands down.

I read a review on here that said the pizza was sub par.  It went on to say that the feta cheese, jalapenos and some other silly ingredients didn't taste good.

No kidding.  Pizza has crust, sauce and cheese - dummy.  If you're looking for GREAT NY pizza in AZ skip the Pizza Biancos of the world with their 4 hours waits.  Stop ordering Papa John's with their $25 heated up garbage.  Load up the prius and head to North Scottsdale for the most economical, best tasting pizza in the 10 - 30 price range.

Keep it up guys, 15 years strong and still killing it! m I'm headed there now.
