A refreshing old-school record store that reminds us, in the days of iTunes and mp3's,  that music is first and foremost about friends and community.  Sure it is a tad cramped, but that is because it is chock-full of indie music goodness (along with a selection of some high quality mainstream tracks). 

 However, in my opinion, more important that event the cd's and vinyl for sale, are the knowledgeable staff and patrons, who are sure to steer you to what you are looking for (even if you didn't know it when you walked in).  

It is also a great space to find out about, and buy tickets for local live music.  They also have a wide selection of cool magazines (not just music oriented),  t-shirts and posters.
