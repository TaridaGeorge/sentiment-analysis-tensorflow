Froyo is froyo is froyo, right?  Not at this place!!!

Someone lovingly crafted the perfect midcentury modern cafe/coffee shop for this Central Phoenix neighborhood (think Lux, Pane Bianco, Postino, Windsor), and then decided to go avant garde and offer Frozen Yogurt instead of that cafe fare/coffee and pastries that you would expect for such a beautifully crafted space.  I actually wanted to hang out here.  I don't think I've ever said that about a froyo shop.

The frozen yogurt itself was what you'd expect from any pay-by-the-ounce froyo shop, but Twirl gets some extra points for inventiveness in toppings - in addition to the standards, Twirl offers gourmet toppings like pumpkin pie spice, raspberry sauce, glazed pecans, and huge chunks of candy.  Perfect perfect perfect.
