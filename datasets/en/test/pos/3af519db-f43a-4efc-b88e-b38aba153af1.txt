Absolutely loved everything here! It's nice to have a vegan restaurant in Glendale. Started with the Golden Rolls. Delicious veggie "egg"rolls that were not greasy. A complimentary cup of soup with clear broth and carrots followed. I had the Spicy Cha Cha faux breaded shrimp based on others' reviews. Completely delicious and highly recommended! My date ordered the Sweet & Sour Divine (faux chicken). We were not charged at all for our rice as mentioned by other Yelpers. Perhaps they caught wind that people disliked their rice charging policy because the woman taking our order made it known that they will be charging for rice in the future, but not that day. We finished with the carrot cake which was delicious! They have a freezer and cooler filled with retail items including the faux shrimp. Vegans, omnis, and flexitarians alike will like Loving Hut!
