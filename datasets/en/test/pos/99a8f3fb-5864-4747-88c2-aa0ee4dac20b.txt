Fabulous! Great views (obviously) of the city. Very romantic. Amazing wine list. Superb service. Delicious menu. 

Luis was our server - great guy full of very helpful information (especially wine pairings). LOVE the lobster bisque (I'm usually not a fan of lobster or bisque). Amazing flavor combinations in everything we tried. I also love ending my meal with a perfect vanilla bean creme brulee. 

Highly recommend if you're bringing a newbie to Phoenix or if you'd like a romantic night out.
