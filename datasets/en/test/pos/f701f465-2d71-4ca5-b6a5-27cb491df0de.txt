Pros: walking distance from the crib. One of the few places you can get Rogue's Hazelnut Brown Nectar. And in 24 oz big-boy bottles, too. w00t! Unparalleled beer selection. Barstaff that is just this side of surly. Local art that is (usually) pretty good.

Cons: Umm, not open for breakfast? Can't really think of any.

Now go drink some beer.
