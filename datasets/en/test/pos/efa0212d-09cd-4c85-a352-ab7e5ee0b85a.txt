This place is bad ass! I'm COMPLETELY addicted.  The carne asada tacos are one of the best I've found. Made to order and FRESH!  They're generous with the cilantro and onions which makes such a big difference.  I always get a side of deeelicious rice as well.  The AZ burrito is OMG SO GOOD!  I don't like potatoes so I substituted for rice and then it is seriously the best burrito in town!
