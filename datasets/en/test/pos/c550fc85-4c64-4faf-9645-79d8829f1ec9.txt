I have been going to Va Bene for about five years now and still love it. 
It is one of the few classy places to go dancing to live music on Friday and Saturday nights. 
The manager and staff understand customer service perfectly. 
The seasoned butter and bread they bring to your table is fresh and savory. The pastas are always delicious. We have never a special that we didn't like- but the ravioli special is always our favorite. 
I must say they have the BEST escargot I have ever had. It is in a delightful pastry and goes so well with a red Tuscan wine. 
If you have any questions about wine, all of the servers are excellent at recommendations. 
The only complaint is that the smokers need to move away from the door. 
First rate!
