Love this place. They have an awesome martini with St. Germain and Gin - love it! I also love the flatbread pizza and the wine list. The bar is large and friendly and you can always feel the warm breeze from the door - I love places that leave the doors open! 
I loved this place years ago when I used to vacation here, now I live here and can go whenever I want! YAY!
