We've purchased take and bake pizza from here twice. Both times we got a Lighter Garden Vegetable and another large (cheese & black olive, for the kid). I have to say the Lighter Garden Vegetable pizza is delicious!  It's on a nice thin crust, creamy sauce, sun dried tomatoes, spinach, artichokes, etc! It is so good. The other pizza we got was also thin crust, delicious as well. 

The crust reminds me of Zpizza, which I love, but the one at Metrocenter closed. I love having pizza without all the grease! 

To those that balk at the price - look for a special. I've used Groupon Now twice. Great deal.

Friendly staff, prompt service. I really like Pizza Fresh.
