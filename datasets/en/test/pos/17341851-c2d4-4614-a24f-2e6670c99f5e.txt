I LOVE LUX! I spend every weekend drinking the weirdest, but most amazing, drink combination in the world--a caffe latte and a bloody mary. Jake makes THE BEST bloody marys I've ever had. Exceptional service, food/drink/coffee quality, price and atmosphere. I couldn't ask for more from the coffee shop down the street from my apt. It's my home away from home--I don't know where I would spend my weekend mornings (which always end up turning into the evening!) w/o lux!

And I used to HATE bloody marys!!!!! Bacon as a garnish?? Pure genius. You get nothing but the best from Lux EVERY time. Everyone I take there is blown away. It's just a pure gem.
