I always get the apple fritter and a maple bar or three glazed old fashion's.  I drive all the way from 7th St. & Bell for these tasty delights.  I stopped once after picking up my sister at Sky Harbor and it is now a required stop every time she comes to PHX.  Bottom line, these are the best donuts you'll ever eat.
