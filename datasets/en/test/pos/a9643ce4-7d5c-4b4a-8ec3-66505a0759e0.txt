One of my biggest disappointments in having to abandon gluten has been missing out on the unbelievable sandwiches from Sacks. Grilled chicken, freshly sliced ham, chunks of turkey... whatever you want, they've got it! 9-grain wheat, rye, sourdough or spinach wrap, the options are literally endless. And if you're smart, you'll trust them and order the daily special - it's different each day, and always more amazing than the last (if you can believe it?!?)! 

For the salad-eaters, hands down... the best tuna salad in the valley! And trust me, get the honey-poppy seed dressing. You won't regret it!
