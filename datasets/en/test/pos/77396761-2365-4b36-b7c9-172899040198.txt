I love Kashman's!  I've only been for breakfast, so I can only attest to the deliciousness of their eggs and potatoes.  They really make magic with their eggs here.  Way better than lots of other breakfast places can make 'em.  

You also get a choice of bread with your breakfast, and I always get a bagel.  YUM. Oh and you can exchange your potatoes for fruit if you want to.  

The staff is a little brash though.  They're a dash sarcastic and not all that pleasant, really.  But it doesn't bother me.  I just get my plate of tasty food, pay just a little (Kashman's is pretty cheap) and grab a table. 

You can also sit outside, but you'll be surrounded by dogs because Kashman's is definitely four-legged-friend-friendly.
