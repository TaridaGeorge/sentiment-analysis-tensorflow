One of the best things about moving to Tempe from Chandler was being closer to The Chuck Box. My older cousin and uncle took me there as a treat when I was a child. As a grown-up, I was there almost weekly.

Few things make me happier than scarfing down a perfect burger with a cold Coke, snacking on some fries, sitting on a wooden box and swatting at the occasional fly.

I miss you Chuck Box, and I want a framed portrait of Big Juan for my living room.
