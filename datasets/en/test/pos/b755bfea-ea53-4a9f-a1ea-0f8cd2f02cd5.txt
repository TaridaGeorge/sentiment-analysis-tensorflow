I fought my love for the G-Spot but I give in!! I decided to spoil my family in East Mesa and brought home the largest container and loaded it up with my fav flavor rocher! Tastes exactly like ferrero rocher chocolate! Mmm hazelnut goodness! They need one closer to home!! But for now I def don't mind it being down the road from work!
