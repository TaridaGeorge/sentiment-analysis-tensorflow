Drinks are reasonably priced, had an amazing time there with my friends.  Now here is the thing, i have a few friends that went before and had some what a bad experience, but they are more use to the scottsdale scene, so i guess that was the issue there.  

Personally, i love the crowd there and its a great place to get shitty!
