I love Solo! I don't get there frequently enough but it is one of my favorite places to hang out with friends or catch up on emails (free wifi). The art and books are fun, especially if you can snag a seat at the couch or lounge chairs. The people who work there are super friendly and they will remember you after you've been there a few times (always a great feeling). I have to confess, in general I love coffee shops for the atmosphere and not for the drinks, but Solo has great tea options and I am always pleased.
