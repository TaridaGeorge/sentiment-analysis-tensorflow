Francisco Grande is wonderful! 
Just sitting in the restaurant/bar is relaxing! The views are amazing! The staff is always very attentive and friendly! 
When we moved here our house was not finished, so we lived at the FG for over 3 weeks! 
The entire staff made our long stay seem like a wonderful vacation! 
After all of the time we spent there it is still our very favorite place!!!! 

You can have anything from sliders to a filet mignon in the bar area! One of the few places you can order a steak pittsburg and they know exactly what you are talking about and it will come out incredible! 
If you are ever in Casa Grande, I suggest that  you add the Francisco Grande to your must list!
