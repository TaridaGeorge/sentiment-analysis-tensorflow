This was my second time coming to Le Le's and I'll certainly be back for more. My nail technician, Tina, was wonderful too. Maybe it was because the place wasn't too busy but she took a lot of time on my nails, really making sure each one was finished to perfection.  It is usually pretty quiet inside, which I happen to love.  I prefer sitting and reading a magazine/relaxing rather than the common nail salon gossip/chatting.  

I got a pedicure and acrylics with gel for only $48. Legit quality with a low price tag.
