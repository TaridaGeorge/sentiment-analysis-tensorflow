Have been to get a massage from Danelle 3 times now, and her massage seems to get better and better with everytime! In the past, massage therapists seem to get lazy or not try so hard to do a good job once you come back, but not Danelle! Every massage has been wonderful. My neck is doing great now and am just going in for continued health, and because I love her massages so much! Thank you Danelle for helpping me feel so good! Also, just added hot stones to my last massage! To die for!
