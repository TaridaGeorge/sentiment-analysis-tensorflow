Walking by this place, I always thought it was closed, but apparently its not!
I had a craving sushi so my date took me here. What a shocker! The sushi was really yummy and the service was pretty good. This restaurant has a sushi bar, tables, teppanyaki tables, and a bar. I enjoyed the atmosphere, it was pretty low key compared to other sushi joints in Old Town, which is nice change. I will be coming back!
