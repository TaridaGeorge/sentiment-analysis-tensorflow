I love this place! The coffee is excellent. The baristas actually clean the shot glasses between each espresso shot which is totally unusual and appreciated. Trust me other places (*cough* Lola on central *cough*) use the same dirty shot glass over and over and don't bother cleaning it which makes my coffee tastes like an ash tray. Jobot also serves crepes and tacos. They were okay at first and a bit pricey for what you got but, they have been improving them and now they are delicious. Really delicious. I love Jobot coffee. I go there several times a week and it is consistently the best coffee in town and their food is great too.
