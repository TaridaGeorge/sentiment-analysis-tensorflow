Awesome,clean, and modern. Fish tacos and cheese crisp were delicious and fresh. Margarita was legit. They make the mix in house, fresh and prepared well. The service at the bar was excellent (Twilight was my bartender) despite how incredibly busy they were ( packed house). The one thing they need is better music.  Sounds like background music at the underwear section of Macy's. Please change your music.
