Dr. Oyan is the best vet for cats.  My 20-year-old tom cat only spent a short time under the care of Dr. Oyan and Megon because he was already in an advanced stage of CRF.  I wish I had found Dreamy Draw Cat Hospital sooner, he may have lived a good bit longer.   It was a long drive, but well worth it.  I highly recommend this vet, but stay far, far away from Elliot Park Animal Hospital in Tempe.
