I'm SO glad they opened up a BevMo that's somewhat near me. This place is great. They have a diverse wine selection. 
My husband and I are going to Argentina in a few weeks, and I wanted to find some wines from vineyards we'll be visiting -- it was easy here. There were a lot of different choices, and  I ended up buying a great bottle of Tapiz malbec for $17. It was wonderful.
- It's not worth deducting any starts, but the only teeny-tiny complaint I have about this place is its closeness to ASU and, therefore, the likelihood that you'll wander past a few Typical Frat Guys who are discussing what "great chard" will impress this "chick" they want to "get on."
Umm.... none?
Ick.
