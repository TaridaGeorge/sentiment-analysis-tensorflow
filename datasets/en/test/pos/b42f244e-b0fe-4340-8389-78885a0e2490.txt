Best. Wings. Ever. If you haven't ever tried their Terikayi wings they are to die for, they are the perfect mix of sweet and salty and crispy and amazing. I always get a side of buffalo chips with Ranch and the combo is perfect. Wash them down with some iced tea and you're golden! I also really enjoy their garlic parmesean wings, which seem to be made with real garlic (they have that tiny bit of spicy that hits your tongue) and parmesean. All around great place!
