I LOVE this place. The service is always excellent, the place is eternally clean, and you go home knowing that your arteries aren't turning to steel. And I love that they are usually playing classical music in the background. Plus, you get free refills, free soft serve/yogurt, free soup...love it. 

The trick in getting the most for your money is to pile the meat/veggies a couple of inches ABOVE your bowl, because it really cooks down once the guy throws it on the big griller for you.
