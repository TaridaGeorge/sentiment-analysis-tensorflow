So I have been hearing all about Sushi Roku for months. Everyone was saying how amazing the food was and how they loved the décor but they also said it was pretty pricey. So I thought I would check it out myself. What I didn't know until I got there was they have a few different menus. We ended up sitting in the Lounge and everything on the menu was $5. We had the popcorn shrimp tempura, edamame hummus (it was incredible), tuna tataki, spicy tuna roll, and several drinks. It was totally affordable!

They also told us about this Stimulus Menu. It's like $30 a person and you get your choice of appetizer, entrée and dessert. Which I think is a great deal. You would spend wayyyy more than that on a regular dinner. So next time we go I'm trying that for sure!
