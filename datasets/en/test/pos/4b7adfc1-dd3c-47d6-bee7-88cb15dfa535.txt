We tried this place today because of all of the great reviews it has received here. We were not disappointed. The jerk chicken was mouth watering and the patty was excellent. The service was great and they are extremely nice and friendly. They even gave all three of us a sample of their homemade carrot cake, trust me, you have to try it! We will definitely be going back!
