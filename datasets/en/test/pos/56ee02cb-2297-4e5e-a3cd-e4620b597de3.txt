I tell all my friends about The Source, particularly Dr. David Arneson.

Professional, approachable, affordable.
Easy to get in with the doc.
Saturday hours.
Nature first, Rx if necessary. 

Dr. Arneson is highly regarded in his field. This I did not know when I was looking for a doctor to see on a Saturday morning. I just needed some antibiotics and it didn't occur to me to go to urgent care. 

Dr. Arneson is the most caring doctor I have ever been to. And he is also no nonsense, which I love. 

The Source is a training clinic, and the days when student interns are there, you don't get charged an office visit fee. 

I have been a patient of Dr. Arneson's for 2 1/2 yrs.
