Unique little store specializing in fresh dairy goods from local AZ dairies. I first heard about this store from a guy at the Roadrunner park Saturday Market giving away free sample of cheese curds.  I was in Tempe today, so I decided to stop by and grab some cheese curds.  They are great!  And, a coworker from WI gives them a thumbs up approval!  

Cool place to check out.  It can be a bit hard to find, it is on the SW corner of Hardy and Broadway. You drive through a gate to the parking lot, then you'll see the store on the left. Also, CASH ONLY
