Best experience I have had. I've spent soc years looking for a barber that not only provided the level of service i needed, but one that had the "barber shop" feel to it. Every time I would find one, the barber would transfer elsewhere, but then I found this one. Walking in after work, Boris took me in and gave me a cut. I wasn't expecting the hot towel, straight edge, or even to like my cut (been so desensitized by Supercuts), but it's safe to say that I'll call this "home" and come for as long as they have an "open" sign.
