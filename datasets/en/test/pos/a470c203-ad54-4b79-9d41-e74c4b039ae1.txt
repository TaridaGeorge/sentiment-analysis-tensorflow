Oh, yes. I've finally found good gelato. 

We happened to be passing by the place at dinnertime, so there was no line. We were just going to sample a few flavors and come back another time, but when I tasted the peanut butter gelato, I knew I had to have me some. And talk about dinner - a medium-size cup could feed a small family. Suffice it to say, we had gelato for supper. And we enjoyed every mouthful.
