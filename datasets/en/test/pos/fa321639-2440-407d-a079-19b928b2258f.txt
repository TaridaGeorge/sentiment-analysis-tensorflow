In town for a conference and decided to take the resort's "Adventure Desk" up on a baja off-road excursion in the desert.  Awesome time but ended up nearly ruining my fave jeans, soccer jersey and North Face jacket; COVERED in dust...black jacket was nearly white with dust.  So, I googled laundromat in Scottsdale and saw that Ginny's had a good rating.  I didn't have time to wash the clothes on my own and wanted to ensure I found a competent cleaners that wouldn't shrink the jeans or jacket.  Just returned to the hotel with my clothes and Ginny's did an awesome job; clothes are very clean and soft, and it's obvious they were handled with care.  Very affordable as well...staff was super friendly and helpful... Strongly recommend...
