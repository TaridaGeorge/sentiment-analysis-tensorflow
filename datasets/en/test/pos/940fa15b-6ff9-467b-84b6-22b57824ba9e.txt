Hey this place is pretty cool.   They have done such a decent job, the buildings are amazing the mine is fun (not real) the bordello is - oh wait I never went in there!  The shootouts at Noon and hourly therafter are so worth it, there is no admission and the mine is like $6 and the Boredello $3?  See a bunch of reptiles (rattlers, gila monsters, tarantulas for $2)  It nickles and dimes you a little but hey whats a couple bucks - and where can you visit a brothel for $3 ??    Remember you can't put a price ona good time.
