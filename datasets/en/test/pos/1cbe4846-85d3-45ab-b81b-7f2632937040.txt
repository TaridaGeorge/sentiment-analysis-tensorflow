This place has cool seeping from its walls. Upon walking in I felt a little disoriented, my guess is by how cool this place was. 

Chars doesnt have to try to be cool, it just is. From the dimly lit dance floor and bar area. The christmas lights hung in a tasteful manner. Although, like every establishment in the valley, you cant smoke inside you can still see a smokey haze hang over the stage and dance floor. 

The band, Soul Power, HOLY FUNK!!!! YESS!!!! 

This place gets 5 stars... it is that awesome. My words dont do it justice. Just go...
