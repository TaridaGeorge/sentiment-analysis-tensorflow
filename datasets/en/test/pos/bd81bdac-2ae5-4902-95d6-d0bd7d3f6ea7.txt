Love the concept, the ethics, the philosophy, the decor...was hoping I'd love the food and service, too.  And luckily, I did!

Awesome, attentive service (Elyse), and simply phenomenal food.  We shared a crudite, edamamme dumplings (outrageous), and the delicious kale salad, and then I had the panang chicken curry over brown rice, which was rich, flavorful, and spicy.  My boyfriend said the cod was incredible, and he's picky about fish.  Dessert was the strawberry-rhubarb crisp (also outrageous), and a super light and refreshing lemon sorbet.  My one gripe was the coffee was lukewarm.  Other than that, the meal was perfection.

I am 7 months pregnant, so I was pleased to see that they offer several non-alcoholic drink concoctions.  I tried two, a cucumber refresher and a ginger-agave soda.  Both fantastic.  

Prices are reasonable.  I NEED one of these in Milwaukee!!
