This place is SO good and I am SO FULL! 

I visited this restaurant tonight and was very pleased overall.  They have good happy hour deals, great food, and AWESOME staff/service!  Everyone from my mother to my younger brother were happy with their plates and the staff is some of the friendliest I have ever met.  I will definitely be back soon.  :)
