I just ate here for the first time and I am now hooked. This was honestly the best meal I've had out in long time. I had the roasted chicken, which was absolutely delicious, and my husband had the hanger steak, which he loved as well. We also split the romaine heart salad and the cheesecake in a jar - yum! The ingredients were fresh and put together to create tasty, comforting food. Both the portions and the prices were perfect - you will leave feeling content, not overly stuffed. The atmosphere is great and the servers are really friendly. I will definitely be back, hopefully sooner than later....
