The Wilkins Family is hands down the best, most loving environment possible! My son went there for Preschool last year, my daughter is currently in the Preschool program-  and now that they offer Pre-K and Kindergarten, my daughter will continue there!
The teachers are the most hands on- loving I have ever seen in a school. Every day when they walk in the door- the teachers run up to them and hug them and pick them up and tell them how much they love them. And it is GENUINE! 
I wish she could stay through hughschool! :)
