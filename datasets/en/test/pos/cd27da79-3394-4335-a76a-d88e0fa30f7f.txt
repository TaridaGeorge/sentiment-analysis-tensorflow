Happy hour, fresh squeezed lemonade martini's yes! I love it here they have 2 happy hours one at the usual time and one from 9pm-11pm who doesn't love that. The regular menu is great too but come on a  jumbo awesome gourmet Angus cheeseburger and fries for $2.95 with a 2 drink ($3.50) minimum. If loving this is wrong I don't want to be right.
