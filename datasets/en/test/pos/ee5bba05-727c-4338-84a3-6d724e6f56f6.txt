We moved to Phoenix from Nashville a few years ago. There are lots of things we don't miss about Nashville, but we really miss the music scene (and no it's not all top 40 country music). Stinkweeds fills a little hole that was in my life after leaving Nashville. Cool, independent music selections in a surprisingly small shop.
