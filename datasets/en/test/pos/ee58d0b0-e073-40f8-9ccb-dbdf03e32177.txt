Ok, so I have stopped in twice now, and both times were quite nice.  The first time I just had a scoop of their Madagasgar vanilla ice cream with some salted caramel on top.  It was  good, but the caramel was SUPER salty...a bit too much.  The second time, I had a scoop of vanilla (I know, so adventurous) with their fudge. Good God was is nom-worthy.  I even went back to ask for more fudge, prepared to pay for my extra topping and the chick behind the counter said it was on the house.  Thought that was pretty cool. Love this place and their staff...will be here again in the near future...and maybe next time I'll try something in a pretzel cone!
