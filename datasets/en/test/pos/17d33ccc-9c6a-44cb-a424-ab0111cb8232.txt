Things I love about this place

- very clean and cute! 
- they have everything you need - mats, towels, toiletries, locks, drinks
- the atmosphere
- they have a lot of classes throughout the week at all times
- they have excellent instructors working here
- plenty of parking

I do wish it was a little bit more affordable, but you definitely pay for what you get here. This is the best yoga studio I have ever seen.
