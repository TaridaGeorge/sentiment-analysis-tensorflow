Loved this place. Super chic and quaint. Yes, there are many college kids and lawyers there, but, I kind of liked it.  It reminds me of a cafe one might find in San Fransico or Brooklyn. The place is huge, so, it isn't that hard to find seating, you just might have to spend a little effort looking (there are nooks and crannies everywhere). The coffee was excellent, loved my latte. It's so awesome they have such an assortment of home made pastries; there is something for everyone's tastes, I'm sure. I only wish I lived closer.
