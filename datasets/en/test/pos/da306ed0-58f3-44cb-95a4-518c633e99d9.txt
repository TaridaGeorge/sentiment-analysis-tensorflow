Of all the Bebe store's in the Valley, this is the one that I have found to have the best customer service.  True, they don't have a huge sale inventory (for that go to the one at Biltmore), however they will go above and beyond in the areas of phone "orders" and have no problem looking for certain items that you may have found on bebe.com, but wish to purchase locally.  I had my husband pick up a dress for me and they knew I was going to be wearing it that evening, (like as soon as he walked in the door we were going right back out for this party), and they PRESSED it for me free of charge!  My husband didn't even ask, they just did it.  Above and beyond, that's what I'm talkin' about...
