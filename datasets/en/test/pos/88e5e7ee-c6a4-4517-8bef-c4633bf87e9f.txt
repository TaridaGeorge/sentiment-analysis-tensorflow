My husband & daughters threw a birthday party for me in their private room. It held 30 plus people very comfortably with room to mingle. 
The place is gorgeous & glammy. The food outstanding. The service unbelievable. 
I had an evening I will never forget because of my family and friends. Modern Steak was the icing on the cake.
P.S. Visiting the Restroom is part of the fabulous experience!
