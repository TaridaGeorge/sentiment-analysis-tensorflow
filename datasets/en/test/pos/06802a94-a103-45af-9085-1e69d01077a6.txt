Great place to socialize, eat good food, and drink tasty beer! I would definitely reccommend this to people. I had a very creative burger called the popper burger which was really good. The person I was with also got a burger and said it was really good. We tried a few of the beers and were very impressed with them! I came on a Monday or Sunday night and it was busy. This is kind of a loud, social place, so I wouldnt reccommend going here if you're looking for a quiet, classy dinner...it is a brewing company!
