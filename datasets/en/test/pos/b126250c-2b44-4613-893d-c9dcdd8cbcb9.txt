Holy Cow.  I am impressed.  Yes, I know its "just a Dennys."  Go ahead, make fun. But, I actually loved the staff here.  I went to this Dennys location for the first today, and had the warmest, friendliest experience.  I was greeted, seated, and ordered within minutes!  I sat at the bar, which I didnt mind doing at all.

My server was so attentive.  The staff here is good looking too.  the guys that work here make eating here half the fun.  Cute, cute cute!   For a good Dennys experience, this location is a must do.  Did I mention this place is open 24 hours??  BONUS!!!  Plus, its right near the expressway!  Its kind of hidden a little by some hotels, but you can still easily see it from the road!
