I wish there were a branch of this fabulous chain in Cleveland!  Seek them out wherever you are!  The under 475 calorie deal on everything brings you in and the food keeps you coming back!  Salads - entrees - the four-bite desserts - sigh wonderful.  We sat on the patio and it was like a little vacation in itself.
