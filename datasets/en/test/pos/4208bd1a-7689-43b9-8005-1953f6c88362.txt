The best cheese steaks I have ever had and in Arizona no less.  The employees are always super friendly and cheerful. Which is impressive for how busy they are always ( a sure sign they are awesome ).  They have everything from authentic cheese steaks ( yes with cheese whiz)  to customized ones of your choosing.  If you don't like cheese whiz ( for shame ) just order it with "real" cheese.  I have had the chicken and steak sandwiches and they are both fantastic.  When you go try the Pizza Steak with mozzarella,mushrooms and pepperonis (it's heaven on a bun) with a side of sweet potato fries you won't regret it.
