Cute sandals go great with a fresh pedicure. This is one of the shoe places I frequent and sometimes  just to go look at the newest styles.  Quality shoes and great prices.  Go if you have not been.  I would recommend you sign up for the rewards program, and you will receive Reward certificates for every 1,500 points earned, which equaled for me to a $10 dollars certificate towards my next purchase.
