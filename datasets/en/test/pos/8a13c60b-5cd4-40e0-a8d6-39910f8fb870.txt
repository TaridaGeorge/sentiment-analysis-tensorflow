St. Francis, I LOVE you for so many reasons! I love your happy hour, I love your food! It is truly amazing!! The flat breads are phenomenal-especially the chorizo flat bread. The risotto is to die for! The burger is A-mazing, the pot roast is savory and has multiple layers of flavor. The hanger steak is delicious, the white fish is oh so yummy! We have tried almost everything on their menu. We have not had anything we didn't like. If you haven't tried St. Francis, you are missing out!!
