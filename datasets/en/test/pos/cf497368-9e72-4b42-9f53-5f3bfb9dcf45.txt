Hands down -My fave Irish pub .

Great Bartenders that will offer you cheeky Irish banter AND are on top of your glass /pint or bottle of beer .

Spot on Irish Fare ,extra seating can be found up in the loft area .small covered patio,that can seat about 40. Dark wood 4 sided bar cute little Irish Knick-Knacks scattered through out . 

And some of the best damn live entertainment in the valley plays here ....from one man acoustic to 8 piece band ..all who play in this house ,truly rock !

Never had a bad time here ! Love it !
