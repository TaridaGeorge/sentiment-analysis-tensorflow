Green is the new black, just don't tell my husband! Actually, he might agree with me. Finally got the meat eater to come to Green for the first time and he was in heaven! It was my third time there and this time I got the Spicy Thai dish and my husband got the Kung Pao. Both meals were delicious, filling and satisfying.  We may actually head back there for dinner tonight!
