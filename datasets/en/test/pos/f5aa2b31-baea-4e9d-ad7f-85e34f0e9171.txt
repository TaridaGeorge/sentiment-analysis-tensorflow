This is one of the most AMAZING seafood restaurants I've ever been to and I've been to a lot!  I am a seafood lover and was very pleasantly surprised at Wildfish.  I had the Chilean sea bass in a delicate garlic lemon butter sauce.  SOOOOO good-the best I've ever had by far.  The fish was cooked perfectly and the flavor of the sauce complimented it perfectly.  I also tried the scallops which were also seared perfectly.  The server was very knowledgeable and attentive.  The atmosphere is great.  I will definetly be returning.  There is so much more I want to try!
