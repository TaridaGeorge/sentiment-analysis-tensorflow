L correctly pointed out that I did not list this restaurant under my reviews. I just started working on all the restaurants, we have been to in the last three years. My guess is over 150. So, I am going to see how high I get.

This is a very classy operation,  because it was L's birthday may be, yikes. I remember them doing something special for us, or was it my birthday? It was someone's birthday and they did something special. 

I remember the after part that they call the next day to ask how your meal was. I think that is very classy and have never had a restaurant do that before. The chefs sister is in charge of that. So, that was what is memorable to me.
