We love the Esplande 14. In fact, we call it "our" theater and have a hard time going anywhere else. Its clean, great staff complete with tasty movie theater treats. And, its a great theater if you're looking to make a good old fashioned date night this is the place for you... great restaurant and bar options within walking distance to the theater. We often get Stingray for happy hour at the Biltmore and then walk over to the theater.
