Money doesn't grow on trees, but Dollar tree grows on saving.

Although one may be embarrassed to go into a discount store, you'll miss out on some very cool items or only a dollar.  Things that you would normally buy at Walmart or Target, you can get it here for a fraction of the price.  In this economy, quality dollar items are hard to find, but at least here you'll find something that may surprise you and stretch out your budget.  

Staff are friendly and place is clean. Also the company seems to do a lot of community projects as well which is pleasantly surprising for a discount store.
