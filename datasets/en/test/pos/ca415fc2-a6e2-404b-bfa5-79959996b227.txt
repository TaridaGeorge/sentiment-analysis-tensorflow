Fresh Start Women's Foundation has opened a resale boutique at the SW corner of 40th St. and Thomas in Phoenix called "Fresh Start Treasures".  The resale shop is an extension of Fresh Start's expertise over the past 20 years in self-esteem and wardrobing.  They have clothing, accessories, and home furnishings. 

Fresh Start Treasures caters to working women, fashionistas and more. They have an extensive collection of fine designer labels from Ann Taylor, Jessica Simpson, Coach, St. John, Elie Tahari to The Limited. They have a great staff that will help you find the perfect business wardrobe, evening or casual outfit. 

I am a recent volunteer at the boutique and I absolutely love it!  The selection of clothing is great as well as the prices.  In addition the work the foundation does is priceless.  Stop in sometime to find the treasure waiting just for you.
