We just had chicken PHO and Tofu spring rolls to try out the place.  The Pho broth was delicious, generous amounts of chicken and the usual veggies--nice and fresh. The tofu rolls with peanut sauce fresh and delicious.  We liked it so much we order additional food to take home. We ordered Lemongrass chicken. Nice taste and spiced just as I like it.   The waiter was polite and attentive.  Water glasses filled promptly.  We were looking for a pho restaurant but didn't want to go to the one we went to before which ironically was this one under another name (Tu Do).  This place will make it if all you Yelpers take heed and patronize them so they can stay in business and we will all enjoy a great vietnamese restaurant.  Has anyone had the pork sandwich here yet?  I'd like some feedback on it.  Enjoy!
