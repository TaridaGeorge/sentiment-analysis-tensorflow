Wednesday: walk into the kitchen and flip on the lights... and nothing.  I check a few things, flip the breakers, even pulled off the plates on the switch and a dead outlet to check for lose wires, no such luck.  I called Dodge Electric on Friday afternoon and scheduled an appointment for 9 AM Monday morning.  9:01 AM Monday morning I meet the electrician and describe the problem to him and he gets to work.  9:40 AM, he finds a loose neutral wire in a smoke detector on a wall that's in no apparent way connected to the room without power.  9:41 AM I have lights in my kitchen and a slightly dumbfounded look my face.

Summary: The electrician from Dodge Electric was punctual, friendly, knowledgeable, quick and efficient.  The price for the repair was also very reasonable.
