I didn't think La Condesa could get any better, but then they decided to start getting my orders right--and then just for bonus points, they went and added a full bar.  Well played, La Condesa.  I would have returned over and over again happily for their tacos and quesas knowing that they would come out wrong the first time AND that I would have to drink booze out of a paper bag in front of the restaurant (kidding?).  To me, La Condesa is one of those rare "secrets" (which is clearly not-so-secret anymore) that has only gotten better with time.  And don't get me started on that life-changing salsa bar...
