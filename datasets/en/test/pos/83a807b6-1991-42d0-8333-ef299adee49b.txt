Valentine's Day: Fabulous late lunch and service from Chelsea. Everything was very fresh and simply delicious. I loved the Roasted Beet salad. I wasn't disappointed that I forgot to get "dressing on the side". 

We love that this place is in the neighborhood and is a genuinely nice, quiet atmosphere with great healthy food. Hope Tryst can keep up in this economy. 

We plan to check out the breakfast too!
