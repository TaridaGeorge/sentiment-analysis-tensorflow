Simply amazing.
Everything on the menu is excellent. The imitation ground beef is even good. While eating my girlfriend's vegetarian shepherd's pie, I didn't even realize it was imitation until it was already gone.

Great service, awesome atmosphere and decor. Very reasonably priced. Great happy hour.

Also, I just can't seem to get enough of the Strongbow Cider that they have on draft. If you haven't been to Cornish Pasty yet, you need to get off of Yelp and drive there immediately.
