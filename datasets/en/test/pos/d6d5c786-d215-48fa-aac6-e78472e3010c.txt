My girlfriend and I decided to try J. Alexanders for the first time last night and this place is fantastic to say the least!  The Hostess was frendly and welcoming, our server was perfectly attentive, the food is TO DIE FOR!  Their Prime Rib is melt in your mouth delicious, the grilled Artichokes are wonderful, and they even gave us nice cold bottles of water before we left!  I can honestly say this is one of the best dining experiences we've ever had!  We will definately be back!
