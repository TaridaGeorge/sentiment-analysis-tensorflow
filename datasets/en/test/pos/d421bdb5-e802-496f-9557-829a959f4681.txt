While this place is a little pricey...it is totally worth it!  I love this place.  Yeah, yeah...it might get old over time - but for an occasional visit, there are very few bars in Tempe that beat this place.  The songs, the talent, the service, the surprises, all incredible.

Just watch out - as others have mentioned - after 9 PM, this place is packed and getting a table is damn near impossible.  With that said, it's definitely a place you must go to if you're a student or just passing through.

PS - They are very serious about the ID thing...don't ever try a fake here.  I never had one so I didn't have a problem, but I know plenty of people who got themselves in a nice bit of trouble because they tried their fake ID here.
