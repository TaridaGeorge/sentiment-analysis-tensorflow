This store is pretty cool and I am not one to like stores like this--so that should tell you something about how cool it is.

Wife and I have visited about a half dozen times and they redo the store for each holiday. Halloween is sooo cool--my fave! Totally gothic setups and store is laid out to look like different rooms you walk through.

Some stuff is pricey, but I think they troll the world looking for items. But you search and can find some really unique, decently priced items for your house. The owners are very nice.
