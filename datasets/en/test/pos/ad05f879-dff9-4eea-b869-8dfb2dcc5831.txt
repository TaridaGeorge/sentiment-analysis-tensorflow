I had a really good experience the other night at Pep Boys.  I stopped in to get new wipers for my car, since I noticed they had gone dull.  The gentlemen working there were just that.  One went out and checked my wipers, confirmed my suspicions, another chose new wipers for me, the other put them on and disposed of the old ones for me -  all in less than 10 minutes!  All I had to do was stand there and look pretty, lol.  AND they're open until 8pm on a weekday, unlike so many other things in Scottsdale that close early.  I can't vouch for major repairs, but I've never been waited on "hand and foot" at a Pep Boys store before!lol
