Karen at Moonbeams is amazingly helpful. The selection of items for our new baby is great. If she doesn't have what we want on the shelf, there are a ton of catalogs Karen is more than willing to show you. Karen is in touch with a lot of local artists so getting unique gifts for our baby's room was very easy. We ordered a custom painting and within a week the artist had a sketch for us to look at. We ordered our iron crib from Karen's shop and had Johnna make our custom bedding for the crib & the bassinet. Both women are fantastic and very helpful. I would highly recommend visiting the shop and registering for your shower.
