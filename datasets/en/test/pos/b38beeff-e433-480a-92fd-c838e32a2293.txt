One of the shortcomings of Phoenix is the cinemas. Fine if you want multiple screens showing the same Hollywood blockbusters, but if your movie tastes are different, you've got a very limited selection. The Camelview and the Valley Art were about it, but now, Chandler Cinemas are an oasis in the desert for fans of the weird and unusual. 

This week their films included a Swedish vampire film and a Belgian arthouse action flick as well as their usual bunch of second-run features for $2. Their snacks are similarly cheap. They also play Rocky Horror, but that's not my kind of thing. However, it is still easily worth traveling across the Valley, especially if you make a night of it and take in a double-bill.
