This hotel was very nice!  I loved the roomy rooms and the cleanliness of the hotel.  It was a great experience.  The staff was amazing and check in and out was wonderful!  I would recommend this hotel if you have to stay in the Gilbert area to anyone.  They also have a hot breakfast and Starbucks / drinks if you want to purchase that.  Overall, great experience!
