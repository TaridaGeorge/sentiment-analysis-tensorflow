This place is awesome! I doubt I will go anywhere else for a pedicure! I found out about it on Yelp, and decided to give it a try...I'm glad I did.  Great prices, excellent service...they don't just rush you through as most nail salons do...they take their time and I especially appreciate the nice job on the foot massage. Definitely will be a regular here:)
