The must-try on Desert Jade's menu is the Hot & Sour Soup.  It is the best I've had anywhere, by far!  Filling, delicious and has a little kick -  the hot & sour soup is great to order at the restaurant or to pick up and take home. Desert Jade has definitely improved my "comfort food" repertoire, so long chicken-noodle soup, you have been replaced for good!
