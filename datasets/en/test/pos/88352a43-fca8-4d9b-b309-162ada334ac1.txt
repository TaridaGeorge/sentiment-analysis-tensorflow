Awesome.  Best  steak in town.  Better than Ruth Chris and The Capital Grille.  We went late about 830 on a Friday recently.  The steak came out sizzling in hot butter.  The sides were quite good, and the drinks were well done.  You must try the butter cake, it is like eating a piece of heaven.  Great selection of breads they give you too.

It was not noisy when we went maybe because it was later, think we will stick to the later in the evening time in the future.  Two people, two steaks, two sides, two salads, 2 wine, 3 margaritta cocktails = $250 with 
tip.  We will return for special occasions.  That steak was amazing by the way.
