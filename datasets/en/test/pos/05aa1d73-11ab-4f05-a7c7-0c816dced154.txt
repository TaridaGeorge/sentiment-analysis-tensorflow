Looking for a Swimsuit or resort clothes?  Hate trying on bathing suits? This store is for you!  Even if you are a size 2 and love trying our suits this store is still for you!  I am a very hard to fit swimsuit person as the top is much bigger than the bottom in terms of size and I found 7 bathing suits that fit me perfectly!  Elise is amazing and they will even custom make a suit for you AT A REASONABLE PRICE!   I will NEVER buy another suit in Arizona at Dillards, Macy's Target or anywhere else.  In 45 minutes I had the best selection, customer service, friendly help and I never once felt like I could have found better styles or prices.  Do yourself a favor....go get your swim and resort wear at What Women Want Swimwear..and you will be thanking me for writing this post!!!
