I ate at Armitage last night and it was fantastic! My friend and I shared bruschetta and the fish of the day. The fish was a grilled halibut over a shitake polenta cake with braised bok choy and  a fennel broth. The server recommended a glass of Manisfesto, Sauvignon Blanc and it was delish! The wine went really well with the grilled fish. I really enjoyed the atmosphere, it felt warm and inviting.
