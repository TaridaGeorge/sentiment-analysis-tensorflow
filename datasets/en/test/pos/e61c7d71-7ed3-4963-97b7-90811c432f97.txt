I had a wonderful experience @ Melrose Pharmacy this week. Teresa went above and beyond, and really made what was a terrible experience at Walgreens all better! :) I highly recommend getting your prescriptions filled there if your insurance will cover it (ours won't..... which is unbelievable). They are nice, professional, knowledgeable and friendly. When we get better insurance we will be transferring all our scripts there. In a city where good customer service is as rare as snow in July, this place exceeded my expectations. Thank you!
