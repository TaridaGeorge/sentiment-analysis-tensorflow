This 12th St & Northern Fresh & Easy is the top and best Fresh and Easy
in all Phoenix!  I have shopped at this one for about 2 years now and
love the high quality food items and reasonable prices and the coupons
that give you money back as well This one is very clean and has very great friendly help and great variety of items and some that you can only
find it the UK. Fresh N Easy are part of the famous huge Tesco stores
in the UK  and have lots of parking and the electric handicap carts. I sure
love to shop at this Fresh N Easy and I urge you to try Fresh and Easy too.
Keep Up The Good Work Fresh and Easy! You Rock!
