This is great place to grab some grub at the mall.  Everything from their coffee to their sandwiches are great.  The staff is so friendly and courteous.  Always a smile and willing to chip in that extra penny if you're short of change.  My faves are the charbroiled chicken sandwich, chicken minis, and spicy chicken sandwich.
