I will also have to agree with imran.  I can't let this place get a bad wrap for one unsatisfactory review.  This is by far my favorite middle eastern food in the valley.  I grew up on authentic arabic food and the flaming kabob tastes just as great as the food I remember eating growing up.  Their grape leaves (w/ lamb) are fantastic, love the hummus, garlic sauce is very potent and wonderful, the gyro plate as well as the chicken shwarma are A++.  And the filafel and tabouli are perfect.  I have turned many friends/acquaintances on to this restaurant and most of them are hooked too.  Definately give this place a try.  You wouldn't be disapointed.
