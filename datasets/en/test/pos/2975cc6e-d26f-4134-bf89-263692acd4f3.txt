The ambiance in this place alone is so romantic and upscale. It's hard not to feel a little sexy when you go here. I've had a filet mignon, asparagus, potatoes, and cheesecake. The steak melts in your mouth the way only perfectly cut and cooked top of the line beef would. Asparagus was tender and flavorful and the potatoes where creamy and fluffy. The cheesecake was just that, cheesecake, nothing spectacular or memorable about it. All in all I love this place, it's the ideal place for celebrations or a special night out.
