I just had the most phenomenal pizza here. It was like potato skins on a pizza.  Figured I would be brave and try something crazy off the menu and it was delicious.  We were seated right away and had our drinks within less than 5 minutes being seated.  Very good service as well.  Too bad I was on the clock or I would have sampled some of their very large beer selection!!!
