I have brought my daughter here since she was 5 days old for a check up. She is half vietnamese so she was born with of course a small amount of jaundice and our blood type was compeltly opposite of each other. She has been seen by Dr. Bishop, Dr. Peterson and Thresea. All of them are great to her and answer all the questions that I have. I think if you are looking for a Dr for your little one, bring them here!!!
