Disclaimer: this review is brought to you by an Italian-American who grew up back east. ;) The bread, the dessert, and everything in between were excellent, though the dipping oil and the eggplant rollatini stood out most for me. The staff is extremely attentive, including the owner who checked on us a few times throughout the meal.
