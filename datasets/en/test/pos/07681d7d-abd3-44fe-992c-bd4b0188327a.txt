I have been to lots of yogurt shops all around the Valley, and I think Orange Leaf is my favorite. It used to be Yogurt Builderz, but there are too many kids that run around that place. Orange Leaf has great yogurt and a nice selection of toppings. It is not too overwhelming. The yogurt is nice and creamy. I highly recommend.
