Hands down some of the best food in the valley. Even if you're not familiar with Scandinavian cuisine the staff is extremely helpful/friendly and there are a wealth of more traditional options.

The food is fresh, carefully prepared, absolutely delicious and served up with great sides. 

My favorite? The surf and turf hamburger (one of the only hamburgers I've never felt the need to put catchup on btw), served with the (included) couscous side, steamed broccoli, green peas, and green beans.  

Like all good food, it takes time to prepare. While this isn't the ideal place if you're in a rush, if you enjoy friendly people and good food made with loving care - this is definitely a must visit.  Hands down one of Tempe's hidden gems.
