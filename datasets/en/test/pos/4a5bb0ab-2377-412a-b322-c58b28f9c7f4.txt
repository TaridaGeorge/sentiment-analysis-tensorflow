My dreams came true a few months ago...when someone told me they were opening a Rita's in Phoenix!!! I'm from PA and Rita's is a summertime STAPLE back east. There was nothing like it out here and I was SO EXCITED to see one open up. I dusted off my Rita's giftcard that I received as a stocking stuffer last Christmas from  my east coast family and hopped in the car after an exhausting track workout. Nevermind that I live nowhere near the location; I was willing to drive. 

I've been to this Rita's twice and have not been disappointed. The staff is super friendly and helpful; the Italian ice is always delicious. I only wish there were a location in central Phoenix, as Glendale really is a hike for me. But the distance just  gives me an excuse to bring a quart home :)
