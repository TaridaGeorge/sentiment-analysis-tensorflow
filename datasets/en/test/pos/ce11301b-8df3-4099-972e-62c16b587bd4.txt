One of my favorite lunch spots.  As has been pointed out, the decor doesn't win any points, but that's completely irrelevant when the food is this good.  I try and make a point of regularly trying different things on the menu and so far haven't found anything I didn't enjoy.  The lunch specials add miso soup, salad, gyoza, and a chicken skewer.  Despite sampling much of the menu, the chicken udon and maguro-don continue to be my definite favorites overall.
