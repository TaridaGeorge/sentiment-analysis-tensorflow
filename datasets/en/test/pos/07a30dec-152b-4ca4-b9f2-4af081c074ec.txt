Great selection and the service is decent.

I came here to get some fabric for my dining room chairs.  There is so much to choose from.  Walking into the door, and not being a person who does this sort of thing, can be overwhelming.  I didn't realize all the things they had.  I didn't look at everything because I was on a mission.  But you can find any kind of fabric, material, buttons, toppers, jewelry, and more here.  I did find what I wanted, and I am very satisfied.  

The lady who helped us informed us how to reupholster the chairs the right way.  It was very helpful cause I was duh confused.  

They are crazy busy on Saturday, and the parking can be a little scary.  There is a blind spot pulling out onto Indian School and not much room to drive through the lot, just fyi.
