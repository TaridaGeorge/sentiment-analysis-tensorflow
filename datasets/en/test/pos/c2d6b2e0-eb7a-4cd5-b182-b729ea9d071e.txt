Another awesome dinner at Havana Cafe! The service was a slow because they were short a waiter, but everything else was just about perfect. We split the onion/almond soup, which was unbelievably delicious, and my mojito was back to its usual perfection. Both the Masas de Puerco Fritas (crisp pork morsels with mojo-garlic lime sauce, rice and beans) and the seafood special were outstanding. Cheesecake with chocolate rum fudge sauce closed out the evening, and we both agreed it was among the best cheesecakes we've ever had (and the slice was HUGE).

What are you waiting for? Go now!
