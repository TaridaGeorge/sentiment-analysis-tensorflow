$22 for a basic pedi and $17 for a kid pedicure. Upgraded pedicures are available, depending on how crusty your feet are. Very friendly and cordial service too! Maybe it depends who waits on you? All the people there were very nice.

They use basic OP lotion, hot towels, and hot stones...good timed massage too! Very clean and very nice decor. (Outdated magazines - LOL!)

I tend to be very paranoid when I try a new place out, I would come back here again! Next to Leo's Hawaiian BBQ.
