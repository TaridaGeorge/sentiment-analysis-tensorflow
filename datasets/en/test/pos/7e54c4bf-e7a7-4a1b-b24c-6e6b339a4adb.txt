This is a very nice Safeway store. It is clean and the people are friendly . They know where thing are and will take you right to what you are looking for. I must say I go here mainly for the meat they have a good selection and the prices are usually cheaper then Fry's across the street. if you need help ask anyone but Becky Is the one that helped me out. 
 There is a Starbucks in this Safeway if you are in to that kind of thing. Also a deli and bakery.
