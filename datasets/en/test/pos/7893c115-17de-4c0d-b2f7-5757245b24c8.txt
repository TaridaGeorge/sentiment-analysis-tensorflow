Great buffet, probably one of the best casino buffets I have ever been to. The quality of food was excellent, there was lots of variety, all the food looked really fresh and tasted great. The service was good, quick and friendly, and the atmosphere was really nice. Plus the buffet was priced fair. Will definitely be back.
