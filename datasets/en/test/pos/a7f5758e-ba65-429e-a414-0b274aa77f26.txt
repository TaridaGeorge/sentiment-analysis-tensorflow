Ok, lemme get this straight.  A vegan restaurant, on my side of town, and it's delicious?!?  It's like a dream come true!

I had the Golden Soy Chicken Delight and it was wonderful.  Thin slices of  "chicken" in a ginger & green onion sauce with rice and steamed veggies.  My fella had the Vegetable Fried Rice which was a huge plate of rice, veggies and tofu.  We shared a sweet, icy glass of mint lemonade too.  Mmmmm, it was all so good and I can't wait to go back!

Update:  I've been back twice since my original review.  I had the Golden Soy Chicken again, and the Pho.  My husband and I also shared some chocolate cake.  Everything was so good!  I love this place!
