Tried Sens this weekend and I'll be back again and again.  Ten of us took the big table in the back and ate till we were sick!  
Everything was outstanding and I don't think we missed any of the Tapas.  The New Times said that the spiced Pork on a sugar cane skewer was flavorless, but after eating 8 or 9 of these little guys - I'd have to disagree.  They were one of my favorites! (ok, maybe not 8 or 9)
Beef Ribs, Duck, Battered Fish, Carpaccio and Tofu were all excellent with LOTS of Sapporo!  This place begs for repeat performances!
