We came back to Uncle Bears as we said we would on 7/2/12; we had Kaylee again; thank you Kaylee for the great service (sorry, we didn't recognize you - I think it had been a stressful day for us)!  Kaylee treated us both very professional , she was pleasant & had a great smile!  We didn't have to wait for our drinks or food very long.  We both had the Rajun Kajun chicken burger (wonderful with just the right seasoning) please thank the chef!
