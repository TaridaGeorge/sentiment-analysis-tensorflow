I saw this spot strolling through town this morning and thought I'd give it a shot!   Wow what a pleasant surprise!  The guys were super friendly and offered me almond or soy milk as a dairy substitute!  It was clean and nice.  The coffee was brewed well; the beans were full flavored; not burnt.  I love this place.  My new favorite coffee spot!
