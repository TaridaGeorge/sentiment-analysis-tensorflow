My windshield was broken by the 10/05/10 hailstorm.  I just got my estimate completed today and called Safelite at 1pm to schedule a replacement installation.  Chris was at my house by 3pm and did an excellent job!  He made sure he covered my driver/passenger seat with plastic so nothing would damage them in the process.   This was not done before when I had a replacement so I was impressed.  After replacing my windshield ( in blazing AZ afternoon heat ) and cleaning it off he cleaned the rest of my windows too!  Above and beyond what I expected!!!
