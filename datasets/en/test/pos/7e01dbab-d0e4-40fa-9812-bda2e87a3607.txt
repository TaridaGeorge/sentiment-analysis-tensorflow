By far this Costco is the best I've been to. I'm not sure if it was due to the holidays but the selection here is far superior then other locations 

The wine selection and variety here is incredible. Many wines were in the 90 point scale but reasonable in price. I ended up purchasing 18 bottles to take back to So Cal! 

I saw other usual items here that no other Costco carries such as Caviar, wine at $1599.00 a bottle and even a bottle of Remy Martin Louis XIII 1.75 liters at $22,999.00!

This Costco has a awesome selection, only negative was I spent more money then I intended. Oh well!

Happy Holidays!
