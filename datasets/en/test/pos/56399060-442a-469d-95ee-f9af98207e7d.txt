This is the only place I go shopping for bras now.  I live 45 minutes away  and found this place from another review. I decided to make the drive down to get a bra for a wedding. I loved my experience so much, I found the perfect bra for the strapless dress, that I bought an everyday at the same time.  It was the first bra in a long time that actually fit perfectly! Karla is so kind, and really cares about finding you a good bra that looks good! It's a trek from my house, but it's so worth it because I know I'm getting a great bra that will last for a long time!
