Wow this shopping mall was so big, beautiful and clean... Man everywhere I went you would just smell some kind of fragrance. I love their Anthropologie there, it was so big!!!

I also have to add the LV Staff was very nice, got some complimentary Perrier Sparking water :-)

There were so many places to eat there, but the food was okay.
