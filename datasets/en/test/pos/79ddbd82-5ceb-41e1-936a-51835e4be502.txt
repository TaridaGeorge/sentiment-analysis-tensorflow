I bought a house downtown, built in 1939, great deal....NO A/C!!! I dont know much about A/C so of course I checked Yelp for recommendations...enter Miguel and Flores Air Conditioning. I had already gotten a quote from my contractor before I contacted Miguel. Miguel met me at the house that day and gave me a quote that was less than my contractor's quote for a better (trane) unit and also told me about the tax rebate that I could qualify for. Miguel re-ducted (is that a word?!) the entire house, installed the new unit, a great touch screen thermostat and new vent covers in just over a day! I am very happy and Miguel was great, he also referred me to a great electrician. 5 stars for great service, product knowledge, and working with a slightly demanding and difficult :) home owner!! Thanks Yelp for another great find!!!
