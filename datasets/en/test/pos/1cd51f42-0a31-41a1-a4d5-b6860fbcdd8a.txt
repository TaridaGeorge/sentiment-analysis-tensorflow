Bunky is a great little shop that you probably wouldn't find unless you were looking for it specifically, but would be happy to have found if you did. The owner Rachel (who is super super cute, more than willing to answer questions and make suggestions, and is very knowledgeable about the area) stocks her store with a lot of small label clothing (mostly for women), some cool artist-made jewelry, cool fedoras and trilbys and other hats, and purses including HOBO brand.   There is a huge rack of cool t-shirts too including kid robot which I think is pretty cool. 

Some of the pricing may seem a little high, but if you found a lot of the stuff she sells elsewhere, you'd realize her pricing is really good. If you're in the area for First Friday or happen by another time, give this place a try.
