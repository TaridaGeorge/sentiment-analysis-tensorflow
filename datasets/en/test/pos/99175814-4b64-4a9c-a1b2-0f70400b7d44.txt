Beautiful country setting in Phoenix on an old farm. Watch closely because it is easy to miss as it is actually an old farm near the Legacy Golf resort at South Mountain. 
Very good home made breakfast with fresh ingredients from the farm. 
Orange juice was fresh and tasty. 
Eggs and bacon were very good. Biscuits and gravy were excellent. 
The setting was the star of this breakfast!
I would recommend ! You won't be sorry !
