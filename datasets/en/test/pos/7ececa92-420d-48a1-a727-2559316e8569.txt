I love the food selection at this place!  As someone who spent many years "across the pond" I've learned to appreciate good european food.

My top foodie recommendations at this store:

- Torani sugar free Black Cherry syrup and CostPlus sparkling water to make your own soda

- The fondue cheese packs

- Heinz cream of tomato soup

If you try just these 3 things you will glimpse nirvana!
