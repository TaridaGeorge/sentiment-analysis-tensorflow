Happy hour at Postino rocks! And, while it's a wine bar and I DO love my wine, I dream about the pub board. I mean, where else can you find corn nuts on a restaurant menu? And the wedges of prickly, little round pickles are so tart and delicious! $5 mini pitcher of Hoegaarden washes it down perfectly.
