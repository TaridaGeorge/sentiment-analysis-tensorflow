St. Francis was a great experience! We had a party of four that sat at the bar for some drinks on a regular Sunday afternoon and it was like watching the food network live! It was very entertaining to see the kitchen busy at work. Every so often, the chef or other staff would let us try little samples of different things they were making, it was so awesome! Also, everyone that works there is fucking hot so it was very appealing to the eyes!
