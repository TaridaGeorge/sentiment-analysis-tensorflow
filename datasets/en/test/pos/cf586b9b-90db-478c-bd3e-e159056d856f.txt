Absolutely delicious and their lunch special was perfect for a man on the go. I went in, sat at the bar, and (I believe her name was Jenny) Jenny was an awesome server. She gave me my choice of any salad on the menu and a slice of heaven, I mean pizza. She even explained what it meant to be gluten free. Not that it matters to me personally, but it's intersting to know and helpful to many I'm sure. 

Thanks guys for the great service, awesome salad(super bomb crutons that I've been dying for), and the little bit of heaven in a pepperoni covered slice of picazzo!!
