This is, as far as I'm aware, THE casual Italian place in Chandler. There's been more than one occasion where myself and a group of friends can't decide what to eat, and have gone here by default. We all get calzones (which are a bit greasy, my only complaint), which are always huge and hot. There are plenty of choice for the stuffing, so everyone gets something they like. They've just expanded to add a new dining area, which was good since before we'd occasionally have to wait (gasp!) for a few minutes to seated. So no, don't go here if you want fine wine and fancy Italian dining. But do go here otherwise.
