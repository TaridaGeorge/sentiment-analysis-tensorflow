What a nifty shop, just a quick walk from the light rail!

Okay, I'll admit the first time we went here was in Robert M's car. We'd heard from some of our friends that this place had great gift ideas, and Robert M is always looking for cool gifts--even if they do end up being given to himself.  Stupid Cupid turned out to be a great deal. They have assorted candles (you have to smell the Campfire one!) along with live bamboo in containers, lotions and assorted bits and bobs.

This is definitely the spot I'll be stopping at for upcoming birthdays and Hallmark holidays. Zing!
