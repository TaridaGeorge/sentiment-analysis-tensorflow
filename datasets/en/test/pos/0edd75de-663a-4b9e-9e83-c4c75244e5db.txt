We have only been in the area for two weeks and this place is going to be our regular weekend brunch place.  We loved our brunch place back in California and really wanted to find somewhere equally as good and we did!!  We used yelp to search, read the reviews and decided to try it for ourselves.  We have eaten here two weekends already and were pleased to find out they welcome dogs on their patio.  The service is great, the food tastes really yummy and the portion sizes are large. I look forward to going through the menu and might even try poping in one evening!!
