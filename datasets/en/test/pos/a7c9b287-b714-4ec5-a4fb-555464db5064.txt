Beyond obsessed with the chocolate chip scone here! When I am craving a sweet treat, this is what I want/need!

I love to meet friends here and sit outside.  My favorite meal is a cup of potato cream cheese soup and the BLT Plus (I sub cucumber instead of the tomato, ask them to leave the mayo off and sub brie for the cheddar).  It is perfection!

My son ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes with the blueberries and a side of bacon and he was completely raving about his meal.  That's saying a lot!

Service is friendly and helpful, the restaurant is always inviting and clean and we always leave with a few shortbread cookies "for later".

I will be back to try the Chopped Salad with salmon ~ it seems that every person around us was enjoying one last time we were there.
