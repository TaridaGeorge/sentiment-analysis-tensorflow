Stayed at the Valley Ho a few days, so I had a chance to experience the Zuzu for all three meals. All of which, from what I ordered, we're amazing and extremely delish. The night coconut cream pie was the featured dessert was my fav. So delicious without being disgustingly sweet. The fries, salads, sandwiches, just everything I tried was good. The BLT and truffle grilled cheese are to die for. Even the side of asparagus was really good. Service was also really good and friendly.
