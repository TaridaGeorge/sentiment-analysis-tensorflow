4-yr-old grandson/gramma heaven on a Monday afternoon between 1:00-4:30! I think we had MAYBE 12 other kids to share the place with!

We even found parking in the shade...which was great given he triple-digit temperatures!!

Pizza was good! It's a larger store with the full compliment of animated characters to put on "the show" and the big screen to watch for a little resting time while eating and between gaming!

Large overhead crawling tube/slide. Many games for little ones. Things seemed clean and didn't see any games out-of-order.

Loved the "Chuck E Cheeses Sketchpad"! Gave us a sketch that was a keepsake for Gramma!!
