I have a soft spot in my heart for YC's. I used to go there all the time on my way home from ASU. I, like many others, have my special concoction. All veggies no sauce, mostly broccoli, shrooms, water chestnuts, and baby corn. The best trick i use is to line your bowl with the crunchy wontons before they ladle your cooked food in to it! It tastes so good, but I am one to like soggy cereal!

Also, they'll cook without oil if you prefer, which I always ask!
