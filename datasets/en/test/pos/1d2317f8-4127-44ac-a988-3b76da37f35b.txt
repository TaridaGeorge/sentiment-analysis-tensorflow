I love this place.  We have one in Vegas and I was pleased to see one out here.  It is massive and I enjoy coming in here to browse the boats and the outdoor gear.

I'm not really into the outdoors, but still enjoy window shopping some of this stuff.

I am about to go on a camping trip....(I can't believe I just typed that)...and was looking for a 0 degree sleeping bag.  While I was looking for that, I browsed the Golf equipment and the bow & arrows.

I want to take archery lessons soon and wanted to price the equipment.

Overall, it's always a blast to shop at a Bass Pro Shops.
