We discovered Dragonfly when it was voted Best New Restaurant in 2003. Since then, I haven't been back much, simply due to the fact that they are in way North Valley, and I'm in the waaay South Valley. 

But, I still dream at times of their Butternut Squash pasts with goat cheese, sage & pepitas... or their Tropical Fruit Salad w/jumbo shrimp, pineapple, mango, coconut, red onion, cilantro and macadamia nuts. Mmmm...

They also serve up a wonderful breakfast/brunch, almost too beautiful to eat, with fresh fruits, mini-pastries, tarts, and tea sandwiches on fresh-baked bread. 

They also now offer frozen dinners-to-go, which one of these days when I have an important dinner party I plan on buying and trying to pass off as my own home-cooking. Think I can pull it off?
