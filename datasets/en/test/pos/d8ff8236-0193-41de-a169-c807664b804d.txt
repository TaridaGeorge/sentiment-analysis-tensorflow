I have to say, that this was the best  "Italian" restaurant, I have ever been.  I had the special of the month, a stuffed chicken breast.  Everything was very fresh.  Extremely tasty (not full of sodium)  I would go back every night, my husband had the lasagna, and it was very tasty, moist, and really wonderful.  The service was fabulous,  not in your face, but very helpful.
