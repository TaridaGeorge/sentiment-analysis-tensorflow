After several months of offering the $1.99 introductory price, they raised the fee for the basic car wash service to $2.99. This is still below the $4.99 price that lurks behind the new "$2.99" streamer on their signs, and still a great bargain for all that you get in this new, efficient car wash station, including the free use of vacuum and floor mat cleaning machines.
