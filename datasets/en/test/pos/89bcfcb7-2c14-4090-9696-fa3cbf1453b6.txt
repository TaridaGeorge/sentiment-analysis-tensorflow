Ive only been there once, but I can't wait to go again. Im actually writing a review because I just looked to see if they were open on the holiday haha anywho, I went through the drive thru and I kept thinking the guy walking around the cars was creepy with his big smile on his face but then once we got up to the window to order, low and behold it was him! He is what every restaurant should have as a front house man and I can't wait to experience D'lish again!
