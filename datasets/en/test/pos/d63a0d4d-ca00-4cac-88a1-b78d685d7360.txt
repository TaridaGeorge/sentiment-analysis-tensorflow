Love this place!!!!  Have been here 3-4 times and have had a great experience each time.  The atmosphere is great both inside and outside.  The decor is modern yet cozy at the same time.  The food is fabulous.  The beets are phenomenal!  The brussel sprouts are fantastic.  The chicken and dumplings are the best comfort food and the salmon is terrific.  A friend of mine has had the mussels on several occasions and loves them.  The service is some of the best that I have seen.  From the time you walk in the door til the time you leave everyone treats you like they are truly happy you are there.  I high recommend Beckett's Table.  It is definitely one of my favorites!
