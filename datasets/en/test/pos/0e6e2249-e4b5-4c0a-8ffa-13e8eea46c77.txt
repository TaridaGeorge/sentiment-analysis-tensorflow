REI has everything you need, and if you can't find it in the store it's definitely on their website. Their customer service is OUTSTANDING. Everyone is so knowledgeable and genuinely interested in answering your questions, no matter how asinine. I work in retail and I've used REI's customer service as an example of awesome customer service standards for my employees.
