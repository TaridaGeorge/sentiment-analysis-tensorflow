Absolutely LOVE this place!  Plenty of healthy food and drink options and they are all organic.  If you are a heavy meat eater this is not the place for you.  They have delicious specialty drinks (both alcoholic and non alcoholic) and plenty of salads, entrees, appetizers, and deserts to choose from.  I would recommend either the spaghetti squash or the quinoa beat salad.  Both are delicious and very good for you.  Service is pretty good.  I have yet to have a poor experience here (knock on wood).  The servers are always very nice and personable and get you your food as soon as its ready.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is trying to lose weight, diet, or just start eating healthier.
