YAY for another adventure to Coup des Tartes!!!  

Prior to arriving I mulled & mulled & mulled over the menu & when we got there, it was different, no worries, because indecisive me was able to...BAM!...decide!!! Woo!

As always the service is absolutely fabulously supreme!

Ordered chevre/tomate (it's becoming a staple along with onion tarte), I ordered salmon & the opposite ordered pork tenderloin.  My salmon was good & the sides were DELICIOUS (not the same as the online menu) BUT, why is it that for me, the opposite plate of food always tastes better?
