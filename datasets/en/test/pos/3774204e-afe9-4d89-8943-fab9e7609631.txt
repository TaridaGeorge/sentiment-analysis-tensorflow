Finally, I've found the creamy, decadent, flavorful fro yo I've been searching for! Zen Zen's yogurt is absolutely divine. I savor each and every bite! The toppings are pretty standard as far as fro yo places go, so they have it all. My absolute favorite topping is the incredibly delicious nutella. For me, it's the consistency and smooth texture of the yogurt that really makes this place stand out among the rest. The selection of yogurt flavors usually varies from visit to visit. My favorites are the chocolate milkshake, red velvet and last but not least, cinnamon buns!! Since there's still a lot of summer left, I plan on heading back here to sample as many different flavors as I can... strawberry lemonade, mint, mango, plain tart... Yum!!
