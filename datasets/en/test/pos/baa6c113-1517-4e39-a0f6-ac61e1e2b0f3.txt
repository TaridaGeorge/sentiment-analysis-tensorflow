BINGO! This place has awesome cupcakes!!!! I purchased a few different varieties as a surprise for my husband's birthday. Not a single complaint! The lemon cupcake was DELICIOUS. The cake portion of the cupcake reminded me of my grandmother's moist  cakes. The frosting tasted like a flavored whipped butter.Yes, I would drive 45 minutes for 12 of these cupcakes!
