Its nice to no longer have to drive around Scottsdale wondering where to eat when you want gluten free and vegan options along with healthy food.  First off, the root-beer float martinis are trouble.  We thought they sounded good and tried one- that turned into four!  I had the sweet potato and avocado salad side.  It was great I never would have thought it could be that good.  High protein burger was up next for dinner.  Never had one before, Glad I did! Really surprised me and I'd definitely have another.
