Oh Maizie's...what can I say, you had me at $4 Dollar Burger Night!  I have really never had a bad meal at this local Phoenix establishment!  Even on their busiest nights, normally Monday for $4 burgers, the staff is accomodating. If you want good food, nice staff then try Maizie's I promise you wont be disappinted!
