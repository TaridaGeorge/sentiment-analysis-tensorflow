Great place to study, relax with a coffee and a book, or catch up with a friend over coffee. 

The coffee is very good and they usually offer several varieties at once. The pastry's are very tasty and never stale. 

The wi-fi is good and free, not super fast but certainly not slow. 

It does get a bit loud in the main room at times. When that happens the bank vault turned study/work area is still pretty quiet.
