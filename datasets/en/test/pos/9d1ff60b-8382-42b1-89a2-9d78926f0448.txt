We were staying at the Phoenician Resort and we were not turned on by the menu they offered. My sister in-law recommended The Breakfast Club do we drove a couple miles down the road and got a delicious breakfast.  My  wife got the "Foster: Topped with Bananas Foster & Vanilla Ice Cream" and she thought it was really good. I got the "Huevos Con Masa w/ Chipotle Cornbread, Chorizo Queso & Pico de Gallo" and that was really out of this world. I never had anything like this before and i commend them for how unique the dish was. This place is better than Ihop (which is 2 stars in my book) and probably cheaper. I would come here again and again.
