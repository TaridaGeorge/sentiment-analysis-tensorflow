YUM!  Best place for brunch outside on a nice sunny day to distress from corporate life.  This place has alot of character from the mismatched silverware to the home grown roses.  The food is delightful with fresh ingredients and creative dishes.  Great place to enjoy a thick, almost meaty, Bloody Mary or one of their special mint mimosa.  I quite enjoyed their Tarte of the Day as well as their sweet potato pancakes which were slightly crispy on the outside and ewy goey in the most wonderful way on the inside.   When you look around, you notice other guests are happy and are leaning back in their chair enjoying themselves; obviously Palatte is doing something right.  If their dinner is any representation of brunch, I can't wait!
