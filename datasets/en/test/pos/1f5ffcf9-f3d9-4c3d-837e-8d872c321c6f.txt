Unquestionably THE best breakfast in the east valley. Even trumps our other favorite breakfast places like The Breakfast Club and more.

Family run and operated for over 20 years! HOMESYLE cooking, FRIENDLY staff, LARGE portions, REASONABLE prices and sometheing for everyone's taste.

While we usually go for breakfast, we've also had exceptional lunches here.

Prepare to wait on weekends... it's well worth the time and SIGNIFICANTLY better than the restaurant next door or across the street.
