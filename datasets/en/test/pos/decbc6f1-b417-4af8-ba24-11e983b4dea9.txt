I've been meaning to try out Babbo and finally did this past weekend with 2 friends. Their menu is extensive so we asked the waiter what he would suggest. He quickly came up with different dishes that he thought we may enjoy. I ordered a salad, my boyfriend ordered the meatball sandwich and my friend ordered a pasta with a side of meatball. All were delicious! We also ordered the dessert (fried dough balls with ice cream and whipped cream). That was equally as delicious. The restaurant has great decor and friendly staff. The food was great. The prices were reasonable. I'll be back again!
