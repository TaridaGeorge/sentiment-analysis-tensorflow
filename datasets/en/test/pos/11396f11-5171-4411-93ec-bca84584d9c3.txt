Tommy's has just been remodeled this summer and is one of my favorite restaurants in Casa Grande.  Tommy did place up nice and the new bar is great place to bring a date then have a fantastic meal.  Tommy's specialty is italian food, but my favorite there is the busted rack or lamb.  Grilled to perfection and glazed in a homemade mint sauce.  Their calamari is fresh and tasty! I recommend it anyone from CG, and  also to anyone coming into town!
