Amazing selection of liquors, beers, and wines joyously unencumbered by Virginia-style socialist ABC monopoly. Other reviewers point out some great details.  I only browsed and had a craft beer with friendly bartenders downstairs in the wine/beer bar-lounge. Great selection on about 8 taps. Check schedule for frequent live music.
