LOVE this place!!! So yummy and a nice change from the millions of same old sandwich shops. My favorite is the Provolone and Veggie Panini! So good, I pretty much have that every time I go, the salads are good as well. The people working there are always so nice and friendly, I just can't get enough of this place!!
