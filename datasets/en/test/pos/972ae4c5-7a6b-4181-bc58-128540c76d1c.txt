so after driving by this spot a few times, I looked it up here, good reviews (expect for one guy bitching about how oily it was, and he looks like a complainer so I ignored him) I stopped in about an hour ago.

I walk in and right away the girl at the counter greets me and is friendly

As I am ordering, customers are walking out and Pino is asking them if everything was good and if they enjoyed it.

More customers leave, and looks like the staff knows them by name

SO- this all set the bar high


Ordered a margherita pizza, it was awesome

Looks like I finally found an my local pizza joint

:D


-will update as I try new things, but their sauce for spagetti smelled amazing!
