Super sexy place! Great for dates, live music, relaxing cocktail with a friend! I'm not sure what I like more, the sexy ambiance or that they have different wines all the time! Very dim lighting, stone walls, stained-glass windows, there isn't even a sign outside the wooden door you walk in. 

Food is amazing. Pretzel break app is super good also the duck confit flat bread was TO DIE FOR. 

Don't forget, usually there is a cover and its small, so make reservations or the earlier the better. Yet, TOTALLY WORTH IT.
