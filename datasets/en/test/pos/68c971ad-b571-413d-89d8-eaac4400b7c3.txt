Very impressed with the service of this place and quality of the course.  The course and the greens are in great shape.  I am rating this on having a 4 year old that wanted to go out and play golf.  Most places of this high quality would never allow a young one to go out.  But after 3pm they do and the kid had free rental clubs which was nice.  They did everything to make sure we are away from other people and not pushed.  My son and I had a great time because of the level of service to make us feel welcomed.
