Yum!

Just had the wings here for the first time last weekend and I really don't think I've had better wings! They were soo good! Ordering them "hot" was just perfect!

Infact, the pizza and salad were just as amazing. I had friends next to me raving on the bread and meatballs they had ordered. 

We had a large group and the service was excellent. They were very friendly and were nice enough to inform us there would be 2 servers since it was Sunday and they like to tagteam if they are slow!
