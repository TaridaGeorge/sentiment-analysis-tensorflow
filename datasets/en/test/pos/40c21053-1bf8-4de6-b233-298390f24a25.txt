Extensive trails, manicured walkways, over 20 species identification signs and the lookout with sighting distances to far away peaks.  This is more akin to a well groomed city park than a mountain hike.  Not very tough but there is a lot to keep your interest.  Don't miss it but don't go on a crowded weekend either.
