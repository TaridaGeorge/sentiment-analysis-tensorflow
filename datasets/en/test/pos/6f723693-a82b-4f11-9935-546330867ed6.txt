This place is amazing.  We eat there once a week and, more often than not, are accompanied by family and friends.  The food is incredible, very fresh, creative, and tasty.  Whatever the special is, order it.  It's always good, and I have found myself requesting a former item that was on special, even though it is not on the menu.  That's the other wonderful thing about SakeBombers: the service.  The staff is wonderful.  They have never steered me wrong with a recommendation and do not hesitate to accommodate any special requests that we have made.   Yoshi, server/bartender, is always very friendly and welcoming.  Their happy hour is amazing - $1.50 for delicious miso soup!  SakeBombers blows other sushi out of the water!
