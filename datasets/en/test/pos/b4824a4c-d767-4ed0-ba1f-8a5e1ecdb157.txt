last saturday we saw the phoenix mercury vs seattle storms.  the arena is quite nice and we really enjoyed ourselves.  my husband's cousin scored us some complimentary tickets! the seats we had were in section 111 and i could see the game perfectly.  i loved the hip hop squad that performed during the intermission.  they made me want to go up there and shake my botty! i would return for sure.
