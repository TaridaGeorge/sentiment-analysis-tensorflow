For as long as this place has been around, it sure keeps a good crowd. DJ's always play a good mix of hip hop and house. Towards the end of the night its a little old school. Always a fun time. Bartenders are always friendly and the door staff is very accomodating. 

Definitely a go to spot on a Friday or Saturday. Guaranteed a good time!
