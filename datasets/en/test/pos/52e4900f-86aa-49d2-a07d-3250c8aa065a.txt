I had a coupon for a free sub from this place (I know, AWESOME!), so stopped by to spend it up. 

I was immediately greeted by the friendly and engaging guy behind the counter, who kept up a cheerful conversation with me throughout the preparation of my order. Didn't even bat an eye at the coupon. Love that!

The sub I ordered was the Turkey provolone. I had it "Mike's Way", and it tasted great. The meat is sliced when you order it. The bread was fresh, with a crispy exterior and a soft interior. 

Friends who know me know that I refuse to eat at or even enter a Subway because I just can't handle how it smells in there. Completely opposite experience here.

Great food, excellent service, clean and convenient location. Yay!
