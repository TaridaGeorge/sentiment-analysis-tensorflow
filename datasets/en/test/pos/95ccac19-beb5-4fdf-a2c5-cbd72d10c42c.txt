This is my Sbux on the way to work, and I'm so glad that it is. I love the staff, and they always make my mornings fun. I don't use the drive-through in the AM as I find it usually takes longer, and then I don't get the full experience. Amber & Kelly are the best. Thanks for starting my days off with a smile!
