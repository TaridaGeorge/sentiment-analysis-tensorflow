I had a great experience at Schwartz Laser recently. After years of contacts and being anxious of this procedure, after a quick 3 minutes I now have 20/15 vision. Dr. Schwartz is great at answering all of my questions before the surgery and on the day of surgery. I have had five scheduled follow up appointments with Dr. Bloomenstien who is also very nice. The office staff are very friendly and appointments are easy to schedule. Of note, on surgery day my partner had to wait in the car because the small waiting room was standing room only.
