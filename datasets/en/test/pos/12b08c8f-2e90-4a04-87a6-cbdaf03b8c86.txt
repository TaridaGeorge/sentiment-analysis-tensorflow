If you've been shopping somewhere like Bath and Body Works, you need to wake up and smell the roses. Lush is without a doubt THE best store for lotion, soap, and well, cosmetics.

It's winter and my hands are dry? They have something for that.
It's summer and I'm feeling a little icky? There's tons of stuff for that, too.

This place smells like heaven, and I think every employee is high from the flower fumes, because they have more energy than a toddler with a sippy cup of Red Bull. Most of the products are completely natural, with tons of vegan options. I find something useful EVERY time I visit!

Even the most macho gentlemen should feel no shame shopping here. Ladies love a man with good skin!
