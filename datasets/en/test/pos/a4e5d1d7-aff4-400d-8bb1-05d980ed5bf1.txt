This store rules!  It has lower prices than other liquor stores I've visited and even lower prices than grocery stores.  When it comes to single bottle beer selection, Total Wine is where it's at.  The only place I've been that can compare is Tops.  You can find New Belgium six packs here for $6.99, which is the lowest price I've seen anywhere.  I also feel much classier shopping at Total Wine than I do at BevMo.  BevMo has kind of a Costco atmosphere, where Total Wine is more akin to being in an A.J's.  Sure, they're both big box liquor stores, but if you prefer a less fluorescent and industrial place to purchase your spirits with low prices and huge selection, choose Total Wine!
