I thought the ambiance and food were great. Reasonable prices, too. My fiance and I tried The Living Room for the first time on Valentine's Day and we had a great experience. We ate the brushcetta, roast beef and brie panini, and a cheese platter. Everything was delicious as was the wine. Great live music too!
