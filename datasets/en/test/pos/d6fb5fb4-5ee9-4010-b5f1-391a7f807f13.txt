All the reviews are in and they are right. This place has the best tacos in town. The location is somewhat scary, but you'll get over it. The food is top notch, the pricing wallet-friendly, and the owners run the place. Ask for some of the hidden hot sauces if you feel like crying and running home to mamma.
