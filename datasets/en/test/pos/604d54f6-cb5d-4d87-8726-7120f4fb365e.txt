I truly love this place.  Not just because it's awesome food, but Chef David Traina & his wife Kiersten rock.  Ok, pretty much everyone rocks there.  I've been to a few "community dinners" there, which are 1st rate - and it's one of those "Cheers" type places where they remember your name and are always happy to see you.  I recommend this to ANYONE.  Check it out, not just 'cause I said so but because it rocks.
