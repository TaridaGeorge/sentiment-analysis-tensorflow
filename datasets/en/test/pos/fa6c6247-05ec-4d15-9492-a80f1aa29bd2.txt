This place is awesome. If you haven't tried it, what are you waiting for? The Prince of Thai's and Senorita-no-meata are my favorites but they have lots of different wraps. So GOOD! Beware around lunch time (mon-fri) it can get pretty busy and you might be waiting for 20 minutes to order and get your food. If time is of the essence pre order your food. 

**Yes parking is a pain and lunch time gets packed for all you men out there .  .. . . this place has tons of meat packed wraps for your taste buds too.
