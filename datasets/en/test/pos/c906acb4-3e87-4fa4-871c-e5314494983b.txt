I love Jimmy Johns.  It is WAY better than Subway.  The bread is what makes it.  They bake their own bread right in the store and then right before they make your sandwich, they pluck out the middle of the bread to fill your sandwich with goodness.  

You choose your sandwiches by number, but you can customize any sandwich.  I usually get the #4 which is a Tom Turkey.  It has turkey, lettuce, tomato, lettuce and sprouts on it.  I like their chips too.  They call them Jimmy Chips.  They are the kettle cooked type.  I personally do not think this is your ordinary sandwich.  The combination of bread and ingredients makes it a great sandwich and they are fast to prepare.
