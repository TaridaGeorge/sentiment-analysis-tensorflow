My mouth is even watering right now just thinking about this place! We went for dinner on a Wednesday. They have dinner specials that are a really good deal. You get a main entree, spring roll, peanut salad, and rice if it's not a noodle dish. I got transparent noodles with veggies and tofu. The salad was amazing. That peanut dressing is officially my new favorite thing in the world! Spring roll was yummy and crunchy. The noodles were very good, although could have used more noodles. All the veggies were perfectly cooked and the Tofu was perfectly fried. I can't wait to come back :)
