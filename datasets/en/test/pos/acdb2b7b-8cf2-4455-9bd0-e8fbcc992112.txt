I have a list of new restaurants I want to try that's a mile long, but the hubs and I find ourselves back at The Grind again and again.  The food is exceptional - and that's coming from a vegetarian.  I LOVE the portobello sandwich and I have dreams about the rosemary roasted cheese.  I also can't get enough of the Blueberry Hill cocktail with fresh mint.  The atmosphere is casual and just noisy enough to give you a sense of privacy.  Such a cool place, so niftily tucked away in a little strip mall - The Grind is a must-try in my opinion.
