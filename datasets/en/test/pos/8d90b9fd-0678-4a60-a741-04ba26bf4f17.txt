First time trying Yan's, and the food was excellent. We had spicy orange chicken, curry beef, shrimp with snow peas, and shrimp with vegetables. The food was fresh, hot, and seasoned to perfection. The portions are good and the price is reasonable and the owner is friendly. We finally have great Chinese food in the West Valley!
