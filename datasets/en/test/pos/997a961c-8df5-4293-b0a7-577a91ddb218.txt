I live near City North so having this place around the corner is phenomenal! Dallas and John know how to run a night club/bar the right way...

Of a weekend there is ALWAYS beautiful people. Yes, there are a lot of older women, but they are just as hot as the younger crowd that also makes its way there. If not, the cocktail waitresses and bartenders are friendly and very easy on the eyes... doesn't hurt that they are wearing corsets!

Anyway, normally I do vodka when I'm at Blue, I was there on an off-night and split a bottle of wine. I was told their more obscure wines are on the 'Captain's List' which allows each location to bring in different wines. I had the Hans Fahden Cabernet... GREAT! This bottle drank well beyond it's price tag. Bold in flavor but very smooth. Ask for it!
