In the heart of Old Scottsdale, Pischke's Paradise lies in wait...catching tourists and locals alike with their diverse menu, and incredible food! 

Have had everything from breakfast to steak au poivre here.  Burgers,  salads, and steaks are good, but I always seem to gravitate back to their open face sandwiches on Boboli bread.  Try the Fire Island, or the Rocky Point Shrimp. Boboli bread with chicken or shrimp in a cream sauce topped with dofino cheese. You'll thank me later.

Ultra casual atmosphere, Fat Tire on tap, great food. What more can you ask for? Not much. Look for long waits at lunch or dinner...
