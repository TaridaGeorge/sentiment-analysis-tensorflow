Holy cow!  I just did the whole Melrose antique/retro tour and also wanted to check out Metro Retro.
By far, the CLEANEST place!  Classiest, too.   They guys who own it are awesome and I stayed and chatted for about 15 minutes.
They didn't have what I was looking for, but if you want retro furniture that's in *really* great shape and *really* funky, this is the place to go!
