We have a Siberian Husky who must run around. This is a great dog park! It is a wonderful City of Phoenix service at no extra cost. Parking is close. There are bags and trash cans for the "doggie deposits". Luckily there are trees for shade and chairs for the doggie parents to relax in. Our dog really enjoys herself here! Recommend!!!
