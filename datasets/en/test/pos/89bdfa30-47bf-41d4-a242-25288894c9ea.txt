There's really nothing bad to say about Tammie Coe. The staff is very nice and everything I eat and drink from there is amazing. I often go there for a mocha latte and a muffin. That's just how I roll. But I just got a bundt cake for my mom for Mother's Day, and it was delicious. It was chocolatey goodness and everyone loved it.

The prices can be a little rough and deter me from buying some of their food items, but when it comes to coffee shops, prices are generally typical with regard to coffees and pastries. The thing with Tammie Coe, though, is that I always like what I get. And they're great at making suggestions if you're clueless and indecisive like me. 

And here's a plus...they're open on Sundays, now!!! Such good news.
