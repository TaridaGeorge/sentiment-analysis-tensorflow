Shoe heaven for men.

These guys know their stuff. Custom sneaks, awesome service, and a new location near fashion square. I'm not a fashion buff, but shoes and glasses are my specialty.

I swear I'm putting these guys' kids through college with the number of shoe's I've bought here. Previously, I bought most of my shoes online due to lack of in-store options. Other than the occasional slickdeals.net specials... where's the fun in shoe shopping online?

Check out High Point for hard-to-find Nike, Adidas, Creative Recs, and more. Many are limited editions.
