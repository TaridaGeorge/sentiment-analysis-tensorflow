This place is incredible. 

They have a very mellow, laid back vibe going on here. The employees are friendly and not pretentious at all (a trait I've noticed throughout old town). 

Cartel is a great place to hang out or study- music is chill and not too loud. Not to mention the chai is amazing. Seriously, like nothing I've had before. Definitely try it out!
