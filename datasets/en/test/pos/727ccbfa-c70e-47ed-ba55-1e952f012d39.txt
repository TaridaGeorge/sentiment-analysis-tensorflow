Even though this place is usually packed, they have their lunch rush down to the tee. By the time I am done paying for my order, within a couple minutes it's ready for me to pick up. I usually just stick to ordering a sandwich because the add-on's tend to get a bit expensive for me. I love their italian sandwich. I look forward to coming back.
