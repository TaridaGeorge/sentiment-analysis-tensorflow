My favorite Indian restaurant in Phoenix!!!

Generous portions and great service. Your water is never empty which is a big deal for me when I eat spicy food.

Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Vindaloo and Aloo Matar are my personal favorites here. Their naan is also great.

Try their lunch buffet and you will not be disappointed.
