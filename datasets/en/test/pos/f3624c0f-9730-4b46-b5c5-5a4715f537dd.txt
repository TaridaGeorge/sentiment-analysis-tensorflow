I love Port of Subs, and this location has very consistent quality & service.  
We get a 2 ft sandwich for $12.99 and have food for 2 days.  We get the ham & turkey on white with their mustard/mayo combo, lettuce, olives, red onions, pepperoncinis and have it sprinkled with oil/vinegar, salt/pepper & oregano...yum.
