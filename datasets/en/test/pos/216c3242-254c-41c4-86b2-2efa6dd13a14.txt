LOVED LOVED LOVED this spot that works great for lunch!
The clean fresh decor was very inviting, service was phenomenal and the FOOODDD was fresh, flavor-able and great value for the price.

They have only been open 3 months and I hope more people will notice that they do a great lunch service as well as Happy Hour and lounge....that serves food until 1:00 am!

I had the House Dynamite that was aptly named because it was DY-NA-MITE!
The sweet-spicy sauce on moist chicken and crunchy vegetable was perfectly prepared.  My friend enjoyed the Pad Thai with tofu that could have used a little marinading but the noodles and sauce were perfect.

We will definitely be back!
