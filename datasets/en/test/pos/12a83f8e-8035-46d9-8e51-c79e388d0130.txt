A lovely retreat nestled into the mountainside. Great walking areas, lots of green grass, beautiful plants, trees and cacti. Very gracious and accommodating staff. Stayed in the Canyon Suites. Nicely appointed rooms, lovely common areas. They accept small pets. Enjoyed all the bunnies and quail. Will look forward to returning. A very nice place to relax and be pampered.
