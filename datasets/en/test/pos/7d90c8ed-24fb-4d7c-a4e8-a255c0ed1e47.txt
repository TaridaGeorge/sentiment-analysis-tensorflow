We love this place! It is ALWAYS crowded for dinner - I don't care what night it is, so show up early unless you want to wait. The portions are huge, but don't let that keep you from adding meatballs to your Bolla Pasta because you can always take the leftovers home! The pizza is top notch too. My mouth is watering as I write this review... Oh, and the lasagna? Well worth the wait - just like the stuffed pizza!
