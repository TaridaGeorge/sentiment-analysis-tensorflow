I took my boyfriend here for a special night out, and we were both in heaven.  Everything we ate was utterly mind blowing.  I appreciated that I was trying japanese dishes that haven't been replicated at every restaurant in town.  The location of the restaurant is serene and the perfect compliment to the cuisine.  I cannot wait to go again!
