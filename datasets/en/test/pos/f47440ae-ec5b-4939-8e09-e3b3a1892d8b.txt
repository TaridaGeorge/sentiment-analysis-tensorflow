I like this place, It is close to home. Plus it is open whenever i need them. But, sorry to say i do not know the hours. Gas is a really good price here compared to a lot of other Chevron's near by.  They also have a full mini mart inside as well as a   car wash. Not the best but good when you are in a hurry. Great location,right on the corner.
