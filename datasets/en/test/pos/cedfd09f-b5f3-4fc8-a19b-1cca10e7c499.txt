When I choose a restaurant, essentially I am asking for good service as well as a great meal. At Cibo, it was a terrific experience from the moment we entired the old Craftsmen home that served us great Napoli Italian food! 

Our server, Matt appeared immediately gleaming in his RUN-DMC t-shirt and I was ready to rap myself in great food from the beginning. The mozarella appetizer was delightful as was the antipasto. My mushroom pizza was thin crusted and delicious, and our guests from North Carolina were impressed. 

Thanks for a great experience.
