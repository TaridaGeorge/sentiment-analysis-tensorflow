Niall Costello of Allodile Construction is probably the friendliest, handiest man I've ever met. Not only is he honest, straightforward, and very talented...He's prompt and affordable too!

He's done all kinds of work for me: Demolition, concrete floor sealing, painting and tiling. He even put up my ceiling fan and fixed my running commode! For lots of my friends he's done big jobs like kitchen & bath remodel, garage additions. I mean, the guy does everything!

And who can resist that sexy Irish accent! This guy is seriously THE dude to hire when you need stuff done around your home or office!
