What a wonderful little gem tucked away in Mesa!

The husband and I tried a few different yoga studios to find just the right instructor, atmosphere and personal attention. We found that and a whole lot more at Inside the Bungalow.

Our instructor is personable, welcoming and makes yoga truly a meditative practice. The studio itself is warm and inviting; a wonderful place to spend a Saturday stretching while living in the now.

I'm not a coffee drinker, but the cafe offers the best hot chocolate I've had best enjoyed on the outdoor patio area.

Love this place!
