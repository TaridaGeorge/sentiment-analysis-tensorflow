The name is no exaggeration!  Like manna from above, this bowl filled me with light and joy. 

My wife proclaimed hallelujah at the surprisingly low calorie count; a food this rich and delicious must be bad for me, but it's not!   With each bite I was reborn and left the store younger than when I entered.  

Maybe it's the acai berries.  Maybe it's the guilt-free natural sweeteners of fruit and honey.  Whatever it is, it's magic served with a spoon.

Let your toxins be washed clean and try the Hawaiian bowl.
