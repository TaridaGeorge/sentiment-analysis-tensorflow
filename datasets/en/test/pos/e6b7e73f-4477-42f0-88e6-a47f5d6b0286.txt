Awesome place. When the weather is nice, take advantage of the outside patio. But the inside is cool, too. Great paintings and nicely appointed. We began with the Apples, Brie, & Fig Jam bruschetta which was excellent. Both the spinach salad and strawberry-gorgonzola salad were perfect lunch-sized portions, very fresh, and very delicious. Our server was welcoming and attentive. And of course, a great selection of wines.

Great place. Plan on returning again...and again...and again.
