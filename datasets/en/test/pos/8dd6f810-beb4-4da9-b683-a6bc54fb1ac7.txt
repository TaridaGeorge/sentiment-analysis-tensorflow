I have been wanting to try Roka Akor for such a long time and now that I have I am a FAN! The Kobe beef & Kimchi dumplings (+ sauce) are to die for. I would have been OK with just those for my entire meal, but I digress. 

The interior is amazing. minimalist but with mid-century modern touches and a Japanese influence. It's comfortable and stylish. It really adds to the cool, sophisticated vibe of this place. Our server was excellent! He was very friendly and extremely knowledgeable. 

The food was fantastic. We tried a few items, including the rock shrimp tempura, the filet and the rice hotpot. 10/10 in my book. I can't wait to come back again!
