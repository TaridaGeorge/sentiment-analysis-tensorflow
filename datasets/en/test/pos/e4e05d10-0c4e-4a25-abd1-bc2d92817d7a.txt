My wife bought tickets to this show for this last Saturday night (8/25) and I didn't know what to expect. I was very pleasantly surprised, in fact, I was amazed at how good the show was. The food could have been better, but I wasn't expecting a gourmet meal. The host and actors were very entertaining through the show. One thing I would say was that the plot was very well thought out and made a lot of sense, unlike in some shows like this I have seen. I would highly recommend this to anyone.
