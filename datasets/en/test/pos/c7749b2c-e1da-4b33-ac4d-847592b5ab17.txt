ahhh Marcellino...

Why do you have to get me drunk? Funny thing is, the more we drink the more I understand your english. Thanks for the help.

There are few places in the valley that can be called true Italian, not to mention ones that are ran by a real Italian chef. Sometimes we go there and ask Marcellino to just "go for it" - havent been dissapointed yet.

BOTTOM LINE: Worth every penny! Dont change a thing.
