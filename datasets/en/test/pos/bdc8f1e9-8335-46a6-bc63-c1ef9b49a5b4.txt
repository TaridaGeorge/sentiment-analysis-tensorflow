Hula's Modern Tiki is always a win!
Great indoor and outdoor seating. Wonderful island-style music that gets you relaxed and thinking that maybe there is a body of water somewhere nearby (not a chance in Phoenix).
I got the chicken skewers, which were moist and came with great dipping sauce. My husband loves the black bean burger here (a great option for vegetarians). They have good drinks and good service. We have come here alone and with friends and we always have a good time. Love the location and the mid-century modern style of the place, too! Very Mad Men, if Don Draper took a trip to Polynesia!
