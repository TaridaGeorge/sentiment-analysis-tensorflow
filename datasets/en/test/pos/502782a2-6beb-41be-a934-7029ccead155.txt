Love the BBQ here, oh my slathered pork with rice and cabbage and your favorite hot sauce....A little taste of Hawaii's Asian, and Western panthology mixed up and served fast. The chefs, perhaps owners, actually seem like Japanese / Hawaiian people. 
Good for Lunch and the room is bright and well painted. 
They have a great take out menu brochure.
Right in the same enourmous complex as Home Depot and Walmart on the far East side near the AMC theatre. Right next to Panda Express. 
Makes me hungry just thinking about it--Perhaps I will go today....
