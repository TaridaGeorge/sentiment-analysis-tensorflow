Sunday highlights: 

Lobster & pancetta ravioli, with morels and pea shoots from Different Pointe of View. A highlight....

Avocado ceviche from McClendon Farms. 

Anything Payton Curry touched- both pates, the sausage, the soup.... it was ridiculous. 

Kai put out an amazing spread: the brioche with an egg was wonderful, the ceviche was wonderful, and pork was delicious. 

There was a vodka lemonade that was pretty stellar, too.  42 something. 

Province had some smoked salmon I really enjoyed as well. 

There was a lot of fluff, and word to the wise, avoid vegan marshmallows, regardless of what they're dipped in.... 

Mostly though, it was so nice to just be out and about in a beautiful venue, full of people who love food, to run into all your friends...  it was a highlight.
