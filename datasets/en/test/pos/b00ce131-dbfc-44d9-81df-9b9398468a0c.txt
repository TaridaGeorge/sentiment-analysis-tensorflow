I have been to Wong's several times now since I moved to Phoenix just a little over a year ago. Every time I have been to Wong's I have had a great meal. I have tried several meals there including the Sesame Chicken, the Wong's Special Lo Mein, and the Barbecue Pork Lo Mein. All of them have been well prepared with no issues. I also get the entree add on which consists of an egg roll, 2 crab puffs and your choice of won ton soup or egg drop soup for a small added fee as it is worth it,. The portions at this restaurant are large. They have a great atmosphere and the employees at this restaurant are top notch, friendly and respectful. If you're in Phoenix and you want great Chinese food make a stop at Wong's and you won't be disappointed.
