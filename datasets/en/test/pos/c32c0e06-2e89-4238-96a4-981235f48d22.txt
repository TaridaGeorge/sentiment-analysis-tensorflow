This place is ah-may-zing. The menu is unique, the food is high quality, the prices are right, the ambiance is cool and laid back, and the employees/owners are super friendly and genuinely happy to have you there. Now, I am the kind of person who will get something on their first visit, enjoy it, and then get nothing but that item every time they visit. At Brosenbrus, it is the Tomato, Basil, Mozzarella sandwich. Every once in awhile, I'll change it up, and it is always delicious (i.e., The Stacked Philli), but I always come back around to this delicious stack of deliciousness. They have recently began selling baked goods, and those are equally tasty. They have a happy hour, which makes their already reasonably prices even lower. Come check these guys out... You will not be disappointed!!
