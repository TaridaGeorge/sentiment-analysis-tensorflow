I had to make a quick trip in to town when my dad had a health issue.  Everything about The Phoenician was awesome.  The front desk was attentive and quick getting me checked in.  The valet service was prompt. My room was super clean - kudos to housekeeping.  The grounds were meticulous.  It was too cold to sun bathe but the pool lounge chairs were toweled and ready to go and we used them to sit in the sun and read.  The golf course was manicured to the 9's and looked inviting but I had no time to play.
