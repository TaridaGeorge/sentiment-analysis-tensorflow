We worked with MelonFish last week to photograph our baked goods for our new venture. Zach was a pleasure to work with, the set-up, shoot, and takedown went quickly and smoothly. Zach was helpful and cooperative, working with us to get the best result for each shot, and we weren't disappointed. The photography was even better than we had imagined.
MelonFishPhoto is highly recommended, we would use Zach again without hesitation.
