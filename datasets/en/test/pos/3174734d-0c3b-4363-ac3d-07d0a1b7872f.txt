Welcome to my new abode, the Pavilions on Central. Besides the lack of obnoxious children. There's much more to like about the Pavilions. It's quiet at the times it's supposed to be. I don't have bass-thumping-subwoofer guy or high-heels-on-hardwood-floor girl living above me and It's walking distance to Lux! Lofts, garages, hardwood floors and the sexual appealing gas fireplace, which is much needed only when you put your air conditioning at 50. 

If the damned Light-Rail construction would ever get complete I've got a pick-up/ drop-off area right in front on Central Ave and there's a pick-up/drop-off area on Central Ave/ Roosevelt. Perfect for my intoxicating evenings at Fate, The Lost Leaf or/and The Roosevelt.

Drink up! Ride the train! Score!
