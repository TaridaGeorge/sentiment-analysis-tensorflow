When my husband and I moved out here, the first place his co-workers said we had to eat was Spinato's.  His boss ordered it for lunch one day and my phone started blowing up with texts from my husband telling me he was bringing this home for dinner.  He said simply - best pizza I've ever had.  

I was skeptical.  Is it really that good?  Was he just really hungry?  NO!  From the minute he walked in the door - the pizza grabbed my attention.  From the smell to the look to the taste.  Hands down - best pizza I've ever had.  

They don't deliver to our place, but it's well worth the trip down the 51 to pick it up.  The staff is alway nice and will remember you after a few trips.  All around - great food, great service and local.
