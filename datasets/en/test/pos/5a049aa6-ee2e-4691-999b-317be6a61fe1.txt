I'll admit, I consider myself a beer snob.  I've had my favorite beer-buying locations throughout the Valley, but Total Wine has become my favorite all-around stop.

The beer selection is great, one of the best in the Valley.  The staff in that section are typically very knowledgeable and make great recommendations.  But the most amazing feature(s) are the prices; by far the best prices on the best selection in town.  The prices and selection also follow suit in the liquor department, but I don't wander there very often.

That said, the wine section frightens me.  I'm only beginning to appreciate wine and I've easily gotten lost among the many wine aisles.  I think I'll stick to smaller locations for my wine experiments.
