i started going to postino for their amazing monday and tuesday bottle and a board deal. i was pretty much in love with postino upon my first visit, and thus, malbec monday was born. how could you hate a monday when you know your day will end in a bottle of malbec and board of delicious bruschetta? 
the staff are friendly, and knowledgeable, and really, honestly, hilarious. 
as if this weren't good enough, then god blessed me with postino brunch. postino brunch is hands down, the BEST brunch in phoenix. the terrible void of an amazing brunch in phoenix that was left when pallette closed has finally been filled. a peach bellini and country toast: this is my ideal sunday afternoon. meals are served with an amazing tiny tomato salad, i don't even like tomatoes... it's so good.
