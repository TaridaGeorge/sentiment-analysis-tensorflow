Lux continually makes some of the best espresso drinks in the Valley in my opinion. Their lattes and mochas are something I drive over 15 miles for every week. 

There are a lot of other options when it comes to Phoenix, but Lux has a great pastry case to match the coffee. Their lemon tarts, coffee cakes and giant cookies are always good. Only problem is that sometimes the place can get really busy on the weekends and there's nowhere to sit inside. That can be a problem when its 110 F out, but if you go at night there's generally seating available.

As for everyone talking about the "hip" scene it attracts...ya there is a lot of that sometimes but everyone is friendly and it's a fun place to people watch at the very least.
