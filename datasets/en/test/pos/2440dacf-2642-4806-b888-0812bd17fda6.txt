My client took me there yesterday, its one of his favorite spots. I wish I had listened to him earlier. I had a salad with blue cheese and mini grilled cheese (blue cheese and havarti on just right crisp sour dough). Both were outstanding. My client had the roast beef and blue cheese sandwich. It was piled high with beef. He gave me a sample and it was also terrific. I'm taking my son there today to try something new. No more taking my lunch with me to my client's. Glad I go to his place every week so I can lunch at Bertha's!
