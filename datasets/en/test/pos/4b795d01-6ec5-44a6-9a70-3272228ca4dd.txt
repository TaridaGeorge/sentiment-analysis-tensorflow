I love this place. So very clean, professional staff, and a ton of machines so you NEVER have to wait for anything. 

Locker rooms have hair dryers, towels and a wet sauna. 

Outside there is the pool area with chairs for napping, lanes for swimming laps, areas for smaller kids and also a slide!

Spa offers massages, facials, haircuts, etc.

Lifecafe has shakes to sandwichs to googles if you're like me and forget them at home.
