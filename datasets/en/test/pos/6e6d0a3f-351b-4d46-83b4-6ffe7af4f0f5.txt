Always enjoy the Teriyaki chicken bowl with brown rice and no veggies. So much so that it is all I ever order there. However, my girl has tried every other dish there and been very please with 99% of them. They have good tasting water, nice napkins and tasty fortune cookies. Good service most of the time and very reasonable prices.

My only complain would be that on their website they showed the Teriyaki bowl to be only 500 calories but they actually split the bowl up into 2 servings which makes it 1000 calories so you must read the fine print before calculating your caloric intake.

I can't wait to go back and get another t-bowl!
