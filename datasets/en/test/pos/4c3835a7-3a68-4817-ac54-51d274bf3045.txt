I LOVE SideBar. It's sleek, modern, and gives you the feeling you're looking out the window and into another city. I have been several times and am never disappointed. They have a wonderful list of cocktails (my favorite being the Lynwood Palmer) and beers as well as a phenomenal full bar stocked with quality alcohol. The bathrooms are clean (and they supply mints) and the bartenders are friendly and on top of their game even at their busiest hours.
