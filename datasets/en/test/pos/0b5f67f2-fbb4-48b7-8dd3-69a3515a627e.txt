Finally a decent place opens in the otherwise cursed location.  The food is fresh and delicious.  The cuisine is Japanese with an emphasis on rice bowls with an average meal at about $8.00.  The chicken bowls are delicious, especially with all white meat.

The style is fast food, but the preparation and delivery are first rate and orders are made to order.  The teriyaki is prepared by the facility; not that sweat molasses crap you find elsewhere at comparable chain restaurants.

Family owned and operated.  A great dining experience.
