I have had such a great experience with Pet Club in Maricopa. We usually buy our dog, cat, & chicken supplies here with no complaints. Recently we made a big out of the ordinary purchase and each staff member we dealt with including the manager were extremely helpful. I made an error in the item I purchased and they accepted the return with as much courtesy as the purchase.  I am sorry that a previous customer had a negative experience there, however I have yet to have one. Thanks guys!
