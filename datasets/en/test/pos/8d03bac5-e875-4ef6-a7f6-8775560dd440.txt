Soooooooo yummy! This place has been here forever and for VERY good reason. 

Top-notch service, authentic Thai cuisine, and a great location. It really doesn't get much better. The atmosphere is also very nice. You can sit in the main dining room, a more quiet room or the bar. Whichever you prefer. 

I highly recommend the Pad Thai if you are new to Thai food. If you are looking for something more exciting, try the Tom Ka Gai soup, Crispy Basil Chicken or Coco Chili Fish.

And for the record, ask for your server to be Cassie. She's been there a while and knows the menu like the back of her hand. Fabulous service.

The bar makes a pretty mean cocktail, too. And you can order take-out! Thai on the Fly!
