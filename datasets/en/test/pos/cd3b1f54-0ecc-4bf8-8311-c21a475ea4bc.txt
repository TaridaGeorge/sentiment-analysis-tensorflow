I am a pizza snob. I usually don't like gourmet pizza. I am a Ray's girl. Alas, I have been cutting most dairy out of my diet because of the harsh treatment of the animals.

Low and behold, Grimaldi's. While I will mention that the pizza I ordered totally rocked. I ordered a plain personal white with garlic (and a side of sauce). Great crust, the sauce was a little on the acidic side.

What I would like to give Grimaldi's the ultimate rating for is the fact that the mozzarella on the pizza is from happy grass-fed free-range cows. I am beyond impressed that Grimaldi's cares enough about the happiness of the cows to use a more expensive cheese.

I can eat pizza again!
