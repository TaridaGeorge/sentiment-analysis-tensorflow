Alright, I'm officially off Starbuck's...when I'm in Phoenix at least. I ordered the coffee of course because how else are you going to determine the quality of a coffee house without testing the main ingredient. So one iced coffee with irish cream and low fat milk...Boom! my new favorite coffee house. The decor is quaint and artsy. Stone floors and brick walls mean a nice cool escape from the insane heat we all live in and the guys behind the counter actually seemed like they were happy to be at work. I even like the building itself, which appears to be converted from a 50's gas station with a single serving pump which now serves as the drive-through. Tomorrow morning I'm gonna head down early and enjoy a newspaper in my new favorite coffee house.
