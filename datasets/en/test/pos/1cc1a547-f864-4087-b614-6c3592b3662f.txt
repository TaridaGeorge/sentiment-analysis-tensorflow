The baguettes are incroyable, incredible, fantastic, amazing.  They have a hint of sweetness, are not rock hard, and I couldn't stop eating them.

I saw literally every single person in the place drinking an iced coffee.  I absolutely had to order one if everyone else was.  I was not disappointed.  In fact, I had the best iced coffee of my life.  There was something about it.  It was strong but not black, dirty, bitter, weak, or sour.  Mixed with a hint of condensed milk and poured over an entire cup of crushed ice, this iced coffee was amazing.
