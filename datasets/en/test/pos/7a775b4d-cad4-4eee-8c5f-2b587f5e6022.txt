Loved Charming Charlie! This is heaven!
Came here last month while visiting AZ!
Never been to a C.C. before and I was so impressed with the color organization and selection!
Everything from jewelry, scarfs, bags, tops...
If you're a girly girl like myself and love cute things or if you're looking for a place to get great gifts for a reasonable price, stop by Charming Charlie. 
Everything I picked up was around $10-20
Can't wait to go back to another location and pick out more things!
I'm a fan!
