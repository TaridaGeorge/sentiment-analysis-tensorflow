Move over Starbucks meet your competition! While the prices are about the same and lower, Dutch has a better roast and not a bunch of hoopla! 

This location is a small stand with double drive thru! You are in and out fast! I like the lids way better too. You don't spill and you don't need a stopper either. If you're sick of bucks and the burnt beans go see Dutch! 

Yumm!
