I can't say enough nice things about Tom and the folks at Floor Source.  I had received a quote from a big box home improvement store (which shall remain nameless) and was shocked at how expensive they were for cheap-looking carpeting.  I went to Floor Source and not only was their carpet much nicer, their price was nearly half of what the other quote was, and they install the very next day!  The carpet looks beautiful and the workers were fast and professional, caused no disruption or damage to the walls (which the other company couldn't promise wouldn't happen).  These guys know customer service and I'll refer anyone who asks to Floor Source!
