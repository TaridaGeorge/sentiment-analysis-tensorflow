I went here yesterday to take advantage of the 3 free piercings on your 18th birthday special. It is a really clean, nice place and all of the staff (both piercer and front desk) are very helpful and friendly.  I got my cartilage and forward helix pierced and had no problems whatsoever with the experience.  They are true to their word and you only pay for the jewelry which can be as little as $12 for a captive hoop! I am very happy with the results and if I decide to get anything else pierced, I will definitely be returning.  My piercer was JD and they even give you free sea salt for the sea salt soaks!
