Wife and I went with the In-laws as we wanted to explore a little of Phoenix before we had to come back home to the cold. This place was cool. Intricately built art exhibits surrounded by some of the most beautiful desert flora I've ever seen. Several Native American rebuilds of homesteads throughout the grounds helped give to the illusion of how things used to be. Military ID got me in free, which is always clutch, and those who did have to pay, didn't pay a whole bunch.
