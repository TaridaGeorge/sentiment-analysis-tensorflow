Gelato is one of my favorite desserts and this is my favorite place to get it.  I HATE this place when it gets crowded though.  I was there last night with a group of 5 and somehow it was dead which was great.  I didn't feel rushed to make my order or feel bad when I wanted to taste everything first.  The staff is always very nice about it but the long line of people behind you may not be so friendly.

Anyway, my gelato was excellent as always.  I've never really had bad gelato ever, but this place churns out some awesome stuff.  I hope to come back soon and often.
