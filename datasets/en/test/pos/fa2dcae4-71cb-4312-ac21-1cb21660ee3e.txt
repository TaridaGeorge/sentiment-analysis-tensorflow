The paletas are very delicious and they remind me of home in Mexico
I tried the nuez (pecan) and the mango with chile. Both were very good!
I definitely think is worth checking them out specially when you see a line over 10 people waiting at the Tempe store.
One suggestion, have more flavors available!
