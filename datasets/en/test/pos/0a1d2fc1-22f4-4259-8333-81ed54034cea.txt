I love this place!  I rode my skateboard there in 87 and bought my first record there.  People still had record players then.  It was The Smiths, This Charming Man 12' single.  I still have it and will always remember Stinkweeds for opening my eyes to music that didn't get played on the radio,  I will be forever grateful for the staff there helping me discover something besides Huey Lewis.  Haven't been to the new store yet but will visit soon as I'm in need of some new vinyl.
