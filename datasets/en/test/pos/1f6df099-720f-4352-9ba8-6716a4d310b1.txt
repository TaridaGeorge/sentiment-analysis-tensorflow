It's a sandwich shop and they have great sandwiches.  Bottom line.   Staff is friendly enough and, for the quality (good) of their food, the service is ultra-fast.  If you are in the area and in need of either a quick breakfast, lunch or something to take back to the office, you can't go wrong here.
