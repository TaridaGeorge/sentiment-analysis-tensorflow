Jewish Sliders are the second best thing on the face of the planet for hangovers. The service is usually slow and not very attentive. On weekends there is a 10 minute wait at least - but the food speaks for itself. Sammi's munchy crunchy wrap in both original and buffalo is a close second of my favorites. I would always get some chocolate milk and possibly a mimosa. Bagels are obviously great and they give you pickles! Can't beat that.
