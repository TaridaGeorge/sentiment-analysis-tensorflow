Food is fantastic, some of the best sandwiches you can find anywhere. But, really what makes Chloe's are the waitress and waiters. They are all cheerful, helpful and if you become a regular (which I am as I live in Kierland Commons) they remember your name and your usual order. Try Chloe's you won't be sorry!!
