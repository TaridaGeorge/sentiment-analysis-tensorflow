I ate at Green for the first time today. I loved the Thai Peanut Salad with mock chicken. My friend had the BBQ Chicken Salad and it was really good too. We plan on going back weekly.
I love the community table, we met some nice people today also enjoying their food. Someone at the table recommended the pasta with "meatballs".
I will be trying that next time.
