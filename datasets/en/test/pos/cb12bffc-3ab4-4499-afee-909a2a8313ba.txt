Great first impression!! I called to place a to-go order and although they literally were closing in ten min, the gentleman on the phone was super cool & acted as though it was hours earlier. There was absolutely no hint in his voice of annoyance at the last minute order, as so many restaurant workers would have displayed. I cannot express how accommodating he was on the phone, it was such a relief after having just gotten home from the airport. Exceptional food, had the chicken pita, tzatsiki, and their signature crazy fries (with feta!). Can't wait to return.
