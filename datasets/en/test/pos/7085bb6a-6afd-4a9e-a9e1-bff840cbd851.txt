This place is good eats.  Wings are very good traditional deep fried hot sauced wings.  Thin crust is better than anything I ever ate in NY.  And deep dish monster Sicilian is only second to Lou Malnatis in Chicago.  Yes it is that good.  I love the way they slice the sausage so thin.  Very cool.

Quality is spot on and tastes the same each time I visit.  About once a month.  I wish I lived closer but I am about 8 miles south of this location.
