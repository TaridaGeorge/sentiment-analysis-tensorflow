What a wonderful store! It goes without saying that their collection is amazing but then again, anybody could have a good stock of wine and spirits. What I like the most about going to BevMo! Is the very helpful and cheerful staff. I have never been in there when I was not greeted and asked if I needed help. But in retail there is a fine line between "helpful" and "pushy" - they must go through training in order to recognize a certain look on your face to know when you actually need help.
