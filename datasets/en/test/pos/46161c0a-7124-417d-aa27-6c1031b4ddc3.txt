I've been searching all over Phoenix ever since moving back here from Los Angeles, CA and finally found the gyro I have been endlessly searching for!

We park in the back of the cute little venue, and notice a sign that says, "Please do no put feet on the wall", ummm.. okay.. I'll be sure to keep that in mind..

We walk in, get greeting, order, get served, QUICK!

The food was so delicious. My mouth waters every time I think of this place! If only my stomach could handle it more often I'd be there so much more :)

The place is small, but cute! I didn't mind! The staff was so attentive and nice! Five stars all the way!
