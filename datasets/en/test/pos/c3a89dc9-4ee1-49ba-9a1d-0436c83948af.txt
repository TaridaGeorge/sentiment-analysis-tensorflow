We had friends in town and needed a place to hang out, eat and drink.  This place was perfect.  You can eat there (which had ok food choices but GREAT drink choices) or hit one of the local restaurants nearby.  We went to Blue Hound then bowled.  Atmosphere was cool, hip and fun.  Large screen televisions helped entertain and large couches were relaxing after rolling a strike.  Young, old and children alike will enjoy this place.
