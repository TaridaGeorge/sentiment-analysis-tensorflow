I absolutely love this doctor and today was my first time meeting her. She was full of life and personality. I like my doctors to have a good bedside manner. I just moved here to Scottsdale a month ago from RI and I really liked my gyno back home and I really was hoping that I would find another one that I really liked. I appreciated the fact that before the actual exam we went into her office to talk about medical history and other questions and concerns. She actually eased my fears on some tests that I recently had done by an endocrinologist. I was referred to her by our realtor whose wife also sees Dr. Haas. So far I am very impressed by the doctors here.
