I was heading to Pei Wei when I saw this place and thought hummus sounded yummy. I ordered the veggie plate which came with hummus, tzatziki, falafal, spanakopita, dolmades and pita. This dish was gigantic. It could be shared by 3 people as an appetizer. I ate it for dinner though and took more than half of it home.

Their pita bread puts a known valley chain with pita in the name to shame. Seriously with a name like that, how can your pita bread taste like cardboard? Anyway, I digress... Cyprus Grill is amazing, and honestly why would you go anywhere else for delicious greek food?!
