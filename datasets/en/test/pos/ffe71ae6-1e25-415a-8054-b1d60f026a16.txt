One of my favorite places. Love to sit outside in the back the best ! I try to go as often as people will go with me ! The strawberry chicken salad is always my favorite and is a must try ! Today my friend really enjoyed their Greek salad as well ! Everything here is absolutely delicious ! Service is always top notch as well ! Highly recommend this spot to anyone and everyone !
