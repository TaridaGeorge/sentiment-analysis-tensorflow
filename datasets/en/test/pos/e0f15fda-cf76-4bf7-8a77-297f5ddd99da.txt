My friend took me to this place because we are both huge fans of micro brew beer. Papago Brewing has a magnificent and ever changing seletion of brews from all around the country including some of their own creations. I highly suggest the orange blossom, it is to die for. 

We also had one of their Pizzas and ended up fighting over the last peice because it was so delicious. Great service and atmosphere capped off an already wonderful time, I will be going back often for sure.
