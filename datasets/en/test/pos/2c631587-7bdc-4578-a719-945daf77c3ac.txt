I've been going here since I was 12. I practically grew up here. There was a patch of time where it lost a lot of popularity. But great skate is back now. Filled with people every Friday and Saturday. The best lighting system, the best employees, the funnest environment and DEFINITELY the best sound system in arizona. If you're looking an awesome place to go with the fam or for bday parties, or even with your friends, go to Great Skate. You won't be disappointed.
