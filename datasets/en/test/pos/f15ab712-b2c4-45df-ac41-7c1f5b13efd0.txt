We have been going to Firebirds for years.  Used to be there was never a wait, but then the word got around and it's crowded quite a bit.  Oh well.  Doesn't stop us!  Love this place!  Steaks are great, Port mushrooms?  Yup!  Spiced Green Beans?  Oh yeah.  The BLT salad rocks, you name it, it's good.  The service has always been great from the hostess to the wait staff.  If I could only go to one place the rest of my life, this would have to be it (but only because Pizzaria Bianco doesn't serve steak!).
