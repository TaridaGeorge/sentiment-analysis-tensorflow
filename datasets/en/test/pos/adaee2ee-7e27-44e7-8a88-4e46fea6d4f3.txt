It was perfect. My boyfriend and I were in a hurry, wanted something quick, healthy and light and Zoe's delivered. Not literally, we ate in. Service was amazingly quick and friendly. We ordered the Chicken Roll-Ups, which were delicious and wonderfully complimented by their salsa, which the server brought extras of! All in all, great experience, I'd love to go back, but I live in Cincy. Oh well. Rock on Zoe's.
