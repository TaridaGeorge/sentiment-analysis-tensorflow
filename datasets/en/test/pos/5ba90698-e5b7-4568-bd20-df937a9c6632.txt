I love Lulu's Cupcakes. I have to say that my favorite flavor is the chocoshnitzel, which is chocolate cake with a yummy coconut frosting. My husband likes the mood elevator, which is chocolate cake with coffee frosting and the bunny boo, which is the carrot cake cupcake.
The staff is always smiley and wonderful. The store is always clean and pretty. I tell everyone I know about Lulus!
