This is the QT I visit most frequently.  I actually go out of my way to visit QTs because I feel they are superior to all other gas stations in AZ and I'm not even talking about the price of the gas.  I'm talking about the friendliness of the staff, the good selection of stuff in the store, and the general good vibe of the place.  The place is always well lit and I especially like that pumps are rarely ever out of order.  Another plus is that in general all QTs are more "roomy" than other stations which lets cars maneuver more easily.
