5 stars as far as lunch buffets for under $10 go. I walked in and asked if the AC was working and the guy turned to get me an ice tea. LOL. I moved to a table with more air circulating. Sushi and edamame on the buffet? wow! So far so good.  There's a ton of food to choose from. I know I will be back!
