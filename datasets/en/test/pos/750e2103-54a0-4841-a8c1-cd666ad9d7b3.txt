This place was so awesomely good. It had a cozy atmosphere, a great waitstaff, and the food was to die for. The flavors were robust and interesting. We had the Three Sisters Salsa, the special soup (a lovely, mildly spicy Pozole soup), and then I had a Tumbleweed salad with Mesquite-grilled tenderloin. Other at my table had the tempura ahi tuna roll (and it was a HUGE hit), the white shrimp tacos, and the penne pasta. Each and every one of us were impressed. 

For a bunch of out-of-towners looking for some tasty Arizona eats, this was the place to be.
