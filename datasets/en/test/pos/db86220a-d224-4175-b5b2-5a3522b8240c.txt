First time trying dessert at Postino's.  We ordered the Salted Caramel Sundae based on our waiters recommendation.  Sadly, I was very disappointed.  It's basically vanilla ice cream with hot caramel poured on top of it.  Add some chocolate covered corn nuts and that's pretty much it.  I am shocked this was the waiters favorite.  Now I must go back and try all the other desserts just to see for myself (not that I mind).

Still gets 5 stars because everything else is simply fabulous at Postino's!
