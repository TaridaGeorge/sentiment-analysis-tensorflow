Stumbled on this restaurant for lunch today.    The atmosphere was awesome.  The food was fresh and delicious..even better the prices for lunch were really reasonable.  Definitely going back to try more things off the menu.  I was looking for Seafood noodle soup.  I tried the Vegetarian instead and was not disappointed at all.
I really reccommend this place.
