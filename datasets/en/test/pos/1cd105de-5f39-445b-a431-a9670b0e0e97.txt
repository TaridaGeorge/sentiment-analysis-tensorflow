This place is awesome! I had the Italian on wheat, my husband had the chicken bacon avocado and my daughter had the meatball. everything I tasted was delicious. The bread was soft and the meat was amazing! The meatball was covered in cheese and oregano and parmesan.  

This place had super fresh ingredients. I will definitely return!
