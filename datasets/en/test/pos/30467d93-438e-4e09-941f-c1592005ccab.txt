Tucked on the western edge of the Foothill Acres neighborhood in North Phoenix or what I would call "The Slope", Try Me Bicycle Shop has been in business for nearly 40 years and has been collecting the odd part for every type of bike over that time. 

The showroom is filled with cruisers and comfort bikes, new and used. No high end bikes here but they do have an inventory of old and hard-to-find parts, good service and free air that makes this place.
