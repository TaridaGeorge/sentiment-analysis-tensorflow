We went here tonight as a family. It was GREAT! Service was fantastic, friendly & welcoming & all the food was very good. I wish I knew all the names of the dishes but they didn't stick in my head. My husband & I had a lemongrass chicken dish on rice - wonderful.   Our son had beef skewers which he devoured & our other son had Shrimp & beef on noodles. It was all delicious & the prices are inexpensive! We'll put this on our places to come back too!
