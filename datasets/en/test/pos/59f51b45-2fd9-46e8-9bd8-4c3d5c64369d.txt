After multiple phases of evolution from Counter Culture/The Downstairs to C.O.L.A.B. and now Conspire...many of these talented individuals have worked together for several years.  This time around I think they have put together the perfect blend of talent, products, location, and control.  Lisa, of Sticker Club Girl, does a great job of organizing and exciting people around her.  And this time these artists have brought in John Sagasta as a partner to bring them amazing coffee and energy.  I enjoy a latte from John on a regular basis and catch up on all the local action, gossip, and hype going on in downtown Phoenix.
