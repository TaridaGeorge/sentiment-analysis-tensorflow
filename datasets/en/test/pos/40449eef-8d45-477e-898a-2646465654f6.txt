I love this Ace.  It is SO much better than the big box chains.  Because people can actually help you when you have a question.  We always go to Ace first, and we are always surprised that we don't have to go anywhere else.  Even though the store is not nearly as large as one of the mega-hardware stores, it stills always seems to carry the little odds and ends you need.  And people in the store know where things are and can give you advice if you don't know exactly what you're looking for.  Definitely go to Ace FIRST!
