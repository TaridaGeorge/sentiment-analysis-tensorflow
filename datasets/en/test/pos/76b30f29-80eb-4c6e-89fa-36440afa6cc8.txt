Very good, reasonably priced, consistent Mediterranean joint.  We've eaten here dozens of times now, mostly at the Shea location but also Fashion Square and Desert Ridge.  Very good baba, hummus, felafel, pizza, veggie burgers, Mediterranean platter, and lentil salad.  Haven't had a thing I would not order again.  Service is good and consistent.  Another good thing about the Shea location is counter space overlooking the kitchen ... always reassuring when the restaurant is willing to expose its practices to diners, and sometimes interesting to see the cooks at work.
