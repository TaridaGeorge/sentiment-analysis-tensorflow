The take care clinic is a life saver!!

Last weekend I was visiting my family for Mother's Day weekend. I stayed 2 nights at a hotel and was attacked by bed bugs. Fortunately, I didn't bring them back to Arizona. Seven days after the initial contact the bites have swelled and become painful. Dr. Lani said my bites became infected due to a bacteria one of the bugs was carrying. GROSS!!!!!! 

I showed up without an appointment and without insurance. An hour later I was seen by the doctor and given 2 prescriptions all for under $150. Thank you Walgreens Take Care Clinic.
