Yes, it's on the Northwest side and its tucked into a non-descript strip mall better known for being the home of Padre Murphy's Sports Bar, but don't let appearances fool you, this is a great gym. The gym offers a large selection of cardio equipment, weight machines, free weights, and group exercise classes. It also has a pool, hot tub, sauna, and steam room. But will really makes this gym special is its kids care facility. It has video games, pop-a-shot, and a giant climbing structure that my kids like so much, they are begging to go to the gym... and it's a lot easier to get a workout done when the kids are excited about going!

Definitely a great find and well worth the drive to the Northwest side.
