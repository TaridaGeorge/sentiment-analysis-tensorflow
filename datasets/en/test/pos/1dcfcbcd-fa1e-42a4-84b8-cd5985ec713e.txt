We went for late night before the band NORTH came on, and the chicken fingers were really great, thick breading and tenderly cooked white meat. The waitresses were awesome, I think Jenn helped us out, she did a really good job. I will be back for both good food and music, which is something I can't say about most places, its usually one or the other. No! Not at Copper Blues, amazing food, feel good music, packed house, energy and noms for this foodie. :-D
