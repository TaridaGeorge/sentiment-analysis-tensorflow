So far, so GOOD! After I was wronged by Seoul Korean Grill, I tried to find another Korean place, failed! Then I turned around to go to Wendy's and it was like the Gods had shone upon me. A Korean restaurant? Right in front of my face? I took directions to another on yelp and it took me back to Seoul! It must have shut down. The tragedy!

So here I am, It looks like a dive bar from the outside and I mosey inside and the waiter is all class! Great sense of humor. Ask for Kyle, he's a swell guy!!!

I'm like starving, and the bimibap arrives in no time! It's great, but a fried egg? Not for me! I was brought out a raw one in seconds with no charge. The tender rib meat was amazing. Mmm... I'll be back.
