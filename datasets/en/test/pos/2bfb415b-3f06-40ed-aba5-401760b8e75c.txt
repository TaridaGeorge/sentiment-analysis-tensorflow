I went to Bikram Yoga Avondale pretty regularly for 3 years...and then I moved to Virginia just last month. Boy. After trying out studios in my new city, I have to say that Avondale is the best studio I've ever been to. The teachers are strong and encouraging, the students are super friendly and the whole vibe of this studio is uplifting. When I come back to AZ to visit, I'd pay double just for the privilege of practicing in this awesome studio. Please don't make me pay double. 
I love the dedication Shelby and John (and the Green girls) give to making this a top-notch place. 
Go here often.
