HTC is:
The cleanest
The safest
The most professional
The most skilled

Dana is my man!  I highly recommend him.  He's so gentle and fun.  Everyone there is incredible, however.  I've been to this location, as well as the 28th ave location, many times over the years for all kinds of piercings-from ears to Christina.  One time I got pierced somewhere else (Tatfu in Flagstaff) and it was a terrible experience (very rude and very little communication about the process or aftercare-thankfully I'm well educated, thanks to HTC).  I don't think I could ever get pierced anywhere but HTC and feel confident about it.  

The only drawback is their somewhat limited jewelry selection, but it just depends on when you go.  

Prices range from moderate to pricey, but you get what you pay for.  

Don't forget to tip!
