On the best days, you'll walk in to the smell of freshly roasting coffee beans, a special blend created by the ever-present owner, Steve Belt.  On the second best days, you'll wonder if it can be any better, and then you'll walk in on one of the best days, where you'll smell the freshly roasting coffee by ... wait, I said that already.

To top off the atmosphere, which is extremely conducive to working, because the music isn't blaring, like some other coffee shop near Indian School and Central (which has its place), the menu is excellent.  Carylann Wooton, a transplant from Liberty Market, created it from scratch, and uses nothing but organic ingredients.  My favorite is the Mediterranean Tuna.

Excellent quality, excellent service.  Prices on food?  A bit more than I'd like to see, but oh so tasty.
