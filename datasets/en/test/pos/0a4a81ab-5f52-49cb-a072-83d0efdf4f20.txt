5 stars for the most comfortable seats in ANY theater I've been.
Another 5 for the film calendar, some really interesting looking flicks.
Beer menu... check, 5 stars.
Now I only saw one film, but the audio/video quality was, well, not so good....  Since it was animation, more than likely it wasn't their fault, so I am sticking with 5 stars and will update after my next viewing.
Great to see indie places like this popping up in PHX.
