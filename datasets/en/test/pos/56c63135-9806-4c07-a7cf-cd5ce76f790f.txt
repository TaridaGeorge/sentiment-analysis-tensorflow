This place is the real frickin deal. I'm going to say this place is better than Roscoe's. I said it. Yes I did. The chicken was the best fried chicken I've ever had and that's coming from someone who loooooves soul food. I aint' talking about no KFC here.. The waffle was definitely tasty with hints of cinnamon. The greens were da booombb..... kool-aid hit the spot on a hot day and the chicken and waffles were amazing on their own.
If i lived in AZ, I would be hitting up this place on a bi-weekly basis.
Wish the place is a bit bigger since the wait to eat is a little long but I heard they're moving to a new location.
