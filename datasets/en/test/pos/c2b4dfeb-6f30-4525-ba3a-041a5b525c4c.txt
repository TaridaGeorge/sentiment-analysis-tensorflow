I was given a box of Fairytale Brownies as a Christmas gift last year.  I had heard of them before so I was excited to try them out.  The packaging was very nice and the entire presentation of the brownies was 1st class.  The brownies themselves were incredible.  Made will all natural items, they melt in your mouth.  My favorite is the carmel swirl. As a plus, you can freeze the individual packets and defrost them for a great treat even months later.  If you give these as a gift, get ready for thanks and praises for months to come!
