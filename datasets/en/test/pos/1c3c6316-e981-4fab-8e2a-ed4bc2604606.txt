This place is amazing!!! 

I walked in and first thing I see is freshly baked chocolate chip cookies coming out of the oven..of course I couldn't resist when offered one!

I ordered 2 tall cafe mocha's with 3 shots (no extra charge) for 2.95 each. 

I have been looking for a local coffee place that makes cafe mocha's that I like better than Starbucks, and this is the place!!

I will never return to Starbucks with this place in the neighborhood!!

I also ordered a lemon blueberry muffin that was also very delicious! 

.......

I came back to this place for lunch, and ordered the Italian sandwich as is....

No more subway or quiznos for me!!

This place is again spectacular!! I will be eating here for lunch a couple times a week most likely!

Love it!
