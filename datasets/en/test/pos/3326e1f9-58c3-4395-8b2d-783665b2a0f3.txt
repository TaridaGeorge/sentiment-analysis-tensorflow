Just a quick review to reiterate how truly great this place is.

They've got soda, lots of soda.  That's right, I said soda! They've got root beer, sarsaparilla, freaky foreign sodas, teas, waters and other things. 

I love this place, I have no complaints. The only thing that would make this place better would be the addition of beer. Man, if these guys hooked up with the dudes that run the beer section of Topps  Liquors it would be unstopable!
