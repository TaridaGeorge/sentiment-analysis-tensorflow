This is a great small family owned bead/jewelry supply store.  The owner, Cathy, is super nice and helpful.  They have great prices on silver and I like that the beads there are different than you find in many of the other bead shops around Phoenix.  A lot of the beads she carries are semi-precious stones at great prices!  She doesn't carry a ton of tools but has some of the basics.  I love stopping in here and try to buy most of my silver from Cathy!
