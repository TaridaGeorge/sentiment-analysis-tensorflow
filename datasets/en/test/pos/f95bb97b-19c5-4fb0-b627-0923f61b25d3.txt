Yes, its true, they are that good. But what do I know about groceries and freshness. Everytime I went there eerything I saw seemed fresh and well, I dont normally buy a whole lot. The place was spick and span and man their selection of natural vitamins was off the hook. Their chai selction was insane too. I never knew that many brands were out there. I like !!

Now only to get them not to look at me strange for walkin in there not wearing spandex and hugging a tree :P
