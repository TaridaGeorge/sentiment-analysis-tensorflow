Loooooove this place! Especially on Mon and Tues when you can get a bottle of wine and bruschetta for $20. Their different types of bruschetta are what make this place amazing. The prosciutto w/ fig; red pepper and goat cheese; and brie w/ apple are my favorites. 
Ambiance is great too. You can walk in dressed up or dressed down and not feel out of place. Lighting is low. Mood is chill. Service is great too.
