I've visited Giant Hamburgers twice in the past month.  Both times I've had a fantastic, tasty, juicy cheeseburger with the works and add two green chilies on top of it all.  The fries are the best I've had since moving to the Phoenix metro area.  Move beyond the strip mall appearance and have a great eating experience.
