Loved this place! Never knew a boxing ring, dance floor, ice cream shop, clothing shop, and restaurant could all be in one bar! 

I was even more pleased to see a Moscow Mule on the drink menu. It only ran me about 7$, but I didn't mind paying it as it came in a MASON JAR - love!! 

Hula Hoops were accessible as a unique dance accessory :)
