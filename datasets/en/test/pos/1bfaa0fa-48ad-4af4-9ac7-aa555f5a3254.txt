6 hours later, I still taste the cheesesteak. That's not nearly as bad as it sounds. 

I had some trepidation about trying it with whiz (white american being my choice), but it turned out to be surprising mild and did not interfere at all with the awesomeness that was the meat and grilled onion taste. Probably better than any cheesesteak I've had since leaving the east coast. 

The fries, very thick cut and skin on are good, but could use a tiny amount of seasoning. The roll, while soft, was basically an afterthought for me. It did fine to sop up some of the grease. 

I understand their burgers are top notch as well, but the cheesesteak was so good I'm going to have trouble breaking away and trying something else. Perhaps one day I'll starve myself and drive over with a bottle of Lipitor and have at it.
