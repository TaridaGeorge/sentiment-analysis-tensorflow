WOOF!!  We were staying at the Hilton and they recommended Zips to us.  Being from CA, we have our fair share of wing places/ sports bars to choose from.   Upon entering it was pretty standard, loud, big screens, games on etc.....BUT there are two things that stood out to us......1) We were served by Serena who served us with a huge smile, knew her beers, and amazingly was happy to help us out...no attitude, no bs...just great service.  2) Her recommendations for golden style wings, sweet potato chips was spot on!  and by the way....ask for a side of the horse radish ranch for the wings.....much much better!  ( zips wings- golden style, Philly steak rolls and a mix base of sweet potato chips/ rings)

The next time we come to Phoenix....Zips will be on our list.
