Top Notch Cardiovascular Care Here! A wonderful aspect of BBHH is the comfortable and spacious visitor waiting areas with coffee, TV and helpful volunteers. The gift shop on the main level is well stocked and if you are lucky, one of the volunteers will be playing the baby grand piano in the lobby! The cafe here is not that great, but for a short walk, you can enjoy the amazing cafeteria at BBMC which is adjacent to BBHH. Also, Dairy Queen and Starbuck's are across the street.
