This place is amazing!! Eric is so great. He will take you on a tour, show you how all of the equipment works, ask you what your fitness goal is and give you a plan!! Machines are fantastic and great for the environment. Even if you're not really into "going green" the place has a great atmosphere. It's not intimidating like some of the other gyms, I felt really comfortable being there. The classes aren't at all crowded so you get alot of one-on-one time if you need it.
Couldn't be happier with Off the Grid!!!
