This place was fantastic! I enjoyed everything about it, the food, the service and the atmosphere.

It was a million degrees outside so I sat inside at the bar. Extremely friendly bartender, friendly locals sitting next to me who totally wanted me to have some of their salad and fabulous food.

I ordered the Grandma's chicken/potato/gorgonzola pizza. It was the St. Louis/flat style. It was to die for. My dining companion had a sandwich. I was told to get the deep dish cookie but, people people, there was no room for cookie. Next time. Had to send the left overs home with the friendly locals sitting next to me. Wow, were they ever so lucky to be sitting next to me that day?
