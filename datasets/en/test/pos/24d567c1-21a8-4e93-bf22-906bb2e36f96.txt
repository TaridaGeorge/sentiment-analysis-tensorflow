Shane's Rib Shack is my go to place for Lunch. You will spend between $7 - $10 dollars unless you go for the ribs. I have had just about everything on the menu. My favorite is the Beef Brisket Sandwich with the beans and a large drink. These sandwiches are huge and sometimes I can't finish them. Their ribs and chicken fingers along with the Big Dad Pork Sandwich are great as well. 

They have all kinds of different barbeque sauces and the staff is friendly and very helpful. They have an outdoor area and just a relaxing place to have a meal.
