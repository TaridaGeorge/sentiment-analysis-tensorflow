Peggy and I ate here for the first time last night, and it was excellent.  Meschelle was our guide through the experience and kept me in ice tea which rates an "excellent" in my book anytime because of the attitude and attention that constant top-offs require.  The baked goat cheese was superb, My pork chop over a smooth silk-like puree of celery and potato was luscious, and Peggy's carrot soup and chicken salad sandwich was exceptional.   The atmosphere is urban comfy and the whole feel of the place is very welcoming.  This is a must go to and we will return!  Dr. B
