I love this place! I have been going to Nu for years (literally, since I was 13) and I love her! She takes such perfect care of my nails, and she does everything you ask with no qualms about it. Sally, the owner, is a sweetheart, and all of the ladies (and Sally's brother!) all work incredibly hard to make everyone leave satisfied!
