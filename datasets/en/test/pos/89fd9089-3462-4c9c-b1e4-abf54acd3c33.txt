The week before I moved away from Arizona, my roommate and I went here to get piercings (not MATCHING piercings, mind you). I went for a Monroe, she went for the upper ear.

This place was super super clean and super helpful. While we were looking through the jewelry, a group of sorority girls came in with some sort of initiation pledge they had to do (like get a guy's sock or something0 and the staff helped good-naturedly...it just stuck with me that they are THAT laid-back and cool.

My friend was really freaked about needles and the piercer was very nice and calm with her.  They gave both of us detailed instructions on how to clean and told us to come back with absolutely any problems. I would totally go back should I make my way to Arizona again!
