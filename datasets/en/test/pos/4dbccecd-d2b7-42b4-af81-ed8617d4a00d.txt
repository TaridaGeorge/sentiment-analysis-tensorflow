I hosted a large conference (100+ people) just this last week. Gold Canyon Resort was not only responsive to our needs, but had some of the best customer/guest service. No request or last-minute change was too big - they were extremely accommodating. 

Meals were excellent, accommodations were great, and everyone provided service with a smile. I would go back over and over again!
