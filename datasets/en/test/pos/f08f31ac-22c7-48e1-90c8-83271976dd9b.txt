Delicious food, incredible service.

Went with a group of six people and all the food ordered was fresh and well prepared.  Some dishes of note were the green curry (ordered medium, nice amount of spice, although not for the meek) and the pad prik khing.  The chili garlic sauce on the latter was delish.  The perfect amount of sweet and spicy. 

The owner was there and made excellent recommendations to those in the party who did not know what to order.  We will certainly go back.

This restaurant compares favorably to Thai Basil, which we also like very much.
