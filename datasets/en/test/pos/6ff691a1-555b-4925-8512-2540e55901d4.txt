I love Postino's!  I guess that is all I really need to say:).  Everyone else pretty well covers the details.  Michael and I come here often... we love the all day happy hour, the food, the wine of course and the service is always excellent.  My latest favorite is the Pub Board but the bruchetta is always awesome too.   The central phoenix location is perfect!
