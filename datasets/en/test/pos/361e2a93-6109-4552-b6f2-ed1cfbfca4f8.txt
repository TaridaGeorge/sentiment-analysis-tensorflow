I can't say enough about this place. The coffee is yummy, the servers are personable and you KNOW the owner cares. I'm a fan of their baked goods and lattes but I'm NUTTY about their Jalapeno Pecan Pancakes (as I see other reviewers have mentioned them too). I dream about them :) 

Imagine amazingly fluffy pancakes, with a little heat and aftertaste of the jalapenos. They are heavy though - mine will last me for two to 3 breakfasts after I take my doggy bag home. 

I traditionally visit in the mornings, but they do have beer tastings and wine tastings at night which tempt me back. The green chile chicken sandwich - also FAB!
