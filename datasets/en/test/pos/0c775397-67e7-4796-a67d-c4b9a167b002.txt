Badda-Boom, Badda-Bing... We have a winner! I used to frequent this establishment in Las Vegas when I lived there, and now, all of a sudden, 17 years later... I work down the street from this place! Yippee for me! Clean well-run, friendly joint, with GREAT sandwiches. Try this place out, and remember... Friends don't let friends eat at Subway.
