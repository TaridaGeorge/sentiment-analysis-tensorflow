Too many people associated with business gathering places have a WIIFM attitude, but that is not the case at Gangplank. They openly share workspace, bandwidth, and collaborative information.
  
In addition, if it's not a school backpack-supplies drive they are having, then it's Toys for Tots or a canned food drive, so they are always giving back to the community. 
 
Good energy, good people, good attitudes and great innovations. 
What a collaboration and a model for many others to copy!
