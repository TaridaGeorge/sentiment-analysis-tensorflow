Jeff P has it all right. I've been going to AABC for a really long time, and they've always been my favorite shop. 

The owners are always up to help you, and the staff is excellent. No matter if I'm in 1 time every 6 months, or every week, Eddie always has my books pulled and he knows my box # by memory. I don't even know my box number.

I've been going to AABC exclusively for years, and I see no reason to change.

Atomic is trying too hard, and they don't care about you. Samurai is good, but not my style. They are great for indie and anime, but I'm a Marvel guy.
