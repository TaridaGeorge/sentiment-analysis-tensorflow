I just moved to Scottsdale and ate dinner here...AMAZING!  Service was great and food was even better.  But be warned, portions are huge!  I ordered an appetizer and the mini version of the mushroom fry, and it was more than enough food.  My mom had the Stetson chopped salad, which we both swooned over.  Oh, and we shared the sweet potato soup, and, had I not been in public, I would've licked the bowl clean.  I'll definitely be returning soon!
