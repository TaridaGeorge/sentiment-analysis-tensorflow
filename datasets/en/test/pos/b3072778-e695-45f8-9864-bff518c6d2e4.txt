There is always something different at Seconds 2 Go since they are getting new things in all the time.  They carry almost everything you would expect to find in a thrift store (furniture, handbags, household goods, shoes, etc.), but I think the biggest find here is the high-end designer women's clothing and shoes.  

The prices are comparable to the other thrift stores in the area and with three other thrift stores (Flo's on 7th, Children's Angel Foundation's Thrift Boutique and Halo) it makes it a must on the route of thrift stores.  

I always find something when I go in here and I'm sure you will too.
