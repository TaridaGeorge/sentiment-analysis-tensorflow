I have been going to Dennis & Randall for two years now; they are AWESOME there!! :D I'm very short... and as usual with short people; I always have to take my clothes to get alterations done and Dennis & his team are very appreciative of all their customers!
I have taken bridesmaid dresses, jeans, skirts...even my workout clothes; I would recommend The Fit 3 for anyone who is looking for great service from people who really care about their customers; they always have a quick turn around for the items taken to get altered. 
Awesome...awesome...awesome!
