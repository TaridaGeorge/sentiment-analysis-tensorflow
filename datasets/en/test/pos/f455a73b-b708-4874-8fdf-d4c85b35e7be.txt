Wow!! Sooo yummy!! First time eating at Smashburger....tastiest Burger I have eaten in many years! 

My husband really liked the skinny fries too...I prefer thick cut fries, so I wasn't too thrilled about them.  BUT...I will go back to SMASHBURGER whenever I want the best burger in town :) You HAVE to check it out! 

P.S...I see in other reviews that the service was rated low....happy to report...the service was extremely good!!!!
