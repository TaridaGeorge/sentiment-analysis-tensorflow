Yum, yum, yum. 

I have put this in my regular rotation for every time I'm in Gilbert.  They have great sandwiches, sides, and burgers and for the most part we have had some fantastic service (my friend has had one or two iffy experiences but mine have all been great)... this past weekend I had one of their burgers of the week which had some white wine grilled onions with Gruyere cheese and it was KILLER, probably my fave burger I've had there.  I've also tried their soups which have been great and their grilled cheese.  The Caprese Pasta Salad is so refreshing and a fave side of mine!
