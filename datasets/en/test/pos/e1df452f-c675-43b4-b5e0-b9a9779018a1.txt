Everything here rocks!  Excellent java...iced or hot and they will give you a roader...I had eggs over medium...cooked perfect with a nice buttery taste, a crazy great piece of grilled turkey...IDK what it was but so darn tasty, fresh fruit and the cranberry toast...oooo I want it now!!!
My mates had choc chip pancakes and they were tasty, fluffy and so yummy!  The home fries were awesome as well...this was a fantabulous foodtastic time!
