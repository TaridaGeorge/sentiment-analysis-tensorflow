This is my second visit to Yen Sushi and I was impressed. They brought us complimentary Miso soup with our meal and because we made it in during Happy Hour (3 PM - 5 PM) we paid only $5 for each sushi roll. We had the Philadelphia roll, the calamari roll, the spicy tuna tempura roll, the salmon tempura roll and the tempura green tea ice cream also $5. 

I was stuffed by the 3rd roll, but very carefully made it through the delicious ice cream! Definitely a treat in 112 degree weather. 

The bill came to $27.08. Very reasonable for all that we ate and the excellent quality and care that was put into our dishes.

I'm going to head back around 8 PM so I can grab a $5 watermelon martini at their 8 PM - close Happy Hour!
