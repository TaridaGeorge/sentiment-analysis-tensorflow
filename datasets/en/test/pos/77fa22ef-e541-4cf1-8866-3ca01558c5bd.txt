I love this place, it is the best Italian in the area and is one of my favorite lunch spots. The sandwiches and pastas are spot on and the service is wonderful. in the modd for dessert? Try the oh-so tasty brownoli - brownie with cannolli filling, it is to die for.

When I visit, I tend to stick with my standby, their solid meatball parm sandwhich. Their meatballs are the best I have had in Arizona and taste wonderful with their homemade mozerella (which you can buy fresh daily).

The owner is generally the man at the counter and he greets you with a solid Chicago Italian hello that makes you feel like you are at the windy city itself, minus the horribly polluted river.

Have no reservations about coming here, you'll love it.
