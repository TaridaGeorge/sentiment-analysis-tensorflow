I've enjoyed doing pilates with Katrina for the past 6 months.  I started pilates with the goal of toning my muscles,  as well as improving my flexibility and mind-body connection.  Katrina has been very patient and encouraging throughout the process.  I've made noticeable gains in the areas I set out to, but have also had the unexpected benefit of reduced lower back pain.  I just read a study by the American Medical Association, which found that stretching does indeed reduce lower back pain.  I haven't changed my routine other than incorporating pilates, which involves a lot of stretching, so I definitely attribute this benefit (as well achieving my other goals) to working with Katrina.  She gets my enthusiastic recommendation!
