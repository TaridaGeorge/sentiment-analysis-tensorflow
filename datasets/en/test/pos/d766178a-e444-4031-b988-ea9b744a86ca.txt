I was in Scottsdale for 6 days and had Oregano's for dinner two of them.  That said, I really loved this joint!  

A friend has been going to Spring Training for a few years now and always comes home raving about Oregano's.  So when my husband and I were in Arizona last week, we had to give it a try.  

Here are my recommendations:
Alfredo in the Dark ----- sooo good!
Cheesy garlic bread
Baked Ziti
Baked Pesto with meatballs --- really awesome and I am not a huge meatball fan either. Everyone was stealing them from me.
Deep Dish pizza
Stuffed Mushrooms

The outdoor seating was great, but as I understand they are moving in a few weeks.  I am sure the next building will be even better.  I really want to remake Alfredo in the Dark at home.  I don't think I can wait until next year.
