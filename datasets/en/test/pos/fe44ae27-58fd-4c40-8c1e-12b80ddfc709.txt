Had a good dinner here at the chef's table a few weeks ago. 

Everything was really flavorful and robust. Talked to the chef partner/owner - he introduced me to their salted butter popcorn gelato - quite different and tasty. 

Another excellent recommendation from the concierge at Marriott Buttes. I'll be going back to Noca again when in AZ.
