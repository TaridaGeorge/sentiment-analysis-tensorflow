Brunchies was recommended by Chandler Regional Hospital Patient Information. I stopped for Chile Relleno breakfast and it was authentic and delicious. Sauce and  beans smothered the relleno with warm tortillas served on the side. I will order same item when I next visit Chandler. The servers were knowledgable and attentive.
