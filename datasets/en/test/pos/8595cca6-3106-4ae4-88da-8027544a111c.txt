Seriously one of my favorite places to eat at any one of the locations around the valley. I think I would eat here weekly if I could. They have awesome food, hummus and tabbouleh never cease to satisfy. I love their salads and the chicken schwarma rocks. The service is always good and the atmosphere is always fun with changing art pieces. The newest tapas/ happy hour is awesome and worth taking advantage of. Simply delicious!
