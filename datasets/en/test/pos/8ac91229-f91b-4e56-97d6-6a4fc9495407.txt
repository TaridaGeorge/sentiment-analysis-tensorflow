I have been renting my Halloween costumes from Mardi Gras for well over 7 years.  Their rental selection is HUGE!  And I can always piece together the outfit I'm doing with no problem.  It is hard to rent from other shops cause I have T&A.  And other rental shops costumes are usually something they've ordered off the internet. 

Mardi Gras' costumes are stage quality.  They rent out to a lot of different High School theater troops and well a lot of theater troops in general. 

The staff is very helpful.  Coreen is a riot!!  And the October rental policy is killer!!  Your rental is for the entire month.  My 1920's Beach Beauty costume I'm picking up next week - $30 rental FOR THE WHOLE MONTH!!  

You definitely get your moneys worth when you rent your Halloween costume from Mardi Gras.  :D
