Breakfast simply doesn't get better than this.  Nice place, great coffee, and their steak and eggs is the best in the Valley.  I've never needed more than my fork to cut my steak.  They have a few different 'benedicts' each of which will take you to a culinary place you'll be glad you visited.  Did I mention how good the coffee is ?      Seriously.
