This place is amazing. It has gorgeous scenery, friendly and efficient service, good food, and a great happy hour. They must do a lot of weddings here because it's provides the beauty of the desert landscape and great space for a ceremony, cocktail, hour and reception, all with the privacy that you would not have getting married at one of the nearby resorts. 

Their happy hour is awesome. $2.00 beers, killer tacos, a great burger. I think we spent $25 for the both of us to eat dinner and have a few drinks. It's a great place to take a date or have a romantic night. We are definitely going back.
