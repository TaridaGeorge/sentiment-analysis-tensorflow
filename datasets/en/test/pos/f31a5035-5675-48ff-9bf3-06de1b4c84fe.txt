Wow! This is one of the best Chinese food places in all of Scottsdale. I have always loved Flo's (on Frank Lloyd Wright), but this might have trumped it. The "house special salad" is freaking incredible, the shrimp spring rolls are packed full of shrimp, the egg drop soup is the best I've ever had (loaded with veggies), and the shrimp fried rice is as good as Flo's. The couple across from us was having Kung Pao beef and string beans, I will be having that next visit. George himself thanked us for coming.

This is a must try if you live in Scottsdale - they also deliver!
