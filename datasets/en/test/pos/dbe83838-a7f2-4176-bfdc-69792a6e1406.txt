My girlfriend, from Texas, knows her BBQ well, and she gave this place 5 stars. I have to agree. Now I've only had "real" Texas BBQ once before, but this place was just amazing. The flavors....oh the flavors. Very clean and comfortable place. The owners are really nice, and they have college football on all the time, you have to love that. Please try....you will go back.
