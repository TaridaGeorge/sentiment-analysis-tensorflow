Don't let looks deceive you. You walk into a small kosher grocery, and in the back is hidden a small, casual restaurant. Their Chinese food is AMAZING! For vegetarians, the Volcano tofu is awesome! I also love a chicken dish with onions in a dark garlic sauce, but don't remember the name of the dish. The chicken meat used in the dishes is moist, tender, and non-fatty. I have been to many restaurants in China, and I like Segal's Chinese food better! :o) The prices are excellent considering the meat is kosher. Great restaurant for non-Jews to try as well; the food tastes better than other non-kosher Chinese restaurants in phoenix.
