We started with the bruschetta..it was phenomenal!  We opted for the "La Noce" pizza.  Probably one of the best pizzas I have ever had.  Lastly, for dessert we had the banana nutella with ice cream. Delicious.  I will definitely be back more sooner than later!!  Oh yeah, did I mention that the atmosphere is adorable!  I cant wait for the weather to become nicer here in Phoenix so I can sit outside on their beautiful patio.  Cibo is my new favorite restaurant.
