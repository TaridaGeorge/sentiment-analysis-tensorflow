If your looking for the best sliders and homemade shakes in Phoenix this is the place to go, if you are from the east coast and you love those little White Castle burgers then this is where you want to go to find the next best thing, along with there chili cheese fries. This place can not be beat. And if your a Chicago fan you will love it the whole place is decorated with Chi-town memorabilia.
