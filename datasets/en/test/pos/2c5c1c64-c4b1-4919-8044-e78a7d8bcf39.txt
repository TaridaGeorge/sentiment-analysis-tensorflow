This is a beautiful preserve in the middle of one of Gilbert's extensively developed residential areas.  It's a great place to hike, bike, or just stroll and enjoy the tranquility and the beauty of nature. A trail system loops around Water Ranch Lake and seven ponds, and the availability of water results in the maintenance of a more lush vegetative community than you would expect in this region. The lake, ponds, and abundance of vegetation also provides habitat for a lot of wildlife, and indeed this is a bird watcher's paradise. There are picnic areas and restrooms, and children can play in the play area or dig for "fossils" in the Dino Dig area. My friend and I are thankful that the preserve allows dogs (as long as they are on a leash) and even provides "mutt mitts" for cleaning up.
