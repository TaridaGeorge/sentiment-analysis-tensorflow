Okay, the staff here is so entertaining, they have great sake and drinks, and live cheesy piano music. plus, the food comes out in like 2 mins. All of this is perfect when people arrive in from the airport on eastern time and they need a fun place with quick service. YAY! It helps that they are right down the street from us and have every kinda chicken you'd like to eat. In addition is also fun to go to the Ranch Market, or stroll in the garden.
