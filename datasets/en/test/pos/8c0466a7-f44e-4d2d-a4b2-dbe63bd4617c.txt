I've been going to My Mother's for as long as I can remember.  I grew up just up the street from it.  I've never had a bad meal there.  The salad bar is always well stocked with a nice variety of items, nothing huge but just the right size for this restaurant.  The roast beef with mashed potatoes, green beans and gravy is excellent.  My son changes around, but usually ends up with the chicken fried steak which he loves.  So what if the decor isn't fancy? I'm going there to eat not pass some interior design test on the place.  They have made it homey and serve absolutely delicious food.  If some of you didn't like it because it wasn't fancy enough for you - don't let the door hit you on the way out and no one will miss you either!
