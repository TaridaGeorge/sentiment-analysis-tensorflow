Billions of books- everywhere! But that's not all, Bookman's will sell pretty much anything, from strange knick-knacks you'd find in your grandma's cupboard to videogames.  This means they'll buy pretty much anything too- but don't take that the wrong way. In theory, they will buy books, cd's, albums, strange knick-knacks etc. but there is no rhyme or reason to what they will actually take. 
If you do get lucky and end up selling some stuff, you'll be given a fair amount for each item, which you can take in trade or cash. 
It can be hard to find what you're looking for because Bookman's is huge, but a little patience goes a long way. 
Books on every subject can be found at discounted prices, so if you like to read, this is your Mecca. 
Make the pilgrimage.
