Delicious!!  Defeintely my favorite pizza place!  I have been eating here for the last 20 years!  It is in an odd area, but "back in the day" it was next to an AMC Theater, so perfect for dinner and a movie.  They still seem to be going strong though.

They have many pizzas to choose from.  Sourdough crust and fresh ingredients (fresh jalepenos).  The jalepeno and sausage is my favorite and you get choose the hotness to your liking from 1-10.  Owners are very friendly too!  Enjoy!
