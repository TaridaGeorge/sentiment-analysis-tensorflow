Just went back yesterday and the meats were spot-on perfect again. The update is for the mac and cheese which is made the way it should be and the way it is in the south - sticky. No creamy sauce or watery mac or breadcrumbs needed. THe pasta sticks together with the cheese in a perfect marriage of this classic dish. Brisket, turkey, mac and they even have the NFL network here if your looking for Thursday night games.
