I grew up on the east coast.  My freshman year in college was all about NY pizza.  Having lived in the Pacific Northwest for the past 11 years, I haven't found much that could compete with NY pizza, so when we moved to Phoenix last week, I  was ecstatic to discover this awesome pizza place just down the street from my new house.  Evocative of the corner pizza joints found both in NYC and outlying towns, the pizza is authentic, from the perfect crust, to the large slices and toppings, to great prices. My  family  may single-handedly keep this place in business.
