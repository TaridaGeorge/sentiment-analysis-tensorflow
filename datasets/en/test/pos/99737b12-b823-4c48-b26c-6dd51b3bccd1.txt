I recently ate at the Deli for the first time and I will definitely be going back !  The food and service was great !  I ordered a club sandwich which was one of the best I have ever had.  My girlfriend ordered meatloaf and loved it from the first bite.  She even asked the waiter for a hint at the recipe,  but was denied.   =)
If you are looking for GOOD food in the Queen Creek area,  this is the place to go.
