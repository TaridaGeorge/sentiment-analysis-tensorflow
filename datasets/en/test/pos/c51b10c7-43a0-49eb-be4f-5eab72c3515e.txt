Janet was a god send for my wedding! We bought all the bridesmaids dresses well in advance, well months after they were ordered we found out my sister, the MOH would be 6 months pregnant, super exciting but how would she fir in her mermaid dress!?!?! Janet to the rescue, we had a standing appointment for THREE DAYS before my wedding, my sister went in and Janet worked her magic! My sister looked amazing! 

I've sent numerous friends to Janet and all have had fantastic experiences. Janet is so friendly, she felt like a long lost aunt or something. 

Do not hesitate to use her
