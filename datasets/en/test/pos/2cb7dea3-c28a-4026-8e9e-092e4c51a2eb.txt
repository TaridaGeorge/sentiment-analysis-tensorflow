Where else can  you get yogurt with BAKLAVA as a topping option?

This Yogurtology is super clean and very bright.  The young staff are very well spoken, friendly and helpful.  The flavors change regularly, and the toppings bar is the best in town.  They also have hot caramel, hot fudge and WHIPPED CREAM if you ask!

I come here with the kids about once a week~ it's a favorite location for yogurt.
