I heart this place.  Always busy; never a line and professional, courteous servers AND hostesses--I would say you rarely get that combination!  I recommend the Brussels spouts and the sausage pizza--you could probably split a pizza between two people but you wouldn't want to.  

Like most lunch places on the Camelback/24th Street area it can get busy at noon.  I recommend going around 11:30 to beat the rush.
