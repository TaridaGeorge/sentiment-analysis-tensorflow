Ok, so Phoenix has no great Chicago pizza, no good Chicago hot dogs and I haven't found a place that has an even passable Chicago beef, but it does have one thing Chicago doesn't-  In N Out.  

The one I was at is in Tempe, but I'm too lazy to add it.   They're all over the place, I'm sure you've seen them.
