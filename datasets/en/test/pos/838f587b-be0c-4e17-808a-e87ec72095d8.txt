Best Martinis in the entire valley!  Maybe even the world!  Yes they are $13 each, but you can't drink more than two without stumbling out of this place.  

My favorite drinks are: 
- Side Car (sweet and tastes harmless, but Wow!)
- English Garden (those who don't like it sweet)
- Absinthe (for artists)
- Chimay (the big bottle for beer snobs)

The Food is just as good.  I almost never order anything beside the signature sandwich, the AZ88 Chicken sandwich.

The crowd is the most diverse in the valley too.  Always well dressed, there are gay and lesbians, hot dates, groups of friends and even 60 year old people and an occasion child.  

Usually great art.  I wish they would change it little more often, but is thought provoking and fun.

I am a regular.  I am here at least once month.
