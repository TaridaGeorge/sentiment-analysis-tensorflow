I can't speak for everybody on staff, but my guy, Mike, is Picasso with the shears.  He is methodical and precise, and always knows how to interpret my failed attempts at describing what I want my hair to look like.  The guy is simply skilled.  It's a $20 haircut - which includes neck shave, shoulder massage, and face steaming.  

I always leave here feeling refreshed and ready to take on the world - what more can you ask from your barber?
