Hands down the best burger you can get for under $20
The place smells Holy Amazing when you come through the door!
The burgers are incredible but you dont feel like you just ate a brick for lunch when your done.
They basically give you 5 orders of fries when you ask for them and I recommend the seasoned ones.
