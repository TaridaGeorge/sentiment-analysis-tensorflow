LOVE Lee's! First discovered it a few years ago walking through Old Town after dinner and stopped in... let me tell you, one of the BEST decisions I've ever made walking through Old Town! It is not overpoweringly alcoholic, but you can definitely taste it in there! They also have some non-alcoholic flavors in case you bring kids or just don't feel like having the alcoholic ice cream (although I highly suggest trying at least one of the flavors!) I have never tried a bad flavor here, in fact each time it is hard to decide on which flavor I want! I have brought many people here. 

The service also deserves and A++, so helpful and friendly ! I tell everyone to go here whenever they are in the area! Also a good "pre-game" for between dinner and going out in the area :)
