My friend Michael invited me as his guest to last night's session with Serina and I am so glad I committed. I got one heck of a workout and enjoyed every minuet of it. The studio is well kept, music was awesome and the instructor was an absolute sweetheart. Her positive energy was contagious; she connected with the class and kept the momentum going for the full hour.

I bought the package deal and I can't wait to "burn-off" through my 20 classes. WEPA!
