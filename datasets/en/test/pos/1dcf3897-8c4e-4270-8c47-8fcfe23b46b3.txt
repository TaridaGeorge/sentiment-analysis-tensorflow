Met a friend for brunch and about died over how good it was. All you need to know is the following:

1. You can get a pitcher of Pimm's Cup. A pitcher.
2. Best Eggs Benedict since the old El Chorro on Lincoln. No offense to the new El Chorro, I just stopped going after you stomped all over your history with the remodel.
3. Griddled Church Potatoes

I am in LOVE with Windsor. Probably going to eat there so much it gets weird.
