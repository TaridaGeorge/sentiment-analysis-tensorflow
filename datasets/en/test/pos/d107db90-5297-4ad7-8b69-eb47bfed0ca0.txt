OMG OMG! We got to finally come here and let me tell you they have a customer for life! I ordered the bruschetta plate (warm artichoke spread and tomato jam with sheeps milk cheese were like heaven in my mouth) the tomato jam tastes like Christmas! Haha! My husband got the BLT panini and I got cheddar potato soup, all of which were amazing too! The service was amazing! This place really has it together. The only thing I wish they had was a couple higher dollar wines. The wines they have are fair. I would like to see a Justin or Duckhorn on their menu for those that want some extraordinary wine! But of course that will not stop me from going back! My mouth is watering thinking about the next time!
