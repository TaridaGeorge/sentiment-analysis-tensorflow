Love this place!!! Went there for lunch and George the owner made our Greek salad and Southwest Sandwhich. It was amazing!!! Even their ice tea was yummy!  When we were about done eating George came over to our table and asked us how the food was...and he was real friendly.  I would definitely go back there again and maybe see how their breakfast menu is like.
