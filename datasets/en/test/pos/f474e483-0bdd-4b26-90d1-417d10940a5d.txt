My business partner and I went into Eddie Chans Asian Bistro last night for a dinner business meeting. This was like my 5th trip in Eddie's.

We had the Orange Chicken and the Mongolian Beef. And I can tell you folks.... this was no flippin' Panda Express! The chicken in the orange Chicken was sliced so thin, which makes it incredible crispy when done up in the orange chicken sauces. 

The Mongolian Beef was equally tasty. It was such a pleasant surprise. 

Eddie Chan also took the time to come by and check on us. I love when owner/operators do this. It means they care!

I can't wait to go back!
