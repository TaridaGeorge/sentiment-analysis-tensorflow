I need to stop the insanity.  I get these e-mails telling me I get additional 30% off, NOOOOOO, I can't pass up that offer.  What do I do?  Get in the car and drive 25 miles each way and get more stuff.  I am obsessed with this store.  I got sunglasses, a new wallet, a cross body purse and a pair of flip flops.  I guess I need to unsubscribe from those e-mails.  At least I didn't pay full price.  This is how I rationalized my purchase.
