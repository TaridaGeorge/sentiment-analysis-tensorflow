This little place is quaint and romantic with excellent food. I recommend any of the deserts. Perfect place for outdoor dining during the cooler time of the year and don't worry they have heaters too during the winter months. The wine selection is fabulous, and this is not just a place for dinner. I had my first lunch here with a best friend who works in the downtown area. It's a great place to stop in and have a bite at lunch.
