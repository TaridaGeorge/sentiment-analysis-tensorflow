I've played well over 40 of the Golf Magazine Top 100 courses in the US. We're lucky to have many of them here right in our backyard. This course stands out! Exemplary service, and the driving range is the best I've ever seen.

The course is tough. No country club rolls here. Hit it right or left and you're undoubtedly taking a drop, and a stroke.

Can't wait to get back for my next round!
