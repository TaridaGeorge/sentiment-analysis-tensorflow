Went there today for the first time and was impressed!!!  It's really lovely inside, very spacious - couches, tables, and a side room with big tables where you can sit and do work with books, a laptop, etc.  The decor is also really lovely.

I also think their menu is fabulous. While I've only been there once and can't speak to the quality of all the items listed, my friend had a tea she enjoyed, a panini that she said was delicious; and I had the side salad that was excellent for only $4.99.  They are also giving away free donuts with purchase to promote their opening and I thought it was very tasty.

Their menu includes salads, sandwiches, paninis, deserts/pastries/donuts and coffee/espresso.  

I will definitely go back - great location, lovely inside, and a great offering of foods.
