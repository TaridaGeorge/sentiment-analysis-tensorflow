Im updating my score for JJ's because well, um, uh... Im bias as hell!

When I first moved here to AZ, I spent a ton of time in this place and even moonlighted for awhile as the friday night karaoke host.  I made tons of friends here and the owners and staff always treated me like I was family.  The guys in the kitchen always would make special requests for me, and the girls would sometimes let me come behind the bar and bartend for kicks when I wasnt  hosting karoke.

Now will they do this for you.... most likely absolutely not.  But the owner just updated and renovated the place and it is looking good and I guarantee it is still fun as hell.  

I made quite a few friends and lovers in this place and it is legendary in my mind...
