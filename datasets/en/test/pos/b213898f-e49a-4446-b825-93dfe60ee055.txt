If you're headed to Scottsdale and looking to play some golf make a trip out to Quintero Golf and Country Club. This course is a little ways off the beaten track but it will be an experience you'll remember. (Temporary clubhouse only). 

This course is semi-private and if you're not a member you need to buy a "Troon card" to be able to make a tee time. Worth every penny though because it is rated in the"top 100" courses in America and truly a remarkable golf experience.
