i love this boutique! i originally found it while visting my friend in chicago. after returning home i visited the web site to realize we had 5 locations here in phoenix! i was so floored i ran right over to the one at 67th and beardsly. All locations are awesome, but my fave so far is northern. its much larger than the one on 67th with great sales and a very heplful friendly staff ( both locations do). This is now my go to shop!
