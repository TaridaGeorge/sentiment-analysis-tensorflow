THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! The staff was courteous and attentive! We went in for some final touches for our Halloween costumes found more than expected. We shopped on a Saturday evening which seemed to be a very busy day, however the staff walked around showed each customer priority. The prices are not overly inflated and the selection is AMAZING! We can't wait to go back!
