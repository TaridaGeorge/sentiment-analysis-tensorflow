Amazing!  What an incredible first time to a place wonderfully run by an old friend!  Peg and I dropped in tonight (early enough so that we could savor the friendship of Bernie and Gina) and had an amazing meal.  Pork belly pastrami appetizer, the traditional chopped salad, and creative main courses of the scallops/grits and meatloaf/yukon gold potato. Of course, the pecan nut bars were an emphatic end to one of the best meals that we have had. It is so  nice to see gracious people excel at what they do, and this is one of the best ever.  We will return and bring friends!!   Love you guys!!
