Call me a communist, but I love sharing books, music and movies. I am ALWAYS at this library either wandering aimlessly for hours or running in to pick up great items on hold.  

Scottsdale is really lucky that a lot of it's taxes get thrown to the public library system, especially when most libraries are reducing staff and operational hours. Even their website is great, highlighting a ton of literary collections you might not think of.  For instance, they are supporting local authors with their "Read Local" promotion, and this week the site has a selection of Banned Books that are must-reads! 

Also check out the website for an endless stream of events and programs including writing workshops, book clubs, and even free entrepreneurial business seminars! 

Libraries make paying taxes worthwhile.
