Now at Town and Country, a whole new Rack to entice me into spending money.  Stopped by for the grand opening today and I can only hope they keep the place as nicely organized as it currently is.  Same quality as you'd expect from Nordstrom, great selection, and generally 1/3 to 1/2 the price.  No complaints.  None at all.
