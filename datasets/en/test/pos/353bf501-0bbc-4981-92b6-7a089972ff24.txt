Honestly, this might not have been my first call ex ante as it seems like a place for a slightly younger crowd, but my dear love insisted that she needed a Dr Funk after the afternoons activities and so we went for an early dinner. We had a delightful time on the patio-ceviche, poke and butterfish were absolutely lovely as were the Dr Funks which seemed to have the desired effect, and I had a great view for the whole meal. I will definitely be back to this wonderful place.
