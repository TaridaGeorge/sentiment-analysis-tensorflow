I wasn't sure what to expect when I first went to Solo. It has a very relaxed atmosphere with a nice comfy velvet couch. They have some pretty cool local art hanging on the walls, some of the art in Solo is created by the owner, from what i understand. The first night I went, there was live music. We lucked out and got there pretty early so we were able to get a seat on the couch before it got crowded. The staff is very friendly and helpful. One employee, Bradley, is always cheery and willing to help out. If you're in the mood for something different, you can ask him to make up one of his custom tea combinations. Delicious and always a nice surprise. This is a very cool place to go.
