My left front tire looked a little low, so I stopped by to have them check it. It was right at 6:00 PM and the sign on the door said they closed at 6:00.  I went in and the guy behind the counter asked what I needed and he went out and checked all four tires.  He recommended we add a little air. He did that. 

He did not ask if I had bought my tires there, which I actually had, or if I was already a customer.  

Great customer service.  This is why I will always go to Discount Tire.  Their employees understand how to take care of customers and keep them coming back. 

Excellent job!
