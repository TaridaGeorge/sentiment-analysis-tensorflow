Both Ben (age 13) and Corinne (age 56) enjoyed the entire experience, from the beverage with the marble to the Chicken & Duck tapas as well as the mini egg rolls floating in a glass of salad/ noodles!  

Presentation was unique AND understated. 

Mr. Chu explained the beverage's unusual format and its inspiration.

Sauces were entirely delectable and I am an avowed "sauce hater".  

Truly a memorable dining experience!  

Tasty and upscale but NOT snobby and superior!
