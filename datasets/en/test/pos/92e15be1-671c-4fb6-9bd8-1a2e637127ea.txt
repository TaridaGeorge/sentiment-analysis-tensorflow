2 things in this life I cannot stand it is Parmesan cheese and fish. I walked in one day excited to try something different. I ordered garlic pepper wings. I was served garlic parmesan by accident. Thank God that happened. They were delicious. On a second visit, I invited friends to join. One of them ordered catfish. They asked me to try it, which I replied no. After a while, peer pressure cracked me. Let's just say, next time I will be asking for their order of catfish... 14 flavors of wings, topped off with a side order of honey biscuits. Can't beat it! Thanks Mike for bringing ATL to the area!!!
