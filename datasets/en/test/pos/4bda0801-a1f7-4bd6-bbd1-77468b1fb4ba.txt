Awesome service, and really great prices.

We just bought our first house, and knew that we needed wires run, and other odds and ends done.  They came over, crawled around our crawl space... hung our chandelier.... and POOF!  Now our house is all electrizied!

A friend referred us to Good Guys, and they really knew their stuff.  Loved them.
