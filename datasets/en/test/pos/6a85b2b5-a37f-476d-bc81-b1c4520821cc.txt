This place is clean and Big a bit confusing but definitely different from the last time I flew out of here 6yrs ago! They did a great job with how everything is arranged here I think my favorite was the Baggage Claim - it reminded me of Vegas!! The fact that the Car Rental place has its own Garage and is organized so well says a lot!
