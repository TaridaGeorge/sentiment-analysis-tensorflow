I'm going to guess that at least a quarter of my closet is from this Kohl's location. Every time I stop in even if I just want to browse I can't help but find amazing deals. Yesterday I picked up a dress, two shirts, and a pair of shoes all for $25. That's cheaper than most shirts are at certain female clothing store (and after you wash them once start to come apart!) 

There are so many racks to go through, and sometimes it takes awhile especially if you try your choices on. But soooo worth it when you go home knowing you have a few new outfits and you didn't even have to break the bank.
