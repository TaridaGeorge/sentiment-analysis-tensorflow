I love Cartel. The coffee is awesome and the employees are almost always friendly. Do they have their bad days? Sure, but so does everyone.

I've noticed that most of the people complaining or leaving negative (or less positive) reviews are doing so because of the clientele. How immature. Let's stick to reviewing the venue and the product, not whether you like the patrons. If some patron doesn't like a frappuccino and says so to the barista, who really gives two flying pigs? Everyone is entitled to their opinion. My recommendation is to try to be a little less insecure and consider the impact your review will have on the actual business and the people that put their blood, sweat and tears into it, before you start taking away points because a certain part of society seeks out novelty and enjoys well made things. 

Just my two cents.
