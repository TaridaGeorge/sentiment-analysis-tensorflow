I've been going to The Keg for what I believe to be the last five years or so and I flat out love the place. It's about a ten minute drive from home and I go there to eat at least four times a month. I've always found the service to be good and the food great. My nephews and I have tried various items on the menu and have found them all to be exceptional. We have always been pleased with the size of the portions served of any and all dishes we have tried. The main reason that I like The Keg is the staff pure and simple, very attractive women. Which makes the food taste even better and the drinks even stronger! Overall, The Keg is a good place for any occasion and I'll be going there tonight!
