This place gets 5 stars for their 8 sand volleyball courts, which are lit up at night until around 11pm (or later if you're playing with someone who works there).

Supposedly you have to pay a $2 entrance fee at the gate sometimes, but there was no one charging admission there tonight.

They also have baseball/softball, batting cages (pay per use), and a bar/lounge area.

Great place to play some volleyball at night during the hot Arizona summer.
