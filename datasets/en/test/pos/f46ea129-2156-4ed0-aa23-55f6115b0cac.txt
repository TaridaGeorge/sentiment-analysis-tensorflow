I am so surprised no one has rated this place. Pastor Lee's messages always have a profound relevancy to life and the current issues my husband and I are facing. We moved away from Arizona over 4 years ago, yet I still miss this church tremendously. (I did recently discover the ability to listen to the sermons online... thank you Radiant!) Oh, and it certainly can be said we laugh always with the light spirit in which Pastor Lee conveys the word! He is funny, and up-to-date with technology and the times. So very grateful for that!

God bless the Radiant pastors and community!
