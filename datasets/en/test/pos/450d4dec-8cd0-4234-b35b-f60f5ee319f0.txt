I should probably eat here a few more times before giving it a full 5 stars, but 4 stars wouldn't express my enthusiasm enough.  Their sangria is awesome. Their servers have all been amazing. The biscuits and gravy are spectacular, and the hangover sandwich is filling but also amazing. I haven't tried the lunch menu, so I'll be back.  The hostess wasn't the most helpful with trying to get a group of 5 on the patio, but it was probably due to my own uncertainty of where we wanted to sit. Give this place a try for hanging out on the patio or for a good breakfast spot in Old Town.
