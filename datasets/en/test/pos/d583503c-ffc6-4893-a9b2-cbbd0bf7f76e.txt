Grew up on Mike and Rondas in Flagstaff.  Its awesome to have one here where I live now.    I cant really tell you about anything there but the Steak Strips with Eggs meal, because thats all I ever get.  I'm addicted to it.

I'm a simple guy that doesnt care for the frills, just a place to sit, a clean table and good service.  If you want real food cooked with plenty of love, this is your place to eat.
