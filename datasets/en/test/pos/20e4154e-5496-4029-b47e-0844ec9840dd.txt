Not that I can add anything more to what has already been said, but this place rocks. High caliber people running the show and working there. Always great stuff coming from the kitchen and the coffee pots. I have never had anything bad here. It is added bonus that these people are the bright spot in a City North that desperately needed something good to overshadow the lame (especially across the street). 

Their special events are a must. I must note that I have never been to an event there, but given that everything these peeps touch glosses over with gold,  I believe my fellow yelpers are raving about. Kudos to you Press. I love you.
