This place is awesome on all accounts. I went there today with my wife for lunch and we were both very pleased. They have a good sized menu with a lot different styles of food. I had the General Tso's Chicken, and my wife, the Curry Chicken. Both were great, and reasonably priced. It was less then $20 for the both of us. The service was also excellent. Not only are the staff very friendly, but we had our food in less than ten minutes. I will be going there again, maybe tomorrow.
