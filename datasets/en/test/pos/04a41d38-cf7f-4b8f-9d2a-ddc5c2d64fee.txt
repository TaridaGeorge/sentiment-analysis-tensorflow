I have been a loyal customer of Exclusively Men's for 6 years. Sam's focus is on customer service & this emphasis is what keeps me coming back. This is a family run business with the look of all the V but NONE of the attitude.  I tried the Royal Shave today for the first time & I am hooked. I recommend this Barber Shop/Spa to everyone. See you next week Sam.
