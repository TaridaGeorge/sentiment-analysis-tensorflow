I'm from Texas, so I know GOOD southern food.  I can't stress enough HOW AUTHENTIC and utterly AMAZING this place is.  The family who owns this and all their employees are the SWEETEST people. I use to work in the service industry for a long while and it's hard to come by waiters who are sincerely nice.  Best service I've EVER had and AMAZING AMAZING food. The Sweet Tea is the REAL DEAL.  The atmosphere: Feels like I'm eating at my mom place, relaxed, friendly; like I'm back in Texas.  PLEASE I URGE you, go to Lo-Lo's!
