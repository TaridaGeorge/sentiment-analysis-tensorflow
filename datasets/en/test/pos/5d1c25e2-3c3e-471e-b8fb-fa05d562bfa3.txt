I am a sushi fan. We visit family in the Pheonix area a few times a year and now go to Celsius every time we go. The sushi is great!!. We ask the sushi chef to make us something special and he (Joe) always makes us an amazing assortment of sushi.  He makes sushi that we never tried before with varieties that we have not found in any other sushi restaurants.  Next time, I will take pictures. A very, very creative chef. It is a shame that we don't have a sushi bar like this in the bay area. It would  be awesome. Yum.
