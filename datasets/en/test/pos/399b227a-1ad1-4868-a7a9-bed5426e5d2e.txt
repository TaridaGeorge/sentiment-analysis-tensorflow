We came here today for Lauren Conrad's book signing. There were a TON of people there and they managed it very well. It only took an hour to get through the line and get the autograph. The staff was calm, collected, and friendly. They didn't seem to get frazzled by the hundreds of screaming and squealing teenage girls. We had to purchase one of her books to get her autograph which wasn't a problem to me because that's the only way the store will make a profit.

As for the store itself, just looking around I was pleasantly surprised. The prices were really affordable and you can sell your used books back here. They also have a great selection. I really liked the atmosphere as well. I will definitely go back here again for another signing or just to buy some literature!
