Delicious!!!  The Burrata and the gnocchi were incredible!  You HAVE to try the pasta trio- it gives you a little taste of everything- and I strongly recommend ditching your diet and going for a meatball...or two.

Classy restaurant, great atmosphere, awesome food and outdoor seating!  What more could a girl ask for?  I guess, someone to pay the bill...
