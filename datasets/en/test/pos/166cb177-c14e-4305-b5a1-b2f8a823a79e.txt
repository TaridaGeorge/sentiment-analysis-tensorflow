Oh happiness, a Chicago treasure just opened on Fifth Avenue in Old Town Scottsdale. Five of us meandered over to it after our happy hour dinner at Fifth and Wine. I tasted five flavors (including Macinak Island Fudge, a treat from my childhood), and finally decided on Caramel Ripple. Yum. Friendly staff and a casual old fashioned ice cream parlor ambience with a tin ceiling and a chandelier had us talking about returning.
