Absolute FAVORITE breakfast spot in Old Town Scottsdale. The food is great, service is wonderful. Try the black forest ham omelet--my favorite thing so far. Every waitress that we've had has been so attentive. Every outrageous request that we've made has been done. If there's a line when you get there, it's worth the wait.
