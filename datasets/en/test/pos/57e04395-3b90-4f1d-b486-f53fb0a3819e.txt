I am an out of tower in dire need of a haircut. Not only did I get a great haircut, but I got insanely good service. This is a family run store that treats you like a king.
Haircut, shampoo(so I didn't have a scratchy neck), lemonade/water while I waited, and a great conversation. All for 15$. If I lived here, this would be my goto haircut place. They also recommended a great place to eat.

Only disappointment is they don't do shaves.
