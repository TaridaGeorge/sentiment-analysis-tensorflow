I'm a thirty-something mom and LOVE this store.  I wish I'd know about it from the moment it opened.  I have such a hard time finding good fitting jeans.  The sales staff and owners were extremely friendly and attentive to my needs.  They helped me find just what I was looking for.  Ladies...look no further...this boutique has is all!  Whether you need something for date night, work, or just for fun, you've got to check out MOMBOMB!  and BRING YOUR FRIENDS!!
