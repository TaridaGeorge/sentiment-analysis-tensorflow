Rosati's has the best pizza on the globe! This is the best Chicago style deep dish or thin crust I've ever had. Please do not listen to the other false reviews about Rosati's because they work for other pizza restaurants! Also, this is the only pizza restaurant I have found that has the combination sandwich on the menu! I went to the new Chicago pizza close by and they didn't even know what a combination sandwich was! 

If you want the best pizza! Proceed to a ROSATI's location asap!!!!
