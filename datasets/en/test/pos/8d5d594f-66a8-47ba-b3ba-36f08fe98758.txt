Good food at a decent price. Cold beer. Hot girls working there. Friendly and helpful staff. Plenty of TV's to catch the game.

I've been going there since about when it opened. From San Diego, but always make it a point to visit.

Try the Mac and Cheese or the peanut butter and bacon burger. Awesome.
