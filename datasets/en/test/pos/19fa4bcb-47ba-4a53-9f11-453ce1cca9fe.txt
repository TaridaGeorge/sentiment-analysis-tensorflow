The best massaman (sp?) curry I've ever had, and I've had a lot. And great pad thai as well. However, as a spice wimp, I asked for my dish as mild as possible, yet tons of red flakes peeked out from the noodles. There are only a few foods I am willing to suffer for, and the yellow curry was one of them, but I just don't get why so many cooks equate "not spicy" with "bland." The dishes were plenty tasty by themselves; next time I go I will either have to order it "bland" or bring a fire extinguisher.
