I have four gorgeous mutts---all shapes and sizes!  Michelle absolutely captured each of them invidually, as well as all of us together!  I had been wanting to have pics with my girls taken for years and finally did it!!!  
Michelle came to the house and did an amazing job!  We actually took a picture in the bathtub and she made it look like we were all in a sleigh!  EVERYONE I have showed them to absolutely adore them!  I plan to use Cow Dreamz in the future --not sure where or when, but I will!  These pictures made many people happy! (not to mention...ME!!)  Thanks Michelle for a great experience - - for my furry babies and their Mommy too!
