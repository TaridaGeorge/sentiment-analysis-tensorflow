I highly recommend this hike to anyone in the Phoenix, AZ area. My bf and his parents all joined me on this hike. We had beautiful views of the Superstition Mountains. There were cactus plants everywhere. We decided to start the hike a little later, so we can watch the sunset. The sunset definitely had a great contrast with the mountains.
