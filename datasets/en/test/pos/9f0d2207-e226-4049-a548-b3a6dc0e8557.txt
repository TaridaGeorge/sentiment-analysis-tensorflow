Great old-school barber shop!  I've been going here for several years and always get a great cut!  Unlike some shops that change personnel frequently, these folks have been cutting hair in this shop for years, and they are all good!  They have the skills to cut your hair any way you want.  They are all friendly, and the flat screen TV's are fun to watch while you relax.  Lot's of history in this shop--get to know Mr. Nash and he'll tell you some great stories.  This is small business at it's best--finest guy's shop I've ever seen!  Mike
