I love this place, especially because it's on my way home from the train. Good quality food (that I couldn't easily make myself) for perfectly reasonable prices. I don't buy meat at the grocery store so if I need an entree I can stop off and easily supplement my veggie/pasta basics with something unique and tasty. 

When I went in the staff was super friendly, even when I got a little indulgent and over-sampled. Yum yum!
