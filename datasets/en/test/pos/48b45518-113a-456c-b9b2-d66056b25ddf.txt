This place reminds me a lot of The Vig, modern atmosphere with good looking people inside.  The parking to my surpise was plentiful and easy to get in and out even though the place was packed.  As this is within walking distance, I will deem it my new favorite Pizza Place.

Now on to the food, the menu is affordable, not cheap, I like the cheese and meat boards concept, although I realize when they say hard cheese, they mean HARD cheese, next time I'll go do something a bit softer.  The Peach and Gorgonzola special of the night was a fantastic parring for my Summer Ale.  I look forward to being back for many more samplings.
