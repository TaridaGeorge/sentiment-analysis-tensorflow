The best store for produce - I haven't found better prices and quality at any other store - ever.

The meat department is really good with an extremely helpful staff. The do have a fresh catch of the day but some of the fish is frozen and thawed. Not that this is a bad thing. The butcher will do special cuts if you go in during normal business hours. 

If you want to save a ton of money, buy all your produce at Sprouts. Stay away from all the chain grocery stores.
