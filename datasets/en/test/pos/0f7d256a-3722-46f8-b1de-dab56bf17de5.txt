Phoenix Comicon 2011 and 2012 were a smashing success. I really hope to see them utilize the Yelp outlet for 2013. 

Having the cast of Star Trek TNG there along with Jon Bernthal from the Walking dead was an absolute treat. There are so many talented artists at these conventions, board gaming, manga, cosplay, video gaming and enough panels that there is no way you can be at them all.

Highly HIGHLY recommended as an event to come to Phoenix for!
