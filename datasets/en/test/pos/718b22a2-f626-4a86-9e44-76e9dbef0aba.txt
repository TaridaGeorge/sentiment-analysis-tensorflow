One of my buddies and I have been hitting up the Short Leash since early November, every Friday in fact. We missed Christmas and New Years day because the food truck court was closed on the holidays, the horror.

The owners are two of the most awesome people ever. They have remembered my name since the 2nd visit and since I'm a creature of habit I don't even have to tell him what I want, he just writes it down.

My favorite combination is a beer-hot dog with the siracha sauce, all 3 cheeses, and toss in a healthy sample of the cilantro. I'm going to lobby for including it on the menu having it named "Dakota" after my Bullmastiff.

Every single person I have taken to Short Leash loves it (over 20 now), and they always return for more.
