Great pizzas, reasonably priced bottles of wine, and a decent ambiance rates this 5 stars for us. We've never sat at the bar. Other tables are smallish and close together, but the overall ambient noise makes it feel more private.

The duck pizza was rich--a real treat. Anything with sausage was really flavorful.

Being on the older, uncooler side of things, we tend to hit Parlor early in the night, since by 8pm there's a line out the door, and it's populated by the, ahem, "Scottsdale" crowd. 

Be prepared to valet.
