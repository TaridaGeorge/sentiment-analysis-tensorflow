Went here for lunch today and I was very impressed. I tagged long with some others who go here very often, and I ordered the Southwest Sandwich. I don't think I've had that good of sandwich before. The best part was definitely the chili mayo they had on it, but the whole sandwich was absolutely delicious.

Not to mention, the guy who I believe is the owner, was very nice and friendly. Great service, great food.
