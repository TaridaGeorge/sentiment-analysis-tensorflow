I have been very dissapointed lately in the quality of the Meixican food restaurants we have visited.  However, being late to find Ajo Al's on Shea just past Scottsdale Rd, i"m happy to say i have found one of the best mexican restaurants around.  We have only been there once, for to go.  But already want to go back.  Just the most flavorable meal.  And the same with our leftovers the next day.  If you have not been do yourself a favour and give it a try.  A little hidden off Shea in the Agua Caliente center.  May be a diet buster, but come on.  Your looking for some good mexican food for a reason!!!
