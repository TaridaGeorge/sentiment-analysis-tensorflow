Southern food doesn't get any better than this. Comfort food at it's best!!! Went with my friend for dinner on MLK day... and who knew waffles and chicken go so well together. Don't get me started on the cool aid... Brought me back to when I was a kid with a red stained mouth after a big gulp if red sugary deliciousness! Highly recommend getting one of their many sides, especially their okra! 

This place is always busy, more so on the weekends. Work the wait in line :)
