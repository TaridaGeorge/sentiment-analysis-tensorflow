This place was a pleasant surprise!  We are vegetarian and found a lot of choices on the menu. The veggie spring rolls are awesome, vegetable tempura also very good. Everything we ate was exceptional, including the veggie roll sushi. I was also impressed that their house sake, on happy hour, was actually good tasting. I was used to places using cheap tasting sake. Again, another pleasant surprise. We are happy to have found this place and will be back!
