Food was amazing! Service was friendly and quick. We ate the pineapple fried rice with pork (#85) and the pineapple coconut curry and both were excellent. Don't forget the thai iced tea!

Oh yeah, prices were reasonable. One entree can easily serve two people or provide good leftovers and ranged from $8-12.
