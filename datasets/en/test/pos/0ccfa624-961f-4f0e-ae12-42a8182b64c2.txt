It was a perfect way for me to start the weekend.  Jen, my massage therapist, was fantastic.  She did a quick consultation before the session, asked me my preferences, my daily routine, and any impact areas.  First couple of minutes into the massage, she made quick adjustments to her technique to match my level of comfort.  After the massage, she gave me an assessment of what she noticed and recommended a course of action for the muscles.  Very impressed with the service.

The ambiance is great, the massage was great.  Highly recommend it!
