These are the most delicious things ever....all the flavors I have tired just rock, shepards pie, chicken, spinach and feta, pepperoni pizza, bbq pork and apple.  Pretty positive the others are equally amazing.   The pastry is flaky, tasty and the perfect wrapping for whatever is inside.  If you see these little nuggets of fabulousness at your local AZ farmer's market just get some.  Then go home, bake away and enjoy.  Not even a tiny chance you will be sorry.
