Popped in for a late lunch Saturday. 

I like almost everything about this place, except possibly the location, which prevents most of us from finding it. (next to "Sushi on Shea"). First off they offer an extensive wine list, the place is well decorated, and certainly worthy of a budget date night. Anyway, the food was great as was the service. I recommend you give this place a try and specifically request the Burmese dishes.
