Everyone here is a caring professional. I have never had such painless novocaine injections. 

The dentists, Rosen and Arak, are always upbeat. The only staff member who left in the 11 years I've been coming here retired. 

Everyone who works here loves to come to work. 

For the first time in my life, I don't mind going to the dentist. 

I can't think of anything that is a greater testimony to the quality of this dental practice.
