Instead of going to Yen, for there happy hour that includes a California roll 5 ways, and the worst service in phoenix, head over to Fresh Wasabi... This place is hands down the best Sushi bar in the phoenix area. Amazing prices, amazing FRESH sushi, and even better service! The happy our and reverse happy our menus are pretty extensive compared to others in the area, (Ahem, Yen). Usually a menu with over 50 rolls to choose from is not a good sign, but from the variety I tried, not a single roll was bad! So seriously, if you like great sushi, for the best price, and appreciate fast service, go check this place out.
