Is it a Gallery?  Is it an intimate place for friends to gather?  It's really both.  #EVFN had the pleasure of having small gathering there tonight 05/01/2009.  

This small gallery located in a business plaza around ASU's campus is not only a great location for upcoming artists but has a spectacular view of the surrounding campus.  It's a must see.

If you are invited  to or they schedule an event here don't miss it as you will miss out on everything that makes this place special.
