I've been to the Liberty Market several times and they never disappoint.  The men in my family always go for the wood fired pizzas (which are superb).. but for those who want a healthier option--their salads make for filling and guilt-free eating.  

The place is always moderately busy, but never so packed that you can't get prompt service.  Plus, there is plenty of inside and outdoor/patio area to park your plates.  Even the bathrooms are well kept and clean.  This place has become a family staple.

Fair Warning:  The red velvet cake will make you an addict.
