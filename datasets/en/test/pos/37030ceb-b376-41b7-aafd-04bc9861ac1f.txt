All I need to say is Happy Hour/Snack Bar.  4PM-Close (Monday through Saturday, all day Sunday).  That's about the happiest happy hour I've seen in a while.

Beer was 1/2 price. The "Snack Bar" consists of a list of bar favorites for $2.99.  The portions are small, but just enough food to keep you going and not ruin your buzz.  I don't find myself on this side of town very often, but when I do this is a good place to get the night started!
