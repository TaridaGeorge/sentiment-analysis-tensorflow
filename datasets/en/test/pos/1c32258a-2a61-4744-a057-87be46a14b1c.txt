I've been going to Stinkweeds for half my life now at 3 different locations and have always had great experience there. They keep up with many of my favorite English language bands and let me know when new release are out. If you have several bands you follow, you should sign up on Stinkweeds email list to receive weekly updates of new release. If you are having trouble finding something, you should definitely ask and they'll do their best to order it. They are also great with their phone list and give you calls as soon as the item comes in. There are a few other good, friendly local record stores, but Kimber and Lindsay at Stinkweeds are the best( the dudes are decent too). Parking lot and entrance are in the back, sometimes entering behind the Diary Queen on central is easier...
