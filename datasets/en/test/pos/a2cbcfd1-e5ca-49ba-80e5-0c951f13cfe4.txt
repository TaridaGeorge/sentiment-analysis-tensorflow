How have I never been here before? I had an appointment at a salon in the same plaza and had half an hour to kill before I needed to be there. I parked by Loehmann's and figured it was a furniture store! I walked in thinking I would check out love seats and recliners, but I ended up finding the most perfect hand bag for $40 less than retail price. 

I will be back here whenever I'm in the area.
