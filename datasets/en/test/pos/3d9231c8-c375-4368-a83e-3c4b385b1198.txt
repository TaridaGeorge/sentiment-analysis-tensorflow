The BEST place in the Valley of the Sun to get some amazing greek food. If you haven't been there yet, you gotta go ASAP! Everything on the menu is awesome! The atmosphere is really cool. You can sit inside, outside on the covered patio, or at the bar. The staff is super friendly too! Ask for a Greek Style Blue Moon! They are super yummy!!!!!!!!!!
