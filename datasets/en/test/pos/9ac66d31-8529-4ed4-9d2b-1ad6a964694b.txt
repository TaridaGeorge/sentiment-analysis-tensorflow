Switch has been my favorite restaurant for every and any meal since 2008 when I moved to Phoenix. Always have the best service (LOVE YOU DUSTY!) and the food has never been anything less than exceedingly delicious. It also is not expensive. My  menu favorites include the jalapeno and bacon clams (the bread is unreal), BLT sandwich, turkey and brie gallette and pretty much any of their weekend brunch specials. My only suggestion is that they start serving brunch 7 days a week!
