Can't ask for more than great drinks, food, service and atmosphere.  This may be my new hang-out.  The seats are comfortable, and for couches, didn't give you that ew gross, who's been sitting here feeling.  The cocktails were delicious, yet strong.  The food was good, and quite large portions, which is nice for sharing.  The service was perfect, friendly, prompt, and overall a great experience.
