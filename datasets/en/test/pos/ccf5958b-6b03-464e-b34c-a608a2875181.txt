Oh CherryBlossom, where have you been my whole life!?? Discovered this spot by looking for restaurants nearby my workplace. Checked it out online, seemed decent enough. Loved the feeling upon walking, very "homely" an authentic. I was confused by the italian/asian menu, but intrigued as well. Should I mentioned I've been 3 times since I first went there only 1 week ago? I've ordered their bento box (which changes daily), a steal at only $10! I've had their sushi twice. Everything is very cheap and VERY tasty. Servers are very friendly and pretty quick. In and out in 45 minutes during lunch. I think I will be frequenting this place very often.
