I am driving back here all the way from Flagstaff this weekend! This place is great!

My girlfriend and I went last week and we went nuts! This was the most fun we had all weekend. There were so many things that reminded us of home and we just wanted to buy everything. Like all great Asian Supermarkets, everything was really cheap. The quality of the produce was great. So much fresher than the safeway in Flagstaff!

There was so many things that I love and the selection was awesome!
