Love. Love. Love. 

For starters, I can get a green iced tea the size of my head. They have a drive-thru AND it's a healthy drive-thru. Not to mention they have the best tuna sandwich I've ever had. 

I probably eat here once a week. It is my dream to one day try everything on the menu. Unfortunately, I can't stop eating that damn tuna sandwich.
