The Flower Studio may be on the pricier side, but they are so worth it... Christine Siegel, founding partner and head floral designer, is remarkable!  From the moment we had our first meeting, she listened to our vision and used her expertise to suggest ideas as well.  Most importantly, she totally delivered on the flowers at our wedding... they were incredible!

My bouquet consisted of Flame and deep purple (eggplant) mini Calla lilies accented with deep red (burgundy) Cymbidium orchids.  The stems were accented with a band of Purple Haze ribbon with a Swarovski crystal seam. They were gorgeous!  So were the bridesmaid's bouquets, the centerpieces, chuppah, Minnie's "Dog of Honor" collar, and everything else...

Thank you,  The Flower Studio, for making my wedding weekend even more beautiful and filled with flowers... I highly recommend this local business!
