This place is simply amazing, so I'll try to keep this review simple and concise. The food is always fresh, locally sourced as much as possible, and absolutely delicious. The pastries are amazing. All of them. The macarons are the best I've tasted anywhere. I've tried macarons other places, and they don't even compare. And the croissants...ohhh the croissants. Once you try the croissants at Essence, you won't want a croissant from anywhere else this side of France. Chef Eugenia, your food is amazing and addictive.
