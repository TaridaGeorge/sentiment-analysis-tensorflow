Terrific credit union. Joined many years ago when it was still the Motorola Credit Union. The staff is very friendly (almost like family or friends). We ended up dumping Bank of America in 2009 after they tried to "upgrade" my Mastercard card to an unwanted (and useless) American Express card, started to mess around with how they reported our mortgage balance and actually gave money out of my account to someone who was NOT on my account. All of our savings, checking, money markets, IRAs, etc are now with TruWest.
