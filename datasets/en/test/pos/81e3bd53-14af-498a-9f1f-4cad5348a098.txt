Is heaven possible on Earth?  Yes.  How do I know the answer to such a question?  I came to Joes Farm Grill today and found it!  

I am a fan of Joes stuff, and came here today to see what it was all about.  I really wanted to just go to the coffee shop, but after setting foot in here for the first time, I realized how close these two places were in proximity to each other, and decided to go to both!

I stood in line and ordered the hot dog basket and it was tasty.  I also got a drink as well, and really enjoyed my meal here.  I dont know how he does it, but this place is perfection.  Next time my parents come in to town, I'm taking them here.  amazing.
