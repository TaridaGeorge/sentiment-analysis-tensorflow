I think Butter & Me cupcakes are awesome.....also, I have to say something in response to Veronica D's comments.  I buy cupcakes for my kids birthday parties and some special occassions because it is less of a hassel and easier to serve.....obviously Veronica D hasn't shopped around for a cake that serves 12 or more people or other cupcake vendors as the pricing is very much competitive for what you get!!!!
A big fan.
