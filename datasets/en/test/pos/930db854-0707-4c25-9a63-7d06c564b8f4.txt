So good.  I think of all the other places around town for you to get ice cream and this is one of the first spots I pick (pun intended).  I think anyone that is near one should go.  

Not only is it a fun atmosphere but their ice cream is so sweet and so good that it hits the spot.  I cant help myself, I can make these puns all day, I have to stop by when I pass by it.

I will say the down side is the price, but if you are willing to spend your money on cold stone for the 4 dollars and some odd cents, go here its way better and a lot more chill.  

I have yet to try the coffee here, but I can only imagine that its as good as the ice cream.

Recommendations: To anyone that eats ice cream
