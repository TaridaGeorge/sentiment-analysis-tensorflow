This has become my standard for all sushi to be judged. I have not had a bad item here. Rainbow carpaccio is a must try. Its sashimi of 4 or 5 different fish with a cucumber relish. Prices are moderate but with a free BYOB its easy to overlook that. The tempura is light and prefectly crisp. I've only had one noodle dish I think. So I cant judge too well based on that. But what I had was excellent. Service is always great.
