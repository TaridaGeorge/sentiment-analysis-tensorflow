I love booze, so clearly I love Total Wine. 

When I first heard of it I assumed it was a total BevMo knock off, but dare I say it's better than BevMo. I think the selection is a bit better, but the prices are the same. 

They sell more than wine and have a great beer selection. My favorite latest find is Samuel Smith's Organic Cherry Beer. You will totally forget you are drinking beer. It's like a carbonated cherry juice that gets you tipsy. 

The selection, service and prices at Total Wine are great and I'm glad I don't have to drive too far for good hooch.
