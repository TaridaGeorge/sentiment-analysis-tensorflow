Great food at very reasonable prices.  The spring roll was quite big and very tasty. The chicken noodle soup was enormous. All 3 of us thought our meals were great and the service was very friendly. The tapioca dessert was absolutely wonderful.   The books about Cambodia on the tables are a very nice touch.  The restaurant is difficult to find because there isn't really a sign and parking is in the back.  But it is definitely worth a trip.
