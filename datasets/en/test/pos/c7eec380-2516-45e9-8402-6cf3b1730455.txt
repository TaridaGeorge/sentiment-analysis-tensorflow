I went to 3 different places before I found this one, and he was the only one who was honest with me, and made me feel better about virtually ruining my $250 Michael Kors! He was extremely kind and fixed my heels in a couple of hours. I highly recommend giving this man your business :0) There just aren't enough deserving small business owners out there, but this guy is awesome, and has very reasonable prices as well!
