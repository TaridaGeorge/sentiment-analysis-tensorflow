This place is a great restaurant for one of those beautiful Phoenix afternoons/evenings. The outside patio is very comfortable to eat and the view is great. We've gotten several different plates and there's nothing we haven't liked. The service is amazing!! One time, we asked for a spicy dish, and the waitress asked if it was spicy enough and my husband said no, but it tasted great anyway, and the chef himself came out to apologize and told us that next time he'd make it really spicy. Who does that anymore?? We really appreciated the gesture.
