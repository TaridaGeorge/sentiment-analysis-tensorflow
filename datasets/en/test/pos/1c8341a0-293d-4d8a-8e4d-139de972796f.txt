Can you say yum! Finally a place that makes bread. The soggy dough in your average supermarket can't be called bread. As a European and a grand daughter of a baker, this place gets it. The only sad thing is that bread is pricey here. We went for breakfast here last week. Fabulous coffee and free refills. Awesome passionfruit ice tea ( I had to try both).
Even the kids menu was great. Cute sand dollar size pancakes.
Another plus, they have the Hero brand jelly. Great Swiss quality I used to back home. All fruity goodness without the high fructose corn syrup. Yay.
Will be back many, many times and get the holiday bread. Willing to shell out a bit more to even buy their loaves.
