A friend and I wanted to grab a bite post late night dog walking, still had my puppy with us and saw that this "Blue Moose" had a patio. She went inside to grab menus, I grabbed a very comfy seat on the patio, and within moments we were greeted by a sweet server who saw my puppy and went in to grab him a dog dish of water. He was super nice to us, very prompt in getting our Shocktops. We ordered appetizers, baked mac & potato skins (the best choices after exercising) and they were absolutely delicious. The potato skins came with a good amount of sour cream and salsa on the side, and we were never left unattended. We will definitely be back, great service, good atmosphere and the patio was perfect.
