John is amazing. He has been fixing my card since 1994 he will never steer u wrong or over charge u. He will always have it done when promised. If u are new to Phoenix or looking for a new honest guy John will give u honesty and a fair price everytime. I have probably had him fix my car 25 times at least and everytime he did a fabulous job.
