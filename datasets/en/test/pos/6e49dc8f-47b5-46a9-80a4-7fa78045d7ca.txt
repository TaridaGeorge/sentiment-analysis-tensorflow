Love this place! Jerk chicken is flavorful and moist. Spicy but not so hot you can't enjoy it. Plantains, not soggy with great flavor. Peas and rice (with a little sauce from the curry chicken on top was delish. Last time I was here I ordered the coconut curry shrimp. Great flavor, lots of shrimp, perfect texture. Beef patties are good, need a little more filling though. Tried the soursop (sp?) juice and it was good too. Highly recommend this place! Great staff, very friendly and informative!

No seating for a large party, just 2 very small tables and a wall of bar stools. Park in the back. Worth the effort!
