We had our second burger there on Saturday night. Both times my burger was cook right to temperature and was delicious. My wife enjoyed the bar, and the service was great. I recommend showing up during non rush hours becuase it was packedthe first time we went and we had to wait for a table. They have lots of happy hour specials and gropons to get the cost down. The prices are a little high, but this is typical for the gourmet burger places like Lush and Blue Burger.
