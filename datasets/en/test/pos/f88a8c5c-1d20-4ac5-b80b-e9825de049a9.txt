So good, came here last week finally with my wife and kids.  Place is not what I would call kid friendly but I found myself wanting to drop my kids off at the McDonald's next door for a few hours, jk (I don't want CPS coming to my house for that joke).  I had the FEZ burger which is just the most flavorful burger ever while being the most unique burger I have ever eaten.  It had BBQ, pears.....and I cant remember but it was flipping awesome.  It is very modern inside, my wife loved her salad, and our friend had a great tasting sandwich.  Kids ate chicken fingers from the bar menu and some sliders from the appetizer menu.  All was delish, will come again and ditch the kids first. (remember, this is a joke)
