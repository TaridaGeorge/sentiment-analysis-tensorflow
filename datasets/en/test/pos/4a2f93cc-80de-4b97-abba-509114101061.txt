Pack a Bowl. Love this place! Super nice staff, the manager always comes by and asks how things are going. Love the price and condiments are plentiful. I always have leftovers and they make for a great meal later that night! Packing a Bowl is an art forum and I have my technique down. Years of practice ya know. You have to crawl before you walk. Get some!
