I am late to the party, but I can independently verify what others have said...

PTC has second-run movies at  a very reasonable price. They are usually in the theater 7-10 days before being released on DVD, but it is awesome to see a movie on the big screen for well under $5!

I have seen numerous movies here including Spiderman 2, Transporter 2, Pride & Prejudice, The Bourne Ultimatium, Waiting, Tristan and Isolde....

There is a veryy cool arcade with old pinball and 80's/90's arcade games. Located next to a  great Italian restaurant (reviewed by me), and a pizzeria.  Ample parking.
