My partner and I absolutely love Harkins Camelview 5. But then, what's not to like.

1) They show indie films that you rarely can see anywhere else
2) The mid-century modern architecture is great
3) Prices are reasonable, especially for the matinees
4) The employees are friendly and outgoing
5) Indie films tend to keep away the kids, one of the most annoying things about huge multiplex theaters.

If you haven't experienced the Camelview 5 you owe it to yourself to check it out.
