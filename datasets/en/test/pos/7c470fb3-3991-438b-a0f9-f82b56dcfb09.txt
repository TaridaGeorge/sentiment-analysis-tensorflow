I've enjoyed Thai food in lots of places, but Malee's is my favorite anywhere. We eat here every time we come to Phoenix and are never disappointed. They serve stuff you can't find anywhere else, and it's all done with a flair. This time I ordered some of the lettuce wraps. Spicy and very yummy.  We always order the crispy basil chicken and the crispy pla. This place is very special. The best!
