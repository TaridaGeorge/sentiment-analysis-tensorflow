Went looking for a Benelli Supernova.  They had several Benelli options, and when I price checked Sportsmans Warehouse vs Cabelas and Bass Pro, Sportsmans was $30 cheaper than the other two.

There was plenty of staff behind the gun counter, and while helpful, they were never pushy or constantly asking what I wanted to see (happens to me a lot at other gun shops).  

While not as big as the Bass Pro Shop in Mesa, Sportsmans had everything I needed and the best price.
