This is easily the BEST RESTAURANT i have ever been to

I love french food, and this is the very best I have ever had. Amazing service (the owner is such a nice guy), amazing service and the atmosphere is cozy and romantic (perfect for a date).

I agree with some of the other raters-- this place would get 10 stars if yelp would let me put 10. Try the duck and the beef bourguignon!
