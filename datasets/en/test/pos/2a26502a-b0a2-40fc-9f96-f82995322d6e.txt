Fletcher Heights Florist did a great job! I called at the last minute to get an arrangement for my grandfather's funeral and they were more than accommodating! Put together the most beautiful wreath and had it delivered to the cemetery for the service early. When we arrived the delivery guy was waiting for us! Thanks for making a difficult time a bit more beautiful! I would use them without question again! The arrangement was absolutely beautiful!
