Hello readers this is Adam Henson of Cartersville,GA again. If you read my first review i said i was getting a Jacoby break cue and i did exactly that. If you have not experienced G CUE BILLIARD STORE you don't know what your missing out on.....
There cues, honesty,reliability, expert advise... i can keep going with this.....................
No matter where you look on the internet you WILL NOT find the quality they have !
I can promise you that from experience.....
I said it once and will say it as many times as i need to G CUE THE BEST THERE IS .
              Thank You G CUE,
               Sincerely, Adam Henson
