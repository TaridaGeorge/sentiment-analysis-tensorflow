Went to see 7 Minutes in Heaven - a variety show where anyone can get on stage and do whatever they want for 7 minutes. There's no screening process - anything goes.

Given this, my expectations weren't exactly high. Turns out I underestimated Phoenix creatives. Every act was entertaining at worst, most were good and a couple made me laugh until my sides hurt. Most notably a comedian known simply as Seymour.

Kudos to the staff for bringing something like this to our some-would-say-cultureless town. It's a breath of fresh air.

Note: 7 Minutes runs every Saturday in June - and it's advised to buy tix in advance as they sell out.
