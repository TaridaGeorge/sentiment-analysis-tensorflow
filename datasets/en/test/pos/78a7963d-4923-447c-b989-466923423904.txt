Whenever I walk into Changing Hands, I get this happy little butterfly feeling I can't explain. I am definitely a kid in a candy shop....No more like Charlie in Wonka's Chocolate factory. This is the most delightful bookstore in Phoenix in my opinion. They have a nice selection of new and used books and lots of fun unique etc. items for purchase. I have found some semi rare stuff here. The staff is soo frickin friendly, it's ridiculous. I just feel at home when I am here and never want to leave.
