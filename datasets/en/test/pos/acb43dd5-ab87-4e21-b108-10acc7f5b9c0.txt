As a guy, this is the place I feel comfortable with my fianc√© taking her car without me. Andre the owner is honest and fair and the type of person I love to do business with. He treated us like we were customers for life or like we were neighbors and we would see him every day. These guys work Toyota/Lexus better than any other I have experienced in the central corridor. Going here I feel confident my time and money are well spent. As a valued customer I will be back.
