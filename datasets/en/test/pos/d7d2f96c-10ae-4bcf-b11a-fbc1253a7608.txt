I had a fabulous, fun and entertaining day at the Renaissance Festival!  It was great to see so many people dressed up as "Ladies", "Lords", "Orphans", "Knights", and more!!

The shows were pretty much non-stop everywhere you looked.  There were plenty of shops, food and entertainment (shows, petting zoo's, rides, and more!).  I was really happy to see that there were wooden rides rather than mechanical rides here.  It made the Renaissance experience feel more authentic.  The roads were unpaved too!  I really enjoyed looking at that the permanent buildings they had for stores to sell stuff in, it wasn't like a tent set up (at least for most of them... ;) ).

This is a great family, group and date experience. :)  Expect a lot of walking!

Check the website on when they are open since it's only certain weekends in the early part of the year.
