I love this Baskin Robbins. They have great deals like a discount on ice scoops on Tuesday nights and a buy one get one  free Sunday night on Wednesdays. Plus the nice young kid working there also let me know that on week days, they have an after school special on half priced kid sized scoops till 5pm. I've made this my place to hangout with friends and enjoy some good ice cream. The staff is very friendly and I always leave happy & satisfied. I recommend this Baskin Robbins for anyone looking for a cool place to relax and have some tasty ice cream.
