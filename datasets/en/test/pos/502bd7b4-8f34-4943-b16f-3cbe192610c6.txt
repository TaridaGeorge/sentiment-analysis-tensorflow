Had a gel polish manicure with Helen. 25 bucks. and she did a Great job! I was referred here by 3 office mates. Helen also speaks English pretty well :)
It looks like the salon may have fairly recently had a facelift and looks nice, though as someone else said, not fancy.
Helen also told me if you come in for a gel polish, they soak off your old gel polish FOR FREE.
