we live right on this spectacular jewel, in a section that runs through/near old town. quite possibly the greatest thing about living here. i can ride my bike to work at scottsdale healthcare at shea, we ride our bikes to happy hours in tempe, and to eat decadent b-fasts at chompies, walk our dog here and let her run loose on the golf course (after hours of course). we run and exercise or take leisurely walks and picnics here. all the while in no fear of getting run over and passing by so many beautiful lakes, parks, and ponds. it is just so cool....and relaxing. and it's awesome to see people out and about enjoying the fantastic weather in arizona. just be careful....there's a couple of sections near continental golf course that is prone to stray golf balls...."FORE".
