Hands down easily one of the best steakhouse's Ive ever been to. Every year when I am in Scottsdale, I HAVE to go to this place! Service is great and the steaks are even better. Be ready to drop a few extra pennies, but its well worth it! They have this seafood appetizer tower that starts off the meal perfectly! Great assortment of food!!! Great bar as well- you really don't even need to sit down at a table- the place is very entertaining and it seems like they only allow gorgeous women into the place- CANT COMPLAIN ONE BIT!
