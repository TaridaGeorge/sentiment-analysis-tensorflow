Charlie was great with our cats! We felt at ease while on vacation since Polly Paws was coming in to take care of our babies! I would recommend them to anyone. The process was easy from start to finish.  They even left a note for when we returned from vacation, it was a status update on how the visits went! We will be using them again.
