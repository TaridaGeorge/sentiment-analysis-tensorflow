We were hungry.... We were thirsty....We were starving for football... So we went here for happy hour on a Saturday, just to give a new place a go. Ended up getting pretty plastered but was a great time. Had awesome sushi and watched some college football. Bartender was very friendly, knew her drinks and made them well. The sushi was in decent serving sizes and was very good. The bar has a decent alcohol selection too, we able to make all the drinks and shots we thought of. Will 100% be going back!
