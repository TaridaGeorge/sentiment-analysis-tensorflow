The BEST instructors and the best curriculum!!!  I have a 6 year old daughter and 3 1/2 yr old son.  My daughter started swimming here at age 4 and my son at age 2.  They both swim beautifully thanks to the TALENTED and WELL-TRAINED staff.  The facility is always CLEAN, SAFE and ORGANIZED.  And as a bonus the managers/supervisors are kind and LISTEN and RESPOND to any concerns you may have as a parent.  I tried several other places in the valley with my first child and Gold Medal stands out as THE BEST place for young swimmers by a large margin.
