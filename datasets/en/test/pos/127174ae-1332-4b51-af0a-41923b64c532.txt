This place is absolutely incredible.  So thoughtfully designed and fun for kids.  My boys are 2 and 5 and it was perfect for them.  Not a detail is overlooked and I love that there is sort of an industrial feel to the museum with so many items that appear to be repurposed.  It's really a neat place and really allows little ones to explore!
