Came by the restaurant the other day with my wife and a friend who was leary about Ecudorian food.  We all had shrimp stew although I was torn  between that and the shrimp cocktail.  Went with the soup knowing that either way it was going to be good.....and it was.
They have a drink there that they say comes from corn.  It's kinda purple and delicious.  Your mind will say it's a fruit drink...it's gonna' be a fruit drink but it isn't.  It has a taste different and it's totally wonderful.
The gentleman who serves as waiter is just great: friendly, happy, and very helpful.
Great place to eat!
