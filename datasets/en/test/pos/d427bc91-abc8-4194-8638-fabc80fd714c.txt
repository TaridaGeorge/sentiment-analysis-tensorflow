I've been going to Koltton for close to 10 years and he is hands down THE BEST!! You can not get a better brow wax from anyone - he's a perfectionist and so meticulous. Facials are awesome too. He really takes his time and pampers you - hand and foot massage while your mask is on. I've been to tons of nice spas around the world and he has always been my favorite. You will not be disappointed with any service you get from him!
