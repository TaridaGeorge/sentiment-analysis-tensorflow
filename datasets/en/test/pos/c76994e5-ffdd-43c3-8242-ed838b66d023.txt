This non-profit organization is a great place to adopt a dog or cat!! They take their business very seriously - when 1 animal gets adopted they make it a point to rescue another pet from being euthanized.  They also have a very friendly staff dedicated to the mission of the organization and they offer a low-cost vaccination clinic onsite.  Highly recommended!!!
