Love, love, love this place! I could live my life on Greek food, so when the Daphne's in this spot closed down, I was sad, not because the food was good but it was walking distance from my home and open late. When this place opened up, I was ecstatic. 

And the food is good.  I always get the Veggie sampler plate, and it's awesome. Rarely is there such a large spanakopita on such platters. The portion is great!

The lemon-rice soup is nice. I've also tried their wraps, falafel is my fave. The pesto portabella wrap is not exactly Greek, but the pesto is fresh and they don't skimp. We love mousaka, but their eggplant version has beef.
