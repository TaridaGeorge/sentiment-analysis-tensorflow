Truly what I call a vacay!

The most perfect mani/pedi here. They have their own line of nail polish that lasted weeks after I left Arizona! And in gorgeous colors. I really wish I bought that beautiful emerald/black polish. And rarely do I care so much about nails!

Afterwards with my beautiful mani/pedi, I indulged myself in the jacuzzi and the French Celtic Mineral pool. No harsh chemicals in the pool, fresh cucumber water in hand, surrounded by dozens of waterlilies (my favorite)...boy do I miss you. OH, and how can I forget! THE SHOWER IN THE LOCKER ROOM. OH MY GOD. SERIOUSLY. I WILL NEVER FORGET YOU. 8 SHOWER HEADS. TOTAL INDULGENCE! Seriously, I have not lived until I came to Spa Avania.
