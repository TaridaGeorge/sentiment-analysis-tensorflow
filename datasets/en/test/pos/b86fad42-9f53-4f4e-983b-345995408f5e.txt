Visiting this place is like hitting the motherload.  Seriously.  I can't leave without finding at least 10 books to take home for, like, 5 cents total.  Plus, the staff are highly knowledgeable and there are rooms for community events and classes you can go to.  If they paid more than $7 an hour, I'd say working there would be my dream job.
