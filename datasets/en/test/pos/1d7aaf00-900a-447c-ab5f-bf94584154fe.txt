This is a great, full-service running store.  I came into town for a week and joined Sole Sports' Thursday night group run.  The store offers everything you could want or need for running.  It even has showers.  The staff is amazingly helpful and friendly, particularly Emmett.  I look forward to coming back to Scottsdale for more runs and events with Sole Sports.
