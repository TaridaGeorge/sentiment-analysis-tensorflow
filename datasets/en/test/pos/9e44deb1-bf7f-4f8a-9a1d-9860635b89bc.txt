Visited several times.  I appreciate good beer and this brewery makes it.  They also have a guest beer or two occassionally, and seem to do a fine job of selecting something that complements their own offering.

If you are considering visiting Sleepy Dog, consider this -- it's a small craft brewery.  Plain and simple.  They don't have food (other than popcorn really) and you aren't going to go there to watch the game.  It's a chill atmosphere and they serve excellent craft beers for you to relax and enjoy.  So, you go there to enjoy a pint or six over conversation with your friends.  THEN, after you're oiled up on good beer, you go to the loud party hangout.  

If you like beer, highly recommend.
