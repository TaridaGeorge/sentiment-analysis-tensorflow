Roy's serves Hawaiian Fusion, which is always an interesting combination of flavors.  I had the pleasure of trying the ahi tuna, the salmon, the butter fish, and the short ribs, each of them distinctly different, and each of them excellent.  

The service was fabulous: the wait staff was knowledgeable, fast and quite pleasant.  My water glass was never empty (despite me being a generally thirsty person).  And despite being rather busy, my server kept things moving quickly and smoothly.

If you're looking for a great place to take a date, or just a nice place to have a GREAT meal, visit Roy's.
