Love Salon Switchblade!  Melinda is great and always has creative ideas to share.  She is edgy and on point with all of her recommendations whether you want to keep it simple or get a little crazy!  She is also willing to explain and teach you things if you aren't a pro at styling your own hair or have questions about something she's doing, she's patient and offers explanations along the way. 

I found out about this place from an old college friend I would bump into occasionally out and about.  She always had the most stylish hairdo and gorgeous color.  I finally asked her where she went to get it done and she raved about Melinda and handed me a card.  I booked an appt immediately and am very happy I did!  

I definitely recommend Melinda and Switchblade Salon to anyone looking for good options in the Cen Pho!
