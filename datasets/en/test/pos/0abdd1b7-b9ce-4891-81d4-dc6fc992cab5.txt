Success starts top down, and the management is always attentive to our needs at Chili's.  They and the staff often know when something's not perfect even if we do not, and they go out of their way to over deliver on Chili's promise of excellence.  It's quick if we need it to be, the food is always delicious and the service is always spot on.  Their regular Margaritas are so good, we rarely even get to try their specialty Margaritas.   My wife and I love Chili's.  It was good enough for our pre-wedding meal when we married at Bellagio and it will always be our first choice.  We will be eating there even when we don't have teeth.
