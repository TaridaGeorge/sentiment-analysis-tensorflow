Love this stadium, so clean and new and beautiful. You can see all the gorgeous players up close from the large grassy area and all the atmosphere is just so nice. Its a wonderful place to watch the spring training games. I went twice and once was kids day sunday and they had all sorts of games set up for kids like bounce houses etc. There is a lot of fun games for adults going on in the walkways too.
