I have been going here regularly for about a year. Dave was the first  medium I had ever met. I did a private reading with him and can say that he is the real thing. It gave me a lot of closure. Ray who usually works in the front is very friendly and helpful. 

Simia who does tarot readings there is amazing. She seems to know things that she couldn't possibly have known when doing my readings. Very specific and accurate. She's very nice too. 

Catherine does palm readings and it was very accurate. 

I love the aura photos here. It  comes out on a polaroid film (unlike some other places who use a different type of camera) and is very clear.  

Overall a great place.
