Great Food!  Even non-vegans and vegetarians will like this food.  It is family owned and operated.  The wife is the cook, made fresh to your order (nothing is pre-made).  The husband is the host and daughters work there as well. Everyone is very friendly.

The food can be made very mild to very spicy.  And the choices of fresh vegetables is always included in this Oriental Style cooking.

They have a very good lunch menu that is $8 and is very filling.  Drinks extra.  

So for lunch or dinner make a point of going and enjoying the food and staff.
