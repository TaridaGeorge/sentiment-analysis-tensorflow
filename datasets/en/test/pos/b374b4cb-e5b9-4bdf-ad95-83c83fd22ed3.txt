I got a huge ol' cup of some amazing yogurt for about $3! They have a variety of about 9 flavors and their all delicious. They have this bar where you can put a large variety of chocolate chips and nuts and cookie crumbs on it.
The place is nice to eat, except the 19 year old worker plays the WEIRDEST music. Kinda felt like I was at some disco where everyone was all cracked out or something...
OTHER THAN THAT! The place is awesome.
