Perfect restaurant for any sports fan as the walls are lined with sports memorabilia. I've been here several times and have never been disappointed. The atmosphere is pleasant, the food is excellent (especially the char-crust ribeye) and the staff is very friendly and courteous. This place is a must see for any sports fan when you visit the valley of the sun.
