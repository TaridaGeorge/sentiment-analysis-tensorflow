Wow!  What a selection!  The veggies and fruits were just gorgeous and reasonably priced.  A large selection of 'real' food... not all this froze and canned stuff.

I love all the herbs and holistic alternatives they offer.  It's a wonderful alternative to the big "chain" grocery stores.  Not a place to buy toilet paper... save that for Walmart!  If you're looking for a store to add quality and value into you life, then Sprouts is the place to go!
