I've been eating here for years, since it was Sonora Brewery.  I've always loved the food, the beer, and the service.  I moved out of state a year ago, came back for business this week and HAD to have the yummy Kobe Burger.  And I'm pleased to say, they didn't let me down.  It was cooked perfectly, and the sweet potato fries appetizer was a great way to start the meal.  Vanilla porter, delicious!  And here's the kicker:  after not setting foot in the place for almost a full year, my server knew not only how I wanted my burger, but also remembered what kind of dressing I liked on the side to dip my fries in!  THAT'S personalized service!  Five stars, SunUp...You deserve 'em!
