We like to order from here for take out.  We usually get Moo Goo Gai Pan, Mongolian Chicken, and egg rolls.  They always get the order right.  It is nice to eat here too, there usually isn't a huge crowd for dinner (I'm not sure about lunch).  The decor isn't much to look at, but the food is very authentic and that is what I come here for. Very tasty.
