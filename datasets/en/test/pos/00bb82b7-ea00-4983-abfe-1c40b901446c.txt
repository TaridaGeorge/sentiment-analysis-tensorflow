Vegan breakfast have always been available to me at this friendly coffee shop upon request, but now they have incredibly tasty options on the actual menu! Their vegan cupcakes are one of my motivational tools, when I need an extra push forward I allow myself one after the goal is achieved.  It can get busy so if you are in a hurry, don't panic at the line, the friendly and efficient service staff will get everyone's order taken and made before you can absorb all the local color on display.
