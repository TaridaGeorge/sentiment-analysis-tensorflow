Five stars for the memory. (hope you all enjoy it) When I was a kid we went here as a family all the time, but one time when I was a baby the organ came out and started playing and I almost bit my moms boob (other parts but keeping this pg for the kids) right off. No matter how many times we go back, nothing will ever get my family to stop telling that story. Lol.  Pizza is decent, and service has always been ok, although I haven't been there in quite some time!
