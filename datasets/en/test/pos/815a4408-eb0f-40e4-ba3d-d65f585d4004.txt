Great place to spend a HOT HOT Phoenix day...

And as always, such a scene...

This is a gigantic place with absolutely beautiful stores.  We went on a 113 degree Sunday so we knew it would be busy but since it is so big, the people have lots of room to roam.  Great people watching and window shopping for those of us without that 6th or 7th figure in the income.  When I win the lotto, this will be one of my first stops and until then, I will keep drooling over those Betsy Johnson pumps.

Happy shopping!
