Hidden gem. No frills, hole in the wall type of place (but pretty clean). The food is simply excellent. Authentic and delicious. Friendly service. I'm really amazed that the prices are so low! I got an order of spring rolls, 2 bowls of pho, 1 entree and a Thai tea for $20!!! Incredible value for the food quality. 

I will definitely be back.
