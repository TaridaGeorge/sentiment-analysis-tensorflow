If you're looking for fresh seafood, great ambiance, & exceptional service you need to check out Mastro's Ocean Club. Their seafood is flown in fresh daily. If you order a martini, you not only get a full martini glass, but a half full shaker as well. Even the bread basket is delicious! (I have a soft spot for the pretzel bread). The halibut is delicious, but the vanilla battered lobster tail is my absolute favorite. Like flavorful mashed potatoes? Order the Mastro's mashed potatoes! The sweet potato steak fries are delicious as well. Looking for a great steak instead? No worries. They serve the same great steaks that they serve at Mastro's Steakhouse & City Hall Steakhouse!
