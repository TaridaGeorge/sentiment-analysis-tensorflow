This is a vast improvement over the OTFM that I used to attend years ago. Organic produce, great breads, nice balance of savory and sweets. Live music provides a nice vibe layout navigates well and parking is plentiful.  Scored  Phoenician's chocolate cherry bread and a multi grain loaf, baby golden beets, rainbow chard, Meyer lemons, blood oranges,spicy pork sausage, unfiltered apple cider and a couple of pints of Sweet Republic ice cream. Awesome! Early morning commute less than 40 minutes from Peoria, a minor detail to enjoy food this good. I was advised to go early as some vendors sell out of popular items. This is hands down the best farmers market our area has to offer.
