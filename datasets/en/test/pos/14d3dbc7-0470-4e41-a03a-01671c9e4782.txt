I will never ever go to Quiznos or Subway ever again!  Cheba Hut is definitely the best and most creative sub shop around.
I had the White Widow sandwich on a garlic herb bun.  It came with chicken smothered in ranch, cheese, bacon,  and mushrooms.  I also added peppers and mustard and it was completely awesome.  
Looking at the menu, I realize that really whatever I am in the mood for, they have.  I would give it -1 star for not having green chilies, but I will survive (and so will be esophogus)

Prices are very reasonable and I loved it that I had the choice of an 8" sub.  My biggest issue with the likes of Subway is that I could only get 6 or 12" when all I wanted was something in the middle.

I found a new love in Cheba Hut.  YUMMY!!!! And the decor ROCKS!!!!!
