I'm a residential real estate agent, so my business involves working with insurance agents often.  There is only one I recommend, though, and that is Michael Pinta with American Family Insurance.  He knows what great customer service means, and delivers it every time.  I have referred him to countless clients of mine, and will continue to do so.
