I love these trails.  Because there are so many options, you can stream-line a hike suited just for you. 
Flat, hills, windy trails, far, long, short, loop, line, ect.  

Almost all the trails allow dogs (Yai ) on a leash, of course. (much appreciated, for those with dogs on leash, {me}  and esepcially for those who don't like dogs running at them).  

Several difficulty levels & lengths.  Such a good work-out!  All ages.  

I love the loop trails because i can usually go for an entire hour and rarely run into anyone (another Yai ! here).  I think some of my fav loops are Yates & Quartz.

Happy Hiking!
