I've been eating here for years.  I've never been disappointed which is rare since I'm extremely picky.  The number 50 is great, and so is the rice and chicken soup.  My boyfriend gets a rice noodle bowl with pork and egg rolls on top.  He must really like it because he's gotten it every time we visit for years.  If you like Vietnamese food you have to check this place out!
