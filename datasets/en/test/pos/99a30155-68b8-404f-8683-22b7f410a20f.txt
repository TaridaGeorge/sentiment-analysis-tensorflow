Absolutely loved the restaurant.  Great food, great time and the wait wasn't that long.  As soon as they took our name, we were ushered next door to quaint old house called Bar Bianco for drinks and appetizers.  We ordered drinks, but our table next door was ready so went back to the Pizzeria Bianco for dinner.  Service and food were great!
