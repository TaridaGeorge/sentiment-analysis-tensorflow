This was so much fun. I bought a groupon as I know how much my dad likes to be on the water, so what better way to show him parts of AZ. Who knew we had water lol.

The tour was gorgeous albeit chilly if you were sitting outside, but so worth it. The Captain did a great job of giving us the history if the surrounding area. I will definitly bring my mom here when she visits in the spring.
