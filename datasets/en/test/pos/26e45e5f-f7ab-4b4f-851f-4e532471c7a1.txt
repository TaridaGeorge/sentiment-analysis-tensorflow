I'm so disappointed that I didn't get a chance to write my review of this terrific little shop before it suddenly closed last month.   I heard it was not for financial reasons, thank goodness... but personal family reasons for the owner.   This is a CenPho loss and I hope Chris comes back soon and starts again'

This was one of those places where you get such personal service, that the owner quickly becomes a trusted friend.  Chris gave me some samples of cat treats that my finicky cat could try... and then even encouraged me to try some brands that are sold at Target!
