I hate to admit it (because I usually avoid ultra trendy places like an ex boyfriend) but I love Postino.  It used to be an old post office, thus the name.  It is now a wine bar that serves "light fare."  There are not too many places with this kind of atmosphere in the Valley -- very California.  One of the walls is a giant garage door that they roll up so the whole place is open.  Little couches and coffee tables are mixed in with tables and high tops for a variety of seating choices.  The bathrooms are lovely, clean, and lit by candles.  The salads are my favorite in Phoenix and the bruschetta is out of this world.   Come early, get your table and enjoy!
