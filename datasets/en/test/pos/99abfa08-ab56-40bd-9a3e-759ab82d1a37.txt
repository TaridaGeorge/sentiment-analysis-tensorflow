The best sandwich I have EVER eaten is their seasonal Thanksgiving sandwich. I wish they had it all year long. I have searched online and cannot seem to find when they start serving it but know it ends at Thanksgiving. Their lemon ricotta pancakes are to die for. I have never had a bad dish, though I agree with some reviews that at times I have waited 20-30 minutes for my food which seems ridiculous when you are not receiving waiter service. I have actually left the line before when it was apparent the line was long with only one cook making food. He actually sighed as the tickets printed out...poor guy. Not always a quick place to eat when wanting takeout or a quick meal.
