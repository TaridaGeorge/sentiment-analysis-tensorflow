Awesome lake!

This is a great lake for family outings dotted with covered ramadas with grills by the water.

We rented their biggest party pontoon.  With twelve people all together, you could fit a few more, easily.  It's a per hour rental, but for a little less than $500, you can have it for 5 hours (that's with filling up with gas at the end).  Not bad if you share the cost.  Lots of room for coolers and extra for stowing away belongings under the seat compartments to keep your stuff dry.  The weather was a little overcast, which made a nice summer swim day without charring your back.  

We had a great time!
