I often eat here weekly!  This is delicious food, great waitress, great service, and it simply can't be beat, especially here in Anthem.  If you aren't a curry fan, try the Pad Thai.  I always get that withe the Geng Kari.  My husband who doesn't really like Thai food really does like the orange chicken...but try the others first.  SOOOO YUMMY!  Hmmm, I think I need to go there now!
