This is a great place to stay in PHX. I have family in the Valley and have stayed here several times over the last year or so and have never been disappointed. The rooms have a small stove, fridge, sink, microwave, and dishwasher. The staff is super nice and helpful. Beds are comfortable and rooms are clean. This is a great value in the PHX area.
