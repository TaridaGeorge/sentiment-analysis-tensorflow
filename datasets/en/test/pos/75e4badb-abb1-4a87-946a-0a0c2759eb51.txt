I cannot say enough great things about Arizona taste. Great food, great service, their catering cannot be beat. I have used them twice now---once for a big event, once for a small, and both went off without a hitch! I'm very surprised to see the review above about the aisle runner because I have found the owner to be fantastic and over the top with service.  All I can say from my experience is that if you want a professional staff and great great food-- choose AZ taste.
