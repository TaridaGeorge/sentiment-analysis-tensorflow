I had lunch here today and had the Baja Chicken wrap with fruit. It was awesome...so fresh and delicious. The place is very quaint and displays beautiful artwork. I mentioned the www yelp on their receipt and asked how many "stars" on yelp.com did they have, they have 4. 
With that information, I have to give them a  star rating to move their average up! 
Thank you
