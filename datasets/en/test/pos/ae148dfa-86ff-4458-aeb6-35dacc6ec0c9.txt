I have had numerous business lunches at Del Frisco's Grille, and the service has been excellent every time. The servers are all friendly and professional. The lunch menu is simple and easy to follow - I've tried just about everything, with the chicken avocado wraps being my favorite. I would also highly recommend the crabcake as a starter. The fact that they take reservations for lunch makes it an extremely convenient spot in the Camelback corridor. If you are looking for a good, quick, business-friendly restaurant, I would highly recommend DFG.
