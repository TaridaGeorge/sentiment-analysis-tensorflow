So my friends took me here as a "farewell" dinner get-together. I didn't know what to expect. My friends go there on  a weekly basis, they're practically regulars... NO KIDDING!! 

From what they were telling me, if you become a regular there they can practically make anything that's NOT in the menu for you. 

Our server Allissa was SOOOO AWESOME!!! I've never been to a restaurant in AZ where the server interacts with their customers on a personal level. It made the place more appealing so in the future, I can take my friends there for sushi. 

Thank you guys for the welcoming atmosphere.
