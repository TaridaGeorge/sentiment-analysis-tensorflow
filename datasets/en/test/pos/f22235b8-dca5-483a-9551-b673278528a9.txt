My friend recommended this company to me when I mentioned I needed some pool repair.  I called and spoke with someone right away and they scheduled a visit within the same week.  He was very knowledgeable and honest with the repairs needed to be done and had my pool crystal clear in a week.  

I am very pleased with the repair that i signed up for weekly maintenance and have never had a problem with my pool... in fact, it's never looked better and stress free. 

Highly recommend!!!
