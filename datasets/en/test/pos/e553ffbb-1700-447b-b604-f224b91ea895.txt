This place is mackin, friendly service with authentic food. We had the chicken wings as an app which tasted good, but nothing to write home about. I had the Italian Flag Lasagna which took about 40 minutes but was definitely worth the wait, some of the best I have had in a longtime. This dish was made from scratch, you can taste the difference with fresh backed pasta, good sauce and lots of meat. My wife had the Grilled Italian Sausage Sandwich. You can tell the sausage was made in house with great spices and a little bit of heat. We will definitely go back.
