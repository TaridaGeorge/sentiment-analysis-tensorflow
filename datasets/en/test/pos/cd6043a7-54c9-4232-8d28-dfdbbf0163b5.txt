I'm definitely a fan of Lobby's. After being bookmarked for over a year I drug my partner out to Tempe to try Lobby's. I'm sure glad we went.

True Chicago-style Italian Beef on the right type of roll, just what the doctor ordered. Fresh, crispy french fries and free refills on soft drinks. 

Lobby's really hit the spot for this former Chicagoan. I'll definitely be back even though it's 25 miles from home!
