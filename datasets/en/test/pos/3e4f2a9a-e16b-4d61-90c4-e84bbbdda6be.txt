"Wow", that's what I can say about Royal Palms.  I just came here to take a walk around the grounds and I was amazed.  Many rooms have their own patio and face a central courtyard surrounded by lush tropical vegetation.  The pool was beautiful, and the fountain in the main central courtyard was a work of art.  The buildings are rustic and warm, and it looks like the restaurant inside is fantastic.  The landscaping of Royal Palms separates it from other resorts: it feels more like an oasis, and less like a desert.  The plumeria trees that dot the grounds smell wonderful!
