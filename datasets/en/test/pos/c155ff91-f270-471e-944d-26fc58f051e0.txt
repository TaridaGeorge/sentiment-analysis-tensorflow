Cozy, clean atmosphere.  Thrilled at the quality of the food.  Everything is organic.  Menus planned by master chefs.  Great for conversation and enjoying a delicious meal followed by tea.  Teas were fresh, and the affiliated boutique offers everything from aromatherapy & massage to acupuncture from certified practitioners.  Easy to get a table without a long wait.
