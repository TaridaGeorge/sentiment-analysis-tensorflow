Great service, Great food and Great Beer. I had a Heff that was awesome. My server recommended a turkey burger stuffed with cheese, basil, and kalamata olives topped with feta cheese with pesto aioli. AWESOMENESS. The atmosphere in and outside of the restaurant is great. Local shops are very cool and there is outdoor seating with a outdoor bar. The burger was $11 the beer was about $4. I liked it very much and will for sure go back again.
