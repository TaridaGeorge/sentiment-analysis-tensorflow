Coming from New York i needed a place like this. Ny has like 5-6 tier 0 Nike accounts and from what i hear this is the ONLY one in AZ.  If you like quickstrikes and limiteds this is the place staff is not overly friendly but the kid that looks like Pharell is nice but coming from NY most tier 0 store employees are jerks so it's expected. Highly recommend this place the mark up isn't bad at all with a wide range of brands though I myself am a Nikehead.
