best coffee in phoenix (so far). experienced and friendly baristas, a large sitting area inside, nice decorations, community conscious, promotes local art and artists, outdoor sitting area, easily accessible location from the light rail and from the portland park neighborhood. 

i had a short vanilla cappuccino and the thing that made it the best insofar to my search for phoenix's best espresso was definitely the milk. it was properly steamed microfoam. the shots were right on, too.

the milk i've had elsewhere in phoenix doesn't compare. thumbs up to fair trade.
