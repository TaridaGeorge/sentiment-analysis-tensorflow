I visited Mesa from Southern CA about a month ago and was pleased to discover this gem my first night in town and I made a point of visiting every day of my trip. If I lived in Mesa, or anywhere near it I would be here every day! The coffee is excellent, they have an organic colombian, a good selection of veggie friendly foods, wi-fi, a large outdoor patio, and there is an extremely reasonably priced yoga studio on the premises, which I visited for one of their intro classes and removed the kinks of several days of driving from my back. The owner is a total sweetheart and the employees (and everyone else I ran into there) are friendly. They just don't make them like this anymore!
