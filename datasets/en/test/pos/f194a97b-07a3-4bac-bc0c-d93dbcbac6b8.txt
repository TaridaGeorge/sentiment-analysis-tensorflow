I live about a mile from here. How did I never know it existed?

I'm reviewing it while sitting here on my Mac Book Pro soaking up the free WIFI and a Strongbow cider, in the dark, feeling cool as fuck. 

It's dark. There's lots of wood. Jazz music on the stereo. This place is awesome. I feel awesome just being here. Well, I usually feel awesome, but now I feel double plus super secret awesome and a half. And it's not just the cider talking. 

As the Terminator said... I'll be back.

There's no sign. Just look for the blue and red OPEN led's in the window.

Wifi key: speakeasy. 

I feel like I'm in one.
