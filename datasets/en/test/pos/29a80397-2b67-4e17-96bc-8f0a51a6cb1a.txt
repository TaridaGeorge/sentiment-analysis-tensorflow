I have to say that I'm very sad it's closed for the summer months, but good for Chris for taking some well deserved time off as this is a one man show.  Chris does everything, I do mean everything, from cooking your meals to washing the dishes.  Every experience I've had there has exceeded my expectations from the food to the service.  This is one of the few hidden treasures of the Valley.  Though do not expect to a quick in and out.  Expect to stay and savor your meal and your dining experience!
