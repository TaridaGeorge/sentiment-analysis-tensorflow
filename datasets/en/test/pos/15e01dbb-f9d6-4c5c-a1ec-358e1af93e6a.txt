This has been the first Salvation Army I have gone to since I've moved to AZ and OMG it's great! I've been to several Goodwill's and thought that they were just ok. Once I came here I asked myself why I hadn't done it sooner. I did notice that some of their furniture was a bit pricey, but everything else was a good shopping experience.
