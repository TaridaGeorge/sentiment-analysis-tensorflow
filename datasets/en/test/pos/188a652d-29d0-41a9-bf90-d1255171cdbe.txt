Serina is one of the best Zumba instructors I've ever had the pleasure of having.  Her energy is contagious and you can't help but smile.  It doesn't even feel like exercise - just a big party!  I recommend it for everyone.  She's so inspiring with her story and her journey - she welcomes all students to take it with her.  Love it!
