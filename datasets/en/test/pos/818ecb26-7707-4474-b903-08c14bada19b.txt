Came here for Food Truck Mania and the location was spacious and was a great venue for fresh food, veggies and organic items.

The food trucks were diverse and prices averaged between $7-$10 for an ''entree''. The vendors ranged from produce, fruit, baked goods, honey and jewelry. 

Parking was a bit tough, but there are meters set up. I believe a lot is right next to the public market but it's $5. 

There were tables and chair set up for you to sit down and enjoy the evening.
