Had a very great dining experience here on Saturday night with a friend. Our waiter was overly friendly and informational. 

As far as the resturant - I don't want to sound like my dad, but the live music was a little loud.  Additionally it seemed like everyone in Scottsdale was celebrating a birthday on Saturday night.

With regards to the food - order the crab cakes - I thought Maryland had great crab cakes until I ate at Eddie V's - simply amazing.  Although not on the online menu I would highly recommend the Swordfish served with diced tomatoes, onions and avacado in a vinegar sauce.  

Overall a great dining experience. Would highly recommend.
