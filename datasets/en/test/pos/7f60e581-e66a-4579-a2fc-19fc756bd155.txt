Lady J & her Brown Skins are kicking butt!  with a great Trio behind her she cannot lose. Just when you think the fabulous lead guitar (with Hendrix and Kravitz inflections), then the base player starts playing rifts that rival. And Lady J, can give Jill Scott and Black Crowes new funkyness...

I love this bar, only one like it in Phoenix. The Rythm Room can only dream.
