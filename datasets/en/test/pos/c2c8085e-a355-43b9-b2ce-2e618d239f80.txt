I dropped in today for lunch, as I have been meaning to do for a while. Before I even tasted the food, I was entirely impressed with the place. While it was busy, the workers still took time to go around and greet many of the customers. I ordered my food to go, and I was surprised how fast they got it out to me.

I ordered the Penne with Meatballz, and it was really great. Though it was a lot to eat, definitely worth the price. Their meatballs are seasoned very well, and would've been great even without the sauce.

Overall, a great place to have lunch. I'll definitely be a regular from here on.
