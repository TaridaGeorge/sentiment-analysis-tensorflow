I'm a fan.
I stopped for some fun gazing at the weekend farmer's market and decided to stay for lunch.  Had a great burger, half pound for $8.45, friendly staff was busy with lunch time crowd but still kept my soda full.  Nice Old West atmosphere.

The table next to me ordered the wings and I could smell them as the server brought them past me.  I'm normally not a fan, but these were exceptionally great smelling and my hound dog nose was aroused.  I asked the orderers and they confirmed they are the best on the valley.
BTW, despite the name, they unfortunately no longer sell steaks for lunch or dinner (I asked).
