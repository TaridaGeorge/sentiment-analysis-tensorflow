We had been so dismayed with the groomers in our area that my husband finally bought his own set of clippers and a grooming table! However, this summer brought us some challenges that left me on a cane and him on crutches, and it is difficult to groom a dog in that state. I called SevenDogs, explained our situation, and they booked an appointment for us the very next morning. They were very friendly, fair-priced, and they did a wonderful job! They even brought my little Schnitzel the Schoodle out to the car for me when I arrived to pick her up so I didn't have to try to handle a dog on a leash while hobbling with a cane. It looks like we have found a new groomer on whom we can depend!
