Easily a place you return to again and again.  Bright, clean and always smells nice.  This was one of the first places I went to upon my move to AZ.   Great array of fresh baked breads (organic and gluten free) You can go breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  I've tried the Chicken Pesto and Feta sandwhich on a cibatta roll, Chicken parmesean ( a little salty), and my favorite, butternut squash ravioli! Don't be fooled by the spaghetti and meatballs - disappointing! They give you weird meatballs on the side!  Other than that, a very classy lunch/dinner spot.  They have wi-fi and a really beautiful glass flower centerpiece that comes down from the ceiling.  Best part: The chocolate chip scone! Buy two or three!
