Always consistently great food. My wife and I are never disappointed in the food here. Imaginative food and drinks. The chef has a great palette for food pairings. She will mix spices from different cuisines and everything will turn out great. This is my wife and mine's favorite restaurant in Phoenix.

We don't even order anymore. We just ask the waiter to bring us whatever he recommends. And we are never dissatisfied. Cool thing is menu always changes with the seasons

This is our go-to restaurant for outta town guests. Even our foodie friends from NYC loved this place.
