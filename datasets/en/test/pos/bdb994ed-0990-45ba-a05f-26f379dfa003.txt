Time and time again I enjoy my visits to Amsterdam!  The trendy hot spot is fun place to start or end a night out in the town.  What keeps me returning to Amsterdam is the JoJo.  Her friendly smile greets you as you come and her fab customer service is much appreciated.  I've been there both on Fridays and Saturdays, despite the hustle and bustle  of all the patrons JoJo makes it a point to connect with each patron and makse them feel welcomed.  Thank you JoJo for your charm and cute smile!
