I LOVE this place so much. I have been volunteering for Liberty for 2 months now. If you are looking for a place to volunteer and get closer to wildlife this is it. I had no experience working with animals before volunteering at Liberty. They taught me everything I needed to know about working with raptors and other birds. The shelter rehabilitates hawks, falcons, eagles, owls, and many other native AZ birds. They have a window up front where they will accept injured birds, and you can call them if you find an injured bird in the wild. They also do educational presentations and bring birds with them! I would highly recommend booking them for an assembly or meeting if you want to learn more about wildlife.

Liberty is a great resource if you find an injured bird or if you are looking for a place to volunteer!
