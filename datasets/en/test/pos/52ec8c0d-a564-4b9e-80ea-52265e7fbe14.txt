I have had the oppertunity to work with these jewlers a couple of times, whether picking out my wedding ring or returning a pearl necklace that my parents bought me they are always five star!  The service is excellent.  I never feel pressured when trying on the same ring for the third year in a row...(still waiting on my hubby to come around on that one!) or guilty for returning something I got as a gift and just didn't like.  They returned it, no questions asked and gave me store credit on the balance.
I love going to their x-mas parties which always have great food and a fun enviroment, plus you can win free stuff!
