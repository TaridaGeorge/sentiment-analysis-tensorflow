Metta is my "home" yoga studio. It is truly a wonderful place to experience yoga. Real honest to goodness Hatha yoga. No hot yoga, no yogarobics, just a very good selection of healing, present, peaceful, strong, positive yoga. The entire staff of this studio is kind, comfortable, helpful and skilled.

I love to be here and enjoy the community that you automatically enter just by going to class here.

They also have a lovely selection of boutique items, in just the right amount.

I am so grateful for Metta!
