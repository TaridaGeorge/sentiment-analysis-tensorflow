Thanks to yelp and the reviews I had a very nice haircut and a friendly conversation. Traveling through an unfamiliar area and trying to find a good barber would've been a bear. All the other reviews were absolutely accurate so I won't repeat. But the top was I got the haircut and hot towel at the senior rate of $14. I am so happy that I signed up with yelp just to write this review.
