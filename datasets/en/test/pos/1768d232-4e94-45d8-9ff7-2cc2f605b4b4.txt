This place gets 5 stars for a couple of reasons. 
1. The prosciutto and brie, apples and fig spread, warm artichoke spread, and the baratta and bacon brisket are amazing. those are the ones i will always order. 
2. For 20 bucks you can get this Delicious food AND a bottle of some of the best pinot noir (which usually costs 11 bucks a glass!!!) 
3. Its the perfect place for a date, and a cheap one at that, on mondays and tuesdays. or a girls night out. 


the only complaint is the wait on mondays and tuesdays. the hostess told us it was an 80 minute wait. it only ended up being 40....wtf. haha
