My review is only for their happy hour, which happens to be AWESOME. $2.95 deals such as a hamburger, shrimp cocktail, steak and gorgonzola bruschetta, and so much more. I must come back here and try everything they offer. It all tasted great. They also have a wide variety of drinks. I ordered the white sangria, which was good. Next time I want to try the strawberry drink. They have wonderful unique options and some have fresh herbs in them. The service was also great. It doesn't get better than happy hour here. I must tell you that if you order the food, there is no special prices for the drinks. However, the drinks are around $7, making the overall deal well worth it.
