I love this tucked away little eatery in Chandler.  It is the first place that comes to mind when I am not in the mood to cook.  The kids are more then thrilled when I recommend it for dinner.

We enjoy the lemon grass chicken, pot stickers, seafood Pho and chicken Pho.

The staff is always so nice no matter how busy they get.
