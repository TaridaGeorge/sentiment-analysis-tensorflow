If you're looking for AUTHENTIC Chinese food, then this is the place! Obviously, you have to stay away from the lunch buffet, which is American style Chinese food. And, you may have to ask for the "Chinese menu" (lots of authentic Chinese restaurants have an American menu and a Chinese menu... I'm not sure if its the case here, but they always give us a menu stocked with authentic food).

Some of our favorites are the black fungus (mushroom) with beef, and the tofu with red chili peppers.

Seriously, one of my favorite Chinese restaurants.
