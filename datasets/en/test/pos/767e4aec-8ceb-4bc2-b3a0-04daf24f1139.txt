I had just bought a car from a friend who lives in Phoenix and she said I needed tires. I was planning to drive back to California but needed to get tires first. I picked the Big O on West Bell because it was near her house and she could drop the car off. Not only did I get a great price, one of the staff drove her home so she didn't have to walk or take the bus. I got great tires, an oil change, and great service from the guys at the West Bell location. Thanks Guys!
