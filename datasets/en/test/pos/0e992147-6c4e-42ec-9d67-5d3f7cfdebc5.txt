Heard about this place from a friend and really wanted to try it out. To start out, the service was impeccable. I have a dairy allergy and Gina, our server, went above and beyond to accommodate me.  She even made my wife a special mocktail since she is pregnant.  The atmosphere is great- very comfortable.  The food was also excellent. We started with the chopped salad, which is the classic Cowboy Ciao chopped salad you could never go wrong with. I followed this with the chicken which was cooked to perfection with a risotto side.  My wife had the grilled cheese which she enjoyed (though not her favorite).  All in all, the five stars goes for the atmosphere, drink menu and service and good food....
