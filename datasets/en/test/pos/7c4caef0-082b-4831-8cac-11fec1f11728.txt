The food at Genghis Grill is great!  If you screw it up, it's your own fault and there's no one else to blame but yourself.  If you have trouble (or are not Genghis Grill bowl mix-masters like the local pros), there are food cards on the wall that will guide you to preparing the perfect meal.

It takes some skill to master the process of putting together your own bowl perfectly, but if you're not savvy with preparing a bowl, just grab a food card and go!
