Went to our first spring training game on a nice, warm Sunday afternoon....Giants v diamondbacks. What a great facility. First, so close to our place, we rode our bikes. Convenient bike racks out front and we saved $5 on parking. Not a bad seat in the place, we sat in the front row down from the dugout on the 1st baseline. Great view of the pitchers warming up and the players walking back and forth. Nice new facilities....clean bathrooms, good concessions, plenty of services and a nice, friendly crowd, even if you're a Giants fan!
We had good margaritas from Saltys and yummy, warm chocolate chip cookies. 

We are going to another game next week at night during the week, so we will see how that is. And I'm looking forward to checking out some of their other upcoming events once spring training is done.
