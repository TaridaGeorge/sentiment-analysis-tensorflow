Tuning Gruppe is a great performance and maintenance shop. No job is too big or too small. I had a promblem with my timing belt and it was fixed asap for a competetive price. Eric was friendly and didnt try to up sell me or add stuff on that wasnt needed but did inform me of stuff to watch out for in the future. they specialize in european cars (vw, audi, bmw, benz, porsche, etc) but i even saw a few american and japanese cars getting work done while i was there. dont let the small shop fool you, these guys do amazing work!
