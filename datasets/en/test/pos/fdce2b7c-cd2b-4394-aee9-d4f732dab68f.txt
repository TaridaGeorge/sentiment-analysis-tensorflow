Kaz Bar is a really cool place.  I can't believe I haven't reviewed it yet.  It definitely has a romantic atmosphere and the noshes are delicious.  There is live entertainment during the week and we happened to stop by on a Monday night.  We actually met Margo Reed not knowing that she was going to be performing that night.  She is awesome.
