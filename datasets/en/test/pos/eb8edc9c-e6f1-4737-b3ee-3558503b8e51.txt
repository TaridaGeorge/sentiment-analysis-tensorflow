Paletas Betty is a nice, clean, hip little local joint that specializes in handcrafted mexican ice pops, made with fresh ingredients in small batches. These are not wimpy pops. Several varieties have chunks of fresh ingredients lodged in their frozen goodness, like the Nuez with chunks of pecans. When you're so stuffed from eating in the nearby restaurants, walk it off down to Paletas Betty, where you can pick a pretty hefty but light & refreshing specialty popsicle. We've treated ourselves three times now and have always completely cleaned off our popsicle sticks.
