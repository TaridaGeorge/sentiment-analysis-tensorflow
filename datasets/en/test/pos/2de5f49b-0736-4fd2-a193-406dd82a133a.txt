This was the best bar in AZ by far! 

The owners were the BEST ever and the bartender Bruce was awesome! 

Drinks were cheap and they had the BEST jukebox ever. 

Show nights the place was packed an super full of all kinds of sexy!  

Non show nights were my fav though. Fun people!

I cried when this bar closed! I am still totally lost without it! :( 

Where will I go now?!

Free pool... awesome cheap jukebox an PBR! Where else can I get my fix?!
