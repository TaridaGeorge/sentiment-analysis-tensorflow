Market Bistro is one of my neighborhood favorites. I have tried most of the menu and the only thing I have chosen not to eat is the ciabatta bread. I ask for Focaccia  bread on all my sandwiches now. The Ciabatta is a little too hard for me to chew. The price point is great and the staff is always friendly... build your own salads are amazing!  Now I have to follow them on Twitter to see what Bridget K. was talking about!
