WARNING: THIS IS THE SADDEST YELP REVIEW YOU'VE EVER READ.

i'm so sad this location closed.

i used to come here at least once a week and peruse their used selection.  i'd leave work hating my life, and would go to zia to restore my faith in mankind.  i don't know how much money i spent at this place, but i could have always bought more.  so much good stuff, such good prices. i never realized how good it was until one night, zia died in my sleep. 

i woke up, went to work, and decided to swing by zia on the way home, and it was gone...and a huge part of my heart died.

i'll never forget you, zia at t-bird & 40th st. you were good to me, and I never even really appreciated you. Goodbye, dear friend- I hope we meet again some day.
