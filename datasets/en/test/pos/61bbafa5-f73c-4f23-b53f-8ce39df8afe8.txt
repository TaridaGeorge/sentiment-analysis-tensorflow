Try chicken noodles, its the bomb. They  have great lunch menu. Red curry, Yellow curry are great. Tom yum and Tom Ka are great . Make sure you pick 1-5 and stay within 3. its a bit packed during lunch, i wish they could turn around faster during lunch, oh well, its worth the wait. My asian colleagues who travel for short visits at least go here once and love it every time. need I say more, officially addicted to swadee!
