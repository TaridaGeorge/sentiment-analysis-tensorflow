I've been searching for a stylist since my usual stylist left almost a year ago from Anthem.  I called in and got scheduled in with Lisa the same day.  Lisa is great - not only did she fix some nasty "oops" cutting issues with my trying to find a person to do my hair, but she also redid my highlights so they look amazing.  She does an awesome job and my highlights don't fade out to the straw-color they were notorious for fading too.  I have found my stylist!
