This is the BEST bookstore in the valley -- and it's an independent establishment! 

You can find great deals on new and used books, plus tons of unique gifts. Make this a day trip, as you will get lost in here for hours on end.

+ check out RedSeven Computers (across the street by Frys) for the coolest computer geeks in town.
