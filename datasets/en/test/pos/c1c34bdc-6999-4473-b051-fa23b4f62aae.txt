This place is right down the street from my new office, and thank goodness! They have a wide range of baked goods, including gourmet breads and pastries, cookies, and other goodies (even fresh hummus!), as well as great iced tea and other drinks. I walked down there today and got a wonderfully delicious sandwich on their fresh 9-grain bread, along with chips and a drink for under $8. The staff and owner are all friendly, the place is charming and has dine-in seating indoors or on the patio, and they make it fast and fresh. Thanks, Bread Basket! You guys are awesome. I'll be coming in more often for sure.
