Truth be told, great happy hour. Very strong drinks, we all know I'm a fan of that :) I just had to try the Lemoncello Margarita, I mean come on...awesome idea! I loved it.

It was hard to find parking close to the place though. Something nearby must be REALLY popular, because it was packed. I was nervous there wouldn't be enough room for my group, but surprisingly there was...plenty.

RECOMMENDATIONS: Lemoncello Margarita, and the Tempura Green Beans!
