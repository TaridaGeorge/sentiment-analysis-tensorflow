I got the best customer service here.  I only stop by this location to pick up little things I need since I don't cook.  I was recently in there and someone put my grocery on the belt, offered to take my items to my car. WOW!  

I like this location because it is convenient, and it's clean and friendly.  I just learn there's a new manager there name Buck.  Young and friendly, probably why I got really good service.  I am hoping to get the same service upon my returns.
