Have missed having a Cine Capri around throughout my adolescent years because I did see a few movies at the original Cine Capri in Biltmore area in the 1990s as a wee kid. 

I have probably only seen about 10 movies or so at this theatre but it is always a great experiences. The best seats probably have to be on the row just below the walkway in the middle. Right there because one can see the whole screen without other seats getting in the way.
