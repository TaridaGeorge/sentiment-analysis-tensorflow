I love Frys. The employee's are very nice and Debbie the post office/customer service employee is nice, she may look like a bitch but she's not. Just don't piss her and you will be fine.

I moved from Scottsdale while rennovations where being done, so this review is striclty prior. The meat department has the best cuts of meat, the deli is connected to the hot ready to go food. The whole store looks classy.

You have the liquor, beer and champagne section together next to customer service.
