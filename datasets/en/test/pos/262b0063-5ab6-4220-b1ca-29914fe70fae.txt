I went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago with my bosses. It was packed on a Friday - we sat at the bar and our cook was fantastic! We got to sit and chat with him while he worked away at the orders. I had the chicken pesto pasty and it was wonderful! the bread used is similar to a pastry dough type...but not as sweet. The pasty was so filling, I could barely finish it.

My bosses have been there before and have always wanted to try the peanut butter and jelly pasty - so we all split it as dessert and it was so good. They put bananas in it and drizzle jelly over the whole pasty. It's definitely rich and gooey. 

I would totally go back here again and have told my friends about it too! Amazing place.
