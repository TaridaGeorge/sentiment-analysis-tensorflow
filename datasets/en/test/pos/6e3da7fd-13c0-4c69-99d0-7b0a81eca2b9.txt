I had been wanting to try Bomberos for quite some time and all my friends were reluctant, so I went alone!  I sat on their beautiful, relaxing patio with a book, glass of the Pinot Black (amazing) and 3 scrumptious bruschetta! The music was relaxing and authentic and I was able to enjoy it even more when the loud politician who was yelling into his phone about the election finally left--I will not mention who, but he lost my vote purely on the basis of his poor manners!

Anyway, I text my friends that I was right about Bomberos and they came to meet me for more wine and an amazing cheese plate!  In total, I was there for 4.5 hours!  YUMMMMY!

I would be in support of a happy hour -- what do you say, Bomberos?!
