Bravo! Lucia di Lammermoor.
If you enjoy opera, don't miss this wonderful performance put on by the Arizona Opera. This was my first "Lucia" and it greatly surpassed my expectations. It is definitely an opera I would enjoy again. We are so fortunate to have this available to us here in Phoenix. We flew out to LA to see La Boheme a few months ago and my wife and I both agreed that LA Opera doesn't have anything over the Arizona Opera. Keep up the good work folks!
