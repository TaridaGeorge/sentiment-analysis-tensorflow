Although I have been dining here for years and am sure have written a review, I feel compelled to add another after last night's New Years Eve dinner.   We usually avoid holiday dinners out as the restaurants usually cannot handle the increases numbers.   Not so here!   The food was superb, service more than acceptable and a bargain to boot!
