Love this place.

A low key, local spot to get some authentic Vietnamese.  Not sure why there are such harsh complaints posted here.  I've been to the restaurant several times and the food/service/price have been spot on!  Even though it's called the "noodle" ranch, I usually get spring rolls and some entree... I am not one of those that judges Vietnamese spots by the Pho alone.  I've ordered their Pho and i've enjoyed, but there is much more on the menu to try.  The Thai Tea could be a bit sweeter/richer -- but maybe it's a good thing not to guzzle down liquid sugar.

P.S To the poster who claims their broth is bland: You can let the waiter know if you want extra heat ;)
