When our beloved family doctor "retired" , I was so worried about how anyone could even come close to his caring medical skills.  We went through a few replacements and then lucked out with Dr. Chad Campbell.  He listens to our concerns and responds with appropriate treatment.  We like him and hope he stays here forever.  Hey, when your nurse daughter and paramedic son say that they like him - that speaks VOLUMES!
