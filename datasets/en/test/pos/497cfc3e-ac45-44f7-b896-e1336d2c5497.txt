Was pleasantly surprised when we tried out this "new" (7 months now) pizza place in Gilbert tonight. We ordered a medium half-and-half pizza (half Carnitas Libre and half Quattro). Both specialty pizzas were great. The crust was good... not too much or too little and the toppings seemed fresh. 

The interior has a bar area to the right and a dining room to the left - lots of big booths in the diring room which we liked a lot. The service was fantastic; Gabriell took great care of us and gave us her expert recommendations, which worked perfectly for us. 

They also have a carry-out door, nice outdoor patio & a huge selection of beers on tap. We'll definitely be back.
