Stepping foot into LGO makes me want to move to the Arcadia area immediately! It is absolute madness inside, filled with Lululemon clad young professionals, the smell of yummy breakfast in the air (perhaps with a hint of Michael Kors "Very Hollywood" ;)), smiles from all of the employees, and super cute season appropriate trinkets. 

Every time I have gone it has been PACKED, but so worth the wait! A friend & I went on a Sunday morning after an intense bootcamp session to refuel with egg white omelettes, mine with avacado, hers with Veggies. Perfect AM protein fix! I've only been for breakfast, but I am dying to hit the pizzeria for dinner. Absolutely darling.
