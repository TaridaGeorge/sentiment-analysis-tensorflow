I don't get to the U.K. often enough, so this place is a bit o' for me: just enough $$ spent on keeping the inspector from shutting the place down, the rest of the hard-earned margin goes into the owners' pockets. 

I have no idea what this long sliver of a place used to be, but it's become heaven for publovers since - a bar that stretches all the way east to Apache Junction with barstools stretching all the way back to the Flintstones, and teensy little 2fer tablet-tables squeezed into the longwall across. 

Seemingly dozens of line cooks doubling as servers, seemingly dozens of taps serving wonderful fermented grains, and the meat, fish and veggie pies - my island ancestors never had it so good!
