LOVE this place!!!! oatmeal cookie flavor is to DIE for, as is the cookies and cream and the mint...no fancy toppings for me, just the graham cracker crumbs.....it's very good on it's own with NO toppings as well. Allergy ingredients are clearly written on the flavor cards, and even a peanut allergic person could consume their products...way to go Yogurtology!!!
