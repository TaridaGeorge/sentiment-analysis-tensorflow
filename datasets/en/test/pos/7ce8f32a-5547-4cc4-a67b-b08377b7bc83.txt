I feel like an alcoholic when I visit Total Wine. I really don't drink much, maybe an average of a drink a week, but when I walk through those doors I'm like a kid at FAO Schwarz... I want everything. The bottles all gleaming under the lights, the thousands of selections tempting my every step, the ridiculously helpful staff around each corner explaining every product down to its molecular anatomy, those little price tags that seem too good to be true... what else do I need to say. Five stars.
