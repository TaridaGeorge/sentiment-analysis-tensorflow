Loved it!!!

We went there last Friday night to be romantic and it definitely did the trick. I had never experienced a BYOB restaurant before and after experiencing it first hand I am hooked. We started the evening with the fillet Mignon tacos and they were fabulous, the perfect start. I had the chicken breast. It was stuffed with goodness and was served with squash, corn, and garlic mashed potatoes. A drizzle of pesto lined the outside of the dish and was the perfect accompaniment. My husband has the salmon as was very impressed (I don't do fish so I can't go into more detail). For dessert we had the four berry tarte, it was warm and the perfect end to a fabulous meal. They serve the type of food that continues to come up in conversation throughout the evening, in a good way.
