My daughter and I wandered in one Saturday afternoon-- little did I know that it would become our favorite new lunch spot!  I had the proscuitto and fig panini, which was outstanding!  My daughter's grilled cheese was so oozy with melted goodness, she immediately proclaimed herself the Cheese Monster ( when you're 6 years old, you can make such proclamations).  Staff was so friendly!  We found ourselves there again the following Saturday and look forward to visiting there regularly!  PS:  Their specialty milkshakes and coffee drinks are amazing as well!
