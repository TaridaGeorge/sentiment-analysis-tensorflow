Absolutely my favorite chinese place in all of Surprise and more than likely out of any place I have tried throughout my life. Every dish I have ever ordered has been fabulous. The people who own/work here are very sweet. The location itself is somewhat small inside but also offers outside patio dining. While I have dined in on occasion, I prefer takeout to get my chinese fix! The orange chicken is literally my all time favorite dish!
