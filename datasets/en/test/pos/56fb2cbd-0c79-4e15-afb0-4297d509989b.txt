I must admit I was very skeptical before going.  it's just a sandwich/wrap shop I thought to myself.  I was surprised with the quality of the food.  We ordered the d'veggie bowl and it was amazing.  The vegetables were fresh and crisp.  They were out of quinoa, and rice was substituted, but it fit the bowl perfectly.  The sauce was tasty without being overpowering.  Friendly service.  Excellent place.

Hopefully, i'll get a chance to go back.
