Some of the best pizza I've had in Phoenix. I prefer to get takeout since the inside is a little...eh... but who cares if the food's good! I love the crust, crispy and slightly chewy. The pizza can be a little greasy sometimes (but hey, it's pizza), but as long as it doesn't soak through and make the crust all flimsy (which has never happened with the pizzas I get here!) it's nothing that a paper towel or two can't fix! I'm not a big wing person but my dad has had them and he says they're pretty good.

The staff has always been super-friendly, and they actually remember me, even though I only come in once every couple months!
