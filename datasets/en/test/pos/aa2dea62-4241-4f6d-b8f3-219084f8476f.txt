My husband and I had a great dinner here.  I had the pork osso buco and he had the pasta trio.  Both were fabulous!   The quiet atmosphere and attentive service were a nice treat after several meals at other local restaurants that were very noisy and crowded.  The wine list was impressive and the waiter was helpful recommending wine.
