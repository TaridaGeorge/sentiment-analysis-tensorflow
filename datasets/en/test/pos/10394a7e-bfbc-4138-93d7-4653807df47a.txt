I've only eaten here twice but both times ive been pleasantly surprised by the price.  I'm no steak connoisseur but I love me some dead bloody cow that's cooked right.  Both times our waitress was pleasant- that's right "waitress", and I just assume that I'm going to get nickel and dinged for everything. Don't get me wrong, they're always trying to upsell you with certain fixings, but it's mostly low key.  I am now sold on this place.  2 adults, 2 kids, blooming onion, big beer- under $65 out the door
