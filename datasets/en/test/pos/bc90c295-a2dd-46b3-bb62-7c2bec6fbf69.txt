You're experience here will vary greatly depending on what you order. Even though the atmosphere says "drinks and tapas" the bigger, heartier meals on the menu are where Vintage 95 really hits the spot. 

My suggestion? Pork Belly

Next Suggestion? Pork Belly!

Out of pork belly? Bruscetta, but come back next time for the Pork Belly. 

PS - Kudos to whoever made the music playlist.
