Cloud Nine Labs took an arthritic old site and has breathed new life into it with both the design and the functionality.  Our readers and customers like all of the changes and traffic is up substantially.  Ethan told me to discuss what I wanted and draw it out - he got what I wanted.  He also scrapped several of my ideas and showed me how it could work even better.  I trusted him and he delivered.  While we are still posting 10 plus years of archival stories to the Aegis Journal to the blog site, it already a winner. Go look for yourselves.
