This place was really pricey but extremely delicious! I loved their stuffed mushrooms as well as their filet mignon, minus the blu cheese sauce, ew. Everything was delicious but the portions were really small and basically a bummer because you wanted more and left with a half empty stomach. :/

I would go here for possibly breakfast or brunch but nothing that you would want to be full from. This is the kind of place that once you go here a couple hours later you're going to drive through In-N-Out.

Overall it was pretty good with high prices and small servings. Would go here again if I was in the area.
