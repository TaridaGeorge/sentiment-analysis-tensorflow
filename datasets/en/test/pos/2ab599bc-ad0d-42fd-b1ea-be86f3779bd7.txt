This is a bit out of the way but I was pleasantly surprised.   They got us in very quick and did a nice job on the pedi.   Even the hub was pleased as she brought out the power sander (just kidding) to our dry dry feet.   The prices are competitive and the massage chairs were some of the best around.   

The creative design on my toes was no challenge and turned out awesome.
