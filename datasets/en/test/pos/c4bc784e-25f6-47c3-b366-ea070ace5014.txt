My toes curl every time I think about this place. It's like some higher power assembled a store that caters to my primary vice in life: alcohol. 

There are items here of which I've never heard, but have every intention of trying. Mostly what I'm excited about is being able to expand my vodka experience, and have already tried two different brands. Both were to my satisfaction. 

This location is perfect for me--close enough that it's not a special trip but far enough away to not be a daily visit.

Would it be pretentious of me to mention that my birthday is approaching and gift certificates at Total Wine are on my b-day list?
