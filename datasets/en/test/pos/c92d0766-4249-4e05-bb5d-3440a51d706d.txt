This is one of my favorite music venues in the Valley.  It's an outdoor grass venue that is big enough to get good bands but small enough to feel intimate.  It's all open so you can get right up there next to the stage.  I saw Modest Mouse here last year and am looking forward to seeing Death Cab for Cutie this December.  Keep your eye on the concert schedule.
