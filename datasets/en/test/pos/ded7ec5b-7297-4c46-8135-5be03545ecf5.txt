Saw Ballet Arizona performance of Giselle at Symphony Hall opening night last night, and I have to say what a beautiful performance! The music was perfect, the story line was easy to follow, I had received a program before it started, but didn't look at it until intermission and I was able to keep up with everything that was going on.  

The dancers, wow just beautiful to watch. Thank you Ballet Arizona for the beautiful performance! Look forward to seeing other productions in the future !
