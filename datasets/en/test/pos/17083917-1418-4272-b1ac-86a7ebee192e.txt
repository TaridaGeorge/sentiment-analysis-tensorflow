This is by far the BEST Thai food you can get in Arizona.

The food is amazing. I have tried several different options here including the hot and sour soup, pad Thai, coconut curry with tofu, a noodle dish with egg and basil and a tofu dish with broccoli. I have never ever been disappointed!

The service is really good and quick, and the prices are right on par.

We used to come here for lunch about once a week when I worked closer, and I used to make a second trip with my roommate at least twice a month.


My old boss used to get a Thai Omelet... so if you are into those, you can ask for a special order!

OH YEAH... I forgot, they have window service so you can actually order take out and never get out of your car! It's awesome!
