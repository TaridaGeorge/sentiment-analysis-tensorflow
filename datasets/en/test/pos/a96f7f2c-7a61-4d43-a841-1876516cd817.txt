I love Gelato Spot and I'm thrilled that they have a location near the movie theater as well! Their gelato is creamy, fresh, and hits the spot on a summer day. My favorite gelato includes the snickers and brownie. I'm a sucker for chocolate so you can see where my gelato love lies. 

I like this location because it's breezy and roomy. There's not much more to add but I always suggest the Gelato Spot if someone is looking for good gelato in the Valley.
