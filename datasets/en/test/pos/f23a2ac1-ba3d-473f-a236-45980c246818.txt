I finally got around to trying this place and so far it has been the best part of my trip (besides seeing my family of course, lol).  The food was excellent, prices were reasonable, and the service is outstanding.  I got the number 10, which had two chicken legs and one waffle, plus I added a side of mac and cheese.  The chicken was awesome.  Not too much breading.  The waffle was light but crispy.  Put those two together and it was perfection.  The mac and cheese was overcooked, but it still had good flavor.  I will probably try another side next time.  Overall, it was a great and everyone in my group walked away with a great experience. We went for lunch and we are considering going back for dinner!
