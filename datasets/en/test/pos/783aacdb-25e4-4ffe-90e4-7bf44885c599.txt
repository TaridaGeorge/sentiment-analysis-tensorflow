Just gotta say yummy... so good it tickles... dw, my son, got the terriaki Burger... ummmm really??? With a fried pineapple slice.... let's just talk about the housemade terriaki sauce... and not your typical bun either... listen... don't get me wrong... its a Burger joint... BUT it's not 'just' another Burger joint... after all the 'taste is outta this world'... and the fries... exceptional!!! 

On to the cherry... they probably have over 200 different sodas... old school favs and some new school stuff... everything from Virgil's root beer... to the ever natural Oogave drinks... they even have one called dog snot and Kitty pittle (not feeling THAT adventurous today)... creamy deliciousness... 

Whether it's next door to you... or across town... it is DEFINITELY worth the ride...
