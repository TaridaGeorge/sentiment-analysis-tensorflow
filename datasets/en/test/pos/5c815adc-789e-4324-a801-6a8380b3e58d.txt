Oh how I love this place!  I only wish I could afford to eat here more often.  LOL.  City Hall is arguably my favorite steakhouse EVER.  I always get the filet, and it just completely melts in my mouth.  Every bite is like a piece of heaven.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  Another must is the lobster mashed potatoes.  I know, it's like $30 for a side dish.  But trust me, it is well worth it, with big chunks of lobster generously layered in every bite, and the potatoes are whipped to smooth and creamy perfection.  

The service at City Hall is always top notch.  And they have a wonderfully diverse wine list!  This is a must if you are visiting the Valley.
