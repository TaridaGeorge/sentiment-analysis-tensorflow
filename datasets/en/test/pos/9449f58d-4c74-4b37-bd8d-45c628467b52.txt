La Boca is one of my all time favorite restaurants in Tempe, heck Arizona for that matter. 

I went to ASU so of course it was close. but.... it has the BEST bruschetta. I think its better than Postinos, yes I said that! The reason I say that is because when you order the mozzarella, tomato, basil La Boca puts E.V.O.O (extra virgin olive oil), Salt, Pepper, and Balsamic. Postinos doesn't do any of that. 

The pizza's are wonderful the Mediterranean plate, shoot everything here is amazing.
