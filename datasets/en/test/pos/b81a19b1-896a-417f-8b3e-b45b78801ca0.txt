Always fresh ingredients. Try spinach and basil with mushroom. Crispy and tasty crust. I am a big fan of "real" pizza and not the mass produced, processed style. You can tell Florencia's takes pride in the pizzas they produce, even the takeouts. While I do not eat there often, it is close enough to be a great stand by when we want great, gourmet pizza.
