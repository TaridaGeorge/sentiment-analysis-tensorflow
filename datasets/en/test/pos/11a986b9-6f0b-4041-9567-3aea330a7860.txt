Forget the hassle of Fry's or Safeway....Fresh and Easy is so convenient, inexpensive and has almost everything!  I hate grocery shopping, but I love going to Fresh and Easy.  They have great fresh fruits, veggies and meats.  You can get in and out quickly and avoid the big, full parking lots and long lines.  This is the perfect store for singles our couples because a lot of the foods come in single/double servings.  LOVE IT!!
