My husband and I found this restaurant at the suggestion of a casino worker.  We are from out of town and ate here twice during out 10 day stay.  The food was AMAZING!!  The crab boil was fabulous!  My only complaint is I can't find a recipe for it to recreate at home.  We may have to fly back just to eat there again!
