Please eat here if you love Thai food as much as I do! I've never been disappointed! The beef pad thai is some of the best I've ever tasted. The tom ka gai, rad nar, garlic chicken, and pretty much everything else I've ever ordered here is great. I try to get one new thing each time I go.

This is also the first place I tried Thai coffee. Excellent! You won't be disappointed.
