Gorgeous place, great location.  I generally ignore protruding plastic, as a safety precaution, but I don't come here for swimming anyway. Although, the pool is just beautiful when no one is in it :) I've come for sushi, yoga, happy hour drinks and appetizers, and after hours, and every time I have felt it was a 5 star experience. From the bartenders, to cocktail servers, hostesses, and security, everyone was definitely screened well by their employer. Great manners, friendly smiles, prompt, professional service. I look forward to returning soon.
