Even though this is a new company to the united states, it's apparently been around in Germany for almost 100 years. They are the "Enterprise of Europe," as the customer service counter rep likes to point out. 

They ran out of compacts, so I got a free upgrade to a brand new 2013 Hyundai Sonata with only 1100 miles on it (that car itself is worth a five star rating).  The price for a two day rental was HALF the price of Enterprise / Hertz, and was even cheaper than Fox car rental!

One minor tip - please consider changing that crazy name. It sounds too close to something that teenagers do (s*xting).
