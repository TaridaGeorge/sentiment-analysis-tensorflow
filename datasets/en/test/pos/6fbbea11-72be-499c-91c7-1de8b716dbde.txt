Excellent Italian salumeria in Scottsdale. Pricey if you think you are entering a typical deli, but this is no typical deli. This is and Italian deli by Little Italy, NY standards. Get the Purista sandwich. Prosciutto, fresh mozz, roasted peppers and arugala. If I move here I know I'll have a little bit of home right down the block.
