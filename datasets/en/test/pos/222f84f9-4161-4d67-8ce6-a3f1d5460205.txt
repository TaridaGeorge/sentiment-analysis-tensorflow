From the outside you would never expect such a comfortable and friendly little bar. The food is fantastic, music is always great and I love the ambiance that comes with such a tiny and dark little bar. That may be a complaint for some but it feels so much more comfortable and inviting to me. The wait can sometimes be long but it is worth completely worthwhile. I'm very excited for the expansion project to get underway, this restaurant is perfect.
