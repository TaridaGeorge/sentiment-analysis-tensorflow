I discovered Habit a few months ago, and it's now becoming a regular stop for me. I've tried most of their burgers but the reason I keep going back is their veggie burger. Where else in town can you find a huge, delicious, fresh, healthy veggie burger for under five bucks that includes cucumber slices, sprouts, lettuce and tomato on a perfectly toasted whole wheat bun? I usually add avocado also, but the up charge is minimal. As many other reviewers have said, the fries and onion rings are always fresh and perfectly crispy. 

After visiting a few Habits, I've learned that the staff is always friendly, but the staff at the 7th Street/Glendale location is a step above. If you stop in, say hello to Theresa and Miranda, who always go the extra mile for me.
