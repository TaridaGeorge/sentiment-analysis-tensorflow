Best pizza in North Scottsdale, hand down. 

The sauce is what makes these pies delicious, never had anything like it before. The cheese and thin crust add to the flavor, makes it very easy to dip the pieces into a plate of olive oil. 

I've always picked up the food, never have experienced the dinning room atmosphere, but if your in the neighbor hood, I would try it out. Don't waste another dollar on the big pizza chains, Spinato's is well worth the extra money.  

When friends come  into town, here is my to-do list:

1. Introduce Spinato's into their life.
2. Everything else. 

Maybe I just like pizza too much...
