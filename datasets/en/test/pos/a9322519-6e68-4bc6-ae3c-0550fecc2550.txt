I found Diamond D through Yelp.com and hired him to install a new bath fan. He was so polite and even EARLY! Can't remember the last time a handyman was so punctual!. He finished the work and was even nice enough to install a towel rack last second. A HUGE plus for me was that he even texts which is super helpful. We will remember him to use in the future!
