YC's is Yummy! Choose whatever you want for meats and veggies, then whatever combination of sauce you want on it, and they wok it up for you! I always buy a to-go container for 50 cents because it is a small price to pay for another meal and I always end up with extra. I recommend the wheat noodles, they are really good. The meal includes crunchy wonton chips with sweet and sour sauce, soup, white or brown rice, and frozen yogurt at the end. Its a good deal for the money! :)
