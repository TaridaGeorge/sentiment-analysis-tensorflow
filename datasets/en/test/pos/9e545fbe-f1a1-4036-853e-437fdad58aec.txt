After noticing this place from living in the area I looked up the reviews and was excited to see that most gave this place rave reviews. 

I ordered the deep dish Vito's special since it was highly recommended and went to pick it up..you can tell this pizza had some weight to it. Pizza was super tasty, smothered with rich tomato sauce, peppers, onions and sausage on a soft cheesy perfectly cooked crust. My mouth is watering as I write this lol. I can't wait to try all of them. 

Now I have lived in what I consider one of the nicer neighborhoods near Vito's and while its not The Biltmore this strip mall isn't as bad as most claim. It's actually really clean with some nice local businesses in it. I find myself lucky to claim this little neighborhood restaurant.
