Hayes is amazing. I'm not a coffee drinker, but I do love the smell of coffee and you can smell Hayes' coffee from around the block. Just follow your nose and you'll find his cute shop. I always get the jasmine green tea, really unique and tasty! I love going into Royal because the staff there always make me feel welcome and treat me like a regular, even though I only go every couple of months when I'm in the area. My sister who came to visit has fallen in LOVE with the Royal's cold brew coffee and I have since purchased 3 bags for her and sent them to her because she wont drink any other. That's gotta say something!
