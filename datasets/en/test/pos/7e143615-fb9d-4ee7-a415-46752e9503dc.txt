Comments:
Awesome Foie Gras and Entre Dishes.  We came here almost every week when we were on our business trip.  The atmosphere was very nice with outdoor and indoor seating.  The lamps give it a nice european feel to it.  The bread was a gruyere bread before the meal and it was good too.

Nothing really to complain about here all of it reasonably priced with Appetizers starting at $10 and Entrees more around $15 - $26.
