Wow! This place lacks for nothing. Superb food and top notch service. What more can you ask for?

I had lunch here recently and was simply amazed at the attention to detail. The staff was the epitome of "professional," friendly and attentive. The decor is upscale, yet inviting. Most importantly, the food  was outstanding in every way. It was one of those times where you take a few extra bites past "full" because the flavor is THAT good.

Highlights: check out the Calamari appetizer, the Tenderloin Sliders, the Truffle Fries, and the Stoli Doli.

If there's one drawback to Capital Grille, it's the prices. This place is expensive. Still, if you go in knowing this in advance, you won't have anything else to gripe about. Capital Grille will take good care of you. I can't wait to return.
