Definitely the best Thai food restaurant in Chandler. Way better than Thai Rama or Latitude 8.

The chicken larb is awesome and so flavorful. My usual is the pad thai, which is excellent here. I always have to ask for extra lime at other places but their pad Thai already has tons of lime flavor. 

Check it out! I don't want this place to go out of business!
