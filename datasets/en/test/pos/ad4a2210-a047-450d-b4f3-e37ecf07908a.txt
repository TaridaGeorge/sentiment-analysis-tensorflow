This place is just plain great. If you want fancy its not gonna work out. If you want service to kiss your butt it aint gonna work out.

If you want great food then its gonna be a ok.

Have tried many versions of the Pho and all are great. The spring rolls are a delight, and the coconuts are a treat.

Its Pho-tastic!

Only complaint is that they close too early. If this was open till 2am on the weekends I would be there every Friday!
