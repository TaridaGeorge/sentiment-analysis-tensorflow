Excellent, excellent, excellent. They finally are offering the lamb shanks - and were they delicious! Cooked perfectly, in a very tasty sauce. The kabobs - as usual- were very good, too. A lot of love goes into these family recipies - if you like generic mediterranen food, go somewhere else - this is the real this. This is a favorite place of ours - family owned and operated.
