Very inviting and friendly atmosphere, no pressure while your looking either. They have a great selection of teas and a few samples to try. The lady was so helpful and patient, my mom and I were probably in there for over half an hour. They have beauty products and very unique tea cups. I will definitely be back here.

Oh and another bonus is they have great hours!
