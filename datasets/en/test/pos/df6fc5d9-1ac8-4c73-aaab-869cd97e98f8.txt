I am writing this review based solely on the little known fact that there is an automated package kiosk in the lobby!  

Tired of waiting in line?
Need to mail that package after 7pm?
Can you use a computer or cellphone?

If you answered YES to any of the above questions, get to this USPS when mailing your next package!  Granted, it should NOT be the size of a bicycle or big-screen TV.
Shoebox size or smaller?  This is the place you.  I stopped in last night, NO WAITING!
Perfect.
