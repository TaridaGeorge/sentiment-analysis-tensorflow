Awesome. 

Cool. Original, unique design. Nice and lovely people. Free wireless. Free computer/printing in the lobby. Great bar and restaurant. Good looking people, which is always nice... I saw a band I like staying there too. The owner struck up a convo with me and she was very nice and invited me to a host of additions if I wanted. I stayed for four nights for work and had a great time. Wireless included (which is a big plus for me). Plus, the pool is just lovely!
