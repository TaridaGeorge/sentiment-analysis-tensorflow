I love this place. It's a little bit of the Bronx right here in dusty Phoenix. The thing I crave of theirs is the stromboli, which is filled to bursting with fresh ingredients. It's often my choice for my cheats on my diet. Gotta love when New Yorkers come in and show the rest of the town how it's done.
