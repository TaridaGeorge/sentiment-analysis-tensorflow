I can start off by saying that I crave Postino's!!

Was introduced to this place by a friend one Friday night, and have been a fan since! Everything that I've ordered since I have been there has been super tasty. They have a wide selection of wines, beer, and all types of drinks.

Their bruschetta board is probably the best thing on the menu! I tried some of their sandwiches which are amazing. The salads that come with the sandwiches are even better, especially the one with walnuts (not sure the name). This is a place to visit, and trust me, you will become a fan from the first bite.
