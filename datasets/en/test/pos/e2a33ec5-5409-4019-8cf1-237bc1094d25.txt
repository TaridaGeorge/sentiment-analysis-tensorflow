Still a fan!

This time around I tried the Chicken Hummus Platter. DE-lish! 

I phoned in the order with no problems. The chicken had a nice seasoning to it and their  hummus is simply wonderful! I don't know why I didn't try this place out sooner. 

The word is that this place "tastes healthy" but I think it is perfect! For being a "healthy" eatery it sure does have MAS flavor!!!
