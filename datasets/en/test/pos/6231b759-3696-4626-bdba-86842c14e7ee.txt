Veterans Day- free meal for vets.  Arrived about 11:30 am, had a wait of about 1 hour, but the staff managed the crowd very well. Every space taken, yet service was great and very prompt, our server Julie was a jewel!  Fast efficient and sincerely thanked my husband as a veteran. Steak was very good and tender as always(our 5th visit, and we live 50'miles away)
A definite must on our list of affordable and enjoyable dining out.
