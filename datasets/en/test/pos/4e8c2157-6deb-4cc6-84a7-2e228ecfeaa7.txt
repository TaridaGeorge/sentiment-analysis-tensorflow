My favorite store is Home depot and this location is a good one. seems like when the economy tanked that all the employees got a pep talk about the importance of customer service and it shows. the people are very helpful and friendly and they have a great selection. The hot dog guy outside has good dogs but is a twit...other than that it's all good!
