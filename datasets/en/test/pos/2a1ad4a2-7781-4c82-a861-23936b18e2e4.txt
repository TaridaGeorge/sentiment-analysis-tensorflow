I am from New York so you know I am super picky about food and my 300 pound stature lets you know I enjoy my food when I get it. So when I say this place is like home, you know this will be food legends are made from. IMHO it does not matter what you order, you will enjoy the meal like no other before. Priced right & they deliver!
