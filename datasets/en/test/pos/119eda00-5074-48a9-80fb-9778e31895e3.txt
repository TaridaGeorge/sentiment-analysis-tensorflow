Must say this is one of my Favorite places to spend my money even better the Bestbuy and I love electronics.  I have always had a quality dinning experience be it in Oahu or here in Chandler.  

My favorite dishes- all of them, you can't go wrong.  They even have fantastic dishes for children which are priced reasonably.  
You must get the chocolate souffl√©, if you go- order ahead as it takes 25 minutes to prepare.  I usually ask for an extra scoop of vanilla ice cream.

We go here for all of our special occasions.  You won't go wrong if you do too!!!

Butterfish!
Even the meatloaf rules!!!
