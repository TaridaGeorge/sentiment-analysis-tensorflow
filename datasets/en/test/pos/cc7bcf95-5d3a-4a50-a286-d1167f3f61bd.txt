Go to Sweet Republic this week and say, "I support Bake for Hope," and they will donate a portion of their proceeds to Bake for Hope.  Bake for Hope is a charity that is raising breast cancer awareness and providing proceeds of nationwide bake sales to local Susan G Komen for the Cure affiliate offices.  On this Saturday, Bake for Hope will be there to sell our delicious homemade cupcakes, brownies, and cookies.  It is the PERFECT pairing- cake and ice cream!
