I take my vehicle into Wilhelm for oil changes and necessary car repairs. I have always found the front desk and mechanics to be extremely helpful and friendly. My family and I are natives and have always taken our vehicles to Wilhelm. I wouldn't think of going any other place. I would HIGHLY recommend to them to anyone!
