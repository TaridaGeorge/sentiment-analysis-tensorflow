I found this little gem tucked away by my church a couple of months ago. Since then, I've eaten here at least two and three times a month.

The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. 

My favorite go-to on the menu is the Greek Salad with chicken. It is so tasty and huge! I never have been able to finish it in one sitting and always end up taking the leftover chicken home. 

Also delicious? Their baklava. It is melt-in-your-mouth good.

I've taken many friends and family here after church and everyone has loved the place and added it to their list of restaurants to frequent.

Just writing this review, I'm now craving their yummy salad!
