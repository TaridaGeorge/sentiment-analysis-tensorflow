Our favorite steakhouse and that is saying a lot, given the number of outstanding steak places in Phoenix..  Old school decor, totally knowledgeable wait staff, steak the way you want it, awesome crab cakes, super size martinis.  IMO there is no better dining experience!
Back again for a special occasion......incredible prime rib, the best wait staff in Phoenix.....hands down, the number one steakhouse.
