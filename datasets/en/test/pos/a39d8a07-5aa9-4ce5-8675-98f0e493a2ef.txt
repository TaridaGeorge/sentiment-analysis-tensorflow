I would like to preface this with one statement: my love of Cartel is ferocious. 

I am at the HTC Body Piercing around the corner semi-often and every time I somehow end up at Cartel, waiting patiently for my regular order of a large iced Chai soy latte. It tastes like there's a wee dance party taking place on my tongue. I've ordered the same thing many a time at many a cafe and no one's is as delicious. I've never had a problem with the wait or the staff, they're always beyond polite and are almost always hilarious. Or at least act like I am, which will get one far. I love that they roast their own beans, take the time to help me decide whether or not to mix up my order, and that I always leave caffinated and with a smile.
