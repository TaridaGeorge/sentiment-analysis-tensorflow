Probably the best independent record shop in the Phoenix area.

I used to go to the Tempe location quite often, but this newer (and now only) location is as great if not even better... There's a small stage area for in-store appearances, and their selection has something for everybody.

The staff is also really knowledgeable and not at all snooty like you might expect them to be.

LONG LIVE STINKWEEDS!
