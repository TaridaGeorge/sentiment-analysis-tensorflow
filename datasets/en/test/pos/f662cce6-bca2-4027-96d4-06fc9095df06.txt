I was heartbroken when I learned Heather left her former salon.  I recently moved to Buckeye and was ready to drive that distance just to see her.  I thought I would have to suffer through getting used to another person doing my hair exactly the way I wanted it. However, I did a quick internet search and found she opened her very own place!!  

Heather is definitely worth the hour long drive.  She's professional, she listens, and always comes up with new ideas to try.

I absolutely love what she's done to my hair and would recommend her to everyone!
