Finally a teriyaki bowl place that does it right.  Nothing against Samuri Sam's, but Yogis is a bit better in my opinion.  Yogis'  menu is strait forward and clearly lists the options available.  The place is clean and the staff is fast and friendly.  The food is also very reasonably priced.  I was very impressed with their different bowl/plate/salad options.  You are able to order some teriyaki veggies, chicken and/or beef pretty much however you want it.  Extra meat, over lettuce, over veggies, brown rice, white rice, etc.  

Anyway, when I visit a place like this my desires are simple.  I want a decent portion of not-overly-sauced white meat chicken over a bunch of veggies.  That's it.  Yogis delivers this and then some.
