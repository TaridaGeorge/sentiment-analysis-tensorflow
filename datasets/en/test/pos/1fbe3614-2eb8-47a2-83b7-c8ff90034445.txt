I made an appointment for 11:00 this morning, and was back on the road by 11:40!  Their service is fantastic, and they even put my seat back in just the right position (I'm pretty short).

I have to say Cody really made my day.  I was going to get the second-cheapest tires for my car because I'm on a very tight budget, but he pointed out that there were other tires better suited for my car with a much higher rating; the only problem was that they were about $50 more than what I could spend.  I expressed this concern, and he made me a deal to fit the better tires into my price range.  He was not aggressive, but instead helpful, polite, and understanding, and I am very grateful for that.  I would go back there in a heartbeat.
