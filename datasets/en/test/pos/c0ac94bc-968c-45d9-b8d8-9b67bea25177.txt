tommy likey. tommy want taco. SOOOO good. this one is better/cleaner/faster than 16th street. They also give you this kick ass salsa with chips when you eat in. SOOO good. The lady at the other one asked me if I needed directions to the 40th street store when I asked about it. Ha..frickin LOVE this place. I want to eat there every day. 
I havent gotten past the tacos yet, and everyone says I should but I cant!!!
