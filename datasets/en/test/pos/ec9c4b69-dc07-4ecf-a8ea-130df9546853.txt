Wow! Wow! Wow!

We discovered Picazzo's this afternoon. Holy moly, this is my new favorite place to eat. The menu is huge and fun, the service was terrific, the food was delicious. I am a happy girl!

Try the oven baked wings. Yumm-o!

The garlic pizza crust was perfection and the chopped Italian salad was great! 

This place is a must, especially in a town where the word "gourmet" is unknown. I'll be back very, very soon!
