ok, I am going to just say it.....  WOW.

I am here visiting a friend in Phoenix for the weekend and we were hungry looking for somewhere to eat.
We found this place on a fluke, and decided to try it, because the sign said crepes and fondue.  My favorite food groups....

The food was great, our service was great and we at too much to have dessert, which is a class C felony in most states... so we will be going there tomorrow ... just for dessert.  

Yea, I will be back, yea my friend and her husband will be back, and I am going to tell everyone I know here to go there.

nom nom nom nom.
