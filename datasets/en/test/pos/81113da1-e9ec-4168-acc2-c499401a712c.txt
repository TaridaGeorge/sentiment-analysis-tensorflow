What can I say about Southwest that has not been said.
 I have flown on them many times now.  I have always been very happy with Southwest Airlines.
Easy to book a Flight and easy to fly on. TSA which I know has nothing to do with the airline, but it is not bad going through their side of the Airport.
 Everyone is friendly with a sense of humor. 
They still serve snacks when they can. Plus the Planes are clean.
Price is good most of the time.
Give them a try next time you fly.
