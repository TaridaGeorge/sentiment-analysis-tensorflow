For fast food burgers, this is indeed quite good. This location is a welcome shot in the arm for Metro Square and the MetroCenter area. The burgers and fries were good, the service friendly and quite fast. Four and a half stars, but I'm bumping it up to 5 because the staff was able to manage the madness of opening day well - including the long queue of cars at the drive-thru.
