This not-so-little bookstore has it all... new and used books, a unique gift section, book signings and events, wonderful staff and a cool, organized, clean atmosphere.  It's going to become a favorite 'down-time' spot for me, I can tell already.  

It's right next to Wildflower Breads on McClintock!

See ya there!
