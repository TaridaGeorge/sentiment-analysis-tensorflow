I have dined in, eaten at the bar, and gotten take out from Herb Box, and every single time the food has been awesome. I've tried their veggie wrap, pear flatbread, and sweet potato tacos. The latter were my favorite, and I really wish I could recreate them at home. Reading the reviews about brunch, I am kicking myself that I haven't spent a Sunday morning there yet.

I don't remember anything about our server when we dined in so I guess it wasn't bad, but I was very happy with the service I got at the bar. The bartender was quick and friendly. Just a lovely overall experience.

The decor is nice, and I think the bathrooms are especially noteworthy.
