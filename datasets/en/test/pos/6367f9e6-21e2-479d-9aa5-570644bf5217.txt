They have a really cool bar and "desserts for two" (um yeah right for two) that were amazing. We got the blondie brownie with vanilla bean ice cream, chocolate sauce, and white chocolate shavings. Dessert for two? I beg to differ. Or maybe it was just my inner fat kid talking but I could've downed the whole thing on my own.  If you're in the area and you're looking for a nicer place to have dinner, especially dessert then this is your place. I'll definitely be going again...once I can find an excuse to go.
