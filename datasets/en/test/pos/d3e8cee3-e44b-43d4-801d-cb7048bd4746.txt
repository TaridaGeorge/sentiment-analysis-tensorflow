I'm can't help but join the 5 stars fan club for T&G Academy.  Thanks Elle T for the tip.

It was many months since my last cut so I had to take several inches off and I wasn't sure if this would be the right place.  But I loved it, loved it and my SO loved it too.  Can't get more bangs for my 12 bucks.  

Yeah, it was crowded, but I made an appointment ahead of time, so no wait for me.  I also asked for someone who was close to graduation.
