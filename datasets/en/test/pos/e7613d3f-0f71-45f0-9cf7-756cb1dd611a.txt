I stopped here the day before Thanksgiving to pick up a few supplies for dinner the next day. Everyone was so super friendly and helpful, especially Tiara who was handling the tastings. She clued me on a few tasty treats like the veil espresso vodka and fennellys irish cream. Then on the champagnes like Jaillance and Satorsola Asti. Yummo! I could have stayed at the tasting area all evening but alas I had to get home to make pies. Thank you Total wine for your outstanding service and   low prices. Plus with the friendliest staff ever, what more can I ask for?
