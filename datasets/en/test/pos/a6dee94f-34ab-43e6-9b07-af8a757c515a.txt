In a world of Starbucks, this is a rare gem.  The espresso beans are awesome & they will sell you some to take home.  I don't really go for flavored beans, but they have those too.  They have a big selection of baked goods and the scones are buttery and amazing.  They have a great selection of teas & brew every cup fresh.  The pomegranate green tea is awesome. I love that they still have punch cards to get your 10th drink free (any way you want it).
