Cibo has fantastic wood fired pizzas, sandwiches and a to die for antipasto platter (love their desserts, too).  The setting is perfect...it reminds me of many, many restaurants in cities like Portland, OR...it is in an old converted house in one of the historic districts.  This is a great place for outside seating.  They have tables set up in the yard and the trees are all brightly lit with wrapped lights (think little white XMas lights).  The only downside for Cibo (and I can't begrudge them this) is that it is frequently really crowded, particularly on weekends.  If it weren't so crowded I would eat here all of the time!
