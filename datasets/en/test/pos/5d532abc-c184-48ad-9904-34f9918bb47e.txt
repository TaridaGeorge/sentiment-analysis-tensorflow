I love this cafe, its near work and they have a great selection of lunch items and there is a pond outside you can sit at, quick service too...they always have a lunch and breakfast special...always unique and great...i had a roast beef wrap with green chili's on it, was delicious and i had chicken breast sandwich on sour dough with green chili's...and sometimes i get omelettes, its very friendly and they have lots of beverages and different coffees...its a good spot and quick. they have big tables area, couches, magazines, its good spot to wait on someone in the building or take a friend to lunch if you work nearby.
