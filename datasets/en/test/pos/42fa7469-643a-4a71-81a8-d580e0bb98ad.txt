Without a doubt the best hot dogs in the city.  Hot dogs are covered in just about anything you can think of from the Jimmy the Greek with Gyro, the Torcher with Eggs, Bacon and Jalapenos, to the Philly with peppers, cheese, and extra yumminess.

Fantastic tiny little establishment.  Every time we have been there the owner comes out and talks to us.  Parking a little problem in a weird location, but it doesn't stop us from getting in there.  This place going into our weekly lunch rotation.
