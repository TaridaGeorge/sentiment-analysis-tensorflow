Navajo Food at it's best !!!!!! I loved everything there ! I guess I love "BLAND" food . :-) everything was terrific ... 

I ordered the bowl (12 oz) of Mutton Hominy Stew I got it with the Tortilla bread which was AMAZING ! I also ordered a side of Blue Corn Mush to dip into my stew ( which is an awesome combination) ... And I also ordered a Grape Shasta Soda :-D ... My Husband ordered the Vegetable Mutton Stew with fry bread and ordered Strawberry Shasta Soda. He loved everything !

Everything was well worth the wait and the food was extra hot and tasted very FRESH !!! I LOVED IT !
