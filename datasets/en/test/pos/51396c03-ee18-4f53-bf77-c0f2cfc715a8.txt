EXCELLENT and known for their PANCAKES!! Amazing! All breakfast items are very good including their omelettes. Don't go to a restaurant that specializes in breakfast and expect their lunch to be good. Went there one time for lunch and would've rather had a sandwich from a hospital cafeteria. Eight years of going there for breakfast. Great price and serving sizes.
