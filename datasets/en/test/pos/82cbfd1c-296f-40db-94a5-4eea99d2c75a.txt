This is a great place if you have a dog and want to hike with your dog. The trails aren't too rocky, the elevation changes gradually, and the trails are wide enough to pull off and have a water break or let others pass.

There are two ways to enter the park: One is off the 51 and Northern. This is the main entrance. Another place to check out is off 40th Street. Exit from the 51 off Shea and turn left onto 40th St. Follow the road until it ends at the entrance to the park. The trails that start here tend not to see the highway and are less crowded. I think mountain bikers tend to use this entrance more.
