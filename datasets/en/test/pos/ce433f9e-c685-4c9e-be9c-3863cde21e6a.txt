I have been a patient of Dr Powell for 12 years now. He really changed the quality of my life. He is always on top of latest findings and helped me find the right kind of contacts. I have seen other eye doctors before i saw him and i can say he is the best not just for his professional skills but also for this attitude towards patients and help make a difference in their life.
