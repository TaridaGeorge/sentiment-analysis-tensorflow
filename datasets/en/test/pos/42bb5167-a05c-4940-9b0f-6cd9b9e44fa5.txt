I rarely go to Indian restaurants. But this is a place I love to visit often. The food seems as if it was done with great interest. When u go there, order anything with rice. They cook it to perfection. I like their handi dishes a lot.

If there is one thing I can suggest, it is that they should stop adding food coloring to some of their dishes. No need to guild this Lilly!
