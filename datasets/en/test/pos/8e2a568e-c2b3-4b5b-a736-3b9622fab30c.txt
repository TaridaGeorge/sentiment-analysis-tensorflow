I ate hear the other day for lunch and had the most tender and fried to perfection Chicken Fired Steak. I now live in OK were CFS is on every menu. That State brags about how they make the best. Well I had to come home to get the best, It was very tender and not greasy at all $14.75 got you a cup of soup or salad, along with mashed potatoes and some grilled veggies. This rocked. I have not been hear for dinner, however they were packed for lunch! If you work or are near the central district check it out!
