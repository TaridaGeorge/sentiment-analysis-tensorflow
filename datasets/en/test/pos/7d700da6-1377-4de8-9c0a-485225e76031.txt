This place is the best.  

First of all, nobody beats that $20 bruschetta and wine deal on Mondays and Tuesdays.  The bruschetta is delicious, there's a ton of it, and the wine doesn't come from a "bargain menu".  This deal makes the day-specific special offers of other restaurants look stingy and pitiful. 

Everything I've had there is delicious and the service is always great.  My only complaints are the casualties of visiting an awesome place: the wait for seating, and for the bathroom.  I'm not used to waiting 45 minutes to get in to a place, but I'll do it for Postino.
