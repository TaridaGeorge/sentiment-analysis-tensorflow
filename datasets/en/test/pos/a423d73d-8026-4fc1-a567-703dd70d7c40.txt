Dropped in here today for lunch & OMG what a treat!  I had a Torta Mexicana & a Pork Tostada Paquime, & every bite of this feast was just terrific!  This particular torta comes with steak, sauteed mushrooms & bell pepper slices, lettuce & tomato, & lots of avocado!  It's big, & SOOOO good!  

The tostada was excellent too, & comes with both bottom & top tortillas.  Over at the salsa bar you pick up as many relish treats as you like, including chiles, marinated baby carrots, onions, & so on, as well as Guacamole & various salsas.

The staff is friendly, the seating is comfortable, the prices reasonable, & in my opinion, FOOD doesn't get any better than this!!  Amazing, amazing, amazing!!  ¡Conseguir su culo aquí!     :-))

Open 8 AM to 10 PM.
