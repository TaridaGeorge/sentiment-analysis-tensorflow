BY FAR the best breakfast place I have ever been to. I love when restaurants are consistent. Every time I come in, I am greeted by the friendliest staff around. No matter how busy they are they always say hi with a smile. It can get busy but the wait is never too long. The food tastes perfect every time. Very fast service as well. 

I ALWAYS order the Light one, it is wonderful. It is an omelet with crepe over it. I sub the toast for little pancakes (no charge) I have tried other things on the menu and they are so good as well. 

They are great at splitting checks! I cannot say enough great things about good egg. I ALWAYS crave it
