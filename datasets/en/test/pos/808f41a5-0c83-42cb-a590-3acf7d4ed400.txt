Amazing. The food is eclectic. The restaurant claims to be a steakhouse but they serve much, much more. Try anything from the "raw" menu, you won't be disappointed.

If possible ask for Chip, he is attentive and very knowledgeable when it comes to the menu. We had so many questions about the items and he was very helpful making suggestion and recommendations.

Very pleased with our visit! Will definitely be back.
