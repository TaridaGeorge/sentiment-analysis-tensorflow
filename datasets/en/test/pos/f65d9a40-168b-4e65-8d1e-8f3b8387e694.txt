I have recently moved to Phoenix area and was on the search for some good Asian food. I had tried a few Chinese places that really sucked so I was hoping that this place would be good and boy oh boy was it! The food is very fresh tasting and you can order it to your preference, mild, hot, or very hot.  Its just a short drive from my house and the service is so fast! Perfect for a quick meal when I am starving. So far I have only tried the pad thai, colorful veggies and green curry but all of them were amazing. The staff is very sweet too. I dont like most chains. For the freshest tastiest Asian food go to Lemongrass!
