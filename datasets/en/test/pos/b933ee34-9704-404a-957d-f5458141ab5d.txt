This place is AMAZING Mom & Pops place!  
Dishes: 
Chicken Cordon Blue Al Gorganzola-my husband loved it. I thought it was a little overcooked. 
& Lobster Ravioli-Superb! Very tastey 
They also gave us an extra shot-Lemon Drops to drink for free :)  
It's not very large inside. Nice touch with Ferrari outside!
