Can you say adorable?  No I don't just mean the cupcakes!  All the girls who work here are such sweethearts!  Don't get me wrong, their red velvet, vanilla, and chocolate are to-die-for, but it's the service that really puts the cherry on top.  Their cupcakes are rich and just perfect.  If you feel like a "sweet genius" (food network show with a very creepy host), buy the batter yourself and go crazy! 

Definitely a staple in the Scottsdale area now, Sprinkles is a must.  Stop in, get your dose of sugar, love, and happiness and go about your day!  KEEP CALM AND EAT CUPCAKES.
