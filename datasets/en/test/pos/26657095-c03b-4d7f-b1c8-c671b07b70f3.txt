I love, love, love this dog park (and so does my Great Dane, Charlie).  It's beautifully maintained, clean, and welcoming to dogs of all sizes (which is good since my dog weighs more than I do).  It's easily accessible, right on the greenbelt, and offers a place where your dogs can run free and socialize, without having to worry about them running into traffic.  It's also a GREAT place for people to socialize as they wait for their pups to tucker themselves out.  There are lots of shady benches to meet and great other dog lovers.  The best part - It's completely FREE!  I definitely give Chaparral Dog Park 5 stars.
