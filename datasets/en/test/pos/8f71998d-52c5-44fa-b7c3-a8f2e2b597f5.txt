We heard great things about the MIM from family and friends. The MIM is exciting and extremely innovative. Headsets are included with the price of admission and allow you to become one with the journey. The whole museum is organized by geographic region and each region is further sub-divided by country. 

I loved the ability to learn about different cultures and instruments through their music. The technology used was also innovative and something I had never experienced. Basically the headsets automatically tune to the music/videos nearest to you. For example, as we approached the Sri Lanka exhibit, music from that country began playing on my headset. 

Through this innovative setup we were able to experience instruments never before heard and tour the world in only a few hours.

I would recommend allowing at least four hours to explore the museum.
