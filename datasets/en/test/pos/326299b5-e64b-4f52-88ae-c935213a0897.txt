I love this location, it always has the best movies playing in the biggest theaters. but the thing draws the 5 stars at this location is the child's play center there. Its the same price as a movie and you can let your child play there while you are in a movie they can't or don't want to watch. My daughter has been there more than 10 times and sometimes she wants to go to the movies just to go in there. They have games, movies, toys, arts and crafts. My daughter has never had a bad experience there and always comes out happy. As for the movies it is a very clean location and always enjoyed every movie experience that I have had there. Go here with confidence.
