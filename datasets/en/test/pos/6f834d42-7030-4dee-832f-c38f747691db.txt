CUPCAKES TO DIE FOR. And on top of their amazing product, the employees are welcoming, helpful, and friendly!!! I ordered two dozen cupcakes for a special event, and they not only provided the delicious freshly bakes goodies exactly how I'd hoped, but they met me an hour before they open to ensure I would be on time. GREAT place!
