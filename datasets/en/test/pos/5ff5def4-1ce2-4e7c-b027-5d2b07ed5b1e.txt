I have been to MANY yoga studios in AZ and across the country, and Metta Yoga stands out for many reasons. The owner takes the time to personally get to know you and your name, there is a diverse group of instructors, and the facility is beautiful. The teachers guide the class to be suitable for beginners to advanced, stating, "I invite you to try the next advancement, if you so choose today". No pressure, but definitely motivating. I LOVE LOVE LOVE!
