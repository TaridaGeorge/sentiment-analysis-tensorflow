What a great place.  About as old-school as you can possibly imagine.  They are a steak house and "stir" house.  Meaning their martini's are NOT shaken.  Many aspects seperate Durant's from the rest and the red velvet walls are just a start.  My favorite is the "meat hats" they serve when you order a bottle of beer at the bar.  At least that's what my friends and I call them.  A skewer of salami and cheese in the mouth of the bottle.  Ah, the simple pleasures.
