Firehouse Subs in Chandler is AMAZING!!! My family and I go there all the time! The staff is super nice and the owner is awesome and friendly! They steam your sandwich once ordered and it's so yummy and fresh! I would recommend this sub shop to all of my friends! My son is almost 2 and loves the kids meal there as well!! 
Thanks Firehouse Subs! We love you!
