Honest, Prompt, Courteous.  We found Sorensen on Yelp and decided to try him due to the great reviews and we were not disappointed.
I was able to get an appointment within 2 days. Brian, the owner, did a diagnostic on the A/C system and told me what he thought should be done, but didn't try to up-sell me.  He replaced our malfunctioning fan and the unit works great now.  Will definitely recommend to friends and family and will use him again.  It's always nice to be able to use a locally owned and operated business.
