I used to enjoy Jamba Juice regularly but in recent years after less then steller service at a few I stopped.  But a few weeks ago when the first heat wave hit I was craving a yummy smoothie as we were out and about so we tried this location.  It was fantastic.  We had our 2 year old with us so they gave us a water cup so I could share my smoothie with him (came with a lid and she even cut a straw down to length for him).  I wanted a combo of 2 smoothies so they took care of it no problem Glad this location is so near home because we'll be visiting more often especially in the summer heat!
