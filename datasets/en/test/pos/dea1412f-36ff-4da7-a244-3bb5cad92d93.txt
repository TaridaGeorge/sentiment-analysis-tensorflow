A good cut, by barbers who take pride in their work.  The price is either $15 or $17 for a cut and neck trim depending on whether they think you'll tip them.

The place is run by, and employs Russian Jewish immigrants, which is only relevent if you want a cut on Saturday since it's closed, but mighty useful on a Sunday!

What I particularly love about this barber is that the staff won't press you with inane drivel and endless questions to strike up a conversation that'll be forgotten as soon as you walk out the door.  If you want to talk, they'll talk but if you want to watch TV (shark week was on and I couldn't peel my eyes away) then that's fine by them.
