I've had pizza in most every major city and in several cities in Italy...this is good.  I don't think it's the best in the world like they say....but I was happy and I'd be delighted to eat there every night of my life.

I like the set up.  It's cute and charming.   We were told we would be waiting an hour to sit so we walked next door to the bar they own and enjoyed a drink.  Our table was ready within 20 mins and we sat.  

After ordering 5 pizzas (there was 6 of us) we stopped.  Total fan...not the best pizza but damn good pizza.  Adorable.  Charming.  Friendly.  Fresh.  Yay.
