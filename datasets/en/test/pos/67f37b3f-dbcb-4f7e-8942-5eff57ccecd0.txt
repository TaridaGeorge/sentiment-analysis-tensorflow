Last Friday it came to my attention I had an irate and well-nested African bee hive that was becoming quite a liability to anyone near my yard.  Usually, I take my time to peruse valuable Yelp reviews when looking for a new local company, but it was Friday before Christmas and the fellow installing my new gate had a thick stinger lodged in his very un-merry cheek, and wouldn't finish the job until our little African friends went bye-bye.  So I did a quick Google search and this was one of the first companies to pop up.  I called and connected immediately with a fellow named Randy, who not only came within the hour but charged a very fair price and removed those angry little suckers with precision and efficiency.  Much appreciated, and a shiny new gate was indeed installed for the holidays.
