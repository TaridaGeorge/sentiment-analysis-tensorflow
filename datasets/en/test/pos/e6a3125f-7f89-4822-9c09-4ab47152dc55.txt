I love Sapporo.  They have reasonable prices, a big menu, great music always playing, entertainment (people watching), etc...

Their sushi is very good.  They have fun drinks.  

If you make a reservation for dinner you usually don't have to wait.

P.S.  They have amazing deals for happy hour, but get there early cause it gets packed!!
