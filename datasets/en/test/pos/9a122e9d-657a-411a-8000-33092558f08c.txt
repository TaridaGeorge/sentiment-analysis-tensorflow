since introduced to KG's over 10 years ago (by Big Pete of Oregano's) i've been a huge fan and always sure to visit when i'm in town. stopping by is like visiting an old friend (the place is uber small) where you say hi to John or TR behind the bar and they remember you. 
a little (pun intended) description: its a small bar that serves OK food (burgers and the like). very basic TV's. Most importantly, its where your likely to find yourself making new friends. It's frequented by local restaurant owners and staff (front and back of house), professional baseball umpires and other interesting folks.
