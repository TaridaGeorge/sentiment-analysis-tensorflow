My husband surprised me with a visit to this place and boy was it a treat! 

I ordered the K8 - Saeng SaeWoo Gui - Shrimp and vegetables and he ordered the K4 - Daeji Bulgogi - spicy pork. Both were the 'BBQ at your own table' type.  

The aroma of the shrimp and the zucchini roasting in the sauce and changing colors really whets your appetite. The food was light, delicious and just the right quantity without making you feel like heavy. I ordered the Hazelnut coffee with boba. The drink itself was yummy but I didn't care too much for the boba.

The seating I would say is a little tight but the food and service are excellent. Very well priced too. And I got to enjoy some Korean TV drama as well :)

We're definitely going back to try a few more dishes!
