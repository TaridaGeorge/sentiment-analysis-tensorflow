For what it is, this place is great.

It's total ranch hand cooking.  There is beef and potatoes and the rest of the things you would expect.

This place has a lot of character and, as the other reviewer mentioned, they will cut your tie off and hang it from the ceiling.  There are other things up there as well which makes me wonder how wild this place gets on weekends, but hey.  Cowboys.  Look out.

It's a real drive to get out here, so make it count.  There is a real western feeling bar area as well.  Since it's out far enough, it hasn't been screwed with which leads some cred that legit and been there for a long time.  It was just marketed to the city folk who come and spend their money.

Good that it was, as it's a neat place.
