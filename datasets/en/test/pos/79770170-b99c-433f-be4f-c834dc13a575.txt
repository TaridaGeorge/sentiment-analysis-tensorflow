Give me a Dilly Bird on Focaccia with potato salad and a Coke and I won't have to eat the rest of the day. Portion sizes are generous but most importantly delicious.  Haven't had a bad sandwich yet and I've tried half the menu.  Salad's are for rabbits so I won't be reviewing those but the soups are absolutely delicious. Try it if your in the neighborhood, you will not be disappointed.
