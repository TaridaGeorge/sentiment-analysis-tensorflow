Loved this place, despite the fact that I went on a 104 degree day, with 50% humidity.  
Great for family walks and birdsighting (as well as other critters), or even a romantic walk.  Kids can feed the ducks, and we all know how much they love that.
You can walk around for several hours without retracing your steps, and most of it is very quiet, we didn't see people for several minutes at a time.  And it's in the middle of Gilbert.
We saw all types of ducks, gueese, vultures, herons, cranes...IT'S FREE. And the children ran around for a long time without having anybody telling them to stop.  They slept like little angels that night.
