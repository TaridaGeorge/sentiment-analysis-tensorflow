Almost all of my tattoos (5 of 6) have been done by an artist at Hotrod Tattoo. I am extremely pleased with their work. They are so clean and helpful. Matt is an amazing artist and is extremely funny. He makes every piece his own and brings it new life. When Eric is around he is also a great artist. He gives you exactly what you ask for. I haven't been pierced, but if I ever was I wouldn't go to anyone but Timmy. The upfront staff is great, especially Chastitiy.
