I had my brows done one month ago.  Heather did an amazing job!  I went back after 2 weeks for a "no charge" touch up.  I haven't worn brow powder or pencil since, and most importantly my brows look TOTALLY natural.  I give her 5 stars and would strongly recommend her.  As a matter of fact I am going to go back and have my lips done!
