Awesome museum. A collection of high quality and quantity. Spent about 2.5 hours here, and could have taken longer if I didn't have other plans that day. 

The exhibits are broken down by region. My mom is South Korean and was very excited to see some of the instruments of her childhood. You receive a headset when you enter, to listen to the video displays at nearly every exhibit. This made the museum special as the audio worked seamlessly into the experience as I walked to each new display.  Highly recommended unless you hate music and learning.
