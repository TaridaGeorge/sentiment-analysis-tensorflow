I'm very small and short so I have a hard time finding pants off the rack that fit me.  Diamondback is the 4th alteration shop I've tried in the past year, and by far the best!  Not only were they much cheaper than other tailors ($12 to take the pants in at the waist versus $16-$18 at other places) they completed the job very quickly.  Other places took over a week to complete the same number of alterations.  I dropped my pants off at Diamondback on Friday and they were ready Tuesday!  The quality of their work is amazing....and the icing on the cake...it looks like they dry cleaned and pressed the pants as well!  I will never go anywhere else for my alteration needs!
