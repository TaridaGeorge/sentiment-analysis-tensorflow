I had the Smothered Tots, and the Beef burger with cheddar, sauteed onions, and avocado! 
The smothered tots are by far my favorite of any junk food to munch on! I always have cravings for smothered Tots, and now I can just go here to satisfy the cravings, and it's such a relaxing environment.
The burger was good too, I am not adventurous to try anything else like Bison, but I enjoyed the beef!
