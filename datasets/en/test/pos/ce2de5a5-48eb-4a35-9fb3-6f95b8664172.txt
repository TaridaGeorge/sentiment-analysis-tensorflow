I used to live within walking distance of Casey's.  As a result, I have been to this bar more times than I can count, and honestly, I've always had an awesome time.  

It's very laid back, and all types of people come here to relax and drink.  A lot.

The patio is the most happenin' spot though- so don't stay inside too long or you'll miss all the action. 

Casey's is supposed to be haunted as the bar is actually an old house that was built in 1910.  I've never had any spooky experiences, but that's the word on the street anyhow.
