Having grown up in Texas, exposed to lots of cajun food and now living in LA where there is none, a promised visit to Pappadeaux was what sealed the deal for me to visit Phoenix. 

Pappadeaux did not disappoint - food was just as good as I remembered the chain to be in Texas. I love my crawfish etouffee. And going at lunch (even on the weekends) is definitely the best bang for your buck. They are very, very generous with the portions.
