Khristine is the best stylists I have had in my life! (And that's a LONG time!) She knows that I tend toward the conservative side, but also knows how to give a little twist when I'm looking for something extra.  The cut looks great weeks later, too, as it grows out.  She uses all organic products which is important to me.  Love, love, love this salon.
