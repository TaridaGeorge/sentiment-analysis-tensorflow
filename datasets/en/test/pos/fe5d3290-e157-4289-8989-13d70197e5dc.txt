I love this store!  I didn't even get to explore the whole place but I came in here to look at assault rifles and possibly pick up a canoe.

The first guy that helped us with the rifles was super knowledgeable and had an opinion about every gun he took down from the rack.  After looking at a couple AR15s, my friend told me about the special gun room where I got to hold guns I had only fired virtually in video games... the Aug, P90, and F2000.

This store is 2 stories of all things outdoors and then there is even a giant aquarium with all kinds of trout and other swimmers.

I wish there were one here in Cali, but obviously, they're smart not to put one in a state with retarded gun laws, so it makes the visits to Cabela's that much more special and amazing.
