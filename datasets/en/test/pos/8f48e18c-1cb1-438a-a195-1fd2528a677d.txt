This is the best fry bread around! Forget that bland attempt you get when the fair comes around, Fry Bread House is the best! Clean, ok customer service, but amazing food! I loooove the tacos here and you can't forget a honey and powder sugar fry bread post taco! yummmmmmmmmmmm .. ps you need lots of napkins.
