I eat at restaurants more likely than I want to admit, but I'm rarely moved to write about it.  In this case, I'm moved to write, but don't have words sufficient to describe the meal.

ShinBay was a phenomenal in every way.  The ambience is almost "spa-like" - warm, quiet, relaxing, inviting, etc.  The service was excellent.  Most importantly, the food was exceptional.  We opted for the $125 tasting course and requested that the chef recommend wine pairings.  Even with high expectations (after reviewing the unanimously positive reviews on yelp), we were blown away by every course.  

Other reviewers have commented that the meal is expensive, but worth it.  I agree, and would even say that compared to similarly priced meals in Scottsdale/Phoenix, this was a great value.  Very highly recommended!!
