I'm a HUGE fan of Costco. Recently I've started using their pharmacy. I have monthly thyroid meds I've been paying $8.99 at the grocery store for, well Costco did it up for a 3 month supply at $11.99!! 
Now this Costco has something NO other Costco has. They are the country's test store for a self check out process. It's pretty cool and easy to use with someone standing right there to walk you thru it. Basically you scan your Costco card and then get a hand held machine to scan all your buys with. They even thought ahead to put a holder for the machine on all the grocery carts. Theres a dedicated are for you to check out (much quicker). The only downside to the process is theres no boxes nearby to make carrying your stuff into the house.
