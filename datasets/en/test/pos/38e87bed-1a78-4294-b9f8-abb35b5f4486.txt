I really enjoyed the lounge by the pool at night. Finally a faboulous place to enjoy quality cocktails and people watch in Scottsdale. 

I'm so over the ASU, college scene. This place is perfect for age 23-33. It's hip, has a dj spinning and just relaxing. I know I can go here and relax. Had a blast here. I'm hoping to return on my next AZ visit.
