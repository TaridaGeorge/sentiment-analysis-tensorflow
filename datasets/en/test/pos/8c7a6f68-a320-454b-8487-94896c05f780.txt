Had a coupon for this place, so I went for brunch today.

Wasn't expecting it to be in the airport terminal, but was pleasantly surprised with the calm, modern atmosphere they've created at Zulu Caffe. The entire east wall is a window looking out to the runway - allowing guests watch the planes take off and land with the beautiful AZ mountains in the background.

Looking forward to cooler weather so that we can eat outside on the patio near the fire place.


Meal was delicious, staff and owner were extremely friendly and helpful. It's a great place to meet up with a friend, sit and chat. Will certainly be back soon.
