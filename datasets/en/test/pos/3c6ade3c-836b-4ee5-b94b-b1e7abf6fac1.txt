My dad used to take me to the one in Tucson when I was little and I LOVED it. When I moved to Phx I looked for one and was so bummed that there weren't any. And then it opened right down the street from me! Good quality beef, not that fatty crap that some places serve. I like their hot italian beef sandwich with extra hot peppers! So good and so filling. One of those is like breakfast, lunch and dinner for me. It's family-owned, too! I think it's operated by the guy's grandchildren or something. So happy there's one in Chandler now!
