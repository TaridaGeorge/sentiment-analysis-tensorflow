Now that the barista from Lux is over at Giant Coffee I am even more in love with this place than before!  I had been frequenting Giant as much as possible and then one day walked in and saw Erik.  "What are you doing here" I asked.  Some sort of dispute with Lux has led to good news for Giant.  Now between my favorite pastries and coffee and barista I am one happy girl!
