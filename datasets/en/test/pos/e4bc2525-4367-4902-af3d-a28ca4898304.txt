Of course you can get almond milk in your iced latte. Of course the waitress is 90 lbs and wearing a plaid headband with a pixie haircut. Of course everyone who needs to be seen working publicly is there with a laptop, and naturally there are no menus and everyone knows to go in the back...

But, fear not the Eau de Hipster that emanates from this lovely place!

There's also a gym buddy group drinking tea, my mom and I on a couch in the corner drinking coffee, parents ordering pastries for their toddlers, a husband and wife sharing a scone, and random dudes at the bar chatting up smiling strangers.

Just because it's a hipster joint, doesn't mean it's not an everyone else joint, too. And besides, almond milk is the shiznit in iced lattes, so let's just embrace it.
