on vacation in scottsdale - and this place was incredible.  it would stand up against the best restaurants in los angeles.  the place is family style where everybody shares.  you choose a few skewers and some main courses.  can also get some sushi or some noodle appetizers.  we got the miso cod and some sort of beef for the main courses and got a bunch of the skewers which were all incredible.  the flavor of everything was just awesome.  portions are tiny.  i can't say enough about this place!
