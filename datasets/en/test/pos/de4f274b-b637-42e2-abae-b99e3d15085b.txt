Outstanding!  

Places like this are a dime a dozen in Beijing or Monterey Park, but not so common here.  

Big, hearty portions of hand-made noodles.  Dumplings the size of a fat plum, full of meat.  Grandpa making noodles by hand and dozing in a chair in between courses.  What's not to like?

This is northern Chinese "stick to your ribs" style.  Nothing fancy but perfectly executed.  I love it, personally but some people here are apparently a bit less enthusiastic.    Just thinking about it makes me hungry.

The display kitchen is a nice touch.

Great value too.  A huge lunch for two and an extra order to go for later ran us about $24.
