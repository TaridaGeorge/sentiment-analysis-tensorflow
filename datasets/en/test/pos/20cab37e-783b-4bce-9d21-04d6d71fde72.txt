I own a MacBook from Laptop Xchange and was able to buy it at a great, reasonable price. I use it all the time and I've had no problems with it, it's as good as new!

I also wasn't sure what to do with my old, used iPhone, so I sold it to them and made some money. Not a bad deal! 

The staff was knowledgable, friendly, and very helpful. I will be going back for my next purchase...perhaps for an iPad!
