Beautiful art center. It sits right near the Tempe Town Lake and offers plenty of great views. The interior is well kept and holds plenty of people.

In the main auditorium, it appears they are using cell-blocking devices because immediately cell signals are dropped upon entering. I don't know this for sure, but it was experienced by me and several others. This was only an issue if the event was supposed to be interactive like Diggnation (when they went on tour in Tempe) or Ignite Phoenix.
