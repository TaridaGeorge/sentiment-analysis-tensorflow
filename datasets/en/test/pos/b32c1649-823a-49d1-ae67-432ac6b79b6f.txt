The best cheese steak anywhere! Make sure you don't go to the place next store by mistake. We did that, then realized we ordered in the wrong place. We gave those subs (and I mean "sub" subs) to the homeless and ate at the real cheese steak place. Also Ron, one of the owners of the Phoenix CS Co was gracious, professional and works hard to please the customer. What a nice change from your average eatery. What do you expect, he's from Long Island!!!
