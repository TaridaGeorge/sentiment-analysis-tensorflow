A rare authentic gem in Phoenix. This is the best french bakery / bistro in the Valley. The owner is from Lyon and has been here with his family for 10 years or so. His french pastry chef is extraordinary. Very unique find - imported directly from France as well. He's probably 80 and has prefected so many of his recipes. All of the pastries here are truly awesome.

I haven't eaten here for lunch. But, the after dinner or before movie treats here are very good.
