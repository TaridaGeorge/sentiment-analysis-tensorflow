Here On The Corner is such a cool little boutique. They have an amazing array of clothes, shoes and accessories. Plus they have items by local designers and also items that give to a cause which I think is something more stores should focus on carrying. So please shop locally and if that means spending a couple dollars more then do so knowing you are supporting a small business dedicated to the local community and in helping others
