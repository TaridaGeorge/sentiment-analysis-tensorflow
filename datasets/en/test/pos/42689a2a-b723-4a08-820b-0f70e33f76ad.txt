Try the teriyaki burger! The fried pineapple sends it over the top. All those flavors work so well together.

Today I had the New Yorker sandwich on marbled rye. Oh my! That is not a good sandwich, that is a great sandwich!

If you have a favorite soda from your home town that you can't find here in town, you will be able to find it here at Rocket Burgers.

I love this place! It's two guys living out their dream. They get to know their customers and they cook for you as if you're family.
