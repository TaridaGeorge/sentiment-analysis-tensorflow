This place is AWESOME!

I was yelpin for a place nearby me with free wifi and coffee so i could get my morning fix on.  Matador came up first and had great reviews so i gave it a shot.

I am sitting inside right now on one of their big fluffly chairs comfortably working on their free fast wifi, sipping their AMAZINGLY good coffee and enjoying every moment of it.

The people behind the counters are super cool and friendly and seem to know every person that walks in here.  This is a very cool local coffee spot.  And my god.. i never want to go back to starbucks again...their coffee is top notch.

Love it. Thanks Matador! You rocked my socks this morning. I will definitely be back...how's tomorrow sound?
