Awesome place! The atmosphere is comfy, casual and cool! Loved that it wasn't a place that is so crammed with tables that it's hard to get in and out of your seat.  My son went to school with Mario and decided to take me there while he was in town visiting. So glad he did! The food was amazing, great selection of wines and beers and love that they use local produce and cure their own meats. Will bring my husband  back for sure! Like other posters, this location has had a few restaurants come and go - here's hoping that Cuoco Pazzo stays for a long time!
