Tremendous!  Great beer and wine selection.  Fantastic, loaded salads.  Creative selection of sides and sandwiches that all deliver.  Cool patio.  Nice atmosphere inside as well.  Dark, hip, chill, great music.  Laid back, friendly, attentive service.  Perfect first time, and I'll be back next week for more.
