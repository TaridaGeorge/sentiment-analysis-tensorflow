I visit this location basically every week day for coffee.  I get iced toddy, and am basically addicted.  Best coffee in town.  I buy cartel beans as well for camping and similar adventures, and the hot coffee is the best around.  Pastries are fantastic, staff is always friendly and the same day after day (I like familiarity!).

I ate there for the first time today, and as expected, the food was excellent.
