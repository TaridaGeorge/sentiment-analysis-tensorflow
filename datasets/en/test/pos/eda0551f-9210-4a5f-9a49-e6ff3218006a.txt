You are immediately hit with the warm smells and hissing steam from the feverishly flying pans in the kitchen.  The chatter coming from the tables of couples and families and friends softly whispers against the brick walls.  The Matisse art work on the walls and bistro tchotchkies say French, while the menu says Italian, no, Japanese, no, Indian.  The fabric napkins are folded oragami houses for your fork and knife.  A basket of home made rolls, banana bread, and cinnamon crisps makes a landing on every table.  The service is friendly and familiar.  The enormous portions of food, no matter from which corner of the world it hails, are fantastic.
