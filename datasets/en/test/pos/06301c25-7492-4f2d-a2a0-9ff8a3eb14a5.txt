An Italian surname Pane Bianco is occupational. The bearer of the name would be a baker who sells his bread, feeds and nourishes.

Great lunch today in a beautiful farm and market style dining room with two thoughtful and lovely gals providing gracious service.

Soup of the Day is an Arizona grown tepary bean, vegetable soup with a slice of out of the oven Italian country bread 6. The tepary bean once a staple in the Sonoran Desert and a legume the Papago Indians embraced.

My sandwich on their made to order focaccia round bread is tuna with red onion, gaeta olives, lemon and arugula 9.5

The treat, I had some vanilla bean rice pudding. Thought I would show a little small business love. Complimenti alla cuoca, ciao, ciao, arrivederci.
