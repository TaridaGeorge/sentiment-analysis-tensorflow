my sister and a few friends went for a morning road bike ride to this place. 
the food was great and light but yet filling. i didn't feel like i ate a pan of grease after eating here. it was a good quality, healthy breakfast. 

the customer service was great!! they were really friendly and helpful with what we needed. 

i will definitely come back to this place and enjoy myself a honey cured-ham with apple and brie cheese breakfast. YUMMMY!!!
