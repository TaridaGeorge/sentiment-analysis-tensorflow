Dr. Amoia and his staff made my visits enjoyable. This month i hurt my back and just 3 visits into getting adjusted I felt great. I was please by the way Dr. Amoia explain my back scans and ex-rays. He answered every question I had with great detail. I already feel back to my old self again. The Staff always greets you with a smile and very friendly Hello and greet you by name. For once, i didnt feel like just a number at a doctors office and made me feel welcomed. Thank you American Chiropractic for making my adjustment visits an enjoyable one!
