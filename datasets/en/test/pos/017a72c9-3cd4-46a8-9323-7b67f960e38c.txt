Alex, the owner, started cutting my hair two or so years ago. She is absolutely brilliant. She's given me the best haircuts/styles I have ever had..the compliments are endless. She's amazing when it comes to listening to your ideas and working with you on them. I have never been disappointed with any of her work..I've referred several friends and I'm sure they would say the same. She just opened up her new place (a.bloom) and it's great. Check it out, I SWEAR you will love her and her work!
