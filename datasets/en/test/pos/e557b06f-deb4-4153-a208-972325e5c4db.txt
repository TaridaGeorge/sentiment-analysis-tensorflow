Went again two days ago and the whole place got BRIGHTER! I thought I was tripping but I then realized that they knocked the wall down and expanded next door. Their restaurant capacity doubled, I gotta say it feels kind of weird at first since the decors don't match.

Anyway, on to the food. Got a No.11 again and my friend got 14 with eggrolls. 

...

same old deliciousness with the same price. Nothing else to say about that.

I do want to add a piece of advice: go eat in clothes that you don't mind smelling like the restaurant.
