Yes the membership fees are high, no doubt but the location is worth it. Huge place, great equipment, I always get a great workout in plus you have never seen so  muh silicone and yoga pants in your life. Great place for Coug hunting, if you got the stones, its like stealing candy from a baby. God bless North Scottsdale.
