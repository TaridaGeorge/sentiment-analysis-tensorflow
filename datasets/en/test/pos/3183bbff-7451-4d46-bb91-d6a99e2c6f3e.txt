A Sunday visit to Olive Garden's unlimited soup and salad combo made for a tasty satisfying meal.  The addition of crab stuffed mushrooms hit the spot too.  Pasta fagioli soup was very good.  We liked the extra peppercinis added to our salad.

Service was excellent!  Teaming by a couple of servers meant that all of our needs/refills were anticipated or handled right away.  Refills for more iced tea, breadsticks, soup and salad were speedy.  The server even gave us an iced tea to go - a plus!

For my next visit I like that I can pretty much expect the same good  food.  Olive Gardens food is consistently good.  Of course I'll be back!
