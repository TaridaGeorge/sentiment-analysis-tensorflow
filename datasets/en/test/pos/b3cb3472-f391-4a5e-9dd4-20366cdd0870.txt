Love this little gem, it is a tiny Italian grocer that has fantastic food.  I am addicted to the Italian sub sandwich that has their famous Italian dressing.  I live very far from this place so I don't get here much anymore but I have to come here every once in a while for their olive oil.  It is very tiny and only has a few chairs so get your food to go.  You must stop in sometime and just check it out.  It is a little hard to find in the corner of a strip mall just North of Bethany on the West side of 16th Street.
