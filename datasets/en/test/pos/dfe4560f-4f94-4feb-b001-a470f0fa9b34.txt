Can you say BEST CHURCH EVER? When you come here... You become family. It may be a big church but, it makes it all the better. The barnetts are simply amazing. Groups are amazing. I love it so much! A great part is they offer free day care during service so I have something to do with my toddler while I worship! I love PFA!
