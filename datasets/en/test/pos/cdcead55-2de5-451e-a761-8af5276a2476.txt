Eduard and Nissan are absolutely great guys.  I have been going to V's for four years now and I have always walked away happy with my cut.  Both gentlemen are great at what they do, very personable and I really cannot say enough about how much I look forward to going to V's to get cleaned up.

Both gentlemen are consistent with their approach: prep, cut, clean up with the straight razor (oh man I love that touch) and then the hot towel wrap followed by a scalp massage.  Sadly what they do so well is becoming a lost art, but I am glad to be able to have a place to go once every few weeks where I feel like I am experiencing some of the simple luxuries without breaking the bank.
