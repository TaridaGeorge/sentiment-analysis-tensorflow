We got the half of the ticket price from Groupon.  We really enjoy the hospitalty of the staff and the cleanance of the boat.  Beautiful ride along with the band playing  on the boat as entertainment.   It is hard to believe that you still can spot a beautiful lake in AZ which is 45 min. away from central phoenix downtown.
