I've never been to the actual restaurant but I got delivery from here one night. I tried their specialty "Mama Spinato's" signature spinach pizza because I like trying whatever the "house specialty" is when I go to a new place. I was not disappointed. 

Another reviewer mentioned that the sauce is somewhat sweet and I'd agree with that. But it's not unpleasant, in fact I think I like it better than sauces I've had at other pizza places because of that.

The ingrediants definitely tasted fresh and were perfectly blended. As for the delivery service, it arrived hot and perfect so no complaints there. I've heard other reviewers say that this is the must-try pizza in the Valley and I can't say I disagree.
