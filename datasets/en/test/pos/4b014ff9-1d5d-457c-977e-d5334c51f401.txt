Wow wow wow! As my friends and I sit here and eat this delectable pizza a few things come to mind, cheesesteak and ricotta. Believe it or not I called in and asked for a large pizza and a cheesesteak, hold the bun and toss it on the pizza. We are now feasting on a little slice of heaven, a pizza covered in onions, green peppers, mushrooms and cheesesteak. All this sitting on top of cheese under a layer of ricotta cheese sauce......stop drooling, you wish you had smell a vision right now...even better call the and order this you will be hooked for life!!
