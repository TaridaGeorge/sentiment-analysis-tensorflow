Love this place -- walked in and had a new pair of great looking sunglasses in less than 20 minutes. The gentleman working there (I apologize that I didn't catch his name) didn't waste time having me try on pair after pair of glasses - he asked what I was looking for and then listened to my response, found a couple of options, and I was on my way, very happy and looking good.

This place is highly recommended for having a great staff, great selection of options and for feeling like a fun place to shop. This will be my first stop next time I need a pair of glasses.
