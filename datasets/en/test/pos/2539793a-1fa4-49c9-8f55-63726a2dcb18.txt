Finally got to a movie here last night for "Bear City", and what a terrific experience!  No question that for environment, style, and beer/wine selection, this place may be the most interesting spot in Phoenix.  I actually ENJOYED the slimmed down theatre space as well -- it's all part of the joy of discovering seriously off the radar little films that, yes, one can always rent on Netflix, but nothing beats a shared experience.  I'm hoping that they might add some interesting baked goods for nibbling, and maybe even three or four tapas selections at some point -- but not having them didn't detract from my enjoyment.  Sure hope this goofy city sustains this place, we NEED this desperately!  Can't wait to go back for "13 Assasins"...and whatever else is coming up on the schedule.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE FilmBar, hope it survives!
