Me and the family continue to eat here on a fairly regular basis. I havent been on to update in awhile but I have to say that this place is far better than Cyclo. The prices and portions are always just right and the food keeps us all coming back. We have all sampled several items from here and they are better than most of the restaurants we went to in Northern California... the service and atmosphere are top notch as well. Unfortunately at Cyclo you pay quite a bit more for the slight air of ambiance that welcomes couples only. If you want to take your family to a quality restaurant owned by some wonderful Chandler business owners... take a peek, you will love it!
