Yes, it is a biker bar.  And it is packed with them at certain times, especially weekends.  I don't ride. But if you roll in on a weekday around noon you might not see any, and if everyone seems to know everyone it's because they are all friendly local folks. So if you're visiting Cave Creek don't assume the Hells Angels are there looking to kick ass   Most of the "bikers" probably drive BMWs during the week.  I stop in at least once a week for a bite.  The food is the best bar food in Cave Creek and the service is awesome. I've been to every bar in town. Harold's , The Chip, Toad, etc. all are good, but The Hideaway is the best.
