I used to live in Chicago and until Romanelli's, I haven't found a good italian beef sandwich. When I took my first bite I was brought back to so many memories. I've had a few other sandwiches here and there hasn't been anything bad. Not to mention the amazing desserts. Definitely the place to go for great food from back east. Love it!
