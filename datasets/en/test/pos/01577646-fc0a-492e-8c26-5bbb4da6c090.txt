I have to agree with everybody below, this place is GREAT!  What a concept, make your own pizza.  Didn't Kramer talk about this a long time ago?  

Don't forget about the divine salads and the sandwiches!  Again with the "make your own" thing.  I like having lots of accouterments in my salad, and this is the place to do it.  

And hey, what's with it being soooooo cheap?  How do they do that and keep a friendly staff?

A 5 STAR MUST DINE AT
