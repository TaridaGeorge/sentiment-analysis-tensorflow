My husband and his brother had been to Cork and absolutely loved it, so naturally for my brother-in-law's birthday, we took him there!

Ambience: relaxed, sophisticated, modern

Menu: definitely not traditional...they had a lot of items that you don't see at every restaurant.  We had the "spontaneous chef's menu."  Each person at the table has to order it if you are getting it.  You get 5 courses each...and each person gets something different.  We would all try ours' and pass our plates...we ended up trying 20 different foods that night!  My favorite was a tie between the Elk and the Kobe Beef tenderloin...both were amazing!

Restrooms: Stylish and clean!

Wine:  They had a great wine selection along with a full bar.
