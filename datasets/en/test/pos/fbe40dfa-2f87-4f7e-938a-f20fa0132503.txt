Cookiez is such a fun place! From the outside, it's almost hard to find - the shop is small and looks almost like a hole-in-the-wall venue. But don't be fooled, go inside! You'll be hit with a wall of delicious smelling cookies and be confronted with way too many wonderful choices for ice cream.

Get an ice cream sandwich! You'll have trouble deciding between the numerous homemade cookie options - I tried the peanut butter cookie and it was wonderful. Next dilemma: which ice cream to use? Again, another wall of delicious options, so you cannot go wrong. I went with rocky road and was delighted.

The sandwich is a lot larger then you'd expect. Easily the size of my hand, I can't believe I haven't tried this place sooner. Skip dessert at the place you had dinner and go try Cookiez on Mill. You won't regret it!
