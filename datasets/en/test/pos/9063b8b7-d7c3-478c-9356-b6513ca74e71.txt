WOW, as said before the chopped salad is amazing and I don't even like salmon-but the combination is terrific!  The Crab enchiladas were to die for; and my stuffed pork chop good, but not amazing.  Portions are huge, even the small plates, so think SHARE!  The wine list is over the top and a bit difficult to follow, but our waiter/som gave us good suggestions and guidance through the maze. Will go back next visit and be sending friends...
