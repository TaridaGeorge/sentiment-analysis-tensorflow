I had tried many nail salon in the valley and haven't been able to find one that I am willing to go back to ...
But I am becoming a regular at this place ... I think the difference of this place is that it gives you a very clean feeling and look very organized in comparison to many .... and the ladies there actually pay attention to your nail instead of just going thru the motion ... 

Every time I went, my nail came out beautifully .... Michelle made my nail so pretty that I had stopped biting my nail all together ....
Try the gel nail, it lasts forever. Seriously it doesn't chip and look as nice as day 1 even after a month 

cash tips only though
