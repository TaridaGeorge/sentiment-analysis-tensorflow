What can I say, I love this place.  This is a great choice if you are watching your carbs and/or portions.  I can get a great 6oz steak with two sides for $9.99.  The portion and the price are perfect.  Add a $3 glass of house wine and its even better.  I think the steak is best if you ask them to leave off all of the seasoning and have it wood fired.  I also like their skinny margarita, which is super yummy!  The only drawback is that if you get there too late there is always a long wait.  Also they are not open for lunch, or I'd probably eat there more often.
