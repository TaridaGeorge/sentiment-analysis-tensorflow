When I found this place, I immediately assumed it was going to be too expensive - it's so neat, hip and clean - had to be out of reach, right?  But no - they are hip, neat, clean, plus you get NICE PEOPLE, great selection of products for your four legged furries, and REASONABLY PRICED items too.   They are also incredibly knowledgable about pet food - please don't tell me you are still buying IAMS at the grocery store - ask them why you shouldn't.    Your pets deserve good healthy quality food, and this is definitely the place to get it.   Even better, sometimes there are rescue pets available for adoption.   It's nice to buy your pet's food from a place that loves pets and cares about the animal welfare community.   Go!  Now!
