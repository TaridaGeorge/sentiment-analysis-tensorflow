Went for dinner last night - kind of surprising to find great French bistro food in a strip mall next door to a Subway, but..

My French onion soup and wife's foie gras (she was going to have the duck pate, but it'd all gone) were absolutely first class.  Confit de canard and coq au vin came next, both spot on.  Wobbled over to the pastry counter and wanted everything, but settled for a wonderful pumpkin-based creation washed down with a perfect espresso.

We'll be back.
