I have been going to this place for years. They used to set up a grill outside on Friday and Saturday nights and sell tacos. There would be a huge line and I would go every week but they said the city made them stop doing it. 
Still one of the best places in Phoenix for authentic Mexican tacos. I love the tacos, try them all! Shrimp burritos are good also and try the ceviche tostadas. 

They have Salcitas all over the valley but for some reason I would drive a bit further to go to this one as they were better. I think it was one of the first ones they built.

This place is "in da hood" and most people you will see here speak better spanish than english but if you love authentic Mexican tacos like I do this is a great place to go!
