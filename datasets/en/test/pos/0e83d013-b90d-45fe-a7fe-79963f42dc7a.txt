Great staff, Beautiful interior design, a bit dark but i guess it adds to the mysteriousness of the decor, they do not serve alcohol here, but have tasty smoothies!

their pho is FLAVORFUL and delicious!!
everything is nice and clean!

ordered their spring rolls, beef stew, another viet dish (dont recall the name) but it is rice skin with meat inside? lol im not sure.. but that was pretty good too!!

WILL BE BACK!
