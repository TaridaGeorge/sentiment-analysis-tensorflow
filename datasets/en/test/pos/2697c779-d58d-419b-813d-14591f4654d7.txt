I recently moved away from this pharmacy and I am so heartbroken.  I simply love the pharmacy staff.  They call you by first name and are always so helpful and friendly.  The pharmacist always tells me issues concerning a new med and the best way to take it.  They truly make you feel like they care,  I too have regretted going to another pharmacy because they are not so friendly especially CVS.  The cashiers at the front registers are awesome as well.  Keep up the good work.   When you are sick and taking tons of Meds...a smile and a how are you doing from another is nice!  Thanks Walgreens for caring!
