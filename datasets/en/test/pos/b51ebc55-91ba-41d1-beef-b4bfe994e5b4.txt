This place has the best Thai food in the East Valley. Their Pad Thai is outstanding. One of their waitresses is a little crazy and you can't really understand anything she says, but hey, at least you know it's authentic Thai. :) My only complaint is that they don't have crab wontons on their appetizer menu!
