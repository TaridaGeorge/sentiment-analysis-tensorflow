If you love authentic Italian food in a festive, holiday atmosphere, La Stalla is the restaurant to try. They have an extensive wine list and they give  you enough  wine  to enjoy the evening. 

We were a party of 8 on a Friday night and the service was superb. The wait staff were helpful, friendly and efficient. 

My minestrone soup was warm and delicious.  The grilled salmon was prepared well and served with steamed veggies that included cabbage.  I love steamed cabbage but since  most restaurants tend to overcook cabbage, La Stalla stole my heart. My group also ordered the lasagna and sweet potato ravioli. These dishes were made with fresh ingredients and well presented.  The desserts were delicious but my all time favorite dessert was the tiramisu. 

La Stalla Cucina is a great place to take your guest during the upcoming holiday.
