What can I say I love AJs especially the Boulangerie or coffee bar.  Jason is the best.   The pineapple ice tea with a slice of pineapple is deli-sh with a yummy cheese croissant.  I admit I usually get something from the coffee bar and bistro more so than the actual grocery store.  Oh and if you go check out the display/decorations they are usually pretty cool.
