An English biker bar rockin' James Brown and pouring ice cold Harp's on tap?

Sign me up.

This pseudo-hipster meets Iggy Pop on a harley bar is a gem. The drink specials are a plus but the crowd can't be beat. The bartenders are super laid back and even the occasional collared Scottsdaler rolls through, making for a great blend of laid back working folks with partying outcasts. 

About the farthest possible thing from Axis. Five stars.
