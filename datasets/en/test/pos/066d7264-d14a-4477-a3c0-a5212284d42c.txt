Ate here before a movie the other night with my hubby & daughter. We've been here numerous times before and are always pleased! If you call in advance, they take reservations for larger groups and are very accommodating. Caprese salad is awesome! And what to say about their amazing pizza .... I have cravings for their delicious crust often. Although the crust is thin, it will fill you up perfectly. Oreo cheesecake is phenomenal. Beer selection is great which is very important to me.
