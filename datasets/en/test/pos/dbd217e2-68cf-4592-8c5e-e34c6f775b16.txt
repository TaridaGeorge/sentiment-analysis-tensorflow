The stay started off a bit rough based on some other patrons, however the Gainey Suites made our stay so pleasurable I have to give 5 stars. Greeted with cookies and teddy bears with comfy beds that I got a great night's sleep on, with a lovely pool and a full sized kitchen my husband said "I could LIVE here!" Rave reviews for this classy and fabulous hotel.
