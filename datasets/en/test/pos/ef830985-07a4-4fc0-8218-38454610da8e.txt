It's been a few months since my first review, so I thought I'd drop a quick line and let you know that Liberty Market is a good place.  The owners are awesome and caring - and the staff (called "the brigade") and really nice, too.

Food portions are beyond generous.  Prices as low as $1.66 for an espresso or you can get a full sized, All American breakfast for $8.00.   

The environment is welcoming and great for groups. No stress or worries about being rushed out.  

Just an overall really nice "third place"
