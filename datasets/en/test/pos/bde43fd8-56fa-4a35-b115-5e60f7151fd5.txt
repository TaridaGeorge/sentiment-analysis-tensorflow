I would not know anything about this place if it wasn't for my cousin.  He introduced me to it about a year and a half ago and we make the drive just to go.  They have a great selection of food on the menu and have classic american dishes.

I usually get the BBQ Chicken Pizza and after I am done I just want another one.  They have great french fries and sweet potato fries.  One of the best things about this place is that it is on a farm (hence the name) so all the food is grown and cooked on the property.

The space is clean and somewhat chic, but not pretentious by any means.  They also have picnic styled benches outside that are great when the weather permits. 

Recommendation:  To anyone that likes american styled food and wants to eat like a champ.
