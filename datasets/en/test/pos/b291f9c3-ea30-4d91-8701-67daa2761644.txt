Best. Place. ever.

The exhibits of music around the world are very enlightening and fun to listen to. The "experience" room is very fun, of course, and I can't wait to go back with more kids than myself.

I haven't been to any of their concerts/shows, but I am looking forward to going in the future! This is now a permanent stop on my touring-visitors-around-AZ list.
