The place to be if your in the neighborhood! Specializing in Vietnamese cuisine, the family is originally from California so expect the food to be diverse, authentic, tasty, and most importantly - to die for! And as Arizona goes, Vietnamese cuisine or asian food in general is scarce and King Eggroll is AZ's premiere place to be. Their noodle soup is great, their rice plates are my favorite, and their desserts are delicious!
