My wife and I ate here prior to an event downtown. Metro light rail is conveniently right outside and an easy trip down to US Airways Center. We had a truffle tremor goat cheese plate with the Brancott Pinot Noir for an appetizer along with the poached pear appetizer. This was fantastic! Highly recommended. I think we'll be buying some if we can't find them for home use. I had the fillet mignon with the suggested cab sav and she had the Parmesan encrusted chicken with the suggested Pinot Gris. Both entrees were delicious. $87 before tip for 2 apps, 2 entrees and 3 glasses of wine. Portion sizes were on the small side, but we still left full.  We may be back for desert after the show! We'll definitely will be back for our next downtown event!
