I love everything about this place; how its decorated, the delicious food, and the friendly staff. I had the egg salad sandwich and it was perfect, just like my mom used to make, I haven't had a sandwich like that in a while. And the caprese pasta salad is sooo yummy. I can't wait to go back and try more

I wish this place was closer to my house because I would probably go there everyday! But it is defiantly worth the drive to support such a great local business.
