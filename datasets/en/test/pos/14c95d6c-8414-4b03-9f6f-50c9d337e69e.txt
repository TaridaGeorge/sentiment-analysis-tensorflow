I don't know what some of these people are talking about.  The gas prices and car washes are in line with the rest of N. Scottsdale and the food from the cafe is excellent.  I have tried the pulled pork, brisket and pulled chicken and the sauces they have available to compliment make the BBQ complete.  Salads are huge.  Craft beer selection is excellent.  A little pricey on some items, but seems about right for the convenience.  Oh, and the old school full-service at the pump, who else does that anymore?  Check your tire pressure, clean your windshield, worth a few extra bucks from time to time.
