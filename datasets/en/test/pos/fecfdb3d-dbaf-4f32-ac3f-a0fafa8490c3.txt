Yup.  Jason said it best, despite its location in the Scottsdale art district, this is real pizza, none of that played out foo-foo pizza.

This review is short because I'm typing with one hand and eating pizza with the other.  

Big floppy foldable cheesy pieces you can't  argue with. Their ingredients tasted top notch, and it had the perfect amount of grease your looking for when it comes to eating a hefty slice of pizza. 

Best of Italy has a great pizza and quality product and I recommend it to anyone.  They have this Chicken Parmesan pizza I'm looking forward to try.  

Not sure it's literally the "BEST" of Italy but its definitely "GREAT" pizza.
