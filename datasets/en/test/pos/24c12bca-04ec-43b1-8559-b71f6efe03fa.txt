Something about Neds is just BETTER than any other sub place. The bread, the meats and cheeses, the mayo... Oh man. I can't get enough of Neds. Recently catered a party with them and (unknown to me) they'd accidentally shorted the meat on the platter (we still had leftovers) and they called out of the blue 2 days later telling me they had messed up and asking me if they could give me a gift card to make up for it! Who does that?? Amazing.
