I love this place! Indian is my absolute favorite and I've been going to Royal Taj for 3 years now. 
I always order the same - vegetable pakoras, an order of naan and Aloo Dumm. It's consistently perfect. 
I'm kind of a wimp and get mine mild but no one I've eaten there with who likes a lot of heat has had any complaints. 
The service is also very friendly and we're always made to feel at home.
