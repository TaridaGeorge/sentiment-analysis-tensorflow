this place is heaven.  honestly, i would go here again in a heartbeat.  the rooms were amazing and the pool was like an amusement park, which includes a man-made beach.  i had so much fun in this "water park" that i was your creepy old guy who was having fun with your kids.  i cannonballed and waterslid with the best of them.

there's a golf course like right behind this resort as well, which is awesooooooome.  they also have tennis courts :D :D

they always have shows here too.  i got to see native americans do dances and hawks/eagles/vultures/big birds fly around me.  at night, they have bands play on  stages, and with the open environment of the resort, it creates a nice ambiance.

i would give more than 5 stars to this place.
