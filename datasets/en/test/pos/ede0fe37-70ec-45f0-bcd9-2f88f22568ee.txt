Hands down, best pizza I've ever had in my entire life, I could eat a Large order by myself if I wanted to and then some.
I always stop by here after I'm done shopping or before a movie. A delicious quick fix when I'm hungry, and they have quite variety of pizza! I think I've tried 'em all!  

The female servers there don't seem to happy to be serving but the awesome pizza make up for their 'meh' attitude. :)
