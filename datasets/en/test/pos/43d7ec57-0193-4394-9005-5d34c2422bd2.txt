Delicious.  Everything.  Sandwiches, Wraps, Salads, Cookies, Smoothies.  Good value for the money. Clean.

Here's the details:  The flat bread sandwiches are very inexpensive and delicious.  The Thai Chicken and Jamaican Jerk Chicken wraps are amazing.  They use some surprisingly different and fresh ingredients to make everything so much more special than run of the mill.  Immune Blast Smoothie kept me from calling in to work one day last winter...really, I was feeling so sick and then got one and was all better!  Speaking of Work, my co-workers took a poll and voted Blimey Limey as the one we all ranked in our top five smoothies.  The place is always clean, so is the restroom, and everyone hard working and friendly.  They do get busy though, so sometimes there can be a wait.  Call a head if you are in a hurry.
