I've been a customer of Ray's since my freshman year at ASU, 1983. I make it a point to try and get to Ray's whenever I'm in town, and I always leave w/ a great haircut and a smile. 

PROS: old school attitude; friendly customers; reasonable price; Charles, Jerry, and my favorite barber of all time, Lloyd

CONS: more ESPN, less Modern Marvels (ha ha)

Ray's has a home town feel, and why wouldn't they? They are an ASU staple. I'm guessing they have taken care of damn near every ROTC cadet for the last 4 decades . . . Thanks guys!
