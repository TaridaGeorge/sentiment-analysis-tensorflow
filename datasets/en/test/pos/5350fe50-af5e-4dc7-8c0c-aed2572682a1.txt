Rosita's is the little local gem that I stumbled upon, if you're use to commercial mexican food like Macayos then you're in the wrong place! Remember the chips cost a dollar, but I'm not complaining they are so worth it. Steaming hot and fresh when they come out to you and served with a delicious fiery red and green salsa. Whenever I go there I have to order the green chili tamales, mmm it is so yummy!! They have delicious authentic mexican drinks as well, and I tried their mango-chile and rum mixed drink, it is a must if you like the mexican candies it tastes like that but blended in a cold alcoholic concoction. I love the decoration as well, some beautiful paintings with festive colors splashed on the walls. A fun and laid back place to go when your craving mexican food! Two thumbs way up!
