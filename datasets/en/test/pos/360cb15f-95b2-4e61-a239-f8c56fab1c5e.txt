i cant review restaurants in phx and leave out LGO. breakfast, coffee ambiance, service, pizza - 5 stars. happy hour 3 stars. Not very many places beat this place out for saturday or sunday morning coffee and or breakfast after a nice wrkout, run, hike or... anything else at home in bed with your better half. must see for my visitors
