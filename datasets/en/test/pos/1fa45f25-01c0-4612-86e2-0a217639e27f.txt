For me, it doesnt get much better then this. Well organized and a staff that actually knows about wine. VERY well priced as well. My BFF and I were in there last night to start shopping for wine for her impending wedding (sounds doom like, eh?). We found so many bargains we walked out of there with 14 different bottles to taste including several that were under 2 bucks (look out Charles Shaw!).. I tried the cab last night.. not to shabby, fruity and not to complex.. very accessible for non red lovers.. anyhoo one of the sales guys was so helpful! He turned me on (yes he was cute) to a section that was dedicated to Portugal.. who knew? Great value here and no stupid discount card needed!!
