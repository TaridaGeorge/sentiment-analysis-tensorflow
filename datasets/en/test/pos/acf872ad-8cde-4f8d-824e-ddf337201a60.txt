I love this museum.  So much so, that I became a member.  They have a great variety of work, the dosiers are very knowledgeable, and they constantly put on amazing exhibits.  Of course the Phoenix Art Museum pales in comparison to Chicago or New York, but very few museum can exceed those two cities anyway.  If you are looking for something to do and feel like learning something or looking at something beautiful, you should check this place out. It is worth it.
