By far, the best Thai food I have ever had. I love the reaction I get when I order it spicy and they ask how spicy and I tell them, as spicy as you can make it. 

I love their squid and other more exotic foods, but the chicken is always cooked perfectly as well. I have tried a sauteed tofu dish that was really yummy when I am in the mood for something lighter. 

I work nearby, so on occasion, get to sneak out to go to lunch. And it is worth it. Amazing, yummy food, delightful service, and a great little place. The decor is a bit out dated, but Im okay with that. It doesn't distract me from the wonderful aroma when you walk in to the zesty, savory, flavors of their cuisine. I recommend them to everyone!
