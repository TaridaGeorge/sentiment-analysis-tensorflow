I'd never been to Sweet Republic before, but we decided to host an event here (north valley friday night) on the last Friday night of June. The owners were very friendly and welcoming. The place is really cute and their ice cream is amazing! I had the date ice cream paired with roquefort blue cheese ice cream. It sounded crazy so I had to get it, and it was really really good! (for the less adventurous, S R offers normal flavors too, my son had mint chocolate chip). The home made brittle makes for a yummy topping and next time I plan to try one of their ice cream sandwiches- yummy ice cream in between two oversized cookies. 

Highly recommended!!
