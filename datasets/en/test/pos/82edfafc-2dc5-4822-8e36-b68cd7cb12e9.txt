The pharmacists and pharmacist assistants at this CVS pharmacy are absolutely wonderful.  Super fast, very organized and they are all extremely friendly.  I am so thankful that we switched from another chain pharmacy to this CVS - the customer service level is night and day compared to our last pharmacy.  Way to go CVS!
