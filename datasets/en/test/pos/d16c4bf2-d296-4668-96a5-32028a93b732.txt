A very welcome addition to the Melrose district of central Phoenix. This is a resale store that is spacious and bright, and while it may not be as large as a Goodwill, you'll find better quality stuff - all at thrift store prices. The store benefits three local LGBT nonprofit groups: 1in10, which provides youth with tools to improve self esteem and self-acceptance; Aunt Rita's Foundation, which raises money to fill the gaps of HIV/AIDS Program funding in the Phoenix area; and the  Community Church of Hope, which provides outreach and spiritual guidance to the LGBT and allies community of metro Phoenix.  So come here to shop and save money on furniture, home furnishings, jewelry, art, clothing and gift items. And come here, too, to donate items; donations are tax-deductible, of course.
