Great chiropractor!! I have been getting adjusted for over 12 years by many......many chiropractors and Dr. Fern is absolutely one of my favorites. Don't let the small mom and pop operation fool you, it's actually better than the huge cookie cutter clinics out there. If you're looking for results, this is the guy!!! I'm so happy I found Dr.Fern.
Only bad thing....office is pretty hard to find, it's in the middle of a medical plaza....just call ahead for specific directions.
