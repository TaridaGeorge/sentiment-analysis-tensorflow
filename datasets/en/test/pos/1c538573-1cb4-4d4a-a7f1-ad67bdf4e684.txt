I'm not shitting you, this wasTHEEEE best breakfast I've ever had!

The pancakes are OUT OF THIS WORLD and the coffee is great.

I had the Eggs Benedict which was really good, due in most part to the really tasty ham. 

Unfortunately I did not order any pancakes but kept stealing bites from my girl's plate. Without question the best pancakes I've ever tasted.

I can not wait to go back!
