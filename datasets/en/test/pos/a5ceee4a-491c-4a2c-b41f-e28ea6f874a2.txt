Went to this restaurant for the 1st time last Thursday for a birthday celebration. Everything was awesome from beginning to end. It was pretty packed for a Thursday night but its is also North Scottsdale so I would assume that is the normal crowd. We had a 7:15 reservation & arrived about 20 mins early but we were seating at our reserved time. Everyone's food was good & made well. No complaints from us. They even do free ice cream for birthdays. Really excited about my next experience.
