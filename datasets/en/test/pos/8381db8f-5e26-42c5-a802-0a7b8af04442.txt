Talk about Service!  I received an awesome deal on my mobile phone to try out their new pizza's at the Oldtown location for $5 was I glad.   I ordered the BBQ chicken, without cheese, and had some arugula added, though it comes with cheese normally - it was absolutely awesome.  My kids enjoyed the margherita pizza and asked for more.  So then I went home and told my husband about it and he signed up for their mobile deals.  The next day, he ordered an Italian Sausage type pizza. Loved it.   We have since told many of our friends and family about this new addition to the Gelato Spot.   Customer service, staff and management is above par and we'll for sure be back.    So much better than other pizza places and healthier, too!  Now that I'm thinking about it....I'm craving it again.
