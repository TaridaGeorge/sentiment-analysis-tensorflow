Frequent LGO-er. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Parking continues to be an issue, but the proprietors have made strides in improving the experience for drivers. Ideal for neighbors within walking, biking distance (thank goodness!). Whether breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, coffee or dessert -- LGO is an easy choice. Chef Cole Turner's desserts are A-MAZING. Try the peanut butter pie.
