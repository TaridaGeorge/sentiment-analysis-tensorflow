I have been going here for years and have always really enjoyed myself! The fish is good and is on bar with the overpriced places in Scottsdale without the price tag. I was a little wary of the All-You-Can-Eat, but its a fair deal if you can eat a lot of sushi. I found the best trick is to order in rounds otherwise your eyes can be bigger than your stomach
