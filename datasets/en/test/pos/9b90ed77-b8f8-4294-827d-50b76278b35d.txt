This is an update to my previous review where I shared my formerly top-secret recipe for the best WW chicken sandwich in the West.

Having taken a 180 degree turn in my diet, I will no longer be eating that amazing chicken sandwich, but, do not fear! There is hope -- thanks to the WW black bean patty.  As a matter of fact, the already world-class sandwich may be even better *without* chicken.

Here's how you roll....vegetarian style!

Grab Bag #6 -- Vegetarian

Then mark the following circles...
Black Bean Patty
Wheat Bread
Toasted
(pick your size)
Pepper Jack Cheese (optional)
Hummus
Tzatziki
Tomatoes
Cucumbers
Olive Salad
Salt
Pepper

Bam!  Pay your tab and wait for the slab of delicious goodness to emerge!

Hint:  write something unique on the back of your bag so you can track it down the assembly line.
