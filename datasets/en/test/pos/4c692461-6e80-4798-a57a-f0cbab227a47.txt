I don't understand why so many people whine about the light rail having bums etc.        
You people need to get off your high horse! There are homeless people everywhere. Be grateful we have a rail system in Phoenix. It's better than the ones I've seen in other cities. (I've seen rats in Philadelphia and trash in New York) 
I like the one in Phoenix. I take it all the time to work and it sure beats the traffic. I think it's a nicely designed rail transport that is equipped with bike racks. If it weren't for the ligh rail, it would have cost me $30 bucks for a taxi to go to the airport.
Thank you Metro Light Rail!
