I was here back in January with a couple who had always raved that this was a special place and I would say it lived up to their billing and then some.  I counted 14 different amuse-bouches served individually and in bunches during the 5 course meal.   I actually felt that the $82 per person was a bargain compared to some of my dining experiences other places (of course they have to pay much higher rents since Binkley's location is quite unassuming.)  I have to say that I will be visiting Binkley's every time I visit the Boulder's.
