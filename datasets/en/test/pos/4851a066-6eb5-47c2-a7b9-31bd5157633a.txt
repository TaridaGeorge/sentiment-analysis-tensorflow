I'm in love!  I only found Chestnut Lane about two weeks ago, but have been back three times now.  Upon my first visit, I asked the gentleman behind the counter about the kale salad.  He offered a sample and I was hooked.  I have never liked kale, but this salad is tremendously delicious!  The poached egg with roasted veggies was perfection.  And to satisfy any sweet tooth, you have to try the nutella pound cake.  The place is beautifully designed.  You feel as though you are sitting in a little french country kitchen.  The staff could not be more helpful or kind.  This little place is a must visit.
