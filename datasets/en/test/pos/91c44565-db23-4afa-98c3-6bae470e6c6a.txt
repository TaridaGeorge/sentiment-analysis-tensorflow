I was looking for a light healthy meal after cheating last night. I found Desert Roots on Yelp and decided to try something new. I ordered the plate which was 3 choices for $8.50. I got the chana masala, dolmades, and pasta salad. All dishes were very good and flavorful, along with being Vegan so I didn't have to worry about dietary issues. The portion size was very generous, a very good value for the money. They also offer samples that you can try, before deciding on what to order. I would definitely come back.
