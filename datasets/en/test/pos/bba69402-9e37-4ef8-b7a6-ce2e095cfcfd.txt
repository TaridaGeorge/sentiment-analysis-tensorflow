A ten dollar gift certificate arrives in the mail from SLT.
In print fashioned for a person of advancing years, a notice at the bottom reads; 
                
                NO PURCHASE NECESSARY

Load up the car baby, we're headed to Sur La Table!

We spent 92 dollars after receiving our unwarranted ten dollar prize, however, the event did yield a cathartic moment.

I now know the pride one (wife) feels when sashaying about, in an all-too-obvious proud-shopper moment, explaining how she saved ten dollars today.

I totally get it now.
Thanks Sur La Table.
Or not?
