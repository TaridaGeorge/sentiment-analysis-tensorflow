This place is the best pizza in Phoenix! There is also one by Tempe Market place. Our favorite is the Homade Italian Sausage and Peperoni pizza! 

When the Tempe location first opened it was like a hidden gem that no one knew about. Now the wait can be any where from 15 to 45 minutes! The deliver around the mall and you can always call in and pick up! The awesome thing is they know your name when you call in and they keep track of what you have ordered in the past!

BEST PIZZA!
