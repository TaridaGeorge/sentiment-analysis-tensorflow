Awesome Italian food! One of my Scottsdale favorites, Tommy V's has a great staff, wine list and consistently delicious food. Love the new fried Burrata and the calamari is a must. They also have a good happy hour menu with small plates to share. They do live music on the weekends- great spot for a date or night out with friends!
