No trip to Phoenix is complete for me unless I have Spinato's Pizza.  This is the first time I have been to this new location and it is just as good as the others with a really nice decor and great service.  We always get the Sausage and Pepperoni pizza, and it's always good.  Also, we always start with the garlic cheese bread, seriously the best I have had anywhere!  The sauce on their pizza is different, a little sweet, but I love it.  If you are looking for good pizza in Phoenix, this would be not only my top, but my only recommendation!
