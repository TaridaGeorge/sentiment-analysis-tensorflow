Ever since I found about about this bakery, I always try to stop there when in town. I especially appreciate that a lot of their items are made without eggs because I'm intolerant of them as well. 

They have, without question, the best gluten free, egg free cinnamon raisin bagels I have ever tasted. I also enjoyed their baguettes and the strawberry champagne cupcakes. Yum!
