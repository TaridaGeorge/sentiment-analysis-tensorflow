I love the office staff here! There's one woman, Liz, who's incredibly comforting and understanding, never cold or short with me. Dr. Steen is also a very gentle, patient man. I pretty much freaked out about getting all my work done and he listened to and addressed all of my fun little paranoias with an eerily calm manner. 

After having my work done, I've called about 18 times about different things that I think are going wrong, and everyone has been so incredibly understanding that it's hard for me not to say "I love my dentist office". And that's weird.

Almost minus a star for not providing me with the cool irrigator thingy that everyone else gets when they have their wisdom teeth pulled.
