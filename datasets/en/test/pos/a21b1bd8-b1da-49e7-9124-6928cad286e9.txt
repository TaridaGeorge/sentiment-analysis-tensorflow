I just made the switch to vegetarianism a few months ago, and have been scouting out some decent cuisine when I stumbled on Green today.  I ordered the Spicy Po Boy, and damn if it wasn't the best Po Boy I've ever had!!!  (vegan or otherwise).  Casual unassuming atmosphere with a bit of a beatnick vibe.  I will definitely be going back to try the "Drunken Chicken" along with a Tsoymami desert!
