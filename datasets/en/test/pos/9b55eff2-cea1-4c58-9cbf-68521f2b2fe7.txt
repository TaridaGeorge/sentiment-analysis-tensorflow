Lobby's only does Chicago dogs, burgers, and fries, but they do them extremely well.  It's a clean atmosphere, fast service, good prices, and fantastically tasty food.  These are easily the best burgers I've had anywhere.  I prefer to go on the week days where the owner is doing the cooking.  On the weekend there's someone else there and the food is more like 4/5 instead of 5/5.
