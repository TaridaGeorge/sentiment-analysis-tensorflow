I love the beer here first, nice selection and seasonal. In my opinion always support your local businesses first. 

The fish and chips here is probably the best I had so far and for $10 you get huge portions. I will come back here every time I am back in town! 

Beware since it is so close to ASU campus this place gets packed at night. Bring your ID at night or you will not get in, but you are automatically 21+ if you park next to the bouncer and walk in front of him to the place!
