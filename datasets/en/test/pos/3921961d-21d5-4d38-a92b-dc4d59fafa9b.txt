My family and I just love this place. It's our favorite family restaurant. Although, they removed one of our favorite dishes - The Big ol' Ravioli. But we always love the pizza!
The thing we particularly love about this place is the fair prices, the unique and warm atmosphere, and that the servers are always very personable.  We always arrive between 4-5pm and usually don't have to wait. The outdoor patio is very pleasant.  We have probably dinned here 20 times and it's always been a good experience.
