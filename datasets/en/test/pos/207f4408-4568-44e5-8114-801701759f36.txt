If I were to set up a market this is how I'd do it.  All of the essentials and then some, reasonably priced, friendly staff, easy to navigate and get in/out.

Try any of the house brand stuff - most of which is delicious and cheap.  Hit it at the right time and you can score huge on the discount aisle.

Their coupon/points system is easy and can save even more.  I can count on one hand the number of times I've been to my old place since they opened this one.

Granted, if you have a huge family and typically go to Wal-Mart and buy in bulk, this may not be the place for you - but if you have a small family, are single or are in a relationship with no kids - score.
