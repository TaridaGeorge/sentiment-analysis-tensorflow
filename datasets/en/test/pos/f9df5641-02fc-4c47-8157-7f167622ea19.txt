yum yum yum yum yum. Been wanting to try this place after trying a fry bread taco at Oktoberfest. Took my daughter there today. Got a beef chili taco and chorizo taco to go. Had to resist licking the plate. Awesome food fast service. Had to get in there before every city crew worker and mini bus driver filled up the lot ( the lot is small and can be tricky to get into with the traffic if its heavy ).
