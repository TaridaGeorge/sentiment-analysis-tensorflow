For the Phoenix Metro, it doesn't get much better then this! They even sell tapioca pearls for my occasional much needed bubble tea fix! Plus they sell tendon and trip for pho.. oh the delights and treasures in store for me on each visit are amazing! I get butterfly's every time I'm on my way there! Sort of like going to Disneyland for the first time.. love and good times!

I love Lee Lee! Its the real deal!
