I'm crazy about this place!!! Their frozen yogurt is delicious, and it is serve yourself so you can mix and match whatever flavors you like! They also have almost 50 different toppings to choose from, including fresh fruit, candy, nuts and chocolate or caramel sauce. The price is right too, especially this weekend! 50% off for the rest of the weekend. I will definitely be back
