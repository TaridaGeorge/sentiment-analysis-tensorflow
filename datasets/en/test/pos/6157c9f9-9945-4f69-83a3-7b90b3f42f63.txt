Is Hard Rock Cafe really still in business? With The Arrogant Butcher across the street I just can't imagine why. The hubby and I stopped by The Arrogant Butcher before a Suns game and had an AWESOME experience there. Our goal was to try a few different appetizers and that turned out to be more than enough food for two. 

House Soft Pretzels with Provolone Fondue=the best thing that ever happened to me.
Artichoke Hummus=unique flavor that goes beyond your regular ol' hummus
Crispy Rock Shrimp=damn good 
Potato Fritters=worth the drive from Chandler all on their own

I can't WAIT to go back here and try everything else on the menu. :D
