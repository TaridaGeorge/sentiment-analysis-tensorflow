Ticoz is one of my favorite places and I always have a good experience when I vist there.   With some restaurants I find a dish that I like so much that I have trouble ordering anything else no matter how good the other dish sounds, and that's the case at Ticoz.  So I recommend the outstanding Coconut Ginger Curry.

For an appetizer, it's hard to beat the guacammus--a hummus and guacamole blend--or the chips and assorted salsas.
