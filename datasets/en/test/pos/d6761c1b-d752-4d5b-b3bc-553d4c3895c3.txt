The reason I go to Express is for their pants.  They have awesome work/going out pants and they're reasonably priced.  By reasonably I mean $70-100, but you have to remember that you're paying for the quality.

I still have a pair of black pants and the cutest purple sweater from Express that I bought 7 years ago, but they don't look old at all.  Keep in mind that with most of their pants, you do have to have them dry cleaned.

Another great thing about Express is that their pants come in various lengths. They have something like short, average and tall- which is awesome for me because I am tall and it's very hard to find long pants. 

I think you can find cute, less expensive shirts, bags and accessories somewhere other than Express, but you just can't beat their pants!
