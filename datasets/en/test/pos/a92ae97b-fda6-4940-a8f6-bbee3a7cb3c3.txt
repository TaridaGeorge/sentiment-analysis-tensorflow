I'm reluctant to write a good review, because I don't want this already popular place getting raided by douchery. But, simply put, TT Roadhouse is awesome. They always have good stuff playing on the tv (tits and zombies anyone?), good beer on tap and an eclectic mix of people. Throw in a good jukebox, and you have a recipe for an excellent dive bar in South Scottsdale.
