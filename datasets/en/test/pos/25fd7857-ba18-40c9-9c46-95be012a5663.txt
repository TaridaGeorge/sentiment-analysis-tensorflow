I stopped to get some gas, a drink, and something to eat on the way to Phoenix from San Diego.  I could not find my car charger, but found my wall charger, and they were nice enough to let me charge my phone while I had a quick bite to eat.  I told them I could not find my car charger and only had my wall charger and was down to one bar on my cell phone, and they were very nice and let me charge my phone.   Not only that, they were very nice and didn't say, "Oh, another Californian," or anything; they just smiled and thanked me for stopping (even though there's about 35 miles where there's no service so it's not like I had much choice).
