Really enjoy Jobing Dot Com Arena. Great place to see a concert or a Coyotes game. 

It's always clean and the staff always seems to be knowledgeable and in a good mood. 

But the absolute best part about seeing something at Jobing Dot Com? FREE parking. Right NEXT door to the arena. 

And I never seem to have trouble with traffic flow either arriving or leaving. 

Great addition to the Valley's entertainment scene.
