Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  We had our wedding weekend at Camelback Inn, so of course we enjoyed Rita's Kitchen several times.  Their brunch options are AMAZING!  I love the made to order waffles, pancakes (they'll add M&M's!), omelets, and french toast.  There's lots of fresh fruit and unlimited orange juice and coffee.  Prices are reasonable too!  The service is super attentive, the scenery gorgeous.

They do have a pricey Sunday brunch, but we passed on that one....

I can't wait to return with my husband to reminisce and enjoy some yummy food!
