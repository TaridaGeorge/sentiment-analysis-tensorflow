The boulangerie is a purveyor of Illi coffee, and delicious homemade pastries and cakes. Sushi comes in many different forms at the in-house Sushi-bar, and if you ask, they will give you free green tea.  This is a great market, and I really enjoy the service, and food options whether it is sweet or pizza from the deli.
