If you want an authentic experience, if you really want to feel like you have some manner of ethnic experience, you need to come to Haji Baba.  

It's a little middle-eastern market.  It's a corner grocery.  It's a family-run restaurant.  It's freaking good.  

The hummus is pretty good, with fresh-made pita.  The feta cheese app is really good.  The chicken shawerma plate is top-notch, and my god is there a ton of food.  Heck, order the gyros plate for around $6 and when it arrives, mounds of succulent meat, tzsaziki sauce, rice and Greek salad, go ahead and take a bite before you decide to pull a Johnny Depp from Once Upon a Time in Mexico and go back to kill the cook because it's just too good.  

It's cheap, it's filling, it's quality, and it's ridiculous that it's not packed from open to close.  

Good ol' Haji Baba.
