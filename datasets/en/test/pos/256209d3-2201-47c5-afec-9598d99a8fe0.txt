Boutique Solie is an absolutely fabulous store ladies! The owner Beth really has an eye for fashion and the inventory changes on a daily basis so you can always find something new. 

The last time I was in I almost wrestled this gorgeous green dress from my girlfriend who spotted it first. The prices are spot on and the variety of jewelry, bags, clothing and shoes is unique and fashion forward. Many of the clothing lines are eco-friendly so you can feel good about your retail therapy. 

Beth also does spray tans in the store and they are cruelty free.  Being fashionable and conscientious is the idea behind Boutique Solie, and the idea is carried out well. Whether you are looking for a weekend wardrobe or wanting to get some instant color this should be your new "go to" spot. You can thank me later.
