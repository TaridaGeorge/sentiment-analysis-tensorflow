Mercantile is an awesome vintage store and salon combo. Super friendly customer service. They had some great classic pieces but some of the prices were upwards of $50-$70 for used, vintage clothes. Seems kinda steep. But other pieces were fairly cheap, around $20. So I guess it depends on what you're looking for. I picked up a cute vintage necklace for only $14!
