One of my friends took me here after raving about their parent's passion for this place and how they have been going here year after year.  Oh my god!  This place is sooooo amazing!  The owner is so sweet as well.  It's authentic, delicious, and really reasonably priced, too.  If you even think your left overs will make it to your house (or even the 101) think again.  This place is just plain awesome!
