I went in here to get my nape pierced. I was incredibly nervous, but the staff was really professional and helpful. They're very straightforward, they know what they're doing, and they don't just want your money. They really care about your body, your piercing, and your health. They only sell internally threaded, high quality jewelry, and the location itself is the cleanest parlor I've ever seen. I happily went home with a new piercing that day.

I went back about a year after getting my nape pierced to have them help replace a disk that had fallen out (it's hard to put your own disks back on the back of your neck!) and was again incredibly happy with the service I received.
