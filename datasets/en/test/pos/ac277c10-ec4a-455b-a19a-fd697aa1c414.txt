This place has an awesome product, and the service to match. I will be talking about TPCC to anyone, and everyone, that will listen. 

I ordered the house specialty, The Phoenix, and it was 10 times better than any Cheesesteak I've gotten in Philly, or otherwise. The bread was perfectly soft with a slightly crusty outside, the onions and peppers were cooked to perfection, it was dripping with melted cheese, and the fresh jalape√±os were very flavorful.

The accompanying fries were slightly battered and salted very reasonably. They were nice and hot with a fresh crunch.

Please do yourself a favor and try these guys out. The service from the staff was some of the best I've ever experienced. Thanks TPCC! I'll definitely come back.
