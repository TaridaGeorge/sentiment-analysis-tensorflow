What's best to support a local company?   No need Starbuks or coffee bean, when you can have great non burnt coffee.   The decor is fun n hip, I love seeing the different customers there too.   Everyone is nice n down to earth.... They also have wifi and great music, while u sip your hot or iced mojo....
