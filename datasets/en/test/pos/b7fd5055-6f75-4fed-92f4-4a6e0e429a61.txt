We love this place! First discovered through the use of Groupon almost a year ago, and have been back numerous times ever since.

Happy hour specials are great, the food takes a bit of time to arrive, but is always worth the wait. It's not a place you want to be rushed out of anyway, so waiting a bit on a nice patio with a beautiful view is not so bad...

The staff is nice, professional and friendly.  The only thing they could use are some misters on the patio, since it can be a little warm in the summer months up there.  Other than that, this place is perfect.  The art and the couches are great, we love it!
