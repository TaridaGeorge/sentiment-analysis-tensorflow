I've only been here once; it was about a month ago for happy hour on a Friday night.  I also didn't pay for any drinks, so I can't tell you if there were happy hour specials/prices.  I know I know, I'm full of useful information here.  

What I loved about this place is the modern furniture inside that is very open.  The layout sort of suggests parties intermingle, which is fun.  There was a nice mix for a crowd, I'd say upper 20's and up.  Half professionals, half lazy asses who don't work.  (Just joking, maybe they can dress casual for work, I don't know.)  I would love to go to Side Bar on Saturday night or stay past happy hour on Friday night to see if the atmosphere changes much.  I hope not.  

Will definitely go back:)
