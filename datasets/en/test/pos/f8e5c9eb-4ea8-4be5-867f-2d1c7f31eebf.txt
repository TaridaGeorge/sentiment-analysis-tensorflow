Fantastic event for a great cause. The registration process was efficient and easy. They got us right in to the event. Inside can only be described as a cupcake lovers paradise! They gave us each a bag with some goodies which was great to carry all the cards and brochures from the cupcake places. Tried more cupcakes than I care to admit! They had water stations, milk, and chocolate milk. There was even a bar area when you could purchase an adult beverage. Great raffle prizes, great merchandise for sale to remember the event by, and all the vendors were really nice and gladly explained what was in the cupcakes. (I have a peanut allergy and managed to make it through sampling without any close calls!) Can't wait for next years...any event that forces me to eat cupcakes and goes to a help a good cause... count me in!!!
