Delicious burgers grilled over charcoal and dressed the way YOU want it at the self-service condiment bar. One of top 3 best burgers I've ever had, and full of smoky grilled flavor goodness.  Very reasonably priced!  I made my way by bus on a long layover at the airport, and it was well worth the trip and time spent.
