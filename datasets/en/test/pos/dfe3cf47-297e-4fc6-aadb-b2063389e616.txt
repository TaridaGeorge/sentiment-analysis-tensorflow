My daughter has been taking classes here for 7 years. She takes class everyday for a total of 9 hours per week. She absolutely loves all of her dance instructors. Her 2 younger brothers started classes this year and are just as happy. I feel my daughter can go on to be a professional dancer and was able to have an enjoyable dance experience as a child, which most studios do not offer. I recommend this studio for all children that love dance. This is a community, not just a studio.
