What a great way to escape the normal life and act like you are somewhere else for a day. 

I swear you forget where you are once you find a cove and jump in the water. There are so many places to drop anchor and have a nice time. 

You can rent boats, eat on the lake, swim, ski, jetski, fish, scuba dive, etc. This place rocks.
