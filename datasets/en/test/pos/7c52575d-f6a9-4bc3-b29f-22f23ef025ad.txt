OOOHHH I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! FIrst you drive through beautiful Cave Creek, Arizona!! The surrounding mountains are so gorgeous. The views are breathtaking! You stop at Rancho Maniana and there is a Restaurant at the Golf Course and it's the best!!! The atmosphere is gorgeous and the food is delectible! The food is mouth-watering in every bite! This place is a "must see" on our list every time we visit Arizona! (almost every year!). They have "different" menu items than some other places and some of your every day type of things also. They have an outdoor patio that has marvelous mountain views and the golfcourse of course! Their desserts are special and yummy and their main dishes are always made with the best and most delicious foods!
