"I had a wonderful experience at Sage! Amber was amazing. Right away I clicked with her. She was easy to talk to and answered any questions I had with my skin. I got the Sage Signature Organic Facial. I would highly recommend this service. It was 75 minutes of pure relaxation. Also, the products were wonderful and my skin never felt better. On top of the facial, I got the Dermaplaning service. If you don't know what this is you have to get it! It instantly made my face look fantastic. This was my first time at Sage and I all ready pre-booked for my next appointment. And that is a first for me. Thank you so much Amber!"
