Just got my car back from being detailed, again Brad did an excellent job!  I have taken my Infiniti to Brad three times now and every time I am impressed with how great my car looks.  I always get the full detailing on the inside.  They clean the carpets, treat the leather, clean the dash, detail all the nooks and crannies on the inside, shampoo the trunk. We also have the exterior wash, wax and wheels detailed.  My car looks like it did when I bought it in 2005!  I highly recommend Brad and his team, they have never let me down.  Brad is always friendly, professional and accommodating to my schedule.  Thank you Brad!
