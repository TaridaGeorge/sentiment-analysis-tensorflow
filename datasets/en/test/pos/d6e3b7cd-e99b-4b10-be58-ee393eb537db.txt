This has been my best eggs Benedict experience in Phoenix. After having a 20 minute conversation with my brother about how badly people destroy hollandaise sauce,  Surprise surprise!  Their sauce was the perfect consistency. Eggs were cooked perfectly.  Presentation with the fingerling potatoes was beautiful.  

This is as good as it gets.
