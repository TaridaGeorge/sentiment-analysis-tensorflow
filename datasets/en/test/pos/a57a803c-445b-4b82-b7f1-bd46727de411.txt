If you want a filling and creative meal- this is it! How can you get better than a pie crust wrapped around anything from salmon and asparagus , greek feta chicken -to a thanksgiving meal - and wash it down with a cold beer- this place is a must taste- and you're hooked!  The only draw back was squeezing my very pregnant friend into a church pew booth- when pull out seats were limited- but - we left happily full with leftovers for later. GO!!
