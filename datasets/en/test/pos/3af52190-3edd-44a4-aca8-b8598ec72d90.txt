Petique is a gem tucked at the end of the Biltmore Fashion Square. Great pet store for unique pet toys and beds that you can't find at your big box pet chains. Petique offers numerous local products which is always a plus. That is only a small part of what makes this place so amazing. The pet adoptions is what this store is all about. 

I can't tell you how many times we have been at this store and a dog, cat or even rabbit is given a second chance with the help of AHS (Arizona Humane Society). Thanks again AHS for everything you do to help our furry friends. Great store that is so much more.
