The Service department here is excellent.  I have nothing but good things to say about Vince Medina and his level of customer service.  Nobody likes spending money on repairs but we really don't have a choice, it is going to happen.  I really appreciate the coordination and convenience of service appointments.  I have been to other dealerships in the East Valley but am really happy here.

Thank you Vince you make a big difference.
