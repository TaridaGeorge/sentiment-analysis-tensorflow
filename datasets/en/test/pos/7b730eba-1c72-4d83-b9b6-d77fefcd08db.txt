We checked out the prices at The Dump, the sales person there just were too pushy. and their prices were not the lowest.  We checked out the prices at Mattress Firm to see if they were any cheaper.  We had a wonderful experience!  The salesperson was friend and helpful NOT pushy at all.  They had the i-select model bed that my friend was looking for.  They were $200 cheaper, delivery was cheaper, and free tempur pedic pillows.  SOLD!!!  My friend is happy as a customer.
