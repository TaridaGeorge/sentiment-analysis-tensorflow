Alberto's is definitely a hidden gem in Cave Creek.  Their pizza was one of the best I have ever eaten.  Their pasta and meat balls were also to die for.

Alberto is from Rome and he knows Italian cuisine.  If you're looking for glamour and glitz, this is not the place.  If you want to have some amazing Italian cuisine at a restaurant that feels more like grandma's place in the country, then this is the place to go.
