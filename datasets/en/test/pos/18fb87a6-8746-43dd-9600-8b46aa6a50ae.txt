After having my car serviced at two different Hyundai dealerships in WA, I needed to send my kudos to Hyundai of Tempe. My car was spoiled with all the complimentary services they offered: free car wash and a thorough 25-point inspection each visit, regardless of the amount of $$ I spent.  Not to mention their HUGE lot and a very comfy customer lounge area. 

Donna was my service advisor and I have to say that she's the best! Thanks again for taking so well care of me and my car.
