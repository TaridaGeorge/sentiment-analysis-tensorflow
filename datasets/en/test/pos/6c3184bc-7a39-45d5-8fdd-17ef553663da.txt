The best part of Mbar is their new bartender.  We went there to see Michael.  He used to be our bartender at Tommy Vs.  He is so awesome.  Super personable and will make sure you enjoy your drink.  I had a wonderful zinfandel he recommended and the hubby had his typical Margarita on the rocks with salt.  The place is very nice, a little pricey, but it is what you can expect from a nice resort after all.
