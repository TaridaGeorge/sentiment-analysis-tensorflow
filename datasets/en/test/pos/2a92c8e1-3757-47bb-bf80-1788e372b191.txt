Tandoori Chicken, that's all I have to say to anyone who has been here and they will lapse into a curry coma of epic proportions. From the outside the place may not look like much but she's got it where it counts.
Once you walk in the immediate feeling is of being under dressed.  The Inside is set up like a proper date movie restraunt complete with chandeliers and frilly table cloths. 
Now you can go for dinner and eat your meal with dignity OR! you can go for the lunch buffet and leave all your inhibitions and delusions of self respect on the plate, since that's all that's going to be on it.  "Lick that shit clean!"  to quote a friend. 
The price is cheap but you would sell your soul and all adjacent souls once you're done with this place.  Just go.  Go now.
