Some of the best breakfast food I have ever had. They have a terrific selection to chose from for breakfast AND lunch, as well as a great selection of gourmet cold and hot drinks. The service is ALWAYS consistently friendly and on-point and they even have some vegan breakfast options if you can believe it! In the last 15 months I have traveled to Europe thrice and must admit that Essence's "French Chocolate Croissant" is the best American attempt at the classic French chocolatine I've managed to find outside of France!
