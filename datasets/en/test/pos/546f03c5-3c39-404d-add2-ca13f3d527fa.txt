Great stay for the price.  A fun, trendy hotel in a great location. If you are an In Touch member you get free Wi-Fi and a $10 mini-bar credit. Staff was great and it's just nice to stay in a room that is not like a standard hotel.  I'm a fan.  Even the toiletries were extra nice.
One area of improvement - the shower area with no door just makes a mess... that's the only flaw I saw.
