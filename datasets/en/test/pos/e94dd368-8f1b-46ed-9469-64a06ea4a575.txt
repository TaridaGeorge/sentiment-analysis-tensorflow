I recently had Jamie do my makeup and had such a great experience! She understood that I normally don't wear much makeup and that I wanted to look "made up" but still look like myself. She did such a fantastic job. She asked if I liked certain things and if I didn't, she changed it. She wasn't upset if I wanted something different or more subtle. The results were amazing - I'm so glad I had her do my makeup.
