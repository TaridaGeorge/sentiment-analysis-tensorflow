Travis Strong was personally recommended to me by a John Hill who has a beautiful Massage Studio: Space.  I loved the way his place turned out and thought the workmanship was perfection  .  Strong Home Improvement (Travis Strong) was one of three bids I got on remodeling my Casita in my back yard.  I liked him from the moment he walked in....professional but warm and open.  Travis has an attitude of win-win.  He takes such pride in his work, always puts the extra "love" into his projects.  What a great guy to have around during a construction project.  He is smart, skilled and cleans up!!!   He does a little bit of everything but seems to do it all really well.  What a treat.  Call him!!  You will be happy whether you have a few "handyman" things on your list or a full remodel!!
