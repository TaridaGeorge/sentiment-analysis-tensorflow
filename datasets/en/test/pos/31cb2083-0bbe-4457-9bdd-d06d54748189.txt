Since my last review of Switch:
  -I had a long, thought provoking email exchange with the owner of Switch, and although we have some fundamentally different views, I think we both came away a little bit wiser.
  - I have been back to Switch 6 or 7 times; and each time the food was exceptional (as always), and the service has improved.  
I would give the Food an A+ for consistency and quality
I would give the service an A-, as there is always room for improvement when you're dealing with different people and personalities
