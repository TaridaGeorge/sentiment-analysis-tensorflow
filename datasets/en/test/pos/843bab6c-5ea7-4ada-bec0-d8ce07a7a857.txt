Worth a visit for the take home beer selection. I found the (bottled) beers super exciting- They had Aventius Eisbock in bottles and ready for take home enjoyment. Also, Bear Republic and Eel River. 
The food was pretty good- huge bavarian style pretzels are always great with beer. Our service was good, even on a Friday night. The house brewed beer was not my favorite, but with all the other selections available, drinking something different did not prove a problem.
