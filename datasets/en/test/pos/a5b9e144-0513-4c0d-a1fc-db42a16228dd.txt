I absolutely love this place.  They have a great menu selection and the food is always excellent. Plan to drop some money though to have the full experience.  It is worth it- the food won't disappoint.
 Some of the best food one can hope for in Tempe and it rivals PHX and Scottsdale, and saves us the drive :)  We celebrated Vday here and sat out by the fire.  The food is certainly 5 star.  We had a good waiter and didn't mind the slower pace of the evening.  Gave us plenty of time to talk!
