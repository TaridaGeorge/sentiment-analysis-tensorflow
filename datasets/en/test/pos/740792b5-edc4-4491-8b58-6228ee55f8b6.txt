No complaints here! Papa John's is one chain I can agree with. Their pizza in my experience has always been fresh, delicious, and satisfying. 

The service at this location was a little slow, probably due to the high volume of orders. It was Customer Appreciation Day after all, which means a large one-topping pizza for 5 bucks! So, the long line was to be expected.
