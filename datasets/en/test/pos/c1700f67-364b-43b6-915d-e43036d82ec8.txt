I can't believe people can find shit to bitch about at the fair.  Carnies, questionable food, questionable rides for that matter, animals, all of those neat projects that people submit for prizes, demolition derby, B rate concerts, the list goes on of all of the cool stuff you can see at the fair.  A lot of people would like to see the fair grounds demolished and probably built up into some beige stucco bullshit - to those people I say bite your tongue!  The  Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum may look ugly as shit to you but it hold many great memories for this old broad.  

I guess if you have a stick up your ass, the State Fair isn't the place for you.  But if you don't mind getting a little dirty and like to act like a kid, this place can be a lot of fun!
