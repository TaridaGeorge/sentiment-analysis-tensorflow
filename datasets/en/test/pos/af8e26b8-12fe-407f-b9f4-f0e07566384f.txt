This place is incredibly delicious. My partner and I eat here at least 2-3 times a month. Our faves: Pad See-Ew, Tom Yum soup with shrimp. The service is always great, the atmosphere is cozy on the inside--though you might never guess that by looking at the outside- it is in a random little strip mall that looks like nothing special. LOVE THIS PLACE. If you know good Thai food, you will love it too.
