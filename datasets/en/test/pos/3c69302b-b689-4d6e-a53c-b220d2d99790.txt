Love. 5 bucks for a super tasty dog with ample fixins served in naan? Yes. And they have chicken dogs! And veggie dogs too. Great for those of us who are not into beef or pork. The chicken dog is super flavorful. I love it "Lady" style (fried pickles, onions, chipotle cream cheese)  or "Igby" style (bbq sauce, cole slaw, blue cheese). Service is fast and friendly and I love that they include a lollipop with each order, very cute. Find them, you wont be disappointed.
