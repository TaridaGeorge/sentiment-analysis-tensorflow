the bartender is pretty quick with the brews and he runs to ask the kitchen if you have a question about the food but the waitress just kind of slings your food at you then never comes back...hey when im out...we ALWAYS WANT another round, so at least glance over us so we can sign language it out or something...basically we got there early before performing arts show, then went back and sat at the beer to avoid the table service to have another brew before the show but they have some crappy hefenveisen brand, how about upgrading to four peaks or just something better than whatever lame brand we drank, i mean we will drink it anyway but if it was better brand, we will drink more.
