I've ordered here from twice for lunch being both of my boss' are huge fans! The soynami (vegan version of a blizzard) is absolutely amazing! It ruined my life becuase I think I may be addicted. I got it with the crunch (vegan version of butterfinger) and chocolate chips. Sooooo good!

The last time I order the spicy peanut tofu sald. It was definitely yummy but could stand for a bit more veggies in the salad itself.

This should be a national landmark for vegans!
