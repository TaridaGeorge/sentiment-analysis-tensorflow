My friend and I went there last night for dinner. They closed at 10 during the weeknights which is great because so many restaurants close at 9. It was kind of hidden in the plaza (Its next to Trader Joes). My friend and I shared the sesame chicken and beef chow mein. The food came out pretty quick and it was pretty big portions! All main dishes come with heaping bowl of rice which is awesome! Our server was wonderful and very pleasant!
