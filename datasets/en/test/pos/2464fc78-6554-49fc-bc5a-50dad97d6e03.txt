The Herberger is probably one of the best places to watch performances in  Phoenix. I love the red velvet seating and the intimate small space.  It's a small Theater,  so you really feel like you're getting to know the cast.
The acoustics are awesome and the space has a  fabulous atmosphere.
The Theater is in downtown phoenix, so it's accessible to the light rail. If you are from out of town, don't worry it's close to all major hotels, bars and restaurants. You won't have trouble finding places to eat before seeing a show. 
I would like to come and see another live performance here in the future. Judging by the size of the space, I don't think there's a bad seat in this venue.
