Ulta has the best return policy! I took back my new favorite curling iron after it had cracked, and without a receipt or original packaging, and not even buying it at that particular Ulta, they took it back - no questions asked! I have had a great experience returning products at Ulta in the past and it's really refreshing to find a store that believes in customer service!
