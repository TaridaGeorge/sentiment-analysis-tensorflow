LOVE this place! I have been here probably about 2 times now and it is my new nail place. They are always very friendly and get me right in. I especially love the gel nails that they have. They lasted about 3 weeks for me. I also love the rewards program that they have, were for every dollar you get a point. After so many points you get so many dollars off. I love a good deal!
