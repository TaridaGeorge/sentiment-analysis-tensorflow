One of the favorite places for pure Sushi in Scottsdale. Clean and friendly. Ask for soy paper if you want your rolls less salty. The calamari salad is the bomb, you can easily split one with a friend for starters. The rolls are all great, I haven't tried anything I didn't like. Ask for Happy Hour specials as well. Be aware of their hours of operation. Fast pick up times too. Have never had a bad experience there, highly recommend it if you're looking for great sushi in Scottsdale.
