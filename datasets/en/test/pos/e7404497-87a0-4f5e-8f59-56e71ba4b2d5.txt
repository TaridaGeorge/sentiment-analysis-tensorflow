Took my parents here for dinner while we were in Scottsdale. The place was busy, but we were lucky to snag a table in the bar. 

My parents are picky eaters so I went with the Roaring Fork since I remember it being a nice place and hopefully would be "parents approved." They loved the food, service and ambiance. 

For those Yelpers from California, the menu is similar to that of a Wood Ranch with a Southwestern flair. They each had the roasted chicken and I ordered the carnitas plate. Both of which were excellent.
