Our Shi -Tzu was overdue for a grooming and our regular groomer was unavailable.  We called Furry Friends on a Saturday and they were able to squeeze us in at the last minute.  The groomer stayed late - until 5:30 PM on Saturday - to do the grooming.  Our dog looked very good afterwards with a nice even "puppy cut" and his nails were all cut and smoothed.

We will continue to use Furry Friends for our future dog grooming needs.
