1) Spring rolls are AWESOME!
2) I love the their House Pho, it is super good (its the first pho listed on the menu)
3) If you're not into pho the bun dishes are equally as good.

The stuff here tastes fresh and is one of my favorite Vietnamese places ever. Definitely recommend checking it out.

Oh and also this place is pretty cheap, its like $8 for a huge bowl of pho.
