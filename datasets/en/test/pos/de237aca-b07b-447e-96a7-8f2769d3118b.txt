My wife and I had dinner here with another couple.  We all had a great time, and loved our food.  We shared two pizzas, and both were great!!

I can't wait to go again, and try other items on the list.  The place has a cool vibe, and great contemporary/modern decor.

As you're pulling up to The Parlor, slow down so you don't miss the pull-in for the parking lot.  It comes up on you quickly.
