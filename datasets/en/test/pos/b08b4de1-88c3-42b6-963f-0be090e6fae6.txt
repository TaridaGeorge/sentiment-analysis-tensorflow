Gyros are tough to rate. I am a firm believer that all gyro meat comes from one factory in the northeast. It really breaks down to what is served with them and how.

These guys make them right. Crispy,juicy, and overflowing out of the wrap. Served up with some delicious tzatiki. Fries are ok, they're fries. I tend to find that the gyro fills me. 

I've also had some of their other items. The Falafel is wonderful, and the vegetarian platter is also great. Super smoky baba ganoosh, garlicky hummus, it's all pretty great. I've even had their Chicago Dog, which was perfect.

The only negative with their food is that their chicken tends to be a little dry, and the service can sometimes seem like you're bothering them.

But whatever, give me that gyro.
