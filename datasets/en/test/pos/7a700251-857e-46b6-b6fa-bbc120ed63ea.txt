I was visiting Tempe last week for work and was very excited to find a studio near where I was staying and a time that fit my schedule.  I took the 6am and was so thankful that I got up early in order to partake in this fantastic class.  The studio was so inviting and the instructor was wonderful.  It was a little different for me being in the dry heat of AZ instead of the humid highs of Austin but I loved it!  Thank you for being such a kind and welcoming place.  It's difficult when you travel for work to get your workout in sometimes especially when I prefer one so specialized such as Bikram but they made me feel right at home.
