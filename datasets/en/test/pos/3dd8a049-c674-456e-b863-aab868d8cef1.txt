WOW!  What an amazing experience!  My mom, myself, and our friend went there for their second saturday market and tasting demonstrations.  When we arrived, we were immediately greeted by several happy, warm workers who looked genuinely happy to be there and that we were there.  The tasting stand was just getting set up, and they were kind of surprised to see us.  Randy, the manager, Jeremy the executive chef, Anthony the sous chef, as well as others made sure that our experience was incredible from the start!  We were the only people attending the tasting demonstration to start and as I said to them, I felt like a rock star!  The food was amazing, fresh, and so nice that it was organic.  The tasting was completely worth the cost and we will definitely be back!
