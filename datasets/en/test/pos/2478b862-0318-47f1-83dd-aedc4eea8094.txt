Dr. Mary Deka of Paradise valley OB-gyn is THE BEST! I had two recommendations and I chose to meet her first. After meeting her I knew she was going to be a great Dr. for me. She is so compassionate, so happy and upbeat, and truly cares for her patients (and their babies). I actually loved going to my appointments with her because I felt so wonderful after leaving her office. I would go home and tell me husband how great she made me feel and it stayed with me for days. In fact, my daughter is 7 months old and I still think about how lucky I was to have her as my Dr. through the amazing journey of pregnancy. She is really great.
