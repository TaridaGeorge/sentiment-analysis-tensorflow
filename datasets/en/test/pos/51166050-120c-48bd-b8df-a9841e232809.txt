My son (he's 4) and I LOVE Mojos!  Great tasting yogurt thats not too sweet and is perfectly refreshing.  He loves picking out toppings - I've had to limit him to 5 toppings because he wants to put everything in his bowl!  We often stop by when they have their Facebook special words and you get half off - love that.  The only thing I don't like is that sometimes its a little hard to work the machines to put the yogurt in the cup.
