After a lot of research I decided on the Hyundai Sonata Ltd. as the car I wanted, and visited a few dealers.
At San Tan I found people that I could deal with in a friendly manner.  No high pressure foolishness that pitted the buyer against the seller.  
The car I wanted right down to the mud flaps was in stock and I drove it home that morning after some back and forth dealing on a price that I found perfectly acceptable. It was all about the art of the deal.
Good car from a good dealership. (We'll see how the service dept. does in the future)
