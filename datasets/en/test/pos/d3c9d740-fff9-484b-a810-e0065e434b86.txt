They just opened "Hangover Hoagies" inside SUN STOP. As a connoisseur of all things deli, the food here is AWESOME. The sub rolls are some of the tastiest ever, and the prices can't be beat..they are doing a 6in combo (6in with chips and drink) for $4.99. Get a sub here TODAY, and tell em Crispy sent ya..
