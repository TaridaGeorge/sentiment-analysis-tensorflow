I would like to say thank you to Christin.
 
We had the worst service here the last time with an assistant manager leaving a new server to drown! 

This time we got a server named Christin and is was amazing! Super fast, always smiling, not bothersome at all, and as alway.... Mimi's awesome lunches! I would recommend this lady to everyone on top of hiring her on the spot to work for me!

Thanks again Christin!
