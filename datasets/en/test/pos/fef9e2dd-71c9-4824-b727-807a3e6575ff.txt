Great place!  We just moved here and my chocolate lab was shedding so badly I wanted to give her a quick bath.  I went into Pet Planet to use their self-bathing services. The facility is clean and very user friendly.  The young woman working there was very helpful and friendly.  My girl Sadie will be going back many times along with her sister Stella.  Thank you Pet Planet!
