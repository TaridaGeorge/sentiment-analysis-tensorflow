Finally! A great Barber shop that isn't 100 years old! This place is super clean, super new, and bottom-line - AWESOME!

Derek cuts my boyfriend's and nephew's hair.  Once you look at this guy, you'll realize he's serious about his job.  He's professional and does exactly what you want.  The entire staff is very friendly and welcoming.  Great for kids of all ages!  

Highly recommend this barber shop! :)
