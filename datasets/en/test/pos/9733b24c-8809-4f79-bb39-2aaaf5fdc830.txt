I love outdoor malls and this is one of my favorites.  Why?  Because not only are there cool stores, but there are some great restaurants here too.  NoRTH  and Chloe's Corner are two of my favorite places here. (separate reviews for each)

I also enjoy walking around and enjoying the outdoors.  I typically park in the lot near Chloe's Corner and walk from street to street, window shopping and sitting down at a bench or two to enjoy the scene.

Will be back soon.
