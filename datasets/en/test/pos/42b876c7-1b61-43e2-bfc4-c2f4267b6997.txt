I have no idea even where to start this review. Scott, on a weekend, sent a tow truck to my husband.He fixed our truck for a ridiculously low amount....and fast.

He once told me how to fix my car over the phone and it worked!No charge.

And recently he saved my ass when I was financially and emotionally strapped. He is THE MOST HONEST GUY in the business and I have sent countless clients and family members to him. They have all had the same experience. If you don't try Whiteys you are denying yourself the gift of Scott and his crew. You never have to question what he says is true..it is. I'm so grateful for his service, his friendship, his honesty and generosity.

Words really escape me when I think of how fortunate I am  to have found him and his shop.
