The In-N-Out Burger on Rural Road & 202 East is always clean, bright, and staffed with friendly kids.  Fast food places aren't known for their well-spoken and friendly teenage work force, but In-N-Out always feels a cut above.  

Their menu is very simple.  You can have a double cheeseburger, a cheeseburger, or a hamburger.  They all taste great, and the fries are made while you watch.  

There's also an unwritten menu at In-N-Out that has developed over the years.  If you'd like sauteed onions, pickles, and extra sauce on your burger, ask for your burger to be prepared "Animal Style".  I know it sounds goofy, but the cashier will know exactly what you mean- and it's amazing.

If you're in the mood for a burger and fries, it doesn't get much better than In-N-Out.
