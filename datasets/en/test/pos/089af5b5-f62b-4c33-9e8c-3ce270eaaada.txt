Oh my God the breakfast burrito. Falls within the top 10 things I have ever eaten. After flying in from Chicago my husband and I stopped here for breakfast. I really can't describe the wonder that is the breakfast burrito. I literally have dreams about it. So good that we stopped here again before heading home.

Loved the atmosphere- eclectic 60's/modern/LA/Southwestern decor. Excellent, fun staff.
