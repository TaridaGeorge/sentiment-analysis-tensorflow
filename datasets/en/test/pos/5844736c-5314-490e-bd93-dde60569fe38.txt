What a treasure. I was very impressed with everything. They do use styrofome dishware but it makes for easy cleanup. The atmosphere was really fun. An Indian movie was playing as we ate which added to the atmosphere as well.  Everything was very clean and picked up. The staff were very friendly and helpful as well. The women that helped us explained what all the dishes were and even gave us seconds of our favorite without any extra charge!  I will be a regular here without a doubt. The prices are great too. Highly recommended!
