I LOVE THIS PLACE. If u like steak this place is heaven! Took my girlfriend for dinner here and we both loved it. The waiters were extremely nice, and they even went back and specially brought us back a steak the way we liked it. Place is very authentic no complaints whatsoever love it love it love it. Little expensive but its worth every penny! Im hungry just talking about it
