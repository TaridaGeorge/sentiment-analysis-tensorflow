After having HORRIBLE experiences with several haircolorist in Scottsdale - and having to return to LA, CA to have it corrected several times - I got lucky and found Ray Issa at the Joya Spa at the Montelucia Resort.  He nailed my hair color and didn't charge me an arm and a leg!  He is also super sweet!  So excited to have found him!
