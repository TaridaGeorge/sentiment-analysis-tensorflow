As good as it gets if not better when it comes to quality, informative, educational, entertaining television....with no commercials. So many good shows. From great cooking shows to gardening and DIY to riveting documentaries, amazing nature shows, plays and other performances, local and world news, and comedy shows that will have you rolling on the floor with laughter. 

I can't get enough of PBS and Channel 8 gives me 4 digital channels to choose from 8 HD, 8 Create, 8 World and 8.4 which is their radio broadcast. 

Cable has not been a part of my household in several years (going on 6 years) all I use is my digiconverter and an antenna. Having PBS Channel 8 and all its options, I don't miss the Food Network or Discovery Channel or the mindless channel surfing I found myself doing....
