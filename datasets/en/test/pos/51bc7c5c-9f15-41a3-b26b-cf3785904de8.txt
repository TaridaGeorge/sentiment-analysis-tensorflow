I am such a freakin' troll here... I always swing by any W&S location and check out what their food and kitchen items are for sale... they run great deals...

I collect food when I travel, and it's nice to find them here:
1.  Maldon salt -- if you have bought into the sea salt craze (really it does taste different straight on the tongue than regular table salt  http://www.slate.com/id/2117243/), try this English version
2.  La Salamandra dulce de leche -- if you like caramel coffees, try this as your sweetener.  The best brand I found in Buenos Aires...
3.  W&S truffle mayo -- omg this is good w/ french fries
4.  Panettone -- beautiful red tin only during the Xmas holidays, glaceed chestnuts (holy crap this is $$$ in Europe)... need I say more.
