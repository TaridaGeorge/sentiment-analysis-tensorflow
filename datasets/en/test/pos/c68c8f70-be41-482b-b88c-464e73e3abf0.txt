Clarks shoes are good shoes. I have a pair of brown and a pair of boots. Both are amazingly comfortable. I tried on a few of the ones w/ straps and didn't find them as comfortable. And, you have to watch sizing. Both of these were true to size for me, but another pair I've tried was too big.
You won't be sorry buying a pair of Clarks.
