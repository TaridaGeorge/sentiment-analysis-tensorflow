This place is great.  Quite unique and good atmosphere.  Some dining is outside in a courtyard.  Bear that in mind when going.

We never knew it existed until we tried it out with a groupon. We've been there several times since and turned other folks on to the place as well.

Everything we've had has been great and the service is always top notch.  Awesome happy hour as well.

Some of our favorites
 (appetizers):
- Empanadas
- Salmon Croquette
- Pernil Sliders (although they don't show up on their online menu)

(entrees - sides are darn good too.  Try the cornbread or jalapeno corn)
- Pernil Asado
- Pasta Fuego
- Angus Short Ribs
- Chile Relleno

Blood Orange Mojitos are awesome.
