Service is great: fast and friendly.  Coupon specials are usually available as a two-for-one deal, so we come here quite often.  There are at least 10 flavors to choose from with a wide variety of toppings.  I have never been there when it wasn't clean.   The best consistent flavor is coffee...some of the others are rather bland.
