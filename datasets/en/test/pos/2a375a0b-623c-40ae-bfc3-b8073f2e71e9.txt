UNREAL! DO...IT...YOURSELF...fro-yo! what else could i ask for? squirt out the yogurt you want...after trying as many flavors you want...and then putting on as many toppings you want...it's all about YOU as the consumer.

but watch out...they weigh it at the end, sweet factory style...and i bet the first time you go you'll fill it up a little too much, but it's so good so it doesn't matter.

i personally only liked the "original" flavor topped with strawberries, strawberry mochi and tons of graham cracker crust!! such a good combo that i'm dreaming about it right now. too bad i don't live in phoenix...i did end up going 3 times while i was there though. 

Mojo..i love you.
