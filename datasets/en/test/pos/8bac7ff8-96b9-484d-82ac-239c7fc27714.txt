My favorite Modified memories:

-Piebald.  Super fun!
-The last Suicide Nation show with Jeromes Dream, Usurp Synapse, and Racebannon.  Seriously some of the most intense sets ever.
-Love Life and Get Hustle.
-Getting drunk outside while my friend thought he gave a homeless person his car keys in a handful of coins from his pocket.  After breaking his passenger window with a brick, he found them in THE GLOVE BOX.  Who puts their keys in the glove box?!
-More recently, any time I walk through it now during First Friday to see some (usually) wonderful artwork.

I hope Modified never goes anywhere.  I've got some iffy memories too that are mostly tied to how sketchy the surrounding neighborhood used to be, but it is incredible to see how much it has come along.
