This place is great for Happy Hour. Not sure I'd want to pay non-HH prices.

Free wi-fi, indoor and outdoor seating at the bars, cool design with private room upstairs that looks like a fun group setting.

The veggie bowl on HH is fantastic for $7.

Great HH drink specials - $5 Moscow Mules, and other specialty cocktails.

Excellent service.
