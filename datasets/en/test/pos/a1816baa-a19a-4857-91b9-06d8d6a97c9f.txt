I LOVE LOVE LOVE Paris Envy.  And I am so proud of Phoenix for having one of the best little boutiques ever.  I moved here from Chicago and was hard-pressed to find really cool boutiques that have unique finds owned by people with independent minds.The purses are HOT, the PJs are so super cute and super comfortable.  I bought a really awesome smelling french perfume.  Now I just have to wait to have some more money to buy some home furnishings.  

Thank you 7th avenue.  Its getting better every day.  I can't wait to see what else comes in.
