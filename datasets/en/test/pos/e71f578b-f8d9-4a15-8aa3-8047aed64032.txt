So, as a complete NON veg, I was dragged there by my girl who is a veggie.  I was dubious, as I am a total steak man.  I must say that the steak poboy was so good, I ordered 2 with extra meat in each.  I was actually craving them a few days later.  Better than a regular steak and cheese sub as you don't feel like crap after you eat it.
lol
I hate it when she is right.
