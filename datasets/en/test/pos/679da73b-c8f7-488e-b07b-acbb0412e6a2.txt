This place is great. We've been coming here for the last few years and they always do a great job. Reasonably priced, prompt service and friendly customer service. What more could you ask for? The owner of the company is often in and is very friendly and often the one checking in the clothes and ringing you up - it's nice to see a hands-on owner that cares about his customers. Always happy to support local businesses.
