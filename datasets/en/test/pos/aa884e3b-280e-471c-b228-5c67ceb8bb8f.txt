Just went here for lunch yesterday and all I can say is awesome!  I had a Southwest Sandwich that was amazing.  The service is wonderful. My wife really wanted one of the sandwiches created in a wrap.  No problem they were on it and did a great job.  They have a new guy behind the counter from New York and he knows customer service and knows how to make a sandwich! I am not sure why others had a bad experience in the past but as of now they have their act together!
