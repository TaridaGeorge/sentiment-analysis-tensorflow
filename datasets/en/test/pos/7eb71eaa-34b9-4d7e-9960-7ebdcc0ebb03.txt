I love this place! When you walk in, you enter the bar, and it's a very friendly, sports-themed bar. Lots of seating, pool tables, TVs, and lots of activity but all of it friendly and open. Then there's the food-oh, my! The burgers are fabulous-fresh ground beef, fresh buns, ripe tomatoes and lettuce, and great fries. I also LOVE the tomato soup...WOW! You have to try the tomato soup!  They have a decent beer and wine selection, and even their coffee is good!

The staff is very friendly and accommodating to our weekly group of about 10-15 writers. They split checks without hassle and are super friendly, which is not always easy to find with a large party. They consistently go above and beyond, and I think they're fabulous!
