If you like your pizza thin and crispy, this is the place. NY Style pizza is the best. Less dough and more of the good stuff.. 
My wife and I prefer the pepperoni with ricotta..
The Caesar salad is good.. .. Decent selection of wines.. If you are looking for pasta.. don't come here.. Pizza and ONLY pizza!!
