I know this is soon for an update, but I find this update-worthy! When I visited Julia Baker last week, they said they would be carrying cake balls for Mother's Day. So on Thursday, I went back to purchase some for the Mothers in my life. They are adorable! They put three in a packet and they have white and chocolate balls with hard sugar flowers on top. They are the perfect gift or addition to a gift. Plus they are sturdy little guys! So, if you are looking for a last minute Mother's Day gift, scurry to Julia Bakers.
