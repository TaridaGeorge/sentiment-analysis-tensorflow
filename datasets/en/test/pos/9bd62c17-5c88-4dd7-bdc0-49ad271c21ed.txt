The Baskin Robbins of Craft Beer.

PROS: 
Beer selection***, prices, beer quality, crunchy boneless wings that are not the McNugget crap they serve at Teakwoods, atmosphere in bar.

CONS:
Previous CON removed.... :) The staff in the bar is knowledgeable after all... 

I can't speak to the atmosphere on the non-bar side, or the quality of the food.  My rating is based on my happy hour experience only.
