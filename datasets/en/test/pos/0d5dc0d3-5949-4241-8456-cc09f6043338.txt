I had a really bad experience at another florist in the area and had them come back and get their flowers.  I then did what my wife said I should have done in the first place: call Jennifer at Red Mountain Florist.  She did a fantastic job!  For the same budget I gave to the other place, she built a beautiful, rose-filled, giant bouquet for my mother-in-law (her birthday).  It was at least twice as densely packed as the other florist's attempt, plus had lots of gorgeous roses where the other one had none.  I've learned my lesson.  I will only use Red Mountain Florists from now on.
