I mean srsly... who doesn't love a communal wash area?!

Liberty Market is easily not only my favorite East Valley Eatery, but just plain hang out spot. The wifi, quality coffee, smiling employees and friendly service are only a fraction of what makes this place awesome. It's attention to detail, delicious eats and creative vibe are second to none. I deeply appreciate how involved they are in the community, and the owner Joe is always a tweet or email away and always has a smile and something nice to say.

I look back fondly on my unemployed summer of '09 as much of it was spent drinking soy lattes at the E61 bar and chatting it up with friends over salads and desert at Liberty Market. 

Joe, keep up the good work!
