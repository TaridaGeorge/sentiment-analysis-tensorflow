Very professional and clean. Marilyn and Andy are super cool and even if you have a dumb question, they don't look at you with that duh look on their face. I have been here so many untold times but every time I go, I feel like I'm at home because everyone is so laid back but not lazy and stupid laid back. My partner had misjudged his piercing placement and when we went back we were prepared and knew that we were going to pay for another piercing (duh, they ask you if it looks good) but Andy ended up not charging us.

You definitely don't want to go cheap with your body, so leave those other discount, 2 for 1 body piercing places and go to HTC to get it done right.
