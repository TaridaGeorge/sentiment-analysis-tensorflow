I LOVE this place! The yogurt is delicious & they have Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory toppings! Need I say more?? 

Only negative I can think of is that the toppings in the back row are VERY difficult to reach (I noticed I wasn't the only one struggling to reach them) - they should change the cover or something to make it more accessible. 

But other than that, 2 enthusiastic thumbs up.  I will be visiting this place very frequently this summer.  I would move in if they let me.
