We went here on a recommendation while I was in Scottsdale, and this place made me feel at home, it would fit right into the mission or north beach...

The beer selection is serious (stone!!!), and the burger looks huge, but  it's just the right amount - perfect bun and hand rolled patty.

Only problem is finding the place if you've never been. It's tucked away, and on a Wednesday there weren't many people around.

They had a beer tasting while we were in there, and the crowd seemed really nice. It looked new, but clearly it's been around for a while. Service was great, and both of us left really happy.
