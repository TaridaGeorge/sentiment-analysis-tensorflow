Anyone know why they closed?

Great BBQ chicken.  The chicken Katsu is pretty darn good too.  The staff is friendly and they work hard to get orders out fast because at times this place can get super busy.  There are very few places to sit in or outside of the restaurant and even standing in line can get more than a little cramped.  But put up with the lack of space and you'll be happy once you're eating some delicious island cuisine.
