Really friendly staff, great beer selection, chill atmosphere, and $3 burger and fries on Monday night.  The $3 burger isn't some tiny little squirt of a burger; its a serious gourmet style juicy burger served on a cibatta.  
Monday night also has $10 off bottles of wine all night and $3 beers for happy hour.  What more could you ask for?  How about a delicious buffalo cheese dip.  I practically lick the bowl every time I get it.
This is the reason I have made Maizies my Monday ritual.
