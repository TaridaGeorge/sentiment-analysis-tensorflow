What can I say ?  This is awesome.  I am a donut fan and would give Dunkin 4 stars, just like this place.  Great variety, great coffee, fresh donuts.  The extra 1 star comes for the fluffiness of their dough.  Its very fluffy and its done just right.  

Dunkin is good but its donuts will taste a little hard and "old" when they have been sitting for a while.  For some reason, the Bosa donuts dun get too hard, even after U buy and drive for like 1/2 hour home.  I know its not located in the best part of town, but they are open 24 hrs and there is a drive thru.  They accept credit cards and discover :)
