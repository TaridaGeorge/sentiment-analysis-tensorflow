I surprised myself by spending hours here, amazed by the diversity of plants and wildlife. There are lots of different pathways to explore, each offering new things to see and experience. I was glad I went at 8:30am, as I (and the birders) had the place pretty much to ourselves for a couple of hours. A great place for kids and adults alike.
