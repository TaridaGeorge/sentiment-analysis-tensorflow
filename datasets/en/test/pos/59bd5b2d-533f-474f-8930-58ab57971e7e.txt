This is my favorite place for lunch in Phoenix, and I love to go on a nice sunny day and sit outside at a picnic table and enjoy great food, lemonade and sunshine.

It's like a little bit of heaven taken right from Napa Valley, with farm fresh and organic ingredients that are healthy, tasty and just flat out make you happy.  The price tag might not put a smile on your face, but don't go every day.
