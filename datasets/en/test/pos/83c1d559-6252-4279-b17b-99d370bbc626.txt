If I'm craving Middle Eastern, this is where I go.  Like so many others have noted, moving to PHX made me realize how good I had it in Michigan with an abundance of solid choices for Middle Eastern food.

The hummus rocks, as does the falafel sandwich, as do those little cheese pies!  It is all pretty reasonably priced, also.

Other randomness:  They randomly take to-go orders when the manager isn't upset that someone did a no show on a previous to-go order.  They had a laminated menu for awhile, but other than that, there is just the giant sign to try and order from.  

Love.  Go.
