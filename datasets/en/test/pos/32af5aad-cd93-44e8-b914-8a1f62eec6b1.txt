Decided to stop by and check out the new place Tuesday.  Complimentary valet is convenient if you get there early before the lot fills up.

I was impressed by the nice open design and high ceilings of the building.  I grabbed a seat at the bar and the server was super friendly and informative.

My pizza was on happy hour special that day and was only $8 which was a great value. I can't remember exactly what was on it other than chicken.  I also tried some of my friend's mafaldine pasta which was delicious with the rock shrimp.

This is a fun place bustling with energy.
