Ah, the Vermonter... a great combination: the apples, the cheddar, the cranberry mayo, the turkey and ham.

This place is hidden back from Via Linda and 90th and you may not see it when first checking out the shopping center... but if you like a good sandwich and you'd like to try something a little new, you ought to check it out.  Ingredients that aren't insanely crazy, but that are inventive and that fit together wonderfully into a good sandwich.

Their soups are delicious, and their wraps are very good.

The owners are pretty cool, too!

I will be back, and this sandwich shop is definitely growing on me each time I visit.  Delicious food.
