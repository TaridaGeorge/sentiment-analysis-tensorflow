Fantastic place for lunch and dinner. The ingredients are fresh and simple and any sandwich is a hit in my book. My favorite side here is the rice pudding, it makes for the perfect dessert after lunch. This place is hoppin' at noon when my coworkers and I show up and parking is limited in the direct vicinity. Going here or across the street to Postino is the way to go for a delicious meal.
