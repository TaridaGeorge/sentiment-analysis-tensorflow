Tried TG during the Food Truck Mania event in downtown phoenix. I love Creme Brulee and was excited to try the different flavors. My options were sea salt caramel, cappucino & blackberry. 

The sea salt caramel was delicious!! It's was a perfect size to share with someone. But if you LOVE creme brulee like me....get 2! The cost was $4.00.
