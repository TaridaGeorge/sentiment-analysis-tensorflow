Legend...wait for it...DARY!

One of a kind! I had pretty high expectations when I went here, because I have been wanting to come here for some time, and it met all my expectations! The food was great; I had a bacon cheeseburger. However, it was the atmosphere that made Greasewood Flat awesome. Great live music and an old western feel gives this place something that cannot be found anywhere else.
