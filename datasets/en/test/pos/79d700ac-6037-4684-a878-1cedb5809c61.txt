I love this place!  I have a ritual of going there once a month for last couple of years.  It is near my work, but far from home.  That is probably a good thing, because I would eat here all the time if it were close to home.  The service is excellent.  They know they're regulars and get you in and out quickly.  The food is awesome.  They have sandwiches, salads, and bakery items.  When I go, I have to take a shopping list from my coworkers because we all love it.  The food is a little pricey, but well worth it.  I always get the Capricorno and it is just under $9.  But it is very filling and has a small salad that I sometimes throw onto the sandwich.  The Pistachio muffins are to die for.  And I don't like pistachios!
