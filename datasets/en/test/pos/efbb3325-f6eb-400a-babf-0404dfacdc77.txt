I aways love going to Bookmans they have a book, CD, video game, DVD, magazine, or some random item for everyone. I have never left their empty handed and everything is at a good price. In case you didn't know, most everything at Bookmans was owned by someone else, but everything is in good to excellant condition. It would be safe to say that Bookmans is a "green" store recyling all those books an magazines.

 One of my favorite things about the place is the magazines. They have a large selction of used magazines with the "Current" month for only $1.50 a copy for most. Love it!!!!
 In case you get thirsty they also have a cafe & free wiFi.             Remember their logo "Reading is not a Crime"
