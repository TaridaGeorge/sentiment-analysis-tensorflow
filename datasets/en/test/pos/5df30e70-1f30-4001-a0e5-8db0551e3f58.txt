I have only dealt with Michael, but he has been awesome.  If you didn't know better, you wouldn't think he is an accountant by his personality.  He is so very personable and savvy.  

He not only does taxes, but he has helped me with business acquisitions and other complicated tax issues.  I can't say enough good about him.  I highly recommend him to anyone.
