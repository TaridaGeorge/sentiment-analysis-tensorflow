Attentive staff, succulent offerings, incredible mixologic concoctions...Citizen continues to inspire with it's near-perfect...okay, PERFECT menu of entrees, cocktails, and starters that plow new ground of satisfaction. I went to AZ88 after this place tonight, and I'm convinced this IS the best place in Lower Scottsdale - -and perhaps the Valley entire, to enjoy...everything!
