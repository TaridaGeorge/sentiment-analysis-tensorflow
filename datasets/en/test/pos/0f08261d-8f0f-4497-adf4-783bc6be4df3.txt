My boyfriend and I went here for our anniversary, and it was very good. The ambience was a little old school, but the food was great. We split a light salad to start and the waiter had them split it onto two plates for us, which was really nice. The salad was flavorful, but not overpowering. I had scotch beef for my main and he had BBQ pork. They were both delicious! I could have licked the bowls. Finally for dessert we had this amazing cheesecake with rosemary caramel sauce. It was so rich and wonderful. This place is a bit pricey, but it is so worth it.
