delicious salads, soups, sides and (of course) pasties. if you're not sure what a pasty is, then just go try one. seriously, you won't regret it. tons of vegetarian and meaty options. i'm convinced that there isn't a bad choice on their menu... if there is, then i haven't found it yet.

it's a pretty small place with a pub vibe. it takes a little while for them to prepare your food, so if you're in a rush, i'd suggest calling ahead.
