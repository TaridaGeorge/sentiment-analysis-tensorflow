I have tried every other mongolian bbq in the valley and none compare to YC's. It is just plain better. Price is right for the portion. I pay extra for the box and go nutts at the line and take home the extra. Meat is always the best quality, the veggies are always fresh. Though busy at peak times, they always get you through the line quick. 

YC's needs a seafood night with lobster and shrimp etc. I'd pay allot more a coupel times a month to step it up.

As for the frozen yogurt, don't bother. They need to pick up the brand Sweet Tomatoes uses and add a little fixin bar and I would pay the extra for dessert.
