Went here on a date with the GF as one of our choices for restaurant week. Wow! We were both so impressed. If you're like me, service and cocktails are almost just as important as the food and I'm happy to say I can give a solid 5 stars on all accounts. The cocktails were awesome; unique and tasty. The food was all very good, the pork stew is something I still am salivating over. Their S'mor dessert was life-changing. And service is some of the best I've had at any restaurant in the valley. I highly recommend Roaring Fork!
