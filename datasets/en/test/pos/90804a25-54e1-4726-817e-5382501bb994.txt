damn i love REI. it's just expensive. some of the retail items like Go-Pro or Oakley never go on sale, but many of their other items do. you just have to keep your eyes open for the mail flyers.

everything outdoorsy, from tents to food to items for your pooch. over the years, i'm sure i've spent thousands at rei on good camping gear. 

the staff is always, always, always super helpful and super friendly, at pretty much any REI i've ever been to. this location is no different.
