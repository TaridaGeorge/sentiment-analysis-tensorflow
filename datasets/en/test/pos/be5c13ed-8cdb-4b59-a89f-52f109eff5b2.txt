First, the location is beautiful overlooking a lake.  The service and ambiance are first class.  I had prime rib that was succulent.  I was pleasantly surprised that they have a salad bar, including cesar salad prepared by the chef.  The bread and crackers they bring with the salads are noteworthy, too.  The dark brown rolls tasted homemade and may have been pumpernickel.  Three of my compatriots had fish entrees that they enjoyed.  BTW, have a margarita.  They use fresh squeezed lime juice and make their own simple syrup.  In addition, they use a premium tequila.  Without a doubt, THE BEST margarita I have ever had!
