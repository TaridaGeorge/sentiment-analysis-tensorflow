I am still coming to the same Firestone years later and the same guys still work there and they are still good to me. The make sure I don't pay for services I don't need and when I do need something, they make sure it is taken care of asap and try to make sure it doesn't cost a small fortune. Even my coworkers in my office have started going to this location and they guys are good to them. Plus they know if they aren't I would give them hell, and the last thing they want is a mad Ebony on their hands lol. I trust them as they know my car is important to me. So in a nutshell, yes I still like this Firestone. The end! :)
