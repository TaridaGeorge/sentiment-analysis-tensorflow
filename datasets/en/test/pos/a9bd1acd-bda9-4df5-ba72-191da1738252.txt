I tried this place out for the first time with a party of seven this last First Friday. The food was to die for. If you don't like spicy food you should tell them; but, I got the jerk chicken and it was perfectly cooked and amazingly seasoned. My friend got the scallops and they were probably the best I've had in Phoenix. We had to wait a while for our table (not surprised since we had a large group and it was Friday night) but they had a a live band playing in the back, a great seating area to wait in and a great drink list (even though I don't really like rum). I will definitely be coming back.
