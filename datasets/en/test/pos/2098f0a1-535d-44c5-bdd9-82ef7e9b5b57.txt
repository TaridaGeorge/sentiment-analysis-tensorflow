I love everything about this place. Clean, super nice employees, great variety of flavors, fresh toppings, and huge portions. They have a deal right now that's good for the summer: buy a $25 gift card and get 2 free regular sized yogurts with that. Fo sho!!

The regular size is big- especially for my kids- so we often share or split these (ask of an extra bowl!). 

Cake batter & rainbow sprinkles. Best combo ever. Your welcome.
