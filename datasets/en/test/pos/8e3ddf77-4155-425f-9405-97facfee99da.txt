this is my favorite big box theatre..it is in walking distance and is always empty. but when its not empty, its just as fun. i've seen cops drag people out of shows, and i've seen people fighting in the lobby. 

i also love the crippled guy that works here, he's really nice if you talk to him. and he reminds me of my long dead uncle who grew up with polio..sad. but he seems happy so i'm happy.

i roll up to the Keosk grab my tickets and go. not even sure why they never seem to be getting any use. oh well. makes it easy for me.
