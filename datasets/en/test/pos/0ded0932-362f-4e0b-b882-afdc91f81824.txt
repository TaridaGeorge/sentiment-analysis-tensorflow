I love Four peaks! The Raj IPA is definitely the best beer however, the first time you go you have to get the sampler. It gets very crowded at night especially on weekends or for sports games. It's definitely a fun place to go with friends for something a little more upscale than a neighborhood dive. I love the ambiance and how they have the huge beer - making things in the place. The food is delicious as well. I've had the chicken fingers and I had one of the burgers (with mush/onions I think). They were both amazing. I like to sit at the bar if possible.
