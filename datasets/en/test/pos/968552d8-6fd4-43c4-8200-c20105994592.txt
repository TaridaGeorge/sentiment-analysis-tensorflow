No hands down, my favorite place to grab a beer in Phoenix. I love the people, the music is usually decent, and the selection of beer and wine is the best in town. It's an old converted house that showcases local art and music as well as hosts some awesome art events like live drawings, poetry nights, and so on. A few people from a local band called Sonorous founded this place less than a handful of years ago and I have been a loyal patron since. It's one of the last places we hung out in before we moved out of Phoenix, and it was the first place we drove into when we last visited for my best friend's wedding (no movie jokes, plz). Seriously solid with relatively fair prices. Mostly bottles, but the variety is stellar!
