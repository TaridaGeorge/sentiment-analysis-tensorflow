ok i gotta start saying that the vig is one of my fav places to go n have a great time,the place has great specials on wine,beer and food, i usually go to arcadia on thursdays, they have a great dj and i go to uptown on fridays when they have the same dj also ;)

the decor and staff are awesome as well .....if you are looking for a place where you can talk,eat,drink and listen great music in a mature atmosphere the vig is your place.
