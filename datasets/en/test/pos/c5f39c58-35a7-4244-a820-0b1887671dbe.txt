Newly opened Chicago style burger, Italian beef and Chicago dogs.
Nice menu, friendly staff and very clean place.  The  1/3lb ground chuck burger, cooked to order, was splendid, as is everything in this little place, including the fries!
We had the burger, fries and drinks (the combo).  It was one of the best burgers I've eaten, home or away!  Since it is made to order, it is cooked to the degree of doneness desired and the fries (huge portion) can be salted to order when they come out of the fryer, crinkle-cut and golden brown.  I can't wait to try the rest of the menu. Simply stated, if you want a great homemade hamburger, this is It!  Great parking as well.
