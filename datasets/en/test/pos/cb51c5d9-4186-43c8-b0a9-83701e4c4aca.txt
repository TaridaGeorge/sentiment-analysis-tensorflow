This store is a 16th Street treasure! I happened upon the Hive when I was living and working in the area. Great art, great accessories and wonderful selection of clothes.  The owners have impeccable taste and are always helpful in putting together outfits.  I have found quite a few event outfits here, some still have the store tags on them! While you're in the area for lunch at La Condesa (which is just down the street), stop by the Bee's Knees and see what treasures they have to offer. You won't be sorry!
