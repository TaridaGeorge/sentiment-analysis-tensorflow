I loved Kokomo! I have yet to go to a fro yo store as clean as Kokomo! The fruits were so fresh, and the topping section was clean, with a great variety! I also found it charming that I got to meet with the friendly owners! Kokomo beats all the yogurt store in this area!  I didn't feel guilty because the yogurt is so healthy! I highly recommend Kokomo!
