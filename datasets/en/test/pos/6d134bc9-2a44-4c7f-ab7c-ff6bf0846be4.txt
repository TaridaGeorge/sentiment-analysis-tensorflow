I love Cafe ZuZu. i have been here twice now, and their salads are excellent.

We went on Mother's Day and they had a "make your own bloody mary" bar, which was a lot of fun. At only 5 bucks a pop, it was worth it. For those of you who don't drink alcohol, they have great iced tea and they serve it all fancy-like on a plate with a napkin and even a proper iced tea spoon. Being in a hotel, you would think that this restaurant would be both mediocre AND super-expensive. It's neither.

Also, the remodel of the Valley Ho is worth seeing. Check it out!
