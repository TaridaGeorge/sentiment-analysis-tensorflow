Huge outdoor seating area that goes all the way around this house. Smaller indoor seating options. It IS a house. Amazing food and great beers and cocktails. The perfect place to meet with friends any time of day or night. Parking can be a bitch so plan accordingly. Your drinking experience doesn't g4t much better than this.
