Met friends here for lunch and loved it. The staff was friendly and attentive, and the food was wonderful. I had a chicken salad sandwich and the roast sweet potato salad. Mmmm! Highly recommended.

After thinking about it, I upped this to five stars. There was nothing to improve upon but the crowd, but that's not really a bad thing. :)
