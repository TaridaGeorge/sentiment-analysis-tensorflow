I go here every "First Friday" event, and I'm always glad I do!

I don't live in the Central Phoenix area, so it's a treat. The coffee here is great and the baked goods here are absolutely scrumptious. (Especially the chocolate croissants and apple pies!)

The environment is nice and it's functionality is divine. 

I love the selection here, and wish there was one closer to me!
