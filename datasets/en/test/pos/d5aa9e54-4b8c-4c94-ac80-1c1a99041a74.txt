The place is great, the merchandise is quality and very reasonably priced. I paid $10-$15 more for my OBEY shirt at some stupid corporate chain. They have a lot of unique items, shirts, etc. that I have not seen anywhere else.
The store is small and intimate and comfortable.
Cool stuff for a cool cause.
And the staff is super friendly and down to earth.
Enough said.
