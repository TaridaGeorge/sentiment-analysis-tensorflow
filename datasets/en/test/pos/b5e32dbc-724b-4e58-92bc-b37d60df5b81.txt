I have been going to this Cheba Hut since I was a freshman in high school. During that time, it was simply because I enjoyed the novelty of the place, and the food was good. Now I return simply for the amazing sandwiches.

The entire menu is great. Everything is fresh. Great sides like fruity pebble marshmallow treats. Great staff. Great music. All in all, amazing sandwiches in a relaxing, friendly atmosphere.
