Everything we ordered tasted great!!  Our meal total was $21 for potstickers which comes with a delicious salad with a homemade peanut dressing, chicken with cashews and beef chow mein.  The dishes were huge and we were able to eat till we were overly full and still had enought flr lunch the next day.  We asked for our food as soon as it was ready so we could make it to a movie in time, and they had our food ready in under 15 minutes.  We will recommend this place to all our friends, it's one of the best asian food restaurants in the southwest area of the valley.
