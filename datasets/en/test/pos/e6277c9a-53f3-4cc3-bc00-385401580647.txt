Went to dinner last night before the Susan Tedeschi & the Derek Truck band concert at Comerica Theater. It was the BEST dinner we have had in a very long time. This being our first time at Cherry Blossom our waiter was very accomadating & helped us with suggestions. The food was fantastic!! My husband ordered the Korean Spicy Beef Noodles & I ordered Yakisoba with seafood (minus the calamari & asked for SPICY!!!) they were both excellent entrees. If this restuarant was closer to us we would probably come back weekly until we tried everything. The portions were quite large & the prices are very reasonable. I want to thank all the other YELP reviewers for also leaving excellent feedback to help us decide on this little gem. We all know you can't always believe what you read BUT this place is worth a try. REALLY!!!
