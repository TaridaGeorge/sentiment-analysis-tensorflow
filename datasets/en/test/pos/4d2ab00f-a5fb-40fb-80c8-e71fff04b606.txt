The Fry Bread House is fantastic- not healthy by any means, but delicious all the same.  The menu is short, but filled with both meal fry breads and dessert.  
I had beans, cheese and tomatoes on mine and then split one of the powdered sugar breads for dessert with my friend. Both were excellent. 
The restaurant itself is supercasual- you order at the counter and sit at little tables.  The food is very reasonable and the staff is friendly. 
Definitely not a restaurant to miss!
