Oh the Nutcracker. Such a beautiful ballet.

Symphony Hall looks very festive right now, all dressed up for Ballet Arizona's performances of The Nutcracker. It was a beautiful, beautiful show. From the lighter twist on the rats and their king, to the gorgeous set and sleigh that Clara and her prince ride on. Just beautiful. Ive seen this ballet a hundred times and it never gets old. My faves parts included Claras weird uncle (whose name always escapes me), the Christmas tree that grew, the Spanish Coffee dance (my fave piece of music), and the Sugar Plum fairy's big solo.

Our seat were awesome and wouldve been amazing if not for the 2 teenagers sitting next to us that talked and texted during the entire 2nd act. Some people are so rude. Other than them, it was a delightful evening.

Thanks Lindsey! My friend Krystl thanks you too!!
