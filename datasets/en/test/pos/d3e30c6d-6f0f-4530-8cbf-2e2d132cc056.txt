We had another great visit at Oregano's!  Yes, there is usually a wait but we don't mind.  We put in our order for the deep dish pizza, grab a couple drinks, and enjoy ourselves.  

The service, specifically the servers, are top notch.  Every single one I've come in contact with is friendly and outgoing, and it really makes a positive impression on us.

Hope to be back soon for a pizzookie!!
