Zia's is pretty much the equivalent of Newbury Comics, the record store I frequented most back home in Boston.  Now that I've moved out here, it was nice to find something so similar.  

re: Chris R.- True, a lot of people are done with CDs due to the changes in the music industry over the years.  But for a lot of people, you can't replace the experience of browsing a huge selection of artists at a place like this.

I'll go here and spend an hour or so until i have a stack of like 6 or 7 CDs, then narrow it down to the best 3 or 4 finds to buy that day.  I've gotten a lot of good deals here and always enjoy myself.  Staff is great.
