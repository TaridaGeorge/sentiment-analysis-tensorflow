heaven in a cup
thats what this store should be called
It's self serve and boy did I help myself
i put in 4 different flavors of yogurt including Green Tea, Peppermint, and vanilla wafer. Vanilla wafer flavored yogurt? oh my, what a yummy sweet delight that was, after my cup was FULL, I topped it with brownie, malt balls and something else I can't remember
t'was cheap too, got another cup for my roommate and the total was only $4 for 2 CUPS of frozen yogurt
