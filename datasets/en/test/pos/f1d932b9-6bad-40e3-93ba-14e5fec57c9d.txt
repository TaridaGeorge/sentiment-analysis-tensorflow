I was very pleased with my carpets. They looked beautiful when he was done. I have a plastic piece down in front of my desk for the rolling chair and when I pick it up to have the carpet cleaned the outline always shows and I was told it was due to sun fading, however he made it almost disappear. My carpets not only look clean but they actually feel clean because there was no sticky residue left after they dried. I also appreciated the corner guards because I recently had my rooms painted and didn't want the walls damaged.  I definitely would recommend and will use them again.
