Hugo Vino at Cycle was an amazing experience. Where to begin, but with the starters. The roasted beet salad was excellent, as was the bruscetta. The short rib was so good, I can't stop wishing for more! The shrimp was really good, too. And dessert, yum! Goat cheese cheesecake - OMG! and strawberries with marscapone cheese, light and delicious. We are praying Hugo Vino returns REALLY SOON!!!!
