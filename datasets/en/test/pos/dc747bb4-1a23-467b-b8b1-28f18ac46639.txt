fast casual. that is their motive. this place fights for my second favorite burger in town (The Grind). fresh ingredients make these burgers' MO and some secret seasoning in the patty's grind. mcdonald's old french fry recipe with a bit of a twist. i've had a 1/3lb, 1/2lb, grilled chicken, and fried chicken. two salads, 4 different types of burgers, and 2 different kids meals (they sponsor my softball team so we are there frequently). $10 for a burger meal seems pricy but they have it all figured out. 

And until the end of Feb, they have LV's sin city burger. Do not miss out on this. Best selling burger in all SmashBurger stores nationwide. Also, this camelback location won franchise of the  year in 2010. be on the lookout for the SmashMobile driving around.
