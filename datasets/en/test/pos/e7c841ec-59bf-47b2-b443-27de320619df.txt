I went here with my foodie friends not expecting a whole lot.  I'm not that into bbq.  But this place rocked my world.  Unfortunately, it also caused me to gain a few pounds.  But it was totally worth it.  Everything, from the ribs to the sides were sinfully delicious.  I can't think of anything to improve on at this place.
