I am a huge fan of this place. It has a great range of prices (some of which I have a hard time justifying to my pocket book) but majority I can afford. The quality of the garments are good and I love the fact that no one will have your same outfit on. I am a loyal Rowdy customer and highly recommend... oops maybe i should not share my fashion secret. 
Also the owners who are usually always there are super friend and helpful.
