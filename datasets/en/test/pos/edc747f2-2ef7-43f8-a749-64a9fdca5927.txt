I absolutely love Spinatos pizza.  Fantastic taste on all pizza with the two signature pizzas being my favorite.  My coworkers and I go here often as it is is the best tasting best priced pizza around.  Staff is also great and fast.  I also have used this as incentive for my staff and have brought Spinatos Pizza in for them - HUGE MOTIVATOR because it tastes so good.  The only down side is that it is closed on Monday :(
