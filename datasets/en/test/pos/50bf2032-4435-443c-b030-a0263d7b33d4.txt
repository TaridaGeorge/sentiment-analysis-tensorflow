All I can say is WOW.

I was in desperate need of a mani/pedi, and I had bookmarked this place after I read the great reviews from Sara and Halley.

This place was impeccable.  So incredibly clean.  

The amount of pampering you get is amazing for the price.  Along with the pedicure, you get a sea salt scrub and hot stone massage.  The manicure was much the same -- a hot stone massage and a bit of a backrub.  I couldn't believe my great luck in finding this place.  

Thanks, Yelp community for another great find!!!
