The place so nice we went there twice. First went on a Sunday. Place was packed yet wait was only about 15 minutes. The great Scottsdale weather helped make the wait more enjoyable. We ended up with an inside table and the hostess was helpful with making room for our baby jogger. Food was all great. Fresh squeezed OJ is awesome there. We went back the next day (monday) and the place was much less busy. Was able to sit outside. Food was excellent again. We both had different things and were not disappointed.
