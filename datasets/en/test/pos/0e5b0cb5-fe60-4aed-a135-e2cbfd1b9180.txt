If you want healthy food that's delicious, this is the place to go. The menu is full of choices! There's a color key on the menu that indicates which menu items are safe for those with different food intolerance's. Where else can you go that they would put that information on the menu? 

Kirstin, the owner, is awesome! She very knowledgeable about food intolerance's and nutrition. She is typically available to answer any questions. 

We attended the "Dinner with a Doc" food allergy seminar, and it was very informative. If you get the chance, check the calendar for upcoming events. They're definitely worth the time and money!! 

I will definitely be back as often as possible!!
