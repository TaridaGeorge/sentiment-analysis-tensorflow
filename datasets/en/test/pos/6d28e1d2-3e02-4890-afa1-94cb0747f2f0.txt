Best Indian food (highly recommend the Shahi Paneer) I've eaten!  Overly courteous staff, great prices, friendly atmosphere.  I've eaten here for the past year or so at least once a week and the menu never gets dull or boring.  Their Matar Paneer or Aloo Matar is to die for.  Additionally, try the veggie pakoras as a nice appetizer.  If things get too spicy, cool off with a delicious Mango Lassi.
