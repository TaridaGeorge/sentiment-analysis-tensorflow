Update from previous review-Tom (the owner) contacted me and we exchanged a few emails about my experience, how hard it is to manage and develop staff, etc.  He was apologetic and we have a carafe on the house the next time we visit.  I think it's great that Tom contacted me, and other Yelpers, to make things right.  Thanks Tom!
