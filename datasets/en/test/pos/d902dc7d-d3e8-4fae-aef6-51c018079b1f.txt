We took our kitten to this wonderful low-cost vaccination service and could not be more pleased. It was mobile and there was no wait! Even a short walk from light rail!

The staff was kind, gentle and very loveable to our adorable baby. They even had a small litter box for use.

Got an unannounced tour of the AAWL facility that was excellent. All the animals seemed happy and healthy. 

If I were going to be adopting another animal, I would get it here.
