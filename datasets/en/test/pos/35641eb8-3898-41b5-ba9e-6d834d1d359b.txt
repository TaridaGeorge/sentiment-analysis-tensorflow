This place has gotten really good reviews so I had to put this restaurant on my short list of places to check out.  I have come here twice in the past week, first was for a late lunch, and the second time was dinner with friends.  Both times were great, I love the feel here.  Feels like an authenic sushi restaurant, not that I know what that means, just doesn't feel like a glamarous overated place like you'd see in Scottsdale.  The employees fit the title, inside is decorated appropiately and oh that sushi comes out fresh, tasty, and with style.   This is my favorite place so far in AZ, I will be back again in no time.
