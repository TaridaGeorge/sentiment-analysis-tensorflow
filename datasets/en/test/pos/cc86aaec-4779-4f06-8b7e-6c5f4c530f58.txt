I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS PLACE! I have never had any frozen yogurt as tangy and refreshing as this and you cannot find it anywhere else - I've tried! My favorites are the pomegranate, blueberry and prickly pear yogurt flavors. And I always get mochi and blueberries on top. The blueberries don't ooze or freeze like other fruit and go with all flavors. I like this location even though I'm taking my chances with the flavor selection b/c I think they make it better than I do at the self-serve one in Old Scottsdale, even though they have a bigger flavor selection. I've NEVER had bad service or noticed any cleanliness issues. Easily 5 stars.
