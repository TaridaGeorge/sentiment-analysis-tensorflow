We went to Pizzeria Bianco expecting a mega long wait, but only had to wait 15 minutes for a table. They have it set up so that you can wait at the bar next door and they will tell let you know when your table is ready, so it makes a potentially long wait not too bad.

We ordered the mozzarella salad and biancoverde (?) pizza. The fresh mozzarella was amazing! I've had this salad many times before all around the world, and the cheese quality here was just so great. The pizza had rosemary and local pistachios on it, making it a unique combination. I would definitely have waited WAY longer for this pizza!!!

The service is also fantastic! They had most of our food to us within 10 minutes and were constantly checking up on us and our drinks. I love this place!
