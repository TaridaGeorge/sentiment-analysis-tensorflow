I was in town for business and I was nervous about finding vegan restaurants in walking distance from my hotel. The hotel recommended True Food to satisfy my needs as well as my non-veg coworker. We went for dinner both nights. The food is fabulous and the service is supreme. Rachel T. waited on us and offered exceptional service. She made sure everything was prepared vegan and that we were happy with all of her recommendations. She was great and if I ever get to travel to phoenix again I will eat at True Food and ask for Rachel!
