FEZ has become our place to take friends and family from out of town to show them that Phoenix is more than heat, desert, and Mexican food. Everyone we bring loves this place. And so do my husband and I. On our last trip we took my parents and sister. They loved their meals. 

My dad is a pilot and regularly flies into and out of the Phoenix airport. He asked me last night how much time I thought it would take him to get from the airport to Fez and back to the airport. I don't think he'll have enough time so we're arranging a way for me to get him the food he wants.

If that doesn't warrant an upgrade to 5 stars, I don't know what does.
