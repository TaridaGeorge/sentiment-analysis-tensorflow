My friend and I bought a Groupon for this place, I probably never would have discovered it otherwise.

Expensive, but worth every penny.

The purchase of one service gives you total access to all the other amenities. Fitness center, sauna, steam room, pool, and both the indoor and outdoor jacuzzis. As well as their lush locker room w/ showers and anything you need to go back out into the world.

We spent a couple hours by the pool drinking some fabulous signiture drinks. It was very quiet and peaceful. The view was stunning.
