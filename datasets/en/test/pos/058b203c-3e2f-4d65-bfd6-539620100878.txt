Me and my familia are frequent customers at this neat authentic Mexican joint (by authentic I mean non of that "tomato sauce and cheddar cheese over everything").
I LOVE the red chilaquiles, which are spicy and savory with its side of rice & beans, and topped of with a fried egg. 
The green chilaquiles are also equally delicious.
Also a great place to find tacos, specially the "tripitas", which are very well cooked, crunchy, and in all of its yummy goodness. Very delicious menudo, remedy for a killer hangover. 
All though rather small but very clean (bathroom included), you walk in and feel right at home with its great service. 
Complete with a salsa's/toppings self serving station, LOTS of Mexican candies, ice-cream (desert anyone?) and sodas to choose from, and of course aguas frescas.
I just got hungry :)
