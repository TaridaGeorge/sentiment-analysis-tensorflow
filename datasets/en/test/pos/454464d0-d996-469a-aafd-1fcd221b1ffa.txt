John does way more than just AC work. I have recommended him to clients and I have used him myself. Recently we had John install a new toilet for us. Just the time savings of having him do it instead of my husband (and get it done right) was worth it.

John's pricing is fair, his service is great and I would highly recommend him to anyone.
