This is our favorite, at least once a month, Pho restaurant. The staff are courteous, friendly and efficient, and the food is excellent. As far as the Pho goes, there isn't a bad option on the menu, but the real treats are the other treasures on the menu, such as the salt & pepper calamari, which is the best I've ever had. The restaurant is large, that's a good thing because it gets pretty busy at peak times, though I've never had to wait more than a few minutes. Dinner for two, without drinks, may run you $20-25 + tip, but that's including appetizers (hint: the spring rolls are fresh and delicious), but your taste buds will thank you with every bite.
