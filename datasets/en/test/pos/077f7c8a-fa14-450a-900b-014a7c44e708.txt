Rip's has become our favorite neighborhood bar for a few reasons.  The first and most important being Karaoke.  There's a reason it was voted best in the valley (New Times '11).  Karaoke is usually pretty terrible, but not at Rip's - the host, Jen, is a great host and singer.  And the other singers vary in skill, but the crowd is always supportive.  Drinks are usually pretty cheap, and all the bartenders are great - the kind that like to know your name.  Obscura is not a typical night for Rip's, but is an AWESOME dance night.  Stop by Rip's any day for a good time.
