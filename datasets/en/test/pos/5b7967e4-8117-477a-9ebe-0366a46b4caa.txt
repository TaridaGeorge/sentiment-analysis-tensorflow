Have done the spray tan and use the beds, both are fantastic! Staff doesn't turn over a lot-they know you when you come in which is nice. Spray tan is really neat. Didn't know how it would look but it looked great, not orange, and lasted about 5 days. The beds are always clean and the prices are OK. If you do some research and learn the most effective ways to tan, you can make the most of your points.
