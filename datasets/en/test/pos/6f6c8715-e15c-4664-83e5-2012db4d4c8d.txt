Excellent Boba's! I always get the Taro flavor wherever I go, and this place makes it the best! Perfectly blended with great boba. The staff is young, but very friendly and the service is always quick. Sucks that its far away from me now that I moved to PHX, but nonetheless, when I'm stocking up on Asian groceries from Lee Lee's, I always make sure to stop in. Especially during the summer. So refreshing!
