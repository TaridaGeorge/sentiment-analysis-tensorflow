Love, love, love this thrift store....totally reminds me of stores from my childhood, back east. Full of goodies at ridiculously cheap prices....they even do 1/2 off day on the opposite Saturday as goodwill, which is a definite plus. Make sure u check out the windows they have killer costume accessories! Do it.
