Best pizza I've ever had...hands down.  It lives up to the hype.  In fact, I've been now 3 times before writing this review as I wanted to make sure my 'best pizza' claim was true.  Each time I've had a different pizza and each time I've walked away wanting more.  The crust is amazing and it is cool to watch them make the pizzas.  Best time to go is for lunch...but get there early as it fills up quick.  The restaurant is small and cozy...with a cool bar next door if you are caught with long wait.  

It isn't often that places live up to the hype...but Pizzeria Bianco exceeds it!
