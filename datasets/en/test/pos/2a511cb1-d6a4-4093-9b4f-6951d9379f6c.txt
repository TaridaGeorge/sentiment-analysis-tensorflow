Great Great Great...  So much so this was my Friday date night with the Wife...  And she was truly happy with the Burger...  She, Said it was the "BEST IN TOWN" and trust me we eat a lot of Burgers...  Wait time was about 7 minutes, as they cook everything fresh and boy were the fries hot... Trust me do the "combo specials" which will save you about $4 bucks...  Also this Fat Burger is not owned by the same group that owns the others in town... Have eaten at 4 of the others here in AZ plus ones in Calf. & NV...  THIS ISTHE BEST...  The only complaint (this is as a past fast-food owner)  they had 6 people behind the counter... Great for service, but must play heck with employee costs...

Great Food...  XXLDADE  (6"4' 270 and love to eat)
