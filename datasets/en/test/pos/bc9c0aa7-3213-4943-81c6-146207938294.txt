Convenient, modern, and efficient are some words that describe Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix.  This Airport actually reminds me of a mall.  There is a whole area that has a food court and little shops for souvenirs.  Amazingly I was shocked to find that the prices for food was not outrageous!  I was expecting to pay $12 bucks for a sandwich like every other airport but they had a Paradise Bakery, Chilies, Mexican food, Chinese food and much more.  The prices to eat here is about a buck more that you would find at the mall.  

The security check point was really fast and efficient and the over all decor and architecture was very modern and clean.  I would have to say this is one of the nicest airports I've been to!
