In my mind, most of the new DIY fro-yo places are pretty much the same.  What makes Mojo best?  Best fruit flavors (they almost always have either Pom-NRG or Acai available), best fresh fruit toppings, and the availability of BOGO coupons via the web.  My choice over Yogurtology, Zoyo, and the other 5-10 places I've tried in the Valley.
