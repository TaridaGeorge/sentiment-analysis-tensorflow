I find myself having dreams about this pizza... It is that good!  I feel sorry for people who continue to frequent places like Dominos, Papa Johns and Pizza Hut.  

Most of all - I'm absolutely THRILLED that they have a location in the Tuke.  Unfortunately - like all their locations they don't take reservations so either get their early, plan on a 25-45 minute wait or get takeout.  Whatever the case - don't forgo this pizza!!!
