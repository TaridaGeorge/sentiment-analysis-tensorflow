This place is awesome! I have been coming here for years, and have never had an experience that was less than stellar.  The pork chops frequent my dreams, the egg rolls combined with the fresh mint are incredible, and all the soups and sandwiches are great lunch options.

What makes this place so great? Well, first and foremost is the freshness of the ingredients.  Second is the simplicity of the menu, there are not a ton of options, but everything is excellent.  Third is the service; always friendly and efficient.  

If there is one problem it is that seating can be limited during busy times, but that just speaks to how awesome this place is.  I have recommended Tea Light to many people and they have all loved it, so if you haven't tried it, you missing out.
