Overall, the selection is very good. I primarily purchase Thai, Chinese and Korean goods here.  The service is very helpful and always very kind. They have a decent selection of beauty goods such as face wash, hair wax and body wash as well. Their prices are not bad for most things, but the drinks are a bit expensive except when on sale.
