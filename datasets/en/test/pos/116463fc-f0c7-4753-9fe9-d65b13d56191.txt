I was wondering when someone would catch onto the fact that we needed a good, wholesome, health food restaurant out here in Ahwatukee!  So many flavorful options on the menu (including delicious smoothies!), which is impressive considering the vegetarian/vegan push.  Prices are reasonable for what a great quality of food you get and the service is always friendly and knowledgeable.  Thank you Pomegranate!
