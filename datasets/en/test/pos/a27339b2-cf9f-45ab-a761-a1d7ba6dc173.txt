My new favorite place, tons of designer clothes, many with their original price tags for great prices.  Not college student budget style cheap, but if you earn a pyacheck now and find Nordstrom Rack more your style, go. here. now.

THANK YOU whoever cleans this store slightly smelling of bleach and does not use incense to cover the smell of dingy clothes.  Ok one more time, THANK YOU.
