I am one of those people who puts off going to the dentist because every time I find a new dentist I leave remembering why I don't like the dentist.  NOT this time.

Dr. Bader and her staff took great care of my poor neglected teeth (it has been at least 5 years since I last saw a dentist).  They did everything they could to minimize my discomfort, they were pleasant, personable, and never once made me feel guilty for the length of time since my last dental visit. 

In addition, the office is very new, very clean, and technologically very up to date.  Overall I am very impressed, and I have an appointment for 6 months from now which I even intend to make.  No more 5 year breaks for me.  I would recommend this dentist to anyone.
