I have been to AZ Therapy Center 4 times already for acupuncture. It is a relaxing, soothing environment that  promotes your mind and body to heal. Just walking in you feel less stressed out! The staff is great and very friendly. I would recommend this place for anyone that has an open mind to natural healing. They do massage, and all sorts of homeopathic treatments. (The prices are extremely competitive too!)
