Yummy, Yummy, Yummy! This place is great! First of all the owners are a very nice Lebanese family, the husband and his wife are the ones always working, they are so nice and friendley!

The food is amazing, their beef shawerma is very different than anyone elses, they actually use FILET MIGNON for their shawerma, which is a nice change sometimes from regular beef shawerma.

Their Baba Ganoush is so good, you might eat your fingers after it *Egyptian saying, sorry, lol*
