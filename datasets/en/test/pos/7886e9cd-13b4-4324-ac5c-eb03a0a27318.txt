We've stayed here twice now for Spring Training (SF GIANTS!!)  I cannot say enough on the  service and the amenities!  They were very friendly and the kids (ages 6, 12) took full advantage of the lazy river and small water slide as well as many other activities they offered. They had a blast.  The lounge is perfect for hanging out and having a bite to eat. The gym wasn't crowded so I got in and out in 45 min.  It is a little small for a resort of that size.  We've stayed here twice (peak season) and don't really have any complaints.
