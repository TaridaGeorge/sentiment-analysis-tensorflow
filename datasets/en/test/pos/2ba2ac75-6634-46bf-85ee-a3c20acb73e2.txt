i LOVE this place. it's super cozy and the owners/ staff are really friendly. they have free wifi and a number of power outlets you can plug laptops into, so it's a great place to go if you're looking to sit down and hammer through some work! they also have some pretty mean sandwiches that can hold you over if you catch yourself stopping in during an awkward almost meal time :)
