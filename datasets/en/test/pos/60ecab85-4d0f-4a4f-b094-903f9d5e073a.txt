Great healthy options fast plus loys of delicious fresh baked goods. I've loved everything I've tried here especially the chicken walnut salad with raspberry dressing, so yummy. If you are getting a salad skip ahead of the line to the salad bar instead of waiting behind the sandwich orders. The location is great for meeting people outside of security as there's plenty of seating and it's right in the middle of both security exits.
