Just used Dad's Catering for my wedding in November. First of all, they are very affordable. When you are paying for your wedding yourself, this is very important. Second, they allow you to purchase all of your own alcohol and they will provide a bartender. This saved me so much money as I was able to buy all my alcohol when it was on sale. I had a pasta bar at my wedding and I got so many compliments on it. I highly recommend them for your next event!
