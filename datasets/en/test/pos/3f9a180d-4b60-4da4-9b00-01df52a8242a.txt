My friends and I went to the Daily Dose 2 times during our 4 day stay in Scottsdale.  I ate from their Health Nut menu both times and I was pleased.  If you are watching your calories, I recommend the Roasted Turkey Sandwich and as a 2nd choice the Turkey Sausage and White Out.  I like that they have beverages outside while you wait (and the wait can be long on a weekday morning).  Service was pleasant and fast.  No complaints from me.
