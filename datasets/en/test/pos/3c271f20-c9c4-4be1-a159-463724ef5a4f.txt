Have been Lux several times now and each time our experience has been consistently the same....fantastic!!!  Their chai latte and coffee are great.  Their baked goods are tasty.  The service is friendly and energetic.  The only downside...lots of others apparently think the same SO it's crowded.  Expect to wait during peak times and it is crowded!
