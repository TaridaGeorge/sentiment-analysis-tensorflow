I was in Scottsdale on vacation and needed to fund lunch in a pinch. I used my Yelp app and came across Cafe Monarch. The rave reviews were spot on. I could not have been more impressed. This is not the type of place that you expect to find among the chain restaurants in Scottsdale. It is a hidden gem! The owner is the chef, the waiter and the bus boy. He was very friendly and accommodating to a food allergy at our table. The food was outstanding!
