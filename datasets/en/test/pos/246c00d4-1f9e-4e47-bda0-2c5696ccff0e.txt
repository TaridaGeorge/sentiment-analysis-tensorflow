Honest employees did a great job.I was weary of going to an AAMCO. I have been to other AAMCOs and have had unbelievably bad experiences. Yet, this AAMCO had a coupon on their website for a transmission fluid flush for $60 bucks, nearly half off! The staff was very courteous and prompt. I called in the evening and they got me an appointment the next morning on a SAT! They were respectful, quick, and didn't feed me any bull about something wrong with my vehicle like every other shady mechanic in AZ. They did exactly what I paid AAMCO to do and they did it well. After the flush my transmission is running brand new and was an amazing deal to help further the lifetime of my transmission. These guys are honest and will make me a repeat customer for my future transmission needs! Thanks guys!
