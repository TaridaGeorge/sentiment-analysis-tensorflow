I love the GFM! They have some of the best vendors! The vendors there are not pushy and many offer samples. I haven't been here in the fall months, but I've heard there are many more  vendors than the summer. The location has great parking, is nice and open, and next to a little sitting/play area for kids. 

It is my Saturday morning ritual to head there!
