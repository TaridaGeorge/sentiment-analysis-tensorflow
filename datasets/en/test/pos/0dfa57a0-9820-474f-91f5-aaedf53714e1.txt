I love love love this place. 
I don't like Chinese food because they are greasy. This restaurant knows how to cook Chinese food. Everything I had was delicious. I especially like the Hong Kong soup. They make their own noodle so you have pre-order the day before. The broth is so good. If you order dishes with chicken and/or shrimp, you get good portion and tender meat. Everyone at work loves this place. They go there almost every day. This was a good find.
