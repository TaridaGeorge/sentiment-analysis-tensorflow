By far our favorite restaurant in the Valley of the Sun. The owners are always there and treat everyone that comes in as if they are friends & neighbors. 
We took my Uncle from San Francisco here when he visited, he said it is as good or better than any Vietnamese  place in the Bay Area. My Aunt is from Southeast Asia & he served in Vietnam, so he is no stranger to the cuisine.
We eat here at least once a week.
