We have quickly become huge fans of Bol!  With so many chains dominating the Chandler area, Bol is a new breath of fresh air. The absolute best meatballs I have ever had, and I have a serious addiction to their Pappardelle pasta. All of their pasta is handmade daily too, which makes such a difference in the taste.

The service at Bol is great as well. I can't think of one complaint- great food, fresh ingredients and reasonable prices. Highly recommend.
