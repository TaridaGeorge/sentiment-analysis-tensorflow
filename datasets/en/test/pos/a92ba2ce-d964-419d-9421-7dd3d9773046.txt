This is purely a Lunch Time review; i have never been here for dinner but am told the price difference is insane. For lunch, pop in and sit at the bar. get the Bowl w/Brown Rice ($9 w/Tax & Tip) or the Steak/Chicken Combo ($13 w/tax & tip). comes with a salad and some water to drink. service is great, food is awesome, and they always have ESPN on the tv. perfect.
