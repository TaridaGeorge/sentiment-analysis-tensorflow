Awesome, awesome, awesome.  The entire menu is delectable.  This one in Phoenix was the first Macaroni Grill I'd been to, but I've since been to locations in Pensacola, Chattanooga, and Orlando.  All of them are consistently excellent.  It's fun and family-friendly (your waiter will write his name on your paper tablecloth in crayon, upside down so that you can read it, then leave the crayons for you to go crazy with).

Also, they leave a bottle of house wine at your table and then charge you by the glass, using the honor system (though I'd imagine if you finished the bottle and claimed one glass they'd catch on).  Add this to my list of places I wish were near me, but sort of glad they aren't because I'd be a lot poorer if they were!
