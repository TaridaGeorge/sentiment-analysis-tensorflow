Let's be honest: the number one reason to come here is the view on the patio. Kicking back on a loveseat around the firepits with a cocktail and some snacks... It doesn't get much better. 

All of the drinks we tried were solid. No one standout, but just well-mixed drinks. Extensive tequila and liquor selection in general. Didn't get to try much food, but the crab dip appetizer one night really hit the spot. 

Being able to light up a cigar outside just completes the experience.
