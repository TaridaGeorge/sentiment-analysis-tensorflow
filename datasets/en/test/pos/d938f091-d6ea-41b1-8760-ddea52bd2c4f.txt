We were here the first week of October for a private party on the patio.  It was a rehearsal dinner so every detail needed to be met - nobody wants the bride to freak out.  Vintage 95 was great in every way.  The food was phenomenal; very different but still well balanced.  The ambiance was perfect.  Luckily for us, the weather was in our favor that night as well.  The wine and beer were ever-flowing thanks to great servers/bartenders.  They never let my glass stay empty and even remembered what I was drinking; not an easy task for a party of that size.  Unfortunately, I live in the bay area of California or else I'd be back on a regular basis.  For all you lucky Phoenicians, you ought to try this place out without a doubt!
