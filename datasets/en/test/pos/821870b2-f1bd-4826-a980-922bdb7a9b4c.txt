My insurance company recommended Lovett's as one of their "top tier" body shops, so I decided to give them a try.  Found out it's woman owned and operated which is a huge plus in my book, because I often feel as though men don't treat me fairly and respectfully when I need work done on my car.  

They had my car for longer than I expected, but I'm very happy with the result.  After all the body work and painting was done, they detailed my car inside and out before I picked it up.  My 2006 looks like it did the day I drove it off the lot!
