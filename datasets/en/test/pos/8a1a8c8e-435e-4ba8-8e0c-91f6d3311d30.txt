Kohls is definitely one of my favorite stores and this is the best location that I've been to. The store is clean and not too crowded and the staff are always friendly. One time I wanted a particular size swim suit that they didn't have and a customer service rep was on the phone for about 20 minutes hunting it down for me! I wouldn't expect that kind of service anywhere else.
