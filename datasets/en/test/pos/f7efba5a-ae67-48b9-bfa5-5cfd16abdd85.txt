The Chop and the Chick..............oh my pesto encrusted pork chop will I ever get to have you again? It was over 100 degrees, it was over an hour wait, but they keep ice water outside so you don't die, and, in my opinion, its worth the wait to experience dining inside- at least once. After that if you wanna come back, just order your goods to go. 

But back to the pork chop.......it was incredible. It was perfectly cooked, and sometimes Porkchops are hit or miss when it comes to moist and dry. But this chop was plump and moist and pesto-y and out of this world. The ambiance and decor of this place was retro-vintage-mod, mostly white w/little but unique decor.  I loved my dining experience there, from the service to the food.  I'd definitely come back!!
