Sought out this restaurant on the recommendation of a colleague. It's behind an unassuming storefront in a run-down strip mall next to a seedy liquor store. If it hadn't been for the strong recommendation, I'd have taken one look at this place and kept on driving. But I'm so glad I went in! Two friends and I demolished a lot of fish through the AYCE menu. The quality and selection were very good considering it was AYCE. For about $24 + tax it was an excellent deal.
