Absolutely Fabulous!  I am very picky with my Miniature Schnauzers grooming.  Jessica listened to everything I said, made suggestions and I could tell we were on the same page!!!  AND, my dog was very relaxed and HAPPY upon arrival and departure...

I am new to the area and found this great place, with all of the "5 Stars", on yelp.  No other grooming company has this many 5 Star Reviews, so I had to try them out.

Oh, and the Owners are very helpful and FUN...
