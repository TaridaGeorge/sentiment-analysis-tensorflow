I went here with my friends today for lunch and it was my first time. I was in love :) I got the cheeseburger with the wheat bun, smothered in pickles, tomato, mustard, and ketchup. I think if I could, I would marry the chef :) The fries were delicious as well, though some were too cruchy. Service was very friendly and cared about our experience. Oh, and my bill was $10 even!
