I got some plastic surgery done at North Valley plastic surgery and the results look great. I am a young male in my early 20's and I got an otoplasty and a blepharoplasty both of which look great. Dr. Gitt did my surgery and I would definitely recommended him to my friends thinking of plastic surgery. I will agree with what people put earlier that the wait times can be long. But if you get Dr. Gitt it's worth it and he will make you feel very confident about his work. He was also open to answering any questions that I had about my surgery. Also the staff was very friendly and ALWAYS looked great
