I found Crossfit infernal about 8 mo.  I was looking to get stronger to improve my marathon time.  What I found was home!  I have been involved in the fitness industry for over 15 years and have been doing body work for 12.  I love the instruction and review.  Not many places care as much as Crossfit infernal or form.  Good form ='s less injury!  The coaching staff is amazing and the members are gold!!!  So what I have after 8 months is faster running times from the mile up to the marathon and everything in-between, I'm  in the best shape of my life, and i have great new friends!

I am forever grateful for Crossfit!!
