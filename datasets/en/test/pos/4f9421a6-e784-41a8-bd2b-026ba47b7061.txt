Been going to their Tempe location for years and always look forward to it. My favorite is the Veggie Pesto. I have also tried their Mesa location, much larger and could easily handle a big group. Customer service is great. If you are looking for fast food this is not it. Whenever I visit the area I like to pick up a cold pasty wrap it with ice packs and put it in my luggage to share with those back home; ten minutes in the oven and it's a beautiful meal.
