Hibachi is temporarily closed for one month. I can't wait till they a re-open. 115 degree days and a $2 - $3 thousand dollar electric bill for a/c in August might have something to do with it. I can't blame them. Why work for nothing when they can go on vacation for a month to see family. Probably will re-open Sept 1 st. Come back my beautiful waitresses and food!
