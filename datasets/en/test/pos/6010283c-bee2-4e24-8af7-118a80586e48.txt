I'm a pretty tough cookie to please, and I rarely give my five stars out (with an exception to book stores), but I truly believe this place deserves it. First of all, I visited FEZ for my friend's birthday party, and when I walked into the chic doors, I immediately fell in love. I thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance of this place! Service was prompt, and I decided to try the sweet fries...and months later, I can still taste the sugary goodness of them. Drinks were delicious, as well! Over all, I had fun at FEZ, and I hope, and will, return shortly!
