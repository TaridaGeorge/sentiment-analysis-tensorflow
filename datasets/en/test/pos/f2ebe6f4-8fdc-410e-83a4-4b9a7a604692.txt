This place has A+ customer service. All staff we interacted with were super friendly and helpful. The food was good but not super however the chef will accommodate any food cravings you may have.  The ambiance on the patio at night is great with gas fireplaces and all. We didn't come here to golf so I can't speak to the course. 

When we arrived the pool and hot tub patio were getting redone so we could not use them. We mentioned the hot tub being of high value since we rode our motorcycle to the resort. No question asked they upgraded us to a hot tub room. 

I don't have anything negative to say about this resort.
