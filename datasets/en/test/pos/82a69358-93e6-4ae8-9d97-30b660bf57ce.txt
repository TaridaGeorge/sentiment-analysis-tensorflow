This little place is awesome! Meat Market is a great little shop that carries only vintage clothing for both men and women. Prices are surprisingly great, considering the small but excellent selection that they have. I found a couple sweet Members Only jackets and a rippin' old The Who shirt, and only spent about $50. Staff (one dude) was friendly and helpful, and left you alone while you shopped. They even had some pretty hot old-school womens swimsuits...OW OW!
