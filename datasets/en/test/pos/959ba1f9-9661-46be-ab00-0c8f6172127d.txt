This place is like a scene from Cheers. Everyone is happy and generally quite intoxicated. There is always a line after 10pm even though there is a cover. On Thursdays, the cover is waived for "students" aka anyone with a student ID.  It does fill up on Thursday through Saturday nights. The staff is pretty friendly and attentive. The crowd gets to request songs and then as the night goes on more and more people join in singing and dancing along. Only come here if you are up to have a good time and don't mind crowds!!! If it your birthday and you're on Mill Ave, definitely check this place out!!!

My favorite part of coming here is the amazing music, sing-alongs, and the cool bumper stickers that say "I got banged @ the Big Bang" and other variations ;)
