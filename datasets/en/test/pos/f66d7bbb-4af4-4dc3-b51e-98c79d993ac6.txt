I went to Citizen Public House for the first time for happy hour the other day and I must say, I was very impressed! They're staff is so very courteous and always attentive. Their happy hour specials are great too! I recommend the sangria :) We didn't have much of the food but we did try of the bar snacks was fantastic! I would recommend this place to anyone looking for an upscale, quaint place to have dinner and drinks. What a great hidden treasure in Scottsdale!
