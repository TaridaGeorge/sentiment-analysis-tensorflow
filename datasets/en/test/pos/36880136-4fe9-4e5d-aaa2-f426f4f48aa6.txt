Wanted a reason to stop in.  Found one ...my granddaughter's dance recital. Stopped in about 1:30 on a Saturday afternoon and explained what I needed. I asked that the price not go over $20.
I ended up with a beautiful bouquet of lilies, snap dragons, a rose, and other assortment of fresh flowers. The "stemmed" flowers had little "stemmed" water bottles put on (it was HOT outside).

The total bill was $19.95.  Supermarkets couldn't have done such a great job.

Love the look of the place and will most definately return. Even for no reason at all.
