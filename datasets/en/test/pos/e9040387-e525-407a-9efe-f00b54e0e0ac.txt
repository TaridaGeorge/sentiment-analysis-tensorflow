Razz, the owner and chief chef, stands behind the bar and drinks wine with his patrons as the food is prepared in the open behind the bar.  If you get the opportunity, sit at the bar to eat.  The food is delicious, and Razz knows his wine.  The ambience is excellent.  The menu changes with time as new dishes are added, but the whole experience is a treat.
