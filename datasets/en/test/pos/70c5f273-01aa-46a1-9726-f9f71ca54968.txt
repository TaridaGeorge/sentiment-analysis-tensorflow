These guys are great... I used to live here in Phoenix and they always took great care of my cars.. I liked how honest they were and fixed 99% of the repairs the first time.   The guys working there are all well seasoned and have a great since of humor.  I used to bring them some wild stuff to work on and they never denied me service except when I brought in a Mercedes...LOL  I was just in town and I picked up an old Saab, they laughed and said they will give it a shot..  
So if you want to get something fix correct the first time take it here..
