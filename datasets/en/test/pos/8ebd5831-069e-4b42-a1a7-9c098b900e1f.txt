Hands down the best chicken teriyaki in the Phoenix area.  I know it's a chain, and yes, it is in a mall, but trust me when I say their chicken is delicious.  I wish they had one closer because I am in North Phoenix, but I have made the drive many times to get it.  They also will offer samples so you can try it before you buy it.  One bite and you will be hooked.  I recommend the double meat because it's only a dollar more.  The vegetables are good too and they have brown rice.  I have checked the nutrition information and it's actually pretty healthy.  Also, make sure you ask for the hot sauce if you like it spicy.  As good as a it gets.
