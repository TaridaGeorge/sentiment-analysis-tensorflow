Their Bone-In-Filet is AMAZING! It ruined every other steak that I have had in the past. The outside was crispy & salty while the center melted in your mouth like butter. The Lobster Mashed potatoes were creamy with huge chunks of lobster. Asparagus was cooked to perfection.

Finish dinner off with a Butter Cake. I often will skip desert from other places just to grab a cake to go.

When you go there, ask for your waiter to be Tobias. He was wonderful and did a wonderful job with A++ service.
