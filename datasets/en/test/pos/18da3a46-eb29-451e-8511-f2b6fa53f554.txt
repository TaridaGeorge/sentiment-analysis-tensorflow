We love Starwood hotels and this one did not disappoint! Beautiful resort and I can't wait to come back and spend more time at this place. The golf course looks incredible and I don't even golf. They were very accommodating with a late checkout so that I could enjoy the spa in the morning and not feel rushed. I know they were very busy too since the Insight and Fiesta Bowl were both taking place that weekend. 

There's really great shopping/dining just across the street and the spa is unbelievable. I had a facial and a massage and I felt like I was in heaven. Very impressive facilities and staff was very professional.
