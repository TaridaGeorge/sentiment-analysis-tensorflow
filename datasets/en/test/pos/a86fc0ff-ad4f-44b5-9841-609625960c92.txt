I've only came to Joe's twice so far and both times, I've had an amazing experience.  I first came here with my friend and I had ordered BBQ Bacon Blue Burger with sweet potato fries.  I must say, I love me some good sweet potato fries and this place did not disappoint.  I could've done without the fruity dipping sauce though.  Anyways, after eating here the first time, it left me craving another try almost right away.

The second time I came here, I brought my friends who were visiting from Colorado here.  Everyone tucked into the food and it was delicious.  I had the ribs thios time and they were definitely finger-likcin' good.  Yum!

I can see why Guy Fieri gave this place such a great review on Diners, Drive-in and Dives.
