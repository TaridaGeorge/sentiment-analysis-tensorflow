Such a great little date spot! I definitely suggest going on Monday or Tuesday nights when they have their bottle of wine/board of bruschetta special for $20. 
I am typically not a fan of mixed greens salads, but this salad is hands down one of the best I've had. Of course, it wouldn't be a trip to Postino's without bruschetta. My personal faves? Proscuitto and Marscipone, and Apple Fig.
