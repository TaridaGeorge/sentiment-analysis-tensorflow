I really misjudged dutch brothers at first. The first time I went I got a drink that was way too sweet and I thought they were just another generic coffee shop. Now I've been getting their dutch coffee with an extra shot and it is just the best tasting stuff I've ever had! Don't know what the secret is with the coffee beans, but so yummy. I crave this stuff and have been getting a drink every day :) LOVE YOU GUYS- very nice staff too!
