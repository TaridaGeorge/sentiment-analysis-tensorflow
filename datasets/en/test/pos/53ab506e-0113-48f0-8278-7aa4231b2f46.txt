Thanks to Yelp, I was able to find a delicious cupcakery in the PHX area that delivers! 

Yelp HQ is based in San Francisco, but we do have a rather large office in Scottsdale. One of our VPs was celebrating her birthday and we wanted to send her some yummy treats. Did a quick search and found Butter & Me. Emailed in and received a rather sweet response from Kelly. Over the next few emails we worked out the order and delivery and everything worked out wonderfully. 

It was an absolute pleasure to work with Kelly! Obviously my review isn't about the cupcakes (though I wish I would have been able to enjoy one as well!), but this review is for Kelly and her awesomeness!
