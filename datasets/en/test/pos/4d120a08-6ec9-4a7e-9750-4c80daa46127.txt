Praise to a fallen giant, consumed by technology.

I have been a customer of Photomark in Phoenix for the past few years, dropping by to pick up/process some film and treat myself to an accessory or two when shooting in Arizona/Utah.   They have shut down both lab and camera shop as you can tell from the currently non-existent websites.
  
This shop and its knowledgeable staff will be missed by many.
