Mmmm I love this place. I've had Lalibela in my regular lunch rotation for years. The servers are great and they are quick to suggest dishes for new people. The atmosphere is nice and cozy and the food is divine. 

Some of my favorites: 
Kye sega wat  - Beef cubes simmered in spicy sauce
Misir wat  - Red lentils simmered in hot sauce and herbs.
Fosolia  - Lightly spiced string beans cooked with carrots and onion.
Yebeg Alicha Sega Wat - Lamb cubes simmered in kibae, onion, turmeric and herbs.
All this is servced with injera which is a spongy sour crepe, you use it to scoop the food off of the plate. 

The spices for each dish are powerful and unique, I don't think you could go wrong with anything on the menu. 

After writing this review I know what I am having for lunch today!
