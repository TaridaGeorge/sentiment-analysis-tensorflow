I am blown away by the level of mastery of the instructors, the variety of classes and variety of 2 locations.
Every class I have taken has been unique to the instructor. There's loads of different classes to choose from.
I have dabbled with yoga for many years but Metta makes me want to dedicate some serious time to getting better versed with it.
