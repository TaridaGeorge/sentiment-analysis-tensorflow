I'm updating because, this weekend I discovered a bad guy had gotten my debit card number when a hold was put on my card resulting in it being declined. I was able to call the number on the card and immediately deactivate it despite the fact that it was a holiday weekend. Though inconvenient timing, (I was without access to my account over the holiday,) today when I went into the branch I was immediately issued a replacement card (like an actual card - not a temporary deal) and paperwork was completed to get the fraudulent charges credited to my account.

Customer service came with a smile and I was relieved to know I didn't have to wait for something to come in the mail!
