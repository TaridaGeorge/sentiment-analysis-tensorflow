FANTASTIC.  Service?  5 stars.  Friendly, efficient, anticipates needs, gracious.  Food?  5 stars. Delicious, came exactly as ordered, came quickly, portions were big, but we all ate every bite it was so good.  Decent selection of beers, comfortable small space.  I would eat here again and again if I lived in the area, but was just here for work.  I recommend this restaurant highly and without reservation.
