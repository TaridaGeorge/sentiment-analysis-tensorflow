Awesome.

This italian joint has an awesome atmosphere with the brick walls, open kitchen, and dim lighting. Some people might call it a bit loud (and maybe to the older crowd it is), but I was totally digging the hustle and bustle of it all. We were seated before our reservation time, had an awesome waitress, and the food came out within 10 minutes.

The bruschetta might be some of my new favorite. And the angel hair pasta was killer. It seems like the really know how to keep it light (most italian places drown their pasta in sauce). For the area, the price isn't bad. About 15 bucks an entree.

One criticism. The tables are REALLY close together. I don't really mind that, but I would understand that some would.
