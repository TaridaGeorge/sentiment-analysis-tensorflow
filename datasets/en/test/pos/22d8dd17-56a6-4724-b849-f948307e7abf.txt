I am a big fan of Knock Kneed Lobster!

It really is a dive, but Jeannie behind the counter is one of the kindest people I have ever met in food service.  We had the King Crab Legs for only $15.95 with 2 sides.  Most of the side choices are deep fried, but the were all hand breaded and prepared when ordered. NO frozen and fried side orders here like most every other place you go.  This no-frills "joint" prepares each meal for the customer as they arrive.  I doubt that they even own a heat lamp.  Oh BTW...  Our meal was GREAT!  I shall return!
