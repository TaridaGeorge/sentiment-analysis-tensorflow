Absolutely the best East Coast style sandwiches in town. The Italian beef is unbelievable and I've had a lot of good pastrami but here it melts in your mouth. This family owned and run business has been in the same spot for 35 years. Joe, the owner is a vet and a true American Hero. If he has time, he likes to sit and tell stories to his customers... Ask him about where he got the recipe for his Italian Beef.
