Stumbled into this place after work one day and I've been hooked ever since. They have a wide variety of flavors and a LOT of toppings, including a few unique ones I hadn't seen yet at a yogurt shop. Every time I go, I leave with some new (and delicious) concoction of flavors and toppings. And the other reviewers weren't kidding, the red velvet cake is the BOMB. The place has a nice "local business" charm that the chain stores don't have. I think with the summer rapidly approaching, I'll be here a lot more often...
