Let me tell you something!

There is nothing filthy about Phil. He is one of the greatest guys on the planet. Get drunk and leave your Harley outside, Phil will take care of it for you.

The drinks are cheap and strong, the lady bartenders are hot, there are  great signs everywhere and the fucked up clock helps to keep you there.

 You can see panties with balls hanging from the ceiling and hear never ending stories from the regulars. 

My favorite part is the list of people who have been 86'd. That's right, caused such a ruckus they are NEVER EVER allowed back in. No I am not on that list (yet).
