Simply amazing! I wanted to try this place after seeing it on Triple D. We went on a Sunday after church. The place was packed, but we did not have to wait too long to get a table. Once we got our meals, every bite was absolutely delicious. We had the Brioche French Toast and the Mile-High Omelet.

The French Toast was super soft and had a fantastic cinnamon/vanilla taste. Even the jelly on the table was delicious!

The Omelet was amazing too. It was quite possibly the best omelet I have ever had. Also, it came with some hash browns that had a great onion flavor. 

I cannot say enough great things about this place!
