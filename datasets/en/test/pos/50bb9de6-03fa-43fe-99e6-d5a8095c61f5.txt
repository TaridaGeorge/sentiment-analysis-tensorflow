Pleanty of sweet and peppery dished...mmmm. The pastas and crispy delights are deliberately bland...add some of the nice gravies and sauses. Great salads..a vinegar,sugar marinade that is perfect. Clean and friendly. Nicely presented Sushi bar. Quality ice creme bar... with several favorite flavors.It beats other chinese buffets...I love it.
