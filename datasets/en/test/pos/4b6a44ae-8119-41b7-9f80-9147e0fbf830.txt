I've had a lot of sushi across North America; I can safely say, it's the best! Where else can you go for an Ikura Birthday Cake.  I've been there hundreds of times and Chefs Al and Zach have proven to give the best sushi / sashimi creations but also the best dining experience.  They've never let me down...I wish they would open for breakfast too :-)
