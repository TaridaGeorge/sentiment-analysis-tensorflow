There seem to be a lot of mixed reviews for this place, but I did enjoy my experience so they get 5 stars from me:).  We came here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and the service was good and the food was great.  I had the Pesto Beef Panini and a basket of fries and it was so delicious.  I knew that this place was owned by the same people who own Fez and Ticoz Tacos so I kind of knew what to expect and found that it was very similar to Fez in the atmosphere department.  I really want to come back and try the breakfast/brunch menu... one of my favorite meals of the day!  I will update this review then:).
