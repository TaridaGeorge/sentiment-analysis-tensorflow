Awesome place, they'll let you sample a ton of wines and they always have mind-blowing recommendations...this is where I go to discover amazing values on wine that offer complex taste & unusual characteristics. 

They also have unbeatable prices across the board on wine & liquor, I can find a lot of my favorite higher end brands cheaper here than BevMo or elsewhere. They basically offer case discounts even when you're just buying one bottle at a time, which is awesome.

Highly recommended!
