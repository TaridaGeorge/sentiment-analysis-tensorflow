Best mani/pedi I've ever had!  Called today for an appointment for me, Mom & my bff and we were all able to go together within the hour!  The gentleman who made our appt & greeted us was very friendly.  The foot massage and hot stone rub for our pedis was heavenly.  I got a full set of acryllics, Mom got a regular manicure & bff got gels... we are all thrilled with the results!  My manicurist, Christina was superb- great skills and very knowledgeable. I'm so lucky Elite Nails is right around the corner.  Thanks Yelpers!
