I Love this place.
No, I mean I REALLY love this place!  A lot!!!!
So much in fact, that before their convection oven broke, I used to go there just for jalapeno poppers and chicken strips at the drop of a hat.
WARNING!  It's a dive bar.  Meaning that you might see duct tape, maybe plywood, perhaps some water damage on the ceiling.

What makes up for that are the GREAT bartenders.
Not to mention the inexpensive drinks, the huge selection of top shelf liquor, the bajillion pool tables, the decent juke box, and the fact that if it's not packed, the bartender will even let you watch pretty much whatever you want on the TV behind the bar.

I love this place so much, I almost joined a pool league!
