Great for business traveler.  Location is great too, near the airport and the Metro is just in front of the hotel.

I was here on a conference and most of the people staying here a business travelers and didn't see much family when I was here.  The pool is okay, small but then again who has time when you're here for business.

If you need a quick overnight stay to catch an early flight, i would recommend staying at this place since it has a fully stocked bar and drink all you want before your flight!

Bed was comfortable and clean and a flat screen TV.
