Absolutely incredible experience. My boyfriend took me here for my 20th birthday and got me the 'Romance Package'. We got our own private little booth with curtains, a bouquet of roses, and what seemed to be our own personal server. She was probably helping other tables as well but she made us seem like we were the only ones in the place. The food was not only amazing, it was an extraordinarily fun experience. We cooked it to our own tastes and there was so much extra to choose from! The portions are perfect for two and we could barely walk out of the restaurant afterwards because of all the different courses! I will definitely be visiting The Melting Pot as often as I can. Although a bit pricy, the ambience, food, and experience is completely worth it.
