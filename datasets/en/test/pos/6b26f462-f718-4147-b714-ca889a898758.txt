Great place.  And while it's not going to have the luxury seating and fancy snack bar that you'll find at other Harkins, it is going to have the best independent films you won't be able to find anywhere else.

I've seen quite a few movies here, from Little Miss Sunshine (so good) to Brokeback Mountain.  I've had to wait in long lines and sometimes been turned away because the movie I wanted to see was already filled, so it's a good idea to buy tickets ahead of time for anything you want to see.

My advice: Forgo the Hollywood blockbuster and discover an independent gem at this theater.
