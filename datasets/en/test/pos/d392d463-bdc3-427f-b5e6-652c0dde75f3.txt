Jerry is great! 
MINI of Tempe always gives me the worst and most expensive diagnosis for my car. I go to Eurotech and Jerry sometimes finds the problem is much better than previously diagnosed and always less expensive to repair. I am done dealing with the dealership.  
The only thing that could improve dealing with Jerry is if he was on the west side!
