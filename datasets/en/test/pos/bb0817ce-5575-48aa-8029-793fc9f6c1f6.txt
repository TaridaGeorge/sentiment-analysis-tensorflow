Cibo is literally my favorite restaurant in Arizona!  This quaint, completely wonderful restaurant is an incredible experience.  Love the outdoor patio with the twinkle lights and the food is to die for!  The best pizza I've ever had!  My fav is the Salsiccia con Patate made with mozzarella, sausage and potato!  Their margarita pizza, Antipasto speciale and even the Nutella and banana crepe dessert are also delish!  I would reccomend this restaurant to anyone!
