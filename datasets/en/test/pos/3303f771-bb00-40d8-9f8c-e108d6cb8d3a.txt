I just started working in this area and was afraid that there weren't going to be any good restaurants near by... I haven't had a chance to stop in for lunch, but I did go for breakfast this week (... ok, second breakfast) and the breakfast panini was delicious. I don't love the coffee there, but they always make a fresh pot if you order some. The people who work there are really friendly and I think the atmosphere alone deserves five stars.
