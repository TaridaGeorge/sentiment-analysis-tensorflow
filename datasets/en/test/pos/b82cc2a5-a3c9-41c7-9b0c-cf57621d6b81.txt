I just found out my house was infested with disgusting termites.  We were remodeling the kitchen and bathroom and found out they had eaten almost one whole wall in the kitchen.  Brian at Action Termite came to my rescue.  We only had a day to get it treated and get new studs put up and he was in an out fast, super professional and even followed up later with a thank you.  It was a great experience!
