We saw this place from the car when we drove through "oldtown" Scottsdale and we knew we had to stop. 

It's an adorable little 50s style cafe. We skipped dinner and had only dessert. The huge sundaes were exactly what we were hoping for. Sweet, sugary and drenched in hot fudge and other toppings.

This is an old-fashioned family spot. Kids and adults will love it.
