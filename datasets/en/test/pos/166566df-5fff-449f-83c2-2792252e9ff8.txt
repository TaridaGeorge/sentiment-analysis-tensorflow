We really don't expect a top quality restaurant of any kind to be opening up a new place in the middle of this awful economy but thank goodness Saigon Kitchen did. Every single dish is authentic and beautifully displayed. All the ingredients are fresh and carefully seasoned - not too spicy unless you ask for it. Their carmelized ribs and wings are scrumptious. Nope, I don't have a financial interest in this restaurant - I'm just a loyal patron who goes at least twice a week knowing I'm not going to be disappointed!
