Tasty crazy good burgers and even a deluxe hot dog! Their chicken salad has celery seed and red grapes in it, and if you've never tried that combination, you've never had chicken salad. I'm a sucker for sweet potato fries, and Delux does great sweet potato fries. The house aioli is great, I recommend the mixed basket of sweet potato and regular fries. If you still have room after that, get the float made with the stout. Happy Hour's good, everything's good!
