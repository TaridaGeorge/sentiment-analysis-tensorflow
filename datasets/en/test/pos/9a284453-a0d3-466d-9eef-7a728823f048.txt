This place is awesome! Been going here for a few months now since I got a monthly pass for $14. They give you a wipe to clean your dash and free vacuums. People that work here are pretty friendly too. Sometimes it gets crowded but well worth the wait and puts other car washes to shame. The amount you pay for a month of washes here, is what 1 was costs at the bigger name places.
