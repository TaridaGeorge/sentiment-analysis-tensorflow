Great Atmosphere... Great Service.... Great Food!...
My wife and I dined at Modern Steak this past weekend... There was no wait (on a friday)  The dining room is Gorgeous, with an open kitchen.
I had the Sirloin Cap and fries, very good value, as some of their steaks are pricy... but there is a bunch of different items on the menu for everyone.  Our Server, Reede, was a very nice young gentleman and took great care of our table from start to finish- I like this restaurant a ton more than Flemings or Durants, as it has a 'modern' flair...  The atmosphere is not stuffy at all!! The waiters and waitresses wear converse sneakers, and the cooks have mohawks.    Try the Beet salad, and the Sirloin cap.  For Dessert they had a tasty peanut butter creme brule thing... it was great!
