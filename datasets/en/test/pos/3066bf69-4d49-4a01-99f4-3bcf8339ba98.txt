I loooove it here!  So unfair (echoing a lot of people from CA's reviews) that the Phoenix area would have a place like this and not the Bay Area-- home of hippie cuisine!  For me this place has been a salvation from Spring Training baseball fare and the general heaviness of eating around here (so much bar/grill and mexican... good stuff, just not 3 meals a day!).

I've really enjoyed their crab puffs, pesto pizza, sweet & sour mock chicken bowl, salads.. and those tosynamis! yum!  At first I thought they were smoothies, but they're really more like soy soft serve ice-cream sundaes with mixers in them.  Tasty.

The prices are amazing for such "novelty" fare.  I noticed they have 100% biodegradable cutlery too which I think is awesome.

Wish I could put this place in the trunk and bring it back to CA.
