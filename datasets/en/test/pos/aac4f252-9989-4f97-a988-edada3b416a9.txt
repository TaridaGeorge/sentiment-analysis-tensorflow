Love this place, the meat is great especially the St. Louis Ribs (is that right?) heaven, the corn bread is to die for. Didn't care for the corn on the cob either time I've tried to eat it. The green beans have a great taste (bacon!) but overcooked to my taste. But really who needs veggies and grains when you have smoked meat?
