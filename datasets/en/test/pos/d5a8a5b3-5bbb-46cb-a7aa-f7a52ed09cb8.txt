My dad & stepmom took me, my hubby, my sister and a family friend to Claim Jumper on Christmas Eve. The food is very expensive, yet it is sooo tasty. You get what you pay for. Keep in mind when you order the serving sizes are huge. Most of us had left overs. I ordered the Chicken Pot Pie and Potato Cheddar Soup. That was sooo delicious. We had fried zucchini and avacodo rolls. Those were so awesome. Our waitress rocked. Very friendly from the time we came in all the way til the end. None of us had to ask to refill our drinks. She was on the ball with everything. We loved this restaurant so much.
