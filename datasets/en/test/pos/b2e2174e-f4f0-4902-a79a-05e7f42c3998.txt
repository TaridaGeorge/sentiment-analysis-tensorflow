Best burger place ever! My Fiancee and I love In-N-Out-Burger! At first glance, it seems like an average burger place with just a few menu items, however, once you know about the "secret menu" everything changes. You can get anything from grilled onions with special sauce to lettuce wrapped burgers, all absolutely delicious. Their fries are also amazing, especially animal style. I love that they use fresh ingredients and make their fries right on the spot. 

When I want a burger,  In-N-Out-Burger is definitely the only place I go! 

Last but not least, try a neapolitan shake, it will be the best shake you have ever had!
