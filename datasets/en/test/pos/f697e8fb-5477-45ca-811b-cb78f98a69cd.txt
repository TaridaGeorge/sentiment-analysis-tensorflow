I always passed this place and thought, Man! It seems like it's only a sit-down breakfast restaurant. Whoa, completely wrong.

NCounter is just a solid sandwich and salad cafe (correction: it does actually serve breakfast food like omelets and all that jazz) that brings your food to your table. The flavors are great and not too overdone. When I went I had a sandwich (forgot the name) and I was extremely impressed by how tasty it was. And the price? Honestly, I've paid about the same amount of money--if not more--on crappier restaurants down the street, but none of those dishes could ever compare to NCounter's sandwiches/salads! 

If I had time to go back here, I would. Seems like this place is always busy, though, and with a limited amount of time for lunch, I can only enjoy this place once in a while. So sad!
