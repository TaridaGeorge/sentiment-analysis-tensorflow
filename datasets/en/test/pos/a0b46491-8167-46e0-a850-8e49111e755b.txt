This is my new favorite breakfast spot after finding it recently here on Yelp. Essence definitely has the best croissants in town - their chocolate croissants are dangerously good and have lured me back far too frequently since I had my first one. Their fruit galettes are also amazing, especially when you have them warm it up for you. My only complaint is that the prices are a little bit high for some of the pastries, but I won't hold it against them since they are well worth it!
