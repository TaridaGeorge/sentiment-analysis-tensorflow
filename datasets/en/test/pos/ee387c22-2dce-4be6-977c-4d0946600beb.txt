Yes, we all know about the breakfast....I give it a 4. 

Today though, I went in for lunch. Gosh dang, 5 stars, it was amazing!

I ordered the Chicken sandwich - Heaven! 
My friend got the butter burger and he claims it may now be his top burger in Phoenix (even over the Chuckbox!) 

Homemade chips, toasted buns, garlic pickle, and just perfectly cooked meat.
