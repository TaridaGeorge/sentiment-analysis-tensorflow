Chuck Box burgers are hands down one of the best burgers in town.  The place is very dive-y but the food cannot be beat.  Beware that this joint is CASH ONLY, although an ATM is right by the door.  Burgers (and other assorted items) are cooked right in front of you after you order on a charcoal grill.  After your food is ready you are free to help yourself to the condiment bar.  There's also plentiful outdoor seating which is great for people watching!
