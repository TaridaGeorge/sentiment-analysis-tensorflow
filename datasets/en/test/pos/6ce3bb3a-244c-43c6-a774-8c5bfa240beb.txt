So... I'm a huge fan of yogurt in any shape or form to begin with. So, I guess I was bias and not hugely hard to sell. 

We were on our way to Souper Salad, before this place even opened officially... and they were giving away samples. I mean, big helpings of samples mind you. 

It was nice to get free, you hear me? 

Alright... the interior is modern. Apparently, they'll be having their own channel on TV to watch (music videos). 12 flavors, 60 toppings. 

The gf had pomegranate and I had mint they were both delish. 

I heard it's going to be 0.39 an ounce. That is, if I remember correctly.
