Now I've been to the Gilbert location, and Arcadia, and I have to say I think I like Gilbert better. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of Postino...amazing food and alcohol, great happy hour deals, and a unique atmosphere, I just didn't dig the Arcadia spot as much. Parking was kiiind of a pain...not many spots to park in. They have valet parking but when you don't have a bill on you it makes valet diffifult (valet guy was nice polite and friendly). Service inside was spot on as usual. Awesome bruschetta, cheese board, and butcher block. No other issues. Great local wine bar. If you're in the valley and looking for a cool spot, don't leave without checking out a Postino.
