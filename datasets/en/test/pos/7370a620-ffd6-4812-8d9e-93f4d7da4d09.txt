Loved this place. It is very modern and everything about it was fabulous. The food was delicious, the drinks were a little strong, and the wait staff was marvelous. I come from New York and wish we had a place similar to this up here. It's like nothing I've ever seen.  It was quite crowded so I recommend a reservation. We went without one and wound up waiting only about 20 minutes.
