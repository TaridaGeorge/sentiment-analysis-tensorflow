I was visiting relatives in AZ and just had to try out some flying trapeze.  George and Terri are incredible instructors and very supportive.  I had only done flying trapeze once before, but they made the return very easy.  Professional, yet make sure everyone is having a great time.  The reasonable price is an added bonus, but once you try, you'll know that you're getting a great deal on a wonderful experience.
