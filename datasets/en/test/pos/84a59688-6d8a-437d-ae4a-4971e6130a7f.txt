These guys make world class products, and I am proud to have them in my "backyard". I know a few of the employees over here and they are all down to earth, super-nice folks.

Sorry to hear Mistress J has an issue with Marketing - perhaps she should have tried the Legal department?

I myself play a Gretsch (which is distributed by Fender) and I love it. I used to be a die-hard Les Paul fan, though the Gretsch converted me.

Rock on Fender!
