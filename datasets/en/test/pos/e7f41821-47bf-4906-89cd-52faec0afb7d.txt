Dang!  So glad I found this place on Yelp.  We were here for lunch on Saturday.  My favorite was the bacon, tomato, arugala brushetta and the salmon one.  I can't remember the names but they were all actually really good so I don't think you could go wrong with any of them. 

If I lived here, i would eat here all the time!  They also had a pretty good deal with the $5 pitchers.
