My go to spot for lunch dates with coworkers! I am in LOVE with their chicken walnut sandwich and the blue cheese crumble salad.  This specific location gets really busy around 12 so try lunch at 11 or 1 :)  The staff is pretty friendly and helpful.  I always get worried at the beginning of the line that I won't get a table but the staff here are pretty quick at clean up so there's always one available.
