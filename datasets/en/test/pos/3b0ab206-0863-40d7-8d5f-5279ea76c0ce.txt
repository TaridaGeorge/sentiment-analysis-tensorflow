Another fantastic foodie date night!  

We sat at the bar, overlooking the busy open kitchen, while hubby sipped his Pinot Noir and I savored my Pink Mojito!  Prickly pear puree, rum, yuzu and crushed ice topped the tallboy...what more could you want in a drink?  Spicy fried calamari came while we waited for our surprise (because we could barely understand our server).  

The Delux Sashimi is one of the best we've had.  The amazing iced presentation consisted of ahi toro, kunomoto oysters, sweet delicate scallops, sliced Alaskan crab, slices of fluke, fresh red ahi, albacore sushi and duck sashimi...yes, you heard me...duck sashimi!  Oh my, we were surprised at how much we liked that one.  The melange of fresh sashimi was served with a simple freshly grated wasabi and  a sprinkling of sea salt.   

Sweet dreams are made of these...
