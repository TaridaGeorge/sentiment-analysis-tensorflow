Love this place. I have been going here for years and took my bridesmaids for my wedding. I am always happy when I leave. I have been to several technicians and Danny is my favorite. Prices are good and they have a ton of gel colors to chose from. Don't go as a walkin. They are usually packed. They are open 7 days a week unlike most salons.
