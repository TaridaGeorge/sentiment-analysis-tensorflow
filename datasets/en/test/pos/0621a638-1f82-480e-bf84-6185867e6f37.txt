Love love love.

My morning addiction. Coffee is excellent, boys are always entertaining, crepes are deeeelish, music is awesome, and I can hole up in the cute little living room and work while I get jacked up on caffeine. Oh! And the oatmeal too! Mmmmm...

This is a REAL coffee shop. The kind where people have conversations and you run into people you know - or meet new friends. If you suck, please don't ever, ever come here and feng up our shui. 

JoBot - I love you.
