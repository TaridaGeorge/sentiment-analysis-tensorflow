I have not been bowling in 24 years,so you can imagine i was worried. But, this place is clean and fresh. On certain nights,(Monday)and a few others you pay a $5.00 cover charge,then everything is $1.00 .Food ,drinks , games and most important bowling games. The instructions were easy. We got shoes in our size then went and picked out a ball. Lots to choose from! Lots of fun!!!   It was a $20.00 night for 2 of us. The workers are very helpful and Friendly. Bathrooms were also clean. I did not see them spray the shoes with Lysol so that was a little gross.But, other than that it was a great time.
