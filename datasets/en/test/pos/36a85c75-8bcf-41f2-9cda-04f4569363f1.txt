I love that they have all you can eat Mongolian barbecue here, so you don't feel the need to load everything you possibly can into a bowl.  Plus there is soup, fried or white rice and all sorts of other goodies at the end.  The service is awesome too!  Both the cooks and the waitress had a smile all the time.  Definitely recommend!
