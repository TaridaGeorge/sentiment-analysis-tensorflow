We accidentally found this wonder while looking for a place to eat today and finding out the next door restaurant may not have been what we had expected. Sitting outside, watching the activity on the street, and eating a delicious omelette was the BEST thing I could have done this morning.

The charm of the staff and the delicious food will bring me back over and over again. It was so good, my party and I reached out to a passerby who looked intrigued and encouraged them to eat here instead of their usual next door favorite. They were not disappointed either. Bon appetite to all who go.
