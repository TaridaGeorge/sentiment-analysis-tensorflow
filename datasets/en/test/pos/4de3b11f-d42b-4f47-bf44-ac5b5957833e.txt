We just took the tour last week and had the milk bar.  Our girls are only 3 and 1 and both absolutely loved it!  If you can't swing the entire tour you can do just the petting zoo for half price and that in itself is well worth the trip!  The animals are all so tame and sweet with children of all ages and the milk bar was fantastically delicious!  This was such a great adventure for our family!
