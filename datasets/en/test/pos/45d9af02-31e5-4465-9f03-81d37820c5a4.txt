Dr Agnew is awesome! She goes above and beyond in treating your pets. My hound was the first entropian surgery that she performed. Her care, attention to detail and follow up was the best that we could have hoped for. All 3 of our pets are treated by her and she knows each one's problems and history  even before I have to tell her.  I would recommend her to anyone and everyone.
