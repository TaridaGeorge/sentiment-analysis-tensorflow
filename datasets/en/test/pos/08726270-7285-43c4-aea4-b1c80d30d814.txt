This place is fabulous. I love everything about it.
Atmosphere, service, quality and portions of food, drinks.. everything! I loved everything! Me and the bf got two apps and 3 entrees and they brought everything to us split already which earned xtra brownie points for sure!! Everything looked so good we had a hard time narrowing down so we just went all out and had no regrets.

Can't wait to go back!
