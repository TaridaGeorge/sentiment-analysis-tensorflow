Fantastic Pizza! Their cheese is great, toppings are good, and they have some interesting and tasty combinations (gourmet slices). All fairly priced, and the staff are incredibly friendly. 

The calzones are also tasty (and quite large), with a very nice garlicy dough/crust. 

They have some incredible-looking deserts which I have yet to try. Overall, if you are a fan of mom 'n pop style new york pizza, you will enjoy this place.
