My husband and I went in for the first time two weeks ago to find liqueur that we had been looking for all over the valley.

Brian was knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly. He really knew his stuff. He explained why we weren't able to find this particular liqueur in the valley as they have been trying to obtain some themselves. We got to talking about some drinks that we were trying to perfect at home and he made some excellent recommendations. We felt as if we really hit the jackpot on this trip. Total Wine is great and all, but sometimes I feel like the employees there don't REALLY know what they're talking about. 

Brian, will you be our real life friend? Goodness, I hope his name was Brian or else this review just got really embarrassing.
