This place is pretty darn amazing, such a hidden gem. It's a huge complex of two massive buildings, full to the brim with adorable trinkets, decor and jewelry. Seriously - go here on a weekend day and give yourself at least two hours to see it all. Everything is organized and displayed beautifully and you could find a gift here for anyone! (Especially a pet lover). I preferred the building that was on the east side, but that's just me. I hope this place is successful as it's a uniquely cool and independent addition to Phoenix.
