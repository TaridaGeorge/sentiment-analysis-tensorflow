For as many times as I've eaten at and taken out Pita Jungle, I probably should've had every item on the menu by now.  However, their hummus trio and chicken is so DARN good, I order it nearly every single time!!  You can not go wrong choosing Pita Jungle, whether it be for a casual lunch, take out, or a big dinner with friends.
