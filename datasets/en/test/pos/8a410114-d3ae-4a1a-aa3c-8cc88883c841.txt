Skies is a country western bar at heart.  Full bar, live music, dancing, good food, and a great staff.  It doesnt seem as big as it really is from the outside.  The food is typical bar grub and the menu won't overwhelm you, but it is still terrific.  I've had the burgers and quesadillas more than anything here and both are great.  On Friday and Saturday nights it can be hard to find a seat at the bar, by the band, or outside, but there's a lot of booths and tables towards the back if you show up late.  Parking can be a bitch, too.  They have hitching posts if you wanna ride in.  The place is loud...clear and simple.
