I LOVE Chic Nails!

I used to go to Tip & Toes on 48th street and Ray Road, until one day they were "too busy" to take my friend and I in for pedicured. We discovered Chic Nails and have been doing all of our manicures and pedicures there since. 

The staff is extremely friendly and they give the best pedicures for a very reasonable price. I highly recommend this nail salon over any other!

P.S. It is extremely close to CK's Bar & Grill to go for happy hour after! :)
