Truly an exceptional experience from the food to the atmosphere to the service. You get all this while not being uppity, but rather trendy and hip. I'm unfortunately not a steak eater because everyone else at the table had steaks and almost died and went to heaven. I had the sea bass which was no less amazing and not to mention the largest and most generous chunk of fish I've ever seen at a nice restaurant. I couldn't even eat half. We had the lobster mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, and green beans as sides which were all delicious. They have an excellent wine list in all price ranges and I noticed they had quite a nice selection of vodkas and martinis. Highly recommended for a special occasion or a special date ;)
