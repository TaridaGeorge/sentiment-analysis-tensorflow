I went to Treasures to see how much it would cost to add a locking clasp to my tennis bracelet. The salesman was so helpful and educated me on the bracelet. He went as far as to have me look through a loop to better explain what he was talking about. These folks know their stuff and I would highly recommend their services. They were really down to earth and not snooty at all like some other jewelry stores seen in high end TV advertisements/ He noticed the tanzanite ring I was wearing and even showed me the difference in colors in the stone and others that were available for purchase. I felt a lot more knowledgeable after leaving.
