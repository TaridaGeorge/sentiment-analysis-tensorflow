One of the best wine stores in Phoenix.  While the store lacks in size the staff makes up in knowledge and friendliness...  they will make very cool custom wine and cheese baskets for that last minute party that you did not get anything for or they can reccomned great value wines.  they also have a nice selection of scotch and tequila.  They even have a little bar that has some sort of food that i have never tried and they have tastings often.  I think this is a great place and the people could not be nicer...
