Yes, I was craving a burger at 10 in the morning. I went to the McDonalds across the street first just becaused I was heading east. When the gentleman came over the intercom I could hear some snickering and laughter; that made me happy. I like people to enjoy their job. When I ordered a burger he told me they weren't serving lunch yet. I said "okay, thanks then" but as I drove past the window I felt stared at like "who wants a burger at 10am?" Young punk... I crossed the street, and at the JITB intercom I asked, "Can I get a burger right now?" The man responded, "You can have whatever you like." I ordered, and when I pulled up to the window was greeted by a genuine smile and he asked me. "How was your service today?" Awesome. I will never go back to McDonald's.
