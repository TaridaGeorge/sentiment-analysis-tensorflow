Love the Meat Shop! Their pork products taste so much better than anything you'll find at the local grocery stores that you'll wonder if it has really been pork you've been eating before! The rashers are delish, ground pork far superior, pork steaks make great schnitzel...I could go on and on. I will have to admit that I prefer Schreiner's chorizo though. Plus, its a local company so if you're a locavore, this is the place for you.
