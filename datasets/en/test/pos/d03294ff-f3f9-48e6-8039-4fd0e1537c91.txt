Prime provisions was a hip, well decorated establishment with fresh, locally sourced food that tastes great.

I usually order the club sandwich on pretzel bread, my wife makes her makes her own salad...one of the only places we can go where we both get exactly what we want without sacrificing what the other gets.  I like big tasty sandwiches (and I am picky) and she likes fresh salads made exactly how she wants it.

All aspects of the menu are build your own style OR order directly from the menu so if you are picky or like things a certain way this will suite you well.

Service was friendly, fast and attentive.  Two thumbs up!  Will definitely be going back!
