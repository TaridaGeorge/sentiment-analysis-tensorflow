I have been going to this store since it was the Wild Bird Center and have never been disappointed. As a hummingbird rehabilitator, I get all of my favorite feeders here ( they are the only store that carries the Best-1 feeders). I also get food for the wild birds that visit our home; like bagged peanuts and papaya. The store also has solar fountains, all kinds of fish and pet foods, fish and other outdoor decor items. 
This is one of my favorite places to shop for pet and bird products. They have a little bit of everything there. It's such a treat to go there and browse around.
