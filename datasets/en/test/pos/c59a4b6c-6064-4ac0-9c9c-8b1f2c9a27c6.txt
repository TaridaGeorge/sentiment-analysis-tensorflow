Foodwise, this is one of the best restaurants in the city of Phoenix (yes, I include Scottsdale, as well as all of the other surburbs, in "Phoenix") and has terrific service to boot.

Carefully created fun cuisine, with high quality ingredients. I wouldn't hesitate to send anyone here. Even those with a less than experienced palate can find something on the menu they will enjoy.
