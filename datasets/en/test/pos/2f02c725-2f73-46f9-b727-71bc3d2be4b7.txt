this place is awesome, i ordered four shrimp rolls and 6 California rolls (i didn't notice the number in parenthesis). lol it was alot and was prepared to pay a hefty bill. i sat at the bar the chef was very friendly and just watching him do his magic with the sushi was awesome. i got my salad and soup and edamame and a hot towel thrown at me by the chef, im guessing for cleaning? is this a custom? it was cool though...the shrimp on my rolls was so tender, possibly the best cooked shrimp i have ever tried. the presentation was ethnic as you expect, the service and food were excellent. guess how much my bill was? for 10 rolls, soup, salad, edamame and2 iced teas? 9 dollars. not bad. will be back.
