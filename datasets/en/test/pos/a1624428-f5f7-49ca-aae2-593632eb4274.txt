We bought a set of four tires last year and after only 11,000 miles they were making noise. Turns out they were "cupping". They were "entry" level tires but still thought they should have lasted longer. Discount Tires called the tire maker who offered 1/2 of another set.
After a discussion they agreed to replace all four at no cost. I signed a waiver stating I realized these tires could do the same thing as the last set. This was only fair after all, they were eating the rest of the replacement cost.
We have never had anything but great service from these guys and will continue to do business with them.
