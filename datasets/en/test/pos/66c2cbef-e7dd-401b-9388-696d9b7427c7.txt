In a city long accused of lacking any distinct persona, Central Ave. and Camelback is quickly becoming metropolitan Phoenix's cultural hub.  And -- for me -- Practical Art has become a major player in the shift.  

The shop features local artisans who make things you can use around the house: everything from handcrafted knives and gorgeous ceramics to unusual jewelry and funky furniture.  The really surprising part?  Unlike some of the more pretentious offerings around town, you can actually afford the stuff that Practical Art sells.  A place where you can support local artists, pick up adorable and functional items, AND keep your budget intact?  That's a pretty good deal.
