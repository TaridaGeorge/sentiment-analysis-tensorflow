This coffee shop is so close to my place that I enjoy walking to it. They have great coffee and love how they make their drip coffee. They grind it for you and use the single use filters and individually make them per order. Their Chi is really good too! They are sustainable and use Eco friendly cups and if the order if for sit down they put their drink in glass tumblers. I love going to this place!
