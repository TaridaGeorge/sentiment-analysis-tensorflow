KILLER!

I had the Lolo platter of fried chicken and two waffles the morning after running the Arizona Half Marathon.  I earned the right to eat whatever I wanted, dammit!  The chicken was crispy and really tasty.  The waffles had something special going on, a little nutmeg maybe?  Together with maple syrup...ah, a symphony!

And with the well mannered hoodlum working like a dog serving everyone in the place, and the listening to the cook yelling from the kitchen, this was totally fun.  Lolo's is on my Scottsdale rotation!

Don't miss this place, real good food and local color.
