One of my favorite restaurants in the Valley! The service here is always excellent, no matter who our waiter is. The food is very high quality. I often find myself here for an impromptu girl's night out, and the ambiance is just fantastic. Plus, they're open late, which is great for those late night cravings! I crave their French fries probably three times a week, they are THAT good. And the aioli sauce that they serve with the fries tastes so amazing, I have never been able to find another aioli even remotely close to being as good as that. Great ... now I'm craving them again! :)
