I've eatten here numerous time and I must say that this is my favorite steakhouse by far. Most steakhouses I've been to tend to not the get the meat cooked correctly. The first time I went here with my husband I was confused a bit when they asked 'what temperature at would you like your steak'. The waitress was more then helpful on explaining what temperature equals what type of cooking. When I got my steak it was cooked to perfection. I love their baked potatoes and the salads are wonderful! They also have a great wine list and a good selection of mixed drinks. 

Also, I've gone here a few times for lunch too and they have a pretty nice sized lunch menu as well with half sandwiches and soup combos that are just the right amount of food for lunch.
