I was in one of my best friends weddings this weekend and, yes, I waited til the last minute to do anything about my see-through completion. I found Jessica on Yelp and gave her a call. She was able to fit me in on an hours notice and was super friendly and made me totally comfortable! I've never had a spray tan, but I would totally do it again with her! 

I was complemented on my sun-kissed skin and no one could believe that I had a spray tan. Thanks again for saving the wedding pictures ;)
