5 stars. Phoenix is becoming more and more like a "real city."

First of all, I ride the light rail to and from work 5 days a week. It's on time, air-conditioned and remarkably clean. The Tempe kids are harder on it than the transients who invariably use it to cool off downtown.

Parking at the airport is a thing of the past.

Dinner downtown or in Tempe? Have as much wine as you want. You've got a sober driver until well after the bars close (on the weekends, at least). If they ever get a line out to Scottsdale, it's over. I'd sell my car. 

Bottom line: if you can use the light rail, you should. It's convenient, fast and environmentally responsible. Support it now and encourage expansion.
