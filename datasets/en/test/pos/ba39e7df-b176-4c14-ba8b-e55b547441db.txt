FYI - it's called Hon Machi, not Han Machi.  I'm surprised by the two other reviews-  portions are small?? Same size as Kona, RA, Sakana, sushi eye, etc.  It is always full from 5-7 for happy hour. The lunch special is $8.95 for two rolls and I get them to go all the time. The owner, Jackie, is awesome and always friendly and helps out when it gets busy for the other servers. The sushi  is fresh and delicious. I really like mom-and-pop places like this. It's nothing fancy but in the three years I've been going here it's always been great and never a disappointment.  My favorites are the Las Vegas roll and Hon Machi roll(both are on the happy hour special).
