Yay! Now I don't have to go all the way down to Chandler for Pacific Seafood! I'm a little late with this review....but let me tell you, I was ecstatic when I drove by on Bell and saw the "Opening Soon" sign on the building. I loved the Chandler location, but hated making the trek!

Glendale Pac Seafood has everything the Chandler one does, except this one is nicer, newer, and super clean! Be careful on going on Friday evenings...this place gets packed, so I'd recommend getting take-out if you're just wanting to grab a quick meal.
