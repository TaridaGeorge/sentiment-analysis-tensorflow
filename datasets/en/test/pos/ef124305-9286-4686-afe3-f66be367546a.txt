Stopped in early on Thursday after hearing they added a special food menu.  I was not sure what to expect and ended up totally loving the eat-at-the-bar thing with chef behind the bar making food in front of us.  My wife and I shared three or four plates and downed a few cocktails but not too many to risk the drive home.   Recommended for those looking for light dinner w/o the big dinner commitment.
