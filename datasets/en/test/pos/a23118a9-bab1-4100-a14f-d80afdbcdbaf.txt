I had a great experience with Massage Envy. My boyfriend made an appointment for us to get a 30 minute couples massage because we had gotten some gift cards from a Yelp event :). The whole experience from beginning to end was relaxing and amazing. First we were taken back to a relaxation room, which is a glorified waiting area where they played relaxing music and had nice aromas. I just about sank into those comfy couches! Next they brought us into a room with two massage tables and gave us time and privacy to get undressed/get on the table. The music was so relaxing and the masseuse was awesome (I think her name was Amy). She made sure to check if the strength of the massage was too intense periodically. I definitely want to take the bf back for a full hour some time soon. I Recommend!
