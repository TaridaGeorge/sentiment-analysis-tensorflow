This buffet is about as good as one can possibly imagine for the price.  

We didn't realize it until we got there but this place is located in a casino.  I don't really gamble and usually don't feel at home in casinos outside Vegas but this casino wasn't bad.  It wasn't like the typical smoke filled dungeons you see scattered over Arizona.  

Also, beware that the buffet closes between breakfast and lunch.  We unfortunately arrived right before it closed for the change to lunch but the staff was nice enough to let us eat the remainder of breakfast quickly.  They were even nice enough to let us stay through the change and into lunch which I was told would normally be an additional cost.  

We were treated like kings and ate like kings too!
