Phenomenal! My in-laws are regulars and I have always wanted go.  It was well worth it.  Creative and delicious and fun.  The tasting menu is fantastic and fun to see what will come out of the kitchen next.  We took our 13 year old son and he said it was one of the neatest experiences and could not wait to tell his friend he had eaten wild boar.
