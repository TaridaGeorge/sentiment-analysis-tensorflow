I tried 3 of their flavors including Tart, Tiramisu, and Coffee Espresso. For toppings I had the frutiy pebbles, mochi, cookie dough, and cheesecake. 

Toppings:
Cheesecake 5/5
Cookie Dough 4.5
Mochi 5/5
fruity pebbles 4/5 (fresh and crunch right out of the box!)

The reason that I'm so impressed is that everything here tastes really fresh. The Mochi is soo soft! ITs fresh, not hard, and guey yummness! There is also the cheesecake which tastes very soft, creamy, and tasty! As for the cookie dough, there isn't any egg and it seems they may have added the mix + oil w/o the egg. Its still tastes fresh and I enjoyed it. The yogurt isn't watered down and is a good consistency.
