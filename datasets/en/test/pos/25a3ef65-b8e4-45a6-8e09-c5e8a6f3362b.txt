Great beer selection, friendly servers, and the food keeps getting better and better (fancy burgers, freshly made chips, sirloin tacos, yes!). Half off bottles Thursdays and half off pizzas Mondays make this place a great regular hangout. Go here when you want to hang out with friends for a chunk of evening somewhere you can actually hear each other.
