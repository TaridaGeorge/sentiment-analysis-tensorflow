the BEST quality self serve frozen yogurt i've ever had. my favorite flavors are peanut butter, cake batter & pistachio... oooh and they had a really good mint flavor during the holidays that was to die for... i really like the service here too. it's really nice to go to a place that is clean, well managed and has friendly workers. i heart Kokomo!
