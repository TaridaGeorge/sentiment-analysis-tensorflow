For those who have been to the Gelato Spot, I have to say that Arlecchino which I discovered before the New Times article and is easy to locate but difficult to stop by (thanks to LGO's popularity) has to be the best gelato I have ever tasted. The owner's passion for his product can definitely be tasted and is amazing. He uses fresh fruits is originally from Italy (and you can only help but notice). What I really enjoy about going there is the passion and pride you can see in the owner's work. If only parking was easier it would be an even bigger hit.
