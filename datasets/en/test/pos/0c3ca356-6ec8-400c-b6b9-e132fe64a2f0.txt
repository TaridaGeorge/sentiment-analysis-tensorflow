Amazing brunch! Nice open air feel and quick service. The wood oven baked eggs are ridiculously good! Runny egg yoke with seasonal veggies all baked with red wine braised beef... Yes please. The chicken salad sandwich is also delicious. Live jazz has on Sunday morning is supposed to be great as well.
