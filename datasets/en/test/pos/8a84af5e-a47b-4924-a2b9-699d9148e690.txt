This place is great! The burgers have a unique flavor and they are a little on the greasy side but that's just the style. The customer service is great; the staff is friendly and attentive. It's nice to have someone stop by your table to make sure you're enjoying the food even though it's only a burger joint. They also serve alcohol if you're into burgers and beer.
