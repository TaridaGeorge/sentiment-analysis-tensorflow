Stayed here last weekend, and I can not say enough about the property.  The room was very comfortable and the bathroom was outstanding,  From the moment I register to when I left the service was world class.  They even had check in for my nephew that he is still talking about, and the property was decorated for the holidays and it was as if I was at home.  I look forward to staying here again in the future.
