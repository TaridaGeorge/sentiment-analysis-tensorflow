I love the view, food and service here. I love dinner and brunch at El Chorro. I just adore everything about this restaurant. (No, the sticky buns are not a draw for me :) I personally think they are weird with wine and dinner-I guess I am not a sticky buns kind of girl) Love the patio!This is one of my favorite places in the valley.
