What else can I say about this place other than I love it.  It is clean, the people are exceptionally friendly, provide excellent service and make a great chicken sandwich.  I even love the music they play in the place!  Here is the real kicker for me; they have diet lemonade.  I'm not sure how many people notice or look into this kind of thing but most "lemonades" served in restaurants are loaded with more sugar than soda's!!! Needless to say I really appreciate the sugar free lemonade and it tastes great!
