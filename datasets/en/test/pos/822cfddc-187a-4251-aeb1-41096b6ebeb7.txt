Was in town for an extended layover late and just looking for a place to get a bite to eat with a friend. Wait staff were extremely attentive and helpful. The setup was awesome with comfy seating, TVs for the sports bar-like experience and the energy of a bar without feeling like everyone is on top of you and making it massively hard to hear. Wings and fries were excellent. Just a really well thought out place that I wished I could've brought home with me.
