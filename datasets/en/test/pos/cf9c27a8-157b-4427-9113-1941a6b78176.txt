I'm a big fan of the groomers here!  I was very loyal to a groomer in Tempe and PetSmart changed my mind.  My sweet little doggy is taken care of so well here.  The groomers make him feel calm and less nervous.  They do a great job listening to my instructions and always make him look great.  I appreciate the doggy mess bags in the parking lot too!
