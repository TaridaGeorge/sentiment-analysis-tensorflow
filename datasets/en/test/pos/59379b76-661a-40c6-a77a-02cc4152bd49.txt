Where do I begin with reviews for this place. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Greek Food!!!! This particular location is so small, an eye sore, & not in the best locations. You cannot judge a book by its cover though. The food is the BEST!

I've tried almost everything there, but my all time favorite & that I always order every Friday is Spring Mix Ceasar Chicken Salad with the creamy Greek dressing. It comes with the most mouth watering Pita bread. If my body could tolerate eating here for lunch everyday, I would but I have to watch my girlish figure...without having to calorie count, haha!

Every Friday!!! Crazy Jim's, Love it!!!!
