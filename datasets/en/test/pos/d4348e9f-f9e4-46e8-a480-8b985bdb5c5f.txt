If you don't like something on the menu... no big deal... they have 100 other things to try.  This menu is quite possibly the second largest menu (behind cheesecake factory) that I have ever seen.  And this is just the food!  My personal favorite is the Parm Crusted Chicken.

Did I mention that this was a brewery that had some great beers as well?  There are very few seasonal beers I can tolerate but every season BJs releases a new beer (even if it's a repeat from last year) I am amazed at how delicious it tastes.
