The most money we have ever spent on sushi.  

It wasn't filling but it was definitely rewarding.  Everything was delicious.  The butterfish appetizer, the sashimi boat, the yellowtail, and whatever else we sampled was practically melt in your mouth.

We'll be back, but not go on a completely empty stomach next time.
