I've been here three times recently for their 1/2 wine bottle special on Sunday nights.  Every time I've had a great experience.

This last visit we started with a bottle of Angeline pinot noir.  It was refreshing and started things out on exactly the right note.

For dinner I had the braised short ribs.  These babies are tender and melted in my mouth.  Absolutely delicious!

The second bottle of wine was a gorgeous Ladera cabernet savignon.  It went perfectly with the short ribs.

For dessert the caramel gelato was just right.

The decor and service are always first class here.  I can't wait to come back soon.
