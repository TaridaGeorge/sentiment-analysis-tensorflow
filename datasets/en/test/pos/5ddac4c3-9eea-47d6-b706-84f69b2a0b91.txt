I freakin' love this place! Food is consistently great...service is always great...staff is very friendly, including the valet guys. It is by far my most favorite place to eat. If you like your food a little spicy and a little sweet, try the Sweet Thai Chili Vings...go during happy hour and get them half price! I have them nearly everytime i go to eat there. All of my friends who have tried them are now hooked, too! They also have a killer Sunday brunch. Been there many many times...I've since moved further away, but I still manage to get over there at least two or three times a month. Will there ever be a Vig-East Mesa? I can only hope! It might be way too cool for East Mesa!!!  :)
