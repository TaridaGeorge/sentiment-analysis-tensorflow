Oh the weather outside is frightful - but the Coach House is delightful, and since we've no place to go!  Well you get the point and we're not snowing anytime soon in Phoenix :(  and no that drizzle of snow is not considered snowing!  I love this place during X-mas especially - X-mas wrappings all over the walls and ceiling.  X-mas lights all over and under.  Man I hate to be the guy assigned to take it down!  Though it makes this place so cozy.  Drinks are pretty inexpensive here also so bottoms-up!  - Enjoy
