Love it! Right up there with Fnand B as the best restaurant in Scottsdale. Fn and B has the better location.  Cafe Monarch is harder to find as it is 3 blocks from the restaurant area in downtown Scottsdale. We were there for breakfast 2 years ago it was $20 and you choose sweet or savory. The chef was the cook, and the waiter. While, they were busy, he could hire more staff if the average chains were not so busy. It is upsetting that more people do not give small great places like this a chance. While, I do not love yelp, yelp was the only way we would have found this hidden gem.
