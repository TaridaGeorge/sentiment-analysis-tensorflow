This place is HUGE.

I was here for Wrestlemania Fan Axxess and it was on the bottom level, which requires you going down 2 separate escalators just to get to.  The entire complex is shiny and huge and amazing.  Of course, it's $3 for a bottle of water but they know they're gonna get you when once you're in, you can't leave again, and you know you're gonna be thirsty after walking around for 4 hours or so.
