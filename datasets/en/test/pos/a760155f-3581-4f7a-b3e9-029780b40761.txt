Yummy...Seafood.. This place has both seafood from the west coast and east coast..


I love their selections.. Their shrimp and lobster salad looked succulent and their Cajun gumbo was to die for..  

This is the real deal if you want to eat a seafood restaurant.. Hands down one of the best seafood restaurants I have been too in a long time...

Wonderful very bright atmosphere makes you feel like your on island in the middle of the desert...hehe
