I love this location. It's always clean, and the equipment is fairly new and well kept up on. I very rarely ever see any equipment down for more than 24 hrs, it generally get's fixed fairly quickly. The staff is always nice and pleasant to be around, never a rude experience. Strongly suggest going EARLY in the morning if you're not a fan of crowds or a lot of people to say the least. Around 2 it gets busier, and right at 4 it's pretty packed.
