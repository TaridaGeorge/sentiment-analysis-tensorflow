CityNorth absolutely rocks. Why, because nobody is there. 
As a business venture it's an absolute failure, financially worse than a train filled with kittens crashing into a train full of puppies.
The result for me? I can go to any restaurant or shop there (all 3 or so), park right in front and never need a reservation. It's like my own private Kierland without the crowds. 
Sorry investors and real estate developers, your loss is my gain.
