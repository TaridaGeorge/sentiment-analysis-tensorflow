Wow! Came here on a Sunday for lunch. It was busy but not packed, which was nice. The wait staff was awesome. Friendly and attentive. We ordered the cheese platter and split a panini. It was pretty big! The cheese platter was wonderful - but I love cheese - and the nuts and dried fruit complimented it perfectly. We didn't order any wine, a mistake that, I'm sure, will be remedied on the next visit.
