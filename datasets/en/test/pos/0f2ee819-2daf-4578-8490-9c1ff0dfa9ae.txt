This is "Accessories Heaven!" Shopping here with two floors of costume jewelry made me feel like a kid in a Candy Store! Color-coordinated earrings, necklaces, hats, purses, scarves in every color imaginable can be found at Charming Charlie. From formal bling to casual everyday wear.....All alternatives are here. 

I especially love the way they display everything according to color. There are separate tables for yellow, green, brown, purple, & white accessories. And prices are reasonable too. 

I'm from Hawaii. Whenever I visit Phoenix, I always make it a point to visit this awesome store. And I always leave with a bag filled with the most gorgeous, affordable accessories around. Open a store in Hawaii please, lol!

P.S. Staff today were gracious and friendly!!! Good Job!
