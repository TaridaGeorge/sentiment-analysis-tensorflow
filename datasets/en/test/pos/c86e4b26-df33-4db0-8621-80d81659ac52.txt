Awesome, awesome, awesome! I've been using TLC for a few years now and Kara and her staff are incredible. When I've used them for daily visits, there is always a note from the sitter telling me what they did with my dogs, playing with them, taking them for walks etc... I've also used their overnight service and have been thrilled. My dogs would not do well at a boarding kennel, in fact, they would do awful at a kennel, and TLC's overnight stay has been a great service. I've been able to go on vacation and relax more knowing that my pets are in good hands while I'm away.
