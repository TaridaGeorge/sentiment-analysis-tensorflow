I just moved downtown and I've been looking for a neighborhood barber shop. I feel like I've found a great one. 

They gave me an incredibly low priced cut, but it was still one of the better cuts I've had in a long time. They were really friendly dudes who were very attentive and quick while still making you feel welcome. Good conversation, too - which adds to that neighborhood feel. 

Really nice to see a locally owned shop give such awesome service at an even better price. I'll be going back next time I need a cut and I hope they stay open to serve the community for a long time.
