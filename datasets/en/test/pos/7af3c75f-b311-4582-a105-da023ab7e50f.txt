Mike Dilello is the reason I'll buy another Land Rover from North Scottsdale Land Rover.  Mike is by far and large THE BEST service advisor I've ever had. And I've had a few over the years with BMW, Infiniti, etc.  He is accomodating and down to earthwith a no nonsense approach who never tries to upsell me.  It's a true pleasure having my car serviced because of Mike.  I've never had a bad experience thanks to him!!!
