I love this market! They always have the freshest produce, meats, seafood, etc!!! You can stop in and grab something prepared fresh for lunch, or a hot dinner to bring home to the family! My fave is the sushi bar!

The staff must be part of some Whole Foods cult or just compensated very well because they all seem to love their jobs, and are extremely helpful! Its a little pricey to shop here, but it's a small price to pay for peace of mind as far as the quality of your groceries go!
