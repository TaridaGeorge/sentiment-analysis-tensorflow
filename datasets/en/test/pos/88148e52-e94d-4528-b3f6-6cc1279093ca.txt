The food was delicious and fresh, the sangria tasty and the wait staff were friendly without being overbearing. Additionally, the music they were playing caught my ear ... an awesome mix of indie pop rock. They definitely impressed our staff of entertainment bookers and event producers. Thanks for the great lunch, Arcadia Farms!
