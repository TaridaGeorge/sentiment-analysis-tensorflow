Got a week?  That's about how long it would take to visit all the stores in this Mall.  I went on a Friday night and the place was packed with happy shoppers.  They have every store that you could ever dream of, plus some that you never thought of.  I was weighted down with packages in no time and my feet were so tired by the time made it from Nordstroms to Dillards, I gave up and went back to my hotel!
