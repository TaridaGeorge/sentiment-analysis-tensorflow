Breakfast is my favorite meal to eat out so naturally I have tried what I think are most all the "breakfast" joints in town but for some reason or the other, I'd never stopped by the Village Inn.  Boy, I am sure glad that I did!

Great menu, great service (Thanks Gina) and good rib sticking food.  Move over Good Egg, you have some competition.
