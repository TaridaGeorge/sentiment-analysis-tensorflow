They have everything!

So, the last cruise DH and I took introduced us to a couple of special bottles of wine. DH's fave was called Magnificat (I found it a bit heavy in the oak) and set us back about $ 80.00.  Found it here for $35.00.  My favorite was a Meritage called Col Solare $99.00 onboard our ship and difficult to find in Boulder.  Total Wine had Col Solare for $65.00!
Nice!

Slight draw back: first time I asked for help finding Col Solare, the guy misdirected me, but another young employee helped me locate this special bottle of wine!
