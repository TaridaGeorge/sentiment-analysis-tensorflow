After a few recommendations, I finally paid a visit to this restaurant.  I'm glad I did because it was really great!  The building isn't the nicest but the food certainly makes up for it.

I ordered a few dishes for our family.  The Beef Chow Fun was my favorite.  This noodle dish has really great flavor.  We also ordered the Mongolian beef and Chicken with Garlic sauce; both were fantastic!  Our last dish that we ordered was the Green Curry with Chicken.  This was also good, a little spicy and a little sweet.

Overall, our meal was really good and we will definitely be coming back here again.
