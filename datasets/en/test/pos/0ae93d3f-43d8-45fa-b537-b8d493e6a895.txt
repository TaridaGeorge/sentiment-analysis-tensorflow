Brought my Mom to get her nails done. She is happy, because they did a great job, and the staff is very nice. They also had a discount coupon on their website  which didn't hurt. (Hey, I am going to treat my Mom and save money... why not?) haha My Mom has been here before and has liked this location. We thought that they remodeled the salon, from our last visit. But, my Mom found out that they have a new owner. My Mom met her and she was very friendly. So, we will be back!
