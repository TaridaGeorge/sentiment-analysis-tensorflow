Chocofin is an excellent place to buy chocolates. You do not need to go to Bruges to taste good chocolate. Owners are super friendly and the staff is also very nice. Cakes are very good my favorite are the cup cakes; they are not available all the time so if you see them buy them, yes, not only one, buy at least 3 after the first bite you will know why. The only bad thing is that I am not in Fountain Hills now to go and buy some. Oh well, I think I can order some.
