I have been going to Vatoci hair salon for over a year now. I've had the same stylist from day one and I highly recommend her. I've never had so many compliments on my hair! Ask for Marsha (Mirushe) and I guarantee she'll take amazing care of you. 

I love that she always remembers what we talk about and asks me about my job and my kids too. I am sure that Spiro and Vera also do a great job because the people who are in there when I am are regulars and everyone is always happy to be there. 

My daughter loved going in to be pampered as well, and they are amazingly flexible on scheduling appointments even though they always seem to have plenty of customers. They know what they are doing. Highly recommend!
