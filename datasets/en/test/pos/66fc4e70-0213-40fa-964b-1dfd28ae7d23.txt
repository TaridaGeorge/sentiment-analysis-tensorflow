This was actually the first place I ever ate Sushi and made me a sushi lover. I have eaten all over the valley yet keep coming back here for more. The new chef is full of personality that goes along with all the staff. I always enjoy my visits and now that they are installing TVs on the wall it will be become a regular hangout. 

My last visit the place was placed full and people still waited to be served. No matter if you want it to go or a night out make sure you give it a try. 

See you there !!!
