MAC and I have had a love affair for many years, until one day when I suddenly developed some sort of freak allergy to their eye shadows! *tear* Well, what can I say?... they may be "pricey" but the colors are the best around and they are so potent that you barely need any, so they last FOR-EV-ER! I have spent more money than I care to admit at MACs across the country and this one is my favorite. The girls (& guys) who work here are always really nice and really helpful. Got my New Years makeup done here and got complimented by everyone the whole night. Love it!!!
