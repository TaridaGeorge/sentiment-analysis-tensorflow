the perfect spot for a lunch meeting - close to the city center but away from the hustle and bustle.  the quiet outside patio is nice for a breath of fresh air before returning to the recirculated air of your office tower.

the lunch menu is affordable and delicious!  i highly recommend the eggplant parm or meatball sandwiches with the house salad! (if you are dining with a friend, try ordering both and sharing half/half on the sandwiches)

the pizza and antipasto on the evening menu is top notch as well!  a great spot for casual group dinners or an intimate dinner for two. love this place!
