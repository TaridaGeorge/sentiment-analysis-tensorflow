No complaints about our stay here. Stayed two nights.

We booked with Travelocity and were able to bring our dog with us at no additional charge--unheard of among hotels and we were so glad for that.

Room was clean and recently renovated, bed plenty comfortable. Everything worked fine. The price was awesome, too.

Super quiet location, too. We didn't get woken up by any noise, but the second night, just to be safe, we left the bathroom fan on all night (it makes just the right amount of background noise).

The lady working the desk at night was an absolute SWEETHEART, too. She remembered my name and was super warm and friendly, besides being very professional.

Great stay. For the price, location, and pet-friendliness, I'll be staying here again next time I visit Tempe.
