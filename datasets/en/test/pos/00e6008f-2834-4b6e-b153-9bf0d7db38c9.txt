This place rocks!  Diana and Ray know glasses and they carry brands that stand behind their products, engage in decent practices, and are cool, cutting edge styles.  If you're looking for "edgy" frames, talk to Ray; Diana is more practical and understands tat not everyone will want to be totally radical.  Seeing them together, it is clear why they're such a good team and why this business works.

This is neither the cheapest place to get frames and lenses, nor the one with the most expansive selections; it is, however,  the BEST place to get them, good advice, guidance, and  a history lesson or two along the way.  These people are steady, fair, committed, and do such a nice job--and it is a locally-owned business to boot.
