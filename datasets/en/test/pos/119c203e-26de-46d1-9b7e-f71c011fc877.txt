Yum, yum, yum!

Husband and I had pizza, while Mom tried the Italian beef sandwich.  Everything was delicious.  Coming from Chicago, it was pretty impressive to find a spot-on Italian beef sandwich down here in the desert.

The pizza was the best I've had in a while.  We are new to the area, and will definitely be back again! :)
