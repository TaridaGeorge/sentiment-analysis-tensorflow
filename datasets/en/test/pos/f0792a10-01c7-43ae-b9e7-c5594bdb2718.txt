I'm a fan.  Saw this place after eating at the restaurant next door.  We took some samples but we were stuffed and promised ourselves to come back.

Glad we did.  Everything tastes the way it says.  Double Chocolate Brownie?  It tastes like chocolate with brownie, not overpowering and those little chunks are yummy.  Strawberry Cheesecake?  Tastes like cheesecake ice cream with swirls of graham cracker crust and chunks of strawberries, again so yummy.  Mango Orange? Coconut? Key Lime Pie?  it goes on an on

The possiblities are endless and although it seems like a small cup it's the perfect portion size.  The price is reasonable for the quality and the service.

We keep coming back and experimenting with mixing the flavors!  A must try.
