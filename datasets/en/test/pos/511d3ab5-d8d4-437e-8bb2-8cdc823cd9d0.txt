A friend lives right buy this place and we didn't know it was there for a while, but we now love it.  Like the larger My Big Fat Greek Restaurants but in a more a fast casual type setting.  A good place to get a quick meal, maybe watch some of the game.  

It is one of the nicer fast casual Greek places I have eve been too with a pretty wide selection of options.  The sandwiches were delicious and came with some really good fries.  The portions are quite large and well in line with the price.  Will have to make sure to go back, a lot.
