We eat here all the time.  I don't get why this place got bad reviews by some people on here.  We have been here weekly (at least) since it opened & the service is fast & friendly, the food is excellent, you can choose from a ginormous array of interesting things to put in your salad.

Sure the decor is bland.  Who cares?  Food is great, service is great, easy to get to.  It *is* a little more expensive, but if you are in the mood for a good FRESH salad, this is your place.  Sweet Tomatoes & Soup or Salad are McDonald's quality...this is not.
