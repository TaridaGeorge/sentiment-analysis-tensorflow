This place deserves better reviews than the 3 and 4 stars I've seen!  They came from another location, China Gate, in Metrocenter, where they were a buffet.  The woman who appears to run it (but I won't say her name, for privacy reasons) remembered my husband and me from there, and even remembered what I ALWAYS order!  SUPER friendly and nice (we hugged the first time, as we were leaving!) and the food is GREAT and generous.  CAN'T GO WRONG!  TRY IT!!  : )
