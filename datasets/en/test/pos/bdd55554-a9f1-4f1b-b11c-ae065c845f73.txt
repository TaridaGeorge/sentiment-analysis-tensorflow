Came in to this place while I was in Scottsdale this weekend. It was recommended to me by some friends. 

First, what can I say! Probably some of the best sushi I've ever had! Phenomenal taste and blend of flavors. Good quality fish selected for the sushi, and everything blended together nice, it didn't taste like eating rice, seaweed, and fish seperately like other places.

The place is smaller so come earlier or right when they open to avoid waiting. 
The sushi is reasonably priced, and service was fast and great!

Highly recommended if you want to try something different than the norm (RA/Stingray)  in Scottsdale .

Ill be back next time I'm in the area.
