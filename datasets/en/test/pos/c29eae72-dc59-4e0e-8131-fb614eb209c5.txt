I might still be a virgin if it weren't for alcohol. Thank god I discovered it early, before all my pesky "standards" kicked in. 

No, I didn't get my first drink from Top's. Or even my thousandth drink. But I do like to think that if I had, I could have had those standards and still gotten some play at the same time. 

Why? Because Top's has everything, from the finest of Belgian beers and pinot noirs designed to lure me in to the loveliest bourbons perfect for letting my guard down to the lowest-of-the-low canned beers for when I've just plain given up and taken off my pants. 

If Top's were a burnout from a dive bar and I were still 19, I would sooooo take him home. Only this time, I would cook him breakfast and let him stay awhile.
