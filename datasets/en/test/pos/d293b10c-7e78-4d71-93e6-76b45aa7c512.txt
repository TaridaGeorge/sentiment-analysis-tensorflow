Simply the best Italian restaurant in Metro Phoenix. Everything is fresh and made daily at their restaurant an the pizzas are cooked in a fire brick oven. Amazing quality, atmosphere and food. The staff are polite an make you feel welcome and that your business is appreciated. It's a must try for anyone who appreciates amazing Italian food. Worth the drive from Scottsdale!
