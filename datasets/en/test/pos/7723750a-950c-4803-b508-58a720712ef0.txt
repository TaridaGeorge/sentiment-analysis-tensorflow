Terra Nostra is located in a strip mall, across from a Goodwill store.  You may find this a reflection of the taste within the restaurant, but you would be very very wrong.  Terra Nostra was a happen chance choice for my family while visiting Scottsdale for a conference last week.  We found it in a magazine and had one of the better italian meals we've ever had.  They have a large menu with plenty of choice.  The bread was fresh, the service was pleasant and responsive, and the decor was your typical italian wall paintings.  We ordered two plates of homemade pasta, eggplant parmensean, and the veal/shrimp plate.  All was delicious and dessert topped it all off.  Great place for a family meal, date, or group outing.
