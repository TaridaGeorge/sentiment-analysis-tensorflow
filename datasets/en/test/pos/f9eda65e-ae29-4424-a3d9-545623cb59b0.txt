Let me get this out of the way first..  They sell Pacquiao t-shirts!!


Anyways, Manila Sunrise has always been my go-to place for Filipino products.  They even have fishball sauce there!  Can you believe that?!  Where else in the East Valley can you get authentic Filipino fishball sauce?


Their products are fairly priced.  Some, I'd even consider cheap.  Yeah, a handful of those products are also sold at LeeLee's, but they are all cheaper at Manila Sunrise.


You want fried chicken skins?  Chicharon?  Chippy?  Clover Chips?  Sarsi in glass bottles?  Tocino?  Longanisa?  Filipino themed apparel?  They have it all there at Manila Sunrise.


The people that work there are pretty cool too.  They really appreciate the patronage you give them.
