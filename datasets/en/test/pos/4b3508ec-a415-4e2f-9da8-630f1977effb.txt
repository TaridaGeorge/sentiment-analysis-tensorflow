I guess there really isn't much left to say but "ditto," but I've loved the Fry Bread House for years and just couldn't resist adding my 2 cents.

I try and I try and I TRY -- but I just can't make fry bread like they do here! The basic recipe for fry bread is so simple (flour, water, oil) you'd think it would be a piece of cake. 

But the freindly folks at Fry Bread House obviously know something I don't. Maybe it's the fact that they are native Tohono O'odham Nation members, and I am SO white (as my exchange student son so often reminds me)...

Anyway, check it out for absolutely the best comfort food to be had this side of a heart attack. And I mean that in the best possible way..
