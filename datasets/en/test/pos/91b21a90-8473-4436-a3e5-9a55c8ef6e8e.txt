The first place I've ever tried Greek food was Pita Jungle and I've been hooked ever since. However I have found that the mom and pop places can be a hit or miss. King Gyro's is a HIT .  I have had their tabouli, hummus, dolmas, chicken gyro, and fajita pita and never once have I been dissappointed.  NATHAN S was not exaggerating about the tzaziki sauce I eat it with EVERYTHING!
