Had a wonderful time, and it's a great environment! The margarita pizza was out of this world, and the old fashions were mixed perfectly!

I had left my phone there a few hours before closing. Our wonderful waiter and an additional waitress (I'm so very sorry I can't remember your names! ): ) found it, called my sister, we drove from Surprise back to Phoenix, and they stayed a little late for me to come and pick it up.

THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS AMAZING! You both have wonderful hearts!
