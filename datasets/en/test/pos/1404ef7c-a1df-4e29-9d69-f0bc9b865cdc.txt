Great. If you have never been I would highly suggest going. Has great pizza...another local spot that blows Pizzeria Bianco out of the water. This place is pretty packed on the weekends and you can expect to wait at least 30 minutes on any given day.

The service here is top notch and I have never had a bad meal. This is one of those places that you wish no one knew about because it is so good you want to keep it to yourself. Me yelping about it is not helping but they are so busy most times the secret's out...and if you don't know now ya know!!!!

5 stars!!!
