Very nice atmosphere. GREAT service, wait staff was very attentive and extra friendly, made the meal even better. Had the classic sampler with ahi, salmon, mahi mahi and butterfish, upgrade white rice to the black sticky rice, excellent. Prices were ok but try Aloha Hour from 4:30 to 6:30. $5 appetizers and drinks, great value if you want a light dinner and a drink. Carmel macadamia tart for desert was delicious.
