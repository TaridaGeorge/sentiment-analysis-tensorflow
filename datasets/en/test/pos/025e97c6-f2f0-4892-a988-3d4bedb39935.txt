What a great concept!  Fresh, healthful food with a wide ranging menu that offers plenty of options for vegetarians, vegans and omnivors. Could not be happier with every aspect of my meal -- delicious local greens salad; vegan pizza with rich tomato sauce on a tasty organic flour/spelt/flax crust; and a chocolate soy ice cream. Nice selection of organic and bio wines.  Very reasonably priced. The only complaint was a slightly wobbly table.  But for someone from Boston to be eating such a wonderful mean outdoors at 8pm in mid-Feb, it doesn't get much better.
