LOVED this place! 

This is hands down the best service I have ever gotten at a restaurant.  Now granted it was the middle of a weekday, but the waiter was nice, attentive, and he even gave us directions to a bar we were trying to find (not for that day, but for another time).

I had an amazing cocktail.  It was basically a mojito but used tequila  instead.  Which was perfect.  It took away some of the sweetness of a mojito and gave it a bit more body.  

I was there with a family member and we split Asparagus and Fennel Frites and the Butternut Squash Corn Enchiladas.  Both I thought were pretty good.   I really liked the fennel, just because it was something a little bit different.  The enchiladas had a little spice to them but not a ton.  They were very flavorful though.
