If any of you Giants fans have never had the opportunity to check out a Spring Training game, I highly recommend it. 

Scottsdale Stadium is an awesome venue for baseball. Every seat is a good one. They have excellent food stands, a mini Giants Dugout Store, and a fun atmosphere. I lucked into some sweet tickets, second row behind the Giants Dugout. I got some badass photos of Timmy, Chez, Panda, Buster and Will The Thrill. Will was my childhood idol, so having him waive when I called out to him and snapping a photo of him made my day. He also threw pieces of gum into the crowd by the handful, adding to the fun.

Too make things even more sweet, we beat the Dodgers...
