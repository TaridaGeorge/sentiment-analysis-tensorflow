I recently moved back to the valley and the pizza has improved. The sauce, toppings, and crust are all high quality and fresh. Organ Stop only gets better.  I love the music and it a great family friendly place to eat.  My daughter gets so excited when they play her request.  Lew Williams, the organist we saw on a Thursday night even played Stairway to Heaven on the organ! Wow.  I don't know if they still have classical concerts but I hope they do.
