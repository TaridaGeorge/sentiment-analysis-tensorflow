Sweeties is like a small grocery store selling just candy.  It is amazing.  They have lots of unique bulk candy you can scoop out of bins, as well as packaged candy.  Some of the bulk candy was very expensive- like 5 lbs of watermelon taffy for $20.  But the assortment is magnificent.  We were looking for large gummy alligators and lizards and found multiple varieties to choose from. I also purchased several small things as a birthday present for a grownup guy: gummy green army men, wax mustache, mechanical punching glove, sports jelly bellys, big league chew bubble gum, extreme rock candy, candy cigar, hot tamales, and a gummy spider.  He loved it.
