AMAZING FOOD! Yes there is a long wait (2-3 Hours sometimes) but if you can't find any friends that you would like to spend a few hours with next door at the bar drinking wine and eating a cheese platter and some olives, then maybe you should just call for delivery and stay in your cave.  The ingredients are minimal on your pizza but you can' TASTE the freshness, and that beats all greasy and heavy pizza in my book! So come prepared to wait, but Bar Bianco, which is less than 20 steps away will help entertain you while you wait. Food and service are exceptional!
