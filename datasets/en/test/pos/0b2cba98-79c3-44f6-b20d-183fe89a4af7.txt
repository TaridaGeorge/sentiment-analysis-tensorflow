One of my fondest memories as a child is traveling to Alameda to visit my great-grandparents, one of which was Filipino. The food! Yum!!! 

It had been years since either my mom or I had Filipino food. We both moved to Arkansas 20+ years ago but I recently moved to the valley. The first time I came across Hey Joe was last Spring when my mom was in town and we visited the Old Town Scottsdale Farmer's Market. Pancit? Lumpia? I was beyond excited when I saw the truck. Yes, I get excited about good food.

Everything was fabulous. I have since tried the breakfast dish which was absolutely delicious. 

Service is great, prices are wonderful. I will definitely be back.
