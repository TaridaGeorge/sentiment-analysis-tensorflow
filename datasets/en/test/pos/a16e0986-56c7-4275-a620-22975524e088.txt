This toffee is amazing and they are always so helpful and sweet. My favorite is the Sweet and Salty...but the Twozels is pretty addicting. I always have a great experience at their store and I haven't met a flavor that wasn't amazing. Cute packaging, beautiful store, really neat concept. Love the mom and daughter thing. 

Plus, the place is immaculate and clean. ADORE!
