All the elements came together perfectly one Friday night: great service, great food, wonderful company, and amazing atmosphere to create a very, very good memory for me.  The food was roll-around-in-it good, but I was most amazed by the Server who had the most wonderful sense of timing and a dry (barely discernible, but very much THERE) sense of humor.  She was a joy to talk to!  I can't wait to return to this little slice of heaven!
