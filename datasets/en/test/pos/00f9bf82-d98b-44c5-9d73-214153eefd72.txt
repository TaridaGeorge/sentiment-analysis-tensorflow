My friends and I had twenty minutes before our show started; could they accomodate us? 

The lone, surly waitor grunted assent. In five minutes, our food and checks were ready. Still no smile, but I'm willing to write that off to cultural differences, because no one does rush orders anymore. 

As others have said, the food at Phoenicia is perfect. I love the hummus with chicken, the shish kabobs, and the gyros. I can camp on the patio with the deluxe hummus all afternoon. 

The decor is basic diner laminate and flourescent lighting, but it was clean, and the patio and big windows count for major points.
