My friend brought me to the Ranch Market to buy tamales for New Year's Eve.  That was four night ago.  I've been back five times since then.  I'm in love with this place. The food is amazing the prices are lower and there is so much atmosphere.  How can I ever go back to Safeway or Fry's.  If you have never been you should get in to your car and drive there right now.  Ranch Market is now on the list of place I am going to take out of town guests.  This is what Phoenix is all about.
