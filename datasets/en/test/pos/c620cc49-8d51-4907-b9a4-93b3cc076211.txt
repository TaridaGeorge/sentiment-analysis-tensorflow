Love this place! I work down the street and visit often for lunch.  I have to admit, I have only ever had one thing - I'm a turkey sandwich lover (I know, plain jane) so I go to PS a lot on Turkey Tuesdays. The bread is delish and the turkey and toppings always taste fresh.  My only recommendation would be to not order the 'avocado' because it's actually the guac-style dip instead of fresh slices.  Otherwise, great place. Oh, and another plus, they have Cherry Coke on fountain!
