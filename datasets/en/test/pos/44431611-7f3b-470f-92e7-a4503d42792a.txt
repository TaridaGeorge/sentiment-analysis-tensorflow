Smelled this GREAT BBQ joint about 1/2 mile down the road on Tegner Street. We immediately doubled back and tried to find it! Well thank goodness, because it was well worth the stop! My friend had and loved the pulled pork sandwich and I had the brisket sandwich. Also had sides of beans and cornbread. Everything was AWESOME from the service to the food to the small room's ambiance! Fits right in with Wickenburg's old west charm.

Looking foward to returning to try some of the other menu items, and possibly tackling the Hog Trough Challenge... 3 Lbs of pulled pork with sides of beans and coleslaw to round it out at 5 lbs even. If you finish in 30 minutes or less, the meal is free. Otherwise its 34.99!
