I took a friend out on a date here for their Wednesday night wine tasting earlier this summer. They were hosting some sort of political rally/party but despite being swamped and busy the staff managed to be VERY attentive to my date and I and once the rally was complete her and I were able to stretch out a bit more and enjoy the now-quiet and intimate atmosphere of Winestyles. They had a fantastic selection for their tasters of the month and the staff was very knowledgeable and helpful! It has been two months since that night and it appears our date night at Winestyles is all my friend can talk about! Now that the school year is back into full swing and we are both back in town we are hoping to become regulars and perhaps even members of the wine club!

Keep singing,
