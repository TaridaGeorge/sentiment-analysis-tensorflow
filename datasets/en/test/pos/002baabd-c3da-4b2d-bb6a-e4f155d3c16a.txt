OK if you are a baseball fan, this place is a museum with good food.  From the moment you walk in you are surrounded by baseball and other memorabilia.. bats, balls, pictures, overwhelming for my daughter.. famous for its baby back ribs, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  Half rack was $18.95.. daughter had a burger, $11.95.. service xlnt. For me this is the best baseball themed restaurant anywhere.  We saw ex-Giants and current Reds manager Dusty Baker in the lobby.. nuts.. love this place. Place packed during March for baseball spring training in summer pretty dead..
