Have to give this place a 5 star if only for the patience of the waiter explaining pretty much all dishes to a newbie to Japanese cuisine. He was able to recommend great menu choices for a non-fish eater and the food I tried was high quality and very tasty. The place is small, so a calling ahead or coming early helps. A great experience.
