Really fun place wit GREAT food!! We went here initially because it was featured on Food Network's "DDD" and now we go back regularly because because the food is fantastic and the service is aways friendly and efficient. Food that tops the list for us are the fontina burger, the pulled pork sandwich, the fresh beet salad, and all of the grilled pizzas (the veggie pizza is so fresh tasting). The grounds are beautiful and offers a calming atmosphere; almost zen-like. During the cooler months, we like to take a stroll through the garden after brunch/lunch/dinner. Joe's is high on our list of places to take visitors from out of town.
