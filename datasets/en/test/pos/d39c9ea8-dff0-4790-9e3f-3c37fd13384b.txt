Best gourmet burgers in town!  Love the small portions that allow you to sample a few different kinds, including a couple of exotic meats.  Every burger I have ever had there was delicious.  My all-time favorite sandwich there, however, is the short rib, which is more like pulled pork.  They have great spinach and artichoke dip and sweet potato fries.  Service is outstanding.  And they are only one of two places in Scottsdale that serves Four Peaks Peach Ale on tap.  Mmmm...that's it -- I'm going back TONIGHT!
