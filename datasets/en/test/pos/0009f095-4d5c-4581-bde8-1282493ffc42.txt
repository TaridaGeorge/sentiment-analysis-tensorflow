It's Rosatis.  True nothing will ever taste as good as Pizza (incl. Rosatis) that you actually get IN Chicago because of the water quality west of the Mississippi is fair at best, this Rosatis does a really good job.

The kid that took our order was pretty cool-chill.  Brought it out to us in ~15 minutes - piping hot!  The sausage at Rosatis is awesome.

We visit this location every time we come to visit Dad/Mom since they live in the adjacent neighborhood.

Tip - order extra cheese - it is so worth it...the grease dripping all over - esp. from the pepperoni.
