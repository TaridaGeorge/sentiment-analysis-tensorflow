While this place has some pricey items the home made treats and washing the pup is totally worth it. I love taking my girl to Wag N' Wash for the Mouse Heads! Really nice people and the brothers that own it are super. If you live around this place and have a dog you need to come in and support them. Oh, and try the mouse head for your four legged friend too!
