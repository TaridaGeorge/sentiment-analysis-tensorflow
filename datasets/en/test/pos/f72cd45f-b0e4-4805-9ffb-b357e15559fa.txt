Upscale/trendy but laid back bar/restaurant. Came here for dinner and loved it! The food was great, service was good, and it was fun to people watch... and also watch the basketball game. There was a DJ spinning some background music. 

Started with the pineapple infused house sake - very light, but tasty. We ordered the sashimi appetizer - sliced well & was pretty fresh. I can't remember everything we ordered but it was all really good. My favorite was one that came on big spoons - it was deliciousss! The Seared Salmon Special (seared salmon wrapped around spicy crab & avocado & topped with garlic ponzu sauce) was my other favorite. The price was not bad at all considering what you got.

Definitely one of the top places for specialty sushi rolls in my book!
