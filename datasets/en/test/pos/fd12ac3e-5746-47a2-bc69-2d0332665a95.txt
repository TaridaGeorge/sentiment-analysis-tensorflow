We love this place!

This is definitely our favorite restaurant. We make the trek from Mesa almost every weekend, it's that good.  Even with the skyrocketing price of fuel we don't mind.

Tottie treats us like family now, so welcoming and accomodating.  Even when we show up not long before closing we are given the same excellent service and food.  

The recent addition of the sushi bar has been great too, we never thought the place was lacking anything before they remodeled but they've gone from strength to strength.  

We recently stopped eating meat, but that doesn't cause a problem here as they have so many different choices and will gladly accomodate any special dietary requirements.

Great lunch specials during the week as well, this place has it all.
