I love Cibo. I've been here for lunch, dinner and take-out. They have never messed up an order or made anything less than perfect. It's my favorite pizza in Phoenix since I gave up trying to go to Bianco's. One order must be dairy-free and it's never a problem (no-cheese pizzas are a familiar order here). The nutella crepes are heavenly. 

I've taken groups, teens, family, etc., it's all good.

Don't go. I don't want to get stuck in a line.
