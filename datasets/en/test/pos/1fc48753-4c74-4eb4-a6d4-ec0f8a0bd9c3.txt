In customer service, there's really no such thing as being "overstaffed". This Walgreens comes pretty close. I've never seen fewer than 5 employees at any given time in such a small place. It's awesome!

This particular Walgreens employees a very friendly staff, as well. They are never too busy to help out in the event you need help.

Once again, I'm not sure if it's good or bad that I know this, but if you frequent this Walgreens enough, the staff takes the time to actually remember your name.

Top notch!
