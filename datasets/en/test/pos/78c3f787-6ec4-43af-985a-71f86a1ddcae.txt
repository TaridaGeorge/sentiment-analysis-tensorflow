I should one day try different dishes from here, but I just can't pull myself away from the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp! I about fainted after finding out how many calories are in this dish, like many others on their menu. But omg is it WORTH IT!! Huge portions that are good to the last bite! Always had good service. Not great service. But I don't come here for the service! lol
