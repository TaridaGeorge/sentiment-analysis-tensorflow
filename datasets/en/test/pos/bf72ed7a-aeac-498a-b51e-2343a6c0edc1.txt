The location: -2 stars. The restaurant is TINY, and located within a gift shop. That being said, the food: 7 stars. Almost every dish had perfectly-balanced flavors, and each was new, exciting, and utterly delicious. I'm afraid "fantastic"  doesn't begin to describe the flavor profile and depth of ingredients. The farm salad, in particular, was so good it left me speechless. And as an added benefit, the service is impeccable. Both the waitress and the chef went out of their way to make our experience amazing - and I am glad to report that they succeeded.
