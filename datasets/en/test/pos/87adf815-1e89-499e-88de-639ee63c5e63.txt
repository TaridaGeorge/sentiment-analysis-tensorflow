Had an awesome dinner at Fiorella's tonight. Great bottle of wine, so reasonably priced. I had soup (homemade, full of fresh veggies and white beans), he had the house salad (both come with the meal), also warm focaccia bread dripping with garlic butter. Seconds? Yes, please.

Entrees were delicious; I always try to take half home for the next day, but it was a losing battle. We both cleaned our plates, and went back for dessert (homemade tiramisu). All entrees are made "a la minute"  - in the pan, no Olive Garden steam table sauces here. Service was excellent, ambiance great (sat outside, beautiful night).

I am a reformed chef from Philadelphia, home of fabulous Italian food. He is from Boston -North End, no less. Fiorella's rivaled both hometowns for food and service. There is nothing as good as a chef owned restaurant.  We'll be back for sure!
