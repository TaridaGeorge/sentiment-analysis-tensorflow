I just love La Bocca. I have been here a handful of times for both lunch and dinner. There bruschetta is sooo good!! Most of them at least. The pizzas are definitely not the typical pizza they have different ingredients most places dont have. Everytime I go the service is excellent and the servers know they're wine selection. Good place to go with friends for a snack and drinks also a great date place!
