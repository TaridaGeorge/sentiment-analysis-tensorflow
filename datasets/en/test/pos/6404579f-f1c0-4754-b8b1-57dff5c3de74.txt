This Dollar Tree (DT) location in Fountain Hills is the best one out of the lot.   I don't normally go to Dollar Trees because the selection is so bad, but when I'm taking the 87 to Shea into Scottsdale, I make sure I stop by this location in Fountain Hills for the small necessities, like greeting cards, wrapping paper, and even makeup.  I really like their plastic boxes for organizational purposes.  I've bought food (like jam and cookies) also from this location, and have had no problems.

This DT location is very clean, and well kempt, which is unlike any other DT location.  The staff, particularly an elderly lady, is really nice and helpful.  I highly recommend this location over the others for values.
