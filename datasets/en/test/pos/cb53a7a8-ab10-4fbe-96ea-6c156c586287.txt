Really great burgers!!! Love all the options for toppings! Love the potato salad! Only dislikes: kinda sloppy (don't eat in the car!) and I don't like the roasted garlic because  you get whole cloves of garlic. Other than that it's wonderful! Go try it sometime and get their lemonade!

Oh also they've improved the speediness of their service since the last time I've been there.
