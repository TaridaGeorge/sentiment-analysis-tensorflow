My husband and I stopped in for happy hour on a Friday. The atmosphere is chill, the ambiance is classy, and the piano-playing topped off the great atmosphere. 

We sat at the bar. The bartender was great...very attentive. Their happy hour menu is fabulous - many happy hour menus have cheap wine that tastes like dirty socks...not this place...their wine was good.

We stuck with happy hour food and did not order dinner, so I cannot review their food, but if you're looking for an upscale yet highly affordable happy hour, this is a great spot.
