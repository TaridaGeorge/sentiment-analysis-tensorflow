I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place!!!

Ever since I discovered Oregano's I've never been back to Olive Garden. I think their food is fantastic and I've learned to try other things aside from their meatballs...ummm! Service is always, always, always fantastic! The servers are so helpful and friendly. I have nothing bad to say about this place. If you do come here...be sure to explore the menu.

One bad thing, but I can't knock a star off for it, is that the wait can be extremely long especially during lunch hours. I've waited an hour before and at other times, I've gotten lucky to get the last table available.
