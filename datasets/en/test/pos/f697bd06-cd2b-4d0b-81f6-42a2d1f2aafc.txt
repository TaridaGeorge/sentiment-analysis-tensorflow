Delicious homemade pasta and for only $4.99! I decided to finally stop by this place one afternoon as I drive by it often and I was in for a real treat. The pasta and sauce is pure yummy and satisfying. I will continue to return here. Candidly, the pasta meal I get here is better than the pasta dishes as the two or three dollar sign restaurants. Far better value, taste and fulfillment at Pasta and Sugo.
