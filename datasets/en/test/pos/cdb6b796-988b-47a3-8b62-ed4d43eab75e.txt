I just had my daughters 4th birthday party there with her school friends. It was just perfect. I was a little selfish in the choice, with knowing how delicious top-its gourmet cupcakes are. But all of the kids liked the "decorate you own" idea. Rachel and Emily are very accommodating. I hope that they continue to have a successful business. I know it's hard for small businesses sometimes. Get down there and treat yourselves. YUM!!!
