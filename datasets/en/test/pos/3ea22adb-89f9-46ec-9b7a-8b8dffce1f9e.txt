This is my favorite Thai restaurant yet. It's not your usual hole in the wall either, it's actually a pretty nice place with good ambiance. I highly recommend the Crispy Basil Chicken. It is FABULOUS! Sweet, crispy, and spicy. Beware of the spice level:
Mild
Hot (The heat the average person likes I think)
Very Hot (Pretty spicy... my fav)
Thai Hot (Too hot for the majority of people)
Chef Hot (Only for people who can bare the hottest of the hot!)
