The food is very tasty and the staff is very friendly.  There is a lot of variety and the atmosphere is very cozy.  It feels like a secret hole-in-the-wall place.  I can't vouch for the authenticity of the food, but it's extremely tasty compared to the handful of other Thai restaurants I've been to.
