A quality drink should take a bit longer than 10 seconds to create.  

The humble bar staff take their art seriously and their talents become fully evident upon the first sip of your perfectly executed libation.  These are real-deal bartenders capable of both perfectly executing the classics and experimentation.

A sampling of the jukebox: Siouxsie and the Banshees, LCD Soundsystem, Otis Redding, Bowie. 

Quality drinks, great music, non-pretentious non-brodawg crowd.  What other bars in Phoenix can you say this about?
