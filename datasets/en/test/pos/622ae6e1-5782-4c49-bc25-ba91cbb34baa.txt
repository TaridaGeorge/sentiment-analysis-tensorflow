The gold standard in froyo is Yogurtland. They have a variety of flavors in which you will find something that you like...and if you don't - then you should go to church and pray for your sense of taste to be given back.

1) Choc Milkshake
2) Dutch Choc
3) Blood Orange Tart
4) Dragon Passion Fruit
5) Milk Choc Hazelnut
6) Cheesecake

The flavors are great, everything you can imagine for toppings and the recipes are perfect.

This place is near ASU so you'll be bum rushed with college students if you go in the evening. They have top 40 playing in the background while you mosh with your fro yo. I'll study here sometimes because they have free wi-fi.
