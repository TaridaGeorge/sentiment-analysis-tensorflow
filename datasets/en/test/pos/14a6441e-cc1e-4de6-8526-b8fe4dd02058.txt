They did our cake for our wedding in 2008.  It was sooo good.  And what is awesome is you get a replica of the top tier of your wedding cake on your one, 5, 10 year anniversarys.  So don't worry about eating the yucky frozen tier from your wedding a year later.  You get a fresh one made just for you!  My husband and I can't wait for our 5 year anniversary and we get to enjoy our cake all ever again!
