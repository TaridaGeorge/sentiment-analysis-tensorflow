Looks like this meal may be the best of our trip to the west. Service was excellent, though I noted a full bus of people that came in before we left. That might have given the second seating some issues. But we were unscathed. 
   We did the chopped salad and it was good and creative. Creative is what best describes the fare. The pork belly rocked and the mushroom fry was nice, though a meal size would be too much. Jeff had had hamburger and whaoo! It was a 10 or close. A contender to Poag Mahone in Chicago!  
   We "guilded the lilly" with zeppoli and they were awesome, like mini Leonard's malasdas from Hawaii. Sweet!
