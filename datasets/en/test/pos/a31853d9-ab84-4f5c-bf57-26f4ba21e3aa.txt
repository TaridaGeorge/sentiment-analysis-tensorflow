LOVE this place!! After living in Arizona for THREE years and having no luck finding a good Thai place I stumbled upon this little gem. I almost didn't go in because it really looked like an Americanized little fast food place, however I was starving and my only other option was Peter Piper Pizza (YUCK) so in I went. The first good sign was that all of the tables were full and there were probably 10-15 people waiting for take out. It was very busy. We got a seat and order some Yellow Curry and Pad Thai noodles. When I bit into this food it was like angels were singing from Heaven. Truly fantastic food!! The prices are great as well and everyone who works there is super friendly. This is now 'my' Thai restaurant in the Phoenix area. I HIGHLY recommend Thai House!
