YUM YUM YUM.... did I say YUM? Everything about this restaurant is fantastic. I love the decor, the outside patio is the best. The bar set up is great and I love that the have an open kitchen so you can see your food prepared. The chicken nachitos with extra guacamole YUMMY! The roasted chicken outstanding! I love the chipolte burger! The mac and cheese is definately something to write about don't miss out on the MAC! I also love that they serve the Passion fruit tea. This is very good food at a very good price. I have only had bad service once, I think our server was new or at least I hope she was. Otherwise she was just a ding bat that couldn't remember to come fill our drinks or bring the extras that we ordered. Don't keep this one a secret!
