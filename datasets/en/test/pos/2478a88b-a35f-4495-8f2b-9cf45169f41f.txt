Ahhhh, Kyoto Bowl. I used to live around the corner from this branch and have many fond memories of walking there. My parents have ZERO tolerance for more adventurous food. My sister is scared to death of fish (because it once had a head, I know, the terror...). My mom knew of nothing else except colonial food (chicken, mash potatoes, etc.) so when I turned old enough to work, I would walk here in my efforts to seek different food. 

I learned to like California rolls, noodles and tofu here. They have hot, green tea for 75 cents. Not bad. If you want to eat healthy and don't want to pay dinner price and tip and you want simple sushi, I recommend Kyoto Bowl. The tinkling fountain makes it relaxing.
