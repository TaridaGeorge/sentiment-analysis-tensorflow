This is one of my favorite coffee shops. The coffee is great, the pastries are delicious, and the ambiance is perfect. One of the best things about Giant is the physical space itself, it's nicely decorated and the floor to ceiling windows along one side of the place turn it into a beautiful place to sit and contemplate the world.

Bonus = take a break perusing the goods at the small boutique next door.
