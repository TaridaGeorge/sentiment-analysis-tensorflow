Okay so a friend of mine knows the owner so I had been meaning to check this place out but never made it to there shop. To my heavenly surprise, a fellow associate brought in 3 dozen doughnuts from Bosa in today! 
Let me tell you, every doughnut I had was fantastic! I ate one in the morning, the second around noon, then my third around 3 and they all tasted delicious! I love this place and will go there at least once a month!
