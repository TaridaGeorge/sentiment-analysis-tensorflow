Love the yoga, love the instructors. The studio has an amazing feel to it, open windows & high ceilings with beautiful (yes, beautiful) duct work. 

I've seen on their website they are going to be offering a 300 hr yoga training, I am seriously considering taking this course to add onto my 200 hr, all of the teachers here seem very knowledgable & unique.
