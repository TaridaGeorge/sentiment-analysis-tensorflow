Lovely little place! It feels like the perfect place to take your Mom out to a nice lunch

I've had the Shrimp-something-something-Salad (it had avocado, goat cheese, tortilla strips?) It was great! 

annnnnddd I've had the chopped veggie salad- Also great! 

I kinda want to try all their salads now and pick my fav.
