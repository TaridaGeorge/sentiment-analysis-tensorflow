Amazing dinner at an amazing price!

Eddie was there, along with at least a dozen servers.

The food is just incredible - really it is - Eddie breaks a lot of culinary rules to our benefit! The service was impeccable, pricing very fair, and the food delicious. Glad to see Cook and Jacks went to a good cause.

Go Eddie!
