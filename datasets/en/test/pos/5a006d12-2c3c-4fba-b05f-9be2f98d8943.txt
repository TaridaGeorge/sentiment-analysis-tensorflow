The first time we stepped into this place we fell head over heals in love! It's got everything we've ever wanted! The place was clean for a buffet, the guys behind the counter were nice and laughed at my jokes, the yogurt was delicious and the variety of toppings was awesome! 

I would only change one thing about Zoyo, the availability of smaller cups. It makes for a hard battle of will power when the only options are large, and extra large.
