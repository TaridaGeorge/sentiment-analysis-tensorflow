We went out of our way to visit Fuego Tacos, since I bought a deal off of Groupon, and we were blown away. If you want to compare the pricing to Filiberto's or any of the low end restaurants, the price will disappoint you, but in comparison to other restaurants of it's ranks, the price is more than adequate! The complimentary chips come with an amazing salsa. The service was quick and our server was amiable. It is a very cute and intimate atmosphere, and I definitely loved that they had extra seating on their second floor. I loved the charcoal grilled taste of my carne asada burrito! It is definitely a place to visit if you find yourself near the Esplanade Theater.
