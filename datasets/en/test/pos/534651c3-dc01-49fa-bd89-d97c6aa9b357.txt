I am not religious, but I will be the first person to admit I thank God for this place--and the neighboring Windsor. Seriously... a latte, ice cream on a waffle cone and a cocktail all within feet of each other. Dear Lord, I have reached bliss. I can die happy now.

Some people gripe that the flavors are not strong enough. 
I prefer to gripe that they aren't open 24/7 because this is my bliss and damn it... I need it at all hours.

Always friendly.
Always clean.
Always awesome.

Yes, there is heaven.
