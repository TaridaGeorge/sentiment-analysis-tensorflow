Lovely family owned business...I have been here on many occasions, and I absolutely love their Frybread!

The shredded beef and roasted bell peppers are amazing!
Everything is made to order right in front of your eyes...

Ordering a taco is the perfect size for me, as I can never finish a whole frybread loaded with toppings, and they do load on the toppings!

Clean, Friendly and Fresh! 

Great place to dine in!
