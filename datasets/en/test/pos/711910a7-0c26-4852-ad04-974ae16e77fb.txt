The Chef's tasting menu ($98 version) provides one of the best culinary experiences in the Valley. The chef comes to your table, discovers your likes and dislikes, and then prepares a multi-course meal that is simply divine. The sushi is so good here it is an absolute travesty to muck up the taste with soy sauce. There is simply no other place in town that can compare. The robata grill is also fantastic. Expensive but worth every penny.
