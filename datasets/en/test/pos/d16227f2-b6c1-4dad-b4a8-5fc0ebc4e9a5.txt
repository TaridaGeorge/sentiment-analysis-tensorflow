When I moved to AZ, I was vegan and gluten free and had no idea where I would be able to go out to eat. I stumbled upon Pomegranate Cafe and tried the Lumberjack sandwich for breakfast and I was hooked! My mom and I had a new weekly breakfast place. It is also a great place for lunch. I wish it was closer to me!
