Loved the food, service and clean environment!  My grandma and I eat out every Tuesday night and she had coupons for a place called, "Culver's".  It had burgers so I was game.  We had double cheeseburgers, fries and drinks.  She also got the cement shakes, or whatever they were called and loved them.  The burger was really tasty and the fries were nice and hot!  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  It had a large, clean dinning area and seemed to be family friendly. They also had TVs for the guys!  I have already told several friends about this place and I only had it last night for the first time! I say that would warrent a "woohoo"!
