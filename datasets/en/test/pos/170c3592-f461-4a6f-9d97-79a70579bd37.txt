I found this business though Living Social on Facebook...I could not be happier to have found it.  Although my waistline will disagree!  The owners are friendly and fun spirited.  The cupcakes are AWESOME!!!  I know, you'll say...it's just cake.  NOT!  There cakes are amazing!  I went to another cupcake place; one that was on the popular hit tv show Cupcake Wars and was really disappointed...cupcakes were not cooked all the way and the frostings all tasted the same.  Top It is kid friendly and clean (until the kids get there) and there flavors are OFF THE HOOK!  I double dog dare you not to l ike their cupcakes.
