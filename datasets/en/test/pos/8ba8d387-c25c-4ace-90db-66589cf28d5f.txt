we love rudy's bbq from texas so on a recent vacation to phoenix when we saw billboards that there was a rudy's we were thrilled.  turns out we arrived in phoenix on rudy's grand opening day (4/5).  we ate there there on sunday 4/8.

we love the brisket, the chicken, the pork loin.  and the sauce.  so delicious.  everything there is highly recommended.

we bought a couple of bottles of rudy's bbq sause to take home.
