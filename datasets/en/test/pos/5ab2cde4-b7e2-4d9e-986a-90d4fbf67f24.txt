I recently discovered this market and it's  absolutely  amazing!! The fruit and vegetables are incredibly fresh as well as their meat section.  The banchan section has a wide variety and it hasn't been sitting on the shelf for days as what you see in asiana market in Mesa.  The lunch counter in the back is delicious!!!!! I love the kalbi stew and spicy octopus.  I will be back weekly!
