This place is almost identical to Sarku teriyaki, which is my favorite teriyaki place.  I think I like both because they probably use more dark meat than white meat.  Or it's the oil they cook in.  But both also grill your food when you order it and that's rare in the fast food business.  I usually get the teriyaki chicken (extra meat) with rice, veggies and a large drink all for under $10.  I don't think this is as good as Sarku, but close enough for me.  I'll be back a lot.
