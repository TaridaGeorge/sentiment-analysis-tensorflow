Every time I visit Beckett's Table the food and service are outstanding; but tonight the best so far. The asparagus app, pate, and pork osso bucco were all to die for! Cobbler for breakfast:) 

I think I have tried just about everything on the menu and have never been disappointed.  Great wine list, amazing cocktails, outstanding food and the best service in town! What else could a casual or serious foodie ask for? Best new restaurant in town!
