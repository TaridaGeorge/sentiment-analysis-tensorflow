Oggie's pizza is devine!  I've been to this location several times and each time the crust has been perfect soft, chewy, and you can even smell the yeast!  They have lots of fun topping combinations on the menu and their desserts are great too!  Be sure to check out their happy hour menu for good deals on food & drinks!
