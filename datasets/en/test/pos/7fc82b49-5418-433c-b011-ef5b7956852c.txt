The Sanctuary is quite the amazing resort. Everything from the service to the accommodations to the amenities is top-notch. 

The layout of the property is nice in that you feel like the only guests there. The smaller pools are great for a private swim (or poolside nap!). 

Overall, this is one of the best hotels I have ever had the pleasure of staying at.
