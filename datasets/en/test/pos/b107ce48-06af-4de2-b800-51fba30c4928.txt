Casey Moore's is like one giant house party but with much better people, and much better beer available.

The extra special vibe is due to its long/sordid history, secret upstairs breakfast room, weird Blarney Stone pee rock, inside dining nook, corner "beach"/lounge area, and hidden neighborhood location.

It wasn't until I got older that I had an honest to goodness dinner here, and that was f-ckin fabulous too. 

Everyone makes it to Casey Moore's at some point...and even after those college years have become a distant memory, you can still pop in for a pint and have an equally great time (just stay inside, and avoid the ubiquitous stumblers...)
