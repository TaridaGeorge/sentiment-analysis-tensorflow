Enjoyed the Veggie Bagel Sandwich today from Lox, Stock & Bagel.  I met the owner Michelle and she was very nice and made my sandwich just the way I liked it. I had the sesame bagel which complimented the whole veggie sandwich and gave it a nice flavor. I was also able to use the Yelp Offer for a free drink with my first check in.
