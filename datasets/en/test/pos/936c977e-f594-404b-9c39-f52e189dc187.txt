It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas! There are several events in Phoenix that remind us the holidays are here. Likely, none so much as The Nutcracker at the ballet! 

The children all dressed in their holiday best. Little girls with silver bows in their hair brimming with excitement for what is for many their first encounter with ballet. It's all so magical! 

If you have not seen this ballet, please, please, please, I beg you, do! Take your children too! This is a wonderful introductory to the art. There is something for everyone! Dancing, magic, smoke, toy soldiers, rats, snowflakes, and sugar plum fairies! 

Thank you Lindsey, Yelp, Ballet Arizona, and Symphony Hall for such a wonderful evening. My son and I could not be more grateful!
