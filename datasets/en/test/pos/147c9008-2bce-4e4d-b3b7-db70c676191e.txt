Excellent Sushi restaurant.  Pancho, the owner, used to own Sushi Hama in Tucson and relocated about 3 years ago and opened Mido Sushi in Chandler.  The Sushi is delicious and plentiful especially during his lunch specials. 

 Someone mentioned that he used to include a second salad but has since done away with it.  Just ask for it by name "Sushi Salad"  and you can get it at no extra charge.  We will travel to Chandler from Tucson on any given Saturday just to eat there.  Would highly recommend it.
