Durant's is a classic steakhouse that maintains its 1950's charm and atmosphere while server wonderful food.

I was in Phoenix for business and went to Durant's looking for a good steak and a restaurant with character.  I was not disappointed.  

The 50s are alive in the restaurant with the red upholstered booths and the red velvet looking walls.  Portraits and paintings line the booths.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable and the wine list if top notch.  You can't get a better filet.
