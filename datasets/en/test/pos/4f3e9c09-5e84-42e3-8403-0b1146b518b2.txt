We came here for the Mother's Day Brunch, and it was outstanding!  It was the first time ever that my 1 and 2 year old actually sat through an entire meal without screaming or having to be escorted out before the meal ended.  They played live country music during our meal, which captivated our toddlers.  The tiramisu was among the best I've had in the USA.  Their steak medallions were fantastic - medium to medium rare, tender, and not dry.  Everything I had at the buffet was great, but those two things really stood out to me.  My kids loved the macaroni and cheese, tater tots, pbj sandwich, ice cream sundaes, and cheesecake.  My husband enjoyed the medallions, as well as the prime rib. This is a great family restaurant, and the food was good, to boot!!
