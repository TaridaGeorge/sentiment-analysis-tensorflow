One of the BEST dining experiences I have ever had! I met friends for diner at Roka Akor on Friday night and it exceeded all expectations. The food was incredible, the service was exceptional, and the entertainment was priceless! There was an (unintended) fire in the open kitchen which set off certain sprinklers, created black smoke, and triggered the fire alarm. It was a Vegas-worthy pyrotechnic display that caught everyone by surprise. Our hospitable server, Eugene, handled it with class and professionalism...and the right amount of humor. I am already looking forward to visiting Roka again soon. 

P.S. The Black Cod changed my world for the better :)
