Having living in Philly for 8 years, Rita's arrival in Phoenix is nothing short of glorious.  My daughter and I waited oh so patiently (not really, but we had no choice) for their opening and now think we show great restraint by only going once, maybe twice a week...

If they have coconut cream ice, go for it, it's heavenly!
