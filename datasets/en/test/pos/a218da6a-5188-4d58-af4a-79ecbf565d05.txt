After my initial review, Jay, the owner, reached out and suggested I try the larger pizza which is a bit different than the lunch pizza. A couple of us went in today for lunch, and not only did Sean, the manager, take care of our whole meal for us, the larger pizza was great. Such good crust. Thanks guys!
