The buffalo carpaccio here is amazing.  It was an enormous plate with lots of delicious raw meat, crostini and blue cheese, and a big pile of greens to make me feel healthy.

The halibut was good too.  Less memorable than the carpaccio, though.

Next time I end up in the Phoenix area, I'll definitely come back.
