Excellent burger and you can get it as a lettuce wrap and skip the toasted bun. Comes with onions and with the basket of fries or yam friends served in a mini shopping cart you get great spicy mayo. Nice wine list, good beers and a modern interior that makes the place ultra hip. A long island counter space runs down the middle of the room with mirrors and photographs lining the walls. Greta experience.
