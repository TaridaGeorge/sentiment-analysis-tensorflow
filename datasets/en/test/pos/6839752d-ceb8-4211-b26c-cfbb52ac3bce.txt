I have had Wade come to my house several times during the past few years to help me with various ac problems.  I initially met him when he was assigned to me by my home warranty company.  Most recently, he came out on a service call after my warranty had expired.  My experiences with this company have always been excellent.    He has done some major work on part of my air conditioning system and the experience was a very good one.  Most recently, I found myself without ac on a very warm weekend, called them first thing on a Monday morning, and had Wade pulling up to my house by 10:30 that morning.  My ac was up and running again within an hour for a reasonable price.

I have always found Wade to be very professional and responsive and would highly recommend him to anyone needing his services.
