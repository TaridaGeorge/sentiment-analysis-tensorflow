This is actually a really good Boston Market if you ask me.

I have found the customer service to be excellent and well above my expectations on more than one occasion. One young gentleman named Trevor was very helpful and gave us some great information about catering for a special event one of the times we went. He checked in on us to see how the food was and cleared our table and made sure we had everything we needed. I was quite impressed!

The food is also always really good at Boston Market. The brownies are addictive! I love how the fountain coke always tastes really good here and better than it does at other quick restaurants. I also like their drink cups a lot!
