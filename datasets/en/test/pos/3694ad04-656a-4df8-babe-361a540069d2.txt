This place rocks! $2 Mimosas for Brunch!!  Food was excellent - I had the Island Eggs Benedict, but I'm fo sho any breakfast is good. Hiccup!  Sorry tad bit too much Mimosas...Anyhow, I like how the restaurant is open - they raise the garage doors and bam! Sweet patio and cool breeze - uh! Go before the summer cause it would be a bummer to miss out now and wait til Fall.  I haven't gone for dinner yet, but I sure plan for it.
