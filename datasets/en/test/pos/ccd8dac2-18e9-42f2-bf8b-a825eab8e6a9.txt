I WANT TO TELL YOU A STORY ABOUT THE BEST HOSTESS AND WAITRESSES  IN PHOENIX! THEY ARE AT ZINBURGER!! 

Danielle (the Manager) and the Hostesses and waitresses are the best. In fact...the last time I was there (tonight) we walked in the door...were seated and 2 minutes later...Danielle brought me my usual: root beer float overflowing with extra chocolate ice cream!!! Before I could even ask for it!! I wish I had taken the name of the waitress because she was wonderful too!

PLUS ZINBURGER HAS THE ABSOLUTE BEST HAMBURGERS AND FRENCH FRIES OF ANYWHERE I HAVE EVER BEEN TO...albeit...I have cravings every once in a while for in n out burger...which I give in to a few times a month! Zinburger is right across the street from where I live: A DREAM COME TRUE!
