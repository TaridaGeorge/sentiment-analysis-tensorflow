Be still, my heart! Today I have decided to be a baker/chef/whatever will make it appropriate for me to come to Penzey's Spices every day for the rest of my life. Folks, what we have here is the motherload of spices, nestled in the cutest darn shop ever. I love the seemingly never ending selection, and they have strategically placed recipe cards throughout the store for people like me who don't know the first thing about cooking. Brilliant! I bought a really cute little gift box with four different spices for my grandma for Christmas  for only $7.95, and yes, I'm serious. I am so excited to come back here soon soon soon!
