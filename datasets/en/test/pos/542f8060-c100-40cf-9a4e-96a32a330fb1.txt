I purchased this event for a fun neighborhood get together and it was a blast!  Brendan was great to work with and kept us informed on what we needed to know and do and all we had to do was peddle!  We booked our date and then a few days before the event he sent us an update and when we got to the Brat Haus, everything was ready to go.

Brendan joined in the fun and every stop thru Old Scottsdale was a new experience. The pubs greeted us and the crowds on the streets cheered us on.

We definitely recommend this as it's a fun time for all!
