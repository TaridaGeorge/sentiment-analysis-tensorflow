I will call "maui" one of my new favorite places to eat!!! CLOSED SUNDAY... which made me sad, BUT their menu is AMAZING!!  Shaggy slaw is yummy on top of a slider...or pretty much anything I'm sure...YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY TRY THIS PLACE OUT!!! Patio is dog friendly, A++ from me and my pup!! YUM YUM YUM
