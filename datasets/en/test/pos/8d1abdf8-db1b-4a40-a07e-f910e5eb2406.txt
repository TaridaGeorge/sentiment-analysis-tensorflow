this is a old dilapidated drive inn. 
that is 3200 miles from me right now and i would love to drive up and get a monster berger and fries. when i was a kid we would go to pete's before the drive in movie and fill up. who would think the best fried oysters in the middle of the desert. go once and you will be hooked.
