Arcadia Tavern is one of my favorite spots for Happy Hour! Such a great deal. From 4-7pm Mon-Fri. 
I usually get the Ahi Tuna appetizer ($10) and the HH chardonnay ($5). I also enjoy going in on Saturdays. They have half off all bottles of wine during the summer! I love hanging with friends at the bar, but they do have a great dinning room that is kid friendly. And always great service.
