I'm so glad by appointment with Nationwide got FUBARed. Had it not, I wouldn't have ended up at Dr. Schrolucke's. 

From the time I set my appointment, to the time I paid my tab, the staff was so friendly and nice, even good for a few laughs. The doc himself seems to be a down-to-earth kind of guy, and I felt entirely comfortable throughout the whole exam.

Their office isn't the sleekest or most modern. But it's comfortable and clean. I didn't have to wait very long for my turn, and the whole exam went rather quickly. 

Best of all, they didn't try to sell me some glasses I didn't need. Gotta love that kind of honesty.
