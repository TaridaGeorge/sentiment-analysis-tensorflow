From our entire family to your team - we want to say a heartfelt thank you for the kindness, hospitality, and generosity you showed us in our time of need. 

After my mothers passing, we chose Va Bene for a memorial dinner, and you handled it professionally, respectably, and delicately for us during a very emotional time. 

The food was unbelievable, the choice of wine (which we left up to you) was perfect, and the atmosphere was both warm and comforting. Thank you again for everything.
