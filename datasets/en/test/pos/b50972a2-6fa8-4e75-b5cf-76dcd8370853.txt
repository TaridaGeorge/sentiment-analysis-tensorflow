Had an AMAZING time here! I, of course, forgot our server's name.. I believe it was Matt thought, he was awesome! Really talkative and friendly, but not in your face. He suggested we get this side of corn which was fantastic! Both my husband and I loved the tacos and the chips. We also ordered a white sangria, which our server kindly gave us a tiny sample of the red sangria, which I will be getting next time. 

Overall great experience. Food was great. Service was great. Atmosphere was great. Price was great.

Loved it and will be back soon!
