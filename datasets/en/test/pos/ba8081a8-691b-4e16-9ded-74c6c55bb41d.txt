OK so it took a bit to find it.  I took Central from my place and then learned that it's only one way at this end.  No biggie.  Took 1st ave or St and got there ok.
Walking into the Ruby Room, you immediately feel at home.  The staff at the bar is super-friendly (and CUTE!) and easy to talk to.
The sound system was pretty good, too.  I was there to perform and can't stand a crappy sound system while trying to make people laugh.
The red walls give it an other-worldly feel.  Romantic, warm, foreign...that's how I feel there!
