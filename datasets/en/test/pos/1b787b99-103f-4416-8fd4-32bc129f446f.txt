Well, I got there in pelting rain, so based on the other review with inclement weather, it seems the time to visit is in a storm.  Must do something good to the kitchen staff, because everything was quite tasty.

Mad props to the delicious gyros - piles of delicious meat on top of a soft pita bread barely large enough to handle the mammoth pile of savory beef.  

No need to order extra tzatziki sauce, the amount given by default was plenty and unlike many gyros the meat was still tender and moist.

Love the crazy decor inside and the friendly staff just topped off the experience.  Would definitely recommend to newcomers in the area since I never would have found the place by judging by the sparse building outside.

This Jim *IS* crazy...crazy delicious!
