This is the forth and best Mr. Goodcents that I routinely eat at. It is by far the cleanest of the bunch (Clean like "very clean","my 1 year old son eats right off the table kinda clean") The others were all closed down over time, I'll miss them but this one is my favorite. 
The meat and the condiments are always fresh and the bread is so good. 
My Favorites are The original. The roast beef, the Italian and the turkey. Usually with onion, olive, mayo, o/v. On the original it has to be mustard and mayo with pickles. My wife got me stuck on that combo 7 years ago, and I get it the same every time. 
Never had a bad experience here. 
Who knows, maybe I'll go there tonight? ha ha.
