Probably the best burger in Phoenix in my opinion.  They use grain fed beef, which is a plus.  Their sweet potato fries are great too.  Delux is open until 2 although I've only been there for lunch and dinner.  This place is always busy it seems.  I went at three in the afternoon and it was still packed.  

The decor is hip and the waitresses were very nice and welcoming.  Check it out!
