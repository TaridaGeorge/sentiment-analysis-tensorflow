This was already my favorite spot in Old Town, but now that Jason Asher is there it should be 7 stars! The atmosphere is amazing, the drinks were at first good but now amazing, and the crowd is perfect. You get a few wannabe hipsters on the weekend, but its better than the Ed Hardy crowd! Casey, Kiki, Neil.... all amazing! Sundays here are the grown up from Metalhead crowd.... it's awesome! I should add that the Sunday promo puts out cocktails that rival anywhere in America, wether it's The Alembic in San Fran, or Death and Co. in NYC.....
