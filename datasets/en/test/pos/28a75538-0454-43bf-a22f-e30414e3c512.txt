What is not to love about the Phoenix Zoo! Everything here is so much fun.             You can walk around the Zoo or ride bikes. They have boats that you can rent and go all over the Zoo grounds.  Every type of animal is here.                                                         You can get a good look at all of them.  They do have food everywhere, and a really nice gift shop.  The best part i think is the stingray bay, You can pet the stingrays and the sharks.  You can even feed them.                     If you buy a membership, you can go any day, all day,come and go as you please. Lots of parking in the lot.   There are lots of fun events all year long. Love the Zoo.
