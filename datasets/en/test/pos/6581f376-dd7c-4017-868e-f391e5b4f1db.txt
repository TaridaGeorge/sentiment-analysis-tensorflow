This business is wonderful. I found out the founder may be retiring last year so took in an 80 year old family heirloom mogul lamp to have it refurbished for my wife's birthday. They fixed it up as good as new.  Today I found the mogul light bulb burned out. I got a new one there. When I got home and tried  it - it burned out immediately. I took the lamp and the bulb back to the shop. The fellow that works there checked both out and replaced the bulb at no cost. He also gave me some free advice about a problem ceiling light. This business is just.irreplaceable
