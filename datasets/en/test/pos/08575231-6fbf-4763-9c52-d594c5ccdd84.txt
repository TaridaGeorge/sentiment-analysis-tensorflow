I had gone to The Elephant Bar a few times when I worked at the mall and I always enjoyed the atmosphere and food. Then a couple of months ago I took my boyfriend, who had never been , and he fell in love with it! Now it is one of our go to spots. No matter what you are craving, or if it is a night when you just can't figure out what you want, as soon as you sit down and look at the menu, your appetite suddenly arrives! I love sitting in the booths that look like train cars - it is just a fun place to hang out and have good food and good service. I know we will be back.
