Beer-battered mozzarella sticks (light crispy batter/AMAZING) and Pizza cheese steak (with stacks of pepperoni/AWESOME) and Kronenbourg on tap with a great juke box, a fun relaxing atmosphere, and outdoor seating if you need to smoke.

I love this place for a date, for a group of friends or to watch the game.
