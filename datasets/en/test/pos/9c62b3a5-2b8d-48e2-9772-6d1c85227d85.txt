I haven't met a donut I didn't like here at Rainbow Donuts.  The old-fashioned donuts, chocolate bars, and french crullers are my favorites.  They even make croissant breakfast sandwiches, which also hit the spot on the mornings that we come here.  Don't bother with Dunkin Donuts if you want authentic donuts at great prices.  The service has always been great and the young lady who works here is always smiling.  :)
