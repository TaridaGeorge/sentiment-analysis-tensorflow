We came here on a Friday night after the recommendation of one of my husband's colleague who's quite the foodie. The host recognized that we were in "date night" mode and got us a table upstairs away from the bar scene and loud music. The ambiance upstairs was great. Later in the evening, someone from the restaurant came by to see if we needed our parking lot ticket validated. We had completely forgotten about it at that point and were thankful for the reminder and their great customer service.

We were both very happy with what we ordered. I loved the shrimp tacos. A word to others who are sensitive to spicy food - make sure to ask your server about the spiciness of some of the items. Everything there was delicious 

Make sure to save some room for the churros/chocolate dip dessert.
