Fantastic interesting food. The first time we went the kitchen shut down before dinner due to a tech issue. But they gave us vouchers for free dinner so we went back and had a great meal. Kudos for great food but more importantly appreciating your customers and making them happy. Although the kitchen issue was not the restaurant's fault, they made the effort to compensate us for our time!!
