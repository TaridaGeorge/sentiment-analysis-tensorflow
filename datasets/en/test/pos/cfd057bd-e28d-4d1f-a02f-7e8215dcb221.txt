This place is an awesome place for happy  hour food deals.  Their drink specials are decent too . . . . but the Chorizo mac and cheese!!!  I dream about it.  The sauce is a bit soupy and there isn't a ton of chorizo meat its really more for flavor, but to me its perfect.   Spicy, cheesy, and yummy all in one dish for $5.  So their happy hour goes (I think) from 4pm-8pm every day.   They have a lot of $5 options for food, and all hamburgers (made with yummy pretzels buns) are $3 off.  Warm Brie, nachos, guacamole and salsa for 3.5 and there is TON of guac.  I was shocked when I saw the portion.  Go here now before they raise their prices and change their happy hour menu.
