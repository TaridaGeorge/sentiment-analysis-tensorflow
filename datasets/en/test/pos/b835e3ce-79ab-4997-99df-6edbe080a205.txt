Guy Fieri's recommendations never disappoint. 

Came in with the expectation that this place would be good considering it was on the Food Network but my expectations were exceeded! Had the Salami Scramble which was DELICIOUS! The side of hashbrowns were AMAZING (maybe the best part of the meal) and I was pleasantly surprised the side of toast was a legit piece of bread, like something you would find at a bakery, and not just a slice of bread you could buy at the market. Eggs were fresh and light and the salami was perfection. 

Only downside was that they made us wait outside for our table which was a little ridiculous considering it was 115 degrees outside. But I got nothing bad to say about their food.
