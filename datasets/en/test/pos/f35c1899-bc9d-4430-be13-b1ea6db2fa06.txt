This is by far one of our favorite parks.  Have you seen the covered jungle gym?  It is awesome!

We love coming here.  My son could play here for hours.  We also ride our bikes along the path.  You can stay on the paved walkway or follow the dirt trail that would lead you along the perimeter of the park.  

There are several huge ramadas and smaller ramadas around the playground to reserve for parties.

The recreation center is beautiful.  So many classes are offered here.  They even do family events several evenings a week!  All kinds of activities for toddlers, children, teenagers and adults!  Check out the website for more info on this.

Come summertime, if your kid is bouncing still off the walls in the eve, take them here to tire them out!  

I highly recommend this place.  Just don't tell too many people!
