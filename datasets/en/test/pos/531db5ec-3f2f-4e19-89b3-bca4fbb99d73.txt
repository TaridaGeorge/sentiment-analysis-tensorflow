Dr. Steen is the fourth dentist I've seen since I moved to AZ about 10 years ago, and the one that I'm by far the happiest with. 

The office is modern and clean, the staff is friendly, and Dr. Steen is extremely nice and patient, and he takes the time to carefully explain what is going on in as much (or as little) detail as you want.
