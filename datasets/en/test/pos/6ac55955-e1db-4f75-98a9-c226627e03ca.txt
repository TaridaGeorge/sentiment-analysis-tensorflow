These folks could have taken me to the cleaners - since I had no clue. 

I was using the wrong key - which only opened the doors, but would not turn over 
the engine. I thought fuel pump, electrical, fuse, etc. They kept my truck for a few 
days to replicate the problem in the shop and no luck - since I gave them a good key!! 

They towed me twice to the shop and tried everything to no avail. 
As a hunch, they asked about the key and ZAP - I remeber I switched my key. 

They charged me almost nothing for the towing, diagnostic work on the car and 
resetting the theft deterrence system. 

This act of honesty and thoroughness could not come at a better time - going 
through a rough patch - economically. I owed them a least a positive review.
