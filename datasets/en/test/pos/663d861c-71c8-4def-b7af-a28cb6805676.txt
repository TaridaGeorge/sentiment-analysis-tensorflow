The chopped salad with salmon and the potato cream cheese soup is one of my favorite meals. Chopped salad consists of wild Alaskan salmon, arugula, Israeli couscous, feta, red peppers, dried sweet corn, dried cranberries and sunflower seeds served with Pesto Vinaigrette.  It is my favorite salad... And with every order you get a  couple pieces of the famous WF bread - dip it in the soup...  excellent!  They are always quick to put together a take out order. Delicious food. Oh, and great carrot cake also... Always consistent quality.
