This is my neighborhood grocery store!!  I love coming here and typically come about every other day.  They have good produce and excellent meats.  They also have the best beer selection out of any grocery store I have been to.  It rivals Papago.  The folks at the counter are also very nice and talk to you as you are checking out.
