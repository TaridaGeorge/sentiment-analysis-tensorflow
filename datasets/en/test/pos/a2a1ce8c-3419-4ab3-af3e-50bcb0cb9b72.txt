I actually ate here a few weeks ago with my manager for dinner. First time here and it was delicious. The portions were huge and the price was right. I believe we had the brushetta for appetizers but can't remember what I had for dinner. I do remember that I had the Butter Cake for dessert and that was YUMMY! Yes, it probably was made out of a whole lotta butter, but it was delicious. 

My manager was here the night before and some of our co-workers come here every time they come into town. I thought it was a great atmosphere with people and ate some great food.
