The Tav has been my favorite choice since they opened! The food is amazing, I have never had a bad meal. The service is always impeccable, the staff truly makes you feel like one of the family and they remember your favorites. It is a family friendly place but they do a nice job of keeping the kids entertained in the game area which is separated from the bar area where I prefer to hang. Great place to watch sports and share time with your friends!! The management and the owners have no problem mingling with their guests and making us feel so welcome and at home. Thanks to all of the Tav peeps for a fantastic place!
