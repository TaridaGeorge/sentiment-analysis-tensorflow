I wish we had one of these in Los Angeles. It's the best store ever. I always find the best designer deals here. Things I've purchased: Michael Kor's suede stilletos, Stuart Weitzman heels, tall egg shells boots, tall black suede boots, and tons of other goodies. I was just thinking about how I wish they were here in LA.
