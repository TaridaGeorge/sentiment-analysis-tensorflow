Authentic Japanese
Service is great: quick and friendly!
I have been here a few times and the fish always tastes very fresh especially for being a sushi place in the valley. 

I always enjoy getting a seat at the sushi bar so I can talk it up with the chef.
for the adventurous: Ask the chef to make you their own specialty dish, my taste buds have never been disappointed!
