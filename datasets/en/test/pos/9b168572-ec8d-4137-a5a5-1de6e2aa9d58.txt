I recently had the pleasure of staying at this hotel for a 3 day conference for Women on the Move.  The staff went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of. They even brought us "Smores kits" to roast by the pool at the fire pits!  They truly understand customer service.  We can't wait to come back.  They have a free shuttle (Red Cadillac Escalade) that can take you locally which was a big help since many of us needed to run out for things during our stay.  The property was exceptionally clean.  The rooms were recently renovated and very large.  I had a ground level room by the pool and it had a great patio with chairs to sit outside.  Only complaint was hallway noise during evening hours but it was not an issue.  Food was great!
