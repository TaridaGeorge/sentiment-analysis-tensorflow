Had a great night here with my boyfriend and new friends. First time and it was amazing. Food and service was above and beyond what I expected. The place is out of the way and looks dodgy from the outside but very warm and pleasant on the inside. Kinda pricey but worth it. 
We tried the London Broil and it was tender and well seasoned. Also had a "Envious Passion" martini....it was radioactive green and was sensational! 
I recommend this place for anything from hanging out with friends or family to a romantic dinner. Well worth it.
