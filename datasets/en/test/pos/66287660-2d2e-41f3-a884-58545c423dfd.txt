No need for one more excellent review of this place, but I'm gonna do it anyway. After much ado & buzz over the last few years, I finally made the hike (and believe me, it's a 45 minute jaunt from CenPho) out here today for a client meeting. Wham, bam, thank you Joe -- I'm a fan.

Excellent food.  Killer restrooms.  Awesome pressurized condiments.

Oh, and they give you a $10 credit towards your meal on your birthday.  Cool!

150% excellence.
