In 2008, I was married at the FireSky Resort and Spa. I fell in love with the resort years ago after visiting the grounds at night - gorgeous lighting, lush greens and great atmosphere. I love the resort for its super cozy feel while still maintaining a trendy look. The fire outside is gorgeous, especially at night. 

The pools are gorgeous and fun. The rooms are very cute. The location is close to a lot of great amenities. Food is great. 

I have also visited the spa - which isn't all that large - so you don't get the day spa feel, but it is a nice little spa. 

This place obviously holds a special place in my heart - it is amazing.
