I've been a fan since I lived in L.A. It's a good thing it's in the opposite direction from work to home or it would become an addiction. I love the animal style or when I'm feeling good the protein style burgers. I like the way they make their fries and when I'm feeling really bad I order my fries animal style. I've never met a worker there that didn't look like they were enjoying their job. They all have great attitudes.
