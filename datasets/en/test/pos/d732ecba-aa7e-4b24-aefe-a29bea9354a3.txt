I went there for the first time on Tuesday.  I had the lunch special of Salmon and side salad.  My friend had pasta and meatball.  Both items were wonderful.  The service was excellent.  The owner kept checking on us.  The restaurant is beautiful, and the restoom was clean and nice.  I will go back.
