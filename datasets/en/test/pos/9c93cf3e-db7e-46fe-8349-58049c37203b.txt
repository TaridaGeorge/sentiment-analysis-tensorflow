Best damned Lasagna in Scottsdale, and probably in Phoenix-Metro.

I think the secret is the sauce - same sauce that goes onto their awesome spaghetti.  Really, really good.

This is by far the best little pizza joint I've visited.  

The pizza's pretty good too, but for goodness sake, eat the lasagna!!
