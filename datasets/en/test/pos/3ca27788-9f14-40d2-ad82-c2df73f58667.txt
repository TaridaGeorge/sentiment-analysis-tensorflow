I wandered in after coffee at Copper Star next door and I can't believe I hadn't been here before. I adored it. Even though it is jam-packed full and cramped, almost slightly uncomfortable, I think it makes me like it even more, like it is busting at the seams with music!

So much vinyl, I can't wait to bring my dad here when he is in town next month, he will spend hours going through their huge selection to add to his stereo room. The staff seems super friendly and knowledgeable.  I bought a used Sergio Mendes cd for $6 in great condition.. and better yet "Pillow Talk" with Doris Day & Rock Hudson for $1.50. It doesn't get much better than that!
Such a cute area, I don't know why I don't spend more time on Melrose.
