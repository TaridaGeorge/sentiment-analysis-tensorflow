Steve and Russ are AWESOME. I took my 2003 Lexus to the dealership and they told me I needed all new rotors because they were too warped to  be fixed and new brakes for around 700.00. I then took it to Steve at Midas and really all that was needed were new front brakes and the rotors trimmed and turned  or whatever they do to them and I was set to go for less than  quarter of the price. My car drives smooth as butter with no shaking. It's good to know that as a woman I can go to Steve and KNOW I will not get ripped off. THANK YOU GUYS!! you're the best!!!
