Great, great local business. I eat here at least twice per month for breakfast. Went today for lunch for the first time. Arrived at noon. Placed was packed, which I was happy to see. I assume most people were still diving into breakfast/brunch fare.

Opted for lunch type food. Ordered the Mucho Smoocho. Very good roast turkey sandwich on grilled rye bread.

I will be back tomorrow for breakfast. Love the pancakes and the staff. Owners are amazing.
