This subway is one of the cleanest, and most efficient subways I have EVER been to.  I've only been in the evenings, but I have to say every time I walk in, someone is always cleaning something.  Their employees are friendly and the food under the glass is fresh looking and appetizing and in their own bins.  Sometimes you can go to a subway and the prep area is a wreck. Thats what makes this Subway so great. Everything is in it's place, and orderly and makes you feel like they take pride in their work.  Absolutely I will go here again, and I can't say that about many Subways unfortunately.
