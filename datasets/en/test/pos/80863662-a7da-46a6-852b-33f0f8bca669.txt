Out of all the times I've been AZ (not to mention living there) I'd never even heard of this place or been taken here (yay for visiting and parents wanting to feed you)!

Everything is fresh and healthy and being that was I going for vegetarian at the time I had plenty of options. After a pain-staking decision I went for the Veg'd Out. AMAZING. I practically licked my plate. (Luckily my parents raised me better than that. In public at least). 

The service was friendly and most efficient and the food was delicious; definitely an improvement over the usual breakfast places I generally get dragged to! 

Bonus points for the humorous menu..I'm such a sucker for menu's with a sense of humor.
