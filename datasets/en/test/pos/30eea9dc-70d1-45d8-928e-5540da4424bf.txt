Really enjoyed this place. Prices were very fair and food was great. I heard about this cat that hangs around there, and as soon as we got there she greeted us. As we walked through the entrance, not sure of where to go, it was almost as if the cat was leading the way. We sat on the patio which was really nice. Mozzarella (that's what they call the cat) came and sat on my girlfriends daughter's lap. We hadn't ordered yet so it was ok. Then the cat left to the grass and allowed us to enjoy our meal.
