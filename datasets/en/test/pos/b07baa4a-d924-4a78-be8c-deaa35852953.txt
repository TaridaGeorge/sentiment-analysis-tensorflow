This has got to be one of the best churches I've been to.  During my travels I definitely get a little nervous about visiting another church for mass.  I cannot stand judgmental churches and was looking for a place near our hotel that would not be.  

This place was far from judgmental.  While the congregation may appear to be older and more conservative, they were incredibly lively, welcoming, and friendly.  Before the mass starts, they welcome visitors and everyone greets each other beforehand.  The music is amazing and they even had one lector who was a radio announcer (made for an excellent reading).  

While there, they had a presiding priest who gave a great and funny homily.  

All in all a wonderful and welcoming congregation.  If I'm ever in the area again and needing to go to mass.  I'll definitely put this place at the top of my list.
