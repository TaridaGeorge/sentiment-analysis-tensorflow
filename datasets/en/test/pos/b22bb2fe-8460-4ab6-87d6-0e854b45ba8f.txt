Do not eat here if you are on a diet. Eat here if you want some damn good chicken and waffles! The food is rich and delicious. 

I love the combination of sweet and savory. Also try the mac n cheese and sweet tea. So good! 

You'll need to be patient because this isn't fast food. It's fun to sit here with friends if you have an hour-and-a-half for lunch.
