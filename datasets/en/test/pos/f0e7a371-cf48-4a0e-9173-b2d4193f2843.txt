I like the Candy Addict. It has the best selection of bulk candy anywhere around - and good stuff, not silly childish stuff like the Fuzzgigz or whatever in the malls. They have a great selection of older candies as well. It's a nice treat after lunch there to get a little bag (have to make sure I don't go overboard) for snacking on.
  The staff is always friendly and the facility is laid out pretty we-- and is easy to browse.
