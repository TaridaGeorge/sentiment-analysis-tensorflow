Fantastic Restaurant!
Excellent atmosphere... less casual than dressy but not entirely dressy.
Polo and Khakis is prevalent. A dress shirt and dress pants is about the end point for the dress code.
 Excellent place to hold dinner conversation as it's not noisy. 
Excellent menu choices. The made a great Filet for me. Even the Baseball Sirloin looks good.
This place isn't meant to be a get in/get out eatery. You go here so that you can enjoy a good time with some friends or business associates over dinner.
