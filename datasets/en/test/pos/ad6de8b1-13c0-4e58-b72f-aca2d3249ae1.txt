I like this shop... lots of assorted modern and silver age consignment availability. Prices are strictly based off comic price guide. The owner is a nice guy and knows his stuff. They have different supplier than most other comic shops in the area. The store is well laid out with lots of decent deals. The store has an old used bookstore smell and nostalgic feel to it. It carries most new stuff on more limited basis than some other shops in the area. The best value of this shop is based on its consignment deals. No complaints here.
