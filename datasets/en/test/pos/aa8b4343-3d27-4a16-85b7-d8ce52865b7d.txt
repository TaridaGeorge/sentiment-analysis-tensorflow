This one's a keeper!! Not only is Dr. Clifford awesome but his entire office staff is great as well. From the first time I came into get my teeth cleaned I was greated by the receptionist by my name. wow, what business does that these days!? While I was getting my teeth cleaned Brooke was very easy to talk to and made the time pass quickly- well as quickly as it can when a pair of hands are in your mouth!! 

But honestly the office is very welcoming and inviting in presentation as well as with the workers. They even set up a treatment plan that maximized my insurance benefits. I am very happy to have found Dr. Clifford and his amazing staff.
