I have been visiting this location for years. At least since 1996 or so. Anyways, this restaurant really does seem to get better with age! The salads are awesome, and large enough to split among a group.

The pizza is outstanding, especially the thin crust specials.

And they have Hop Knot (from four peaks) on tap.

What more do you need!
