I'm not sure I want to share this place...  dark moody lighting, great booths, downtempo beats, and the drink bible.  What more do you need?  The crowd is hit and miss.  Some nights it is totally mellow and other nights it is packed.  But it is always interesting.  Definitely one of my favorite bars in Scottsdale.
