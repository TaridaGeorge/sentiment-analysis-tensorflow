I Loves the cool music and very clean bathrooms. The photographs on the wall are beautiful and add an interesting connection to our history. 
The appetizers we ordered were fantastic. We had the Griddle cakes and the spicy Hummus appetizers !
Hamburgers: the blue cheese and the PCG burger were delicious. The beef was excellent and the sauce was great!
The pot Roast with bourbon gravy was excellent.
The portions were big and could easily be shared by two.
The Rib eye steak was large and very delicious.
We also liked the flavorful mashed potatoes. 
Service was very good!
I will be back soon !
