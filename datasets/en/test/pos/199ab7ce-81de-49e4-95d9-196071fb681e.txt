this is the best little pizza joint in tempe. located right on mill ave., it is now open LATE. they used to close down pretty early, like 10 or 11, even on weekends. so when the BF and i saw the line snkaing out of it while walking to the car from rula bula after last call, we were STOKED!
it took like 20 minutes, but it was worth every second. the pizza hails from Boston, and is thin and crispy - i'm partial to the feta/tomato.
a few tables and counter space, a few more tables on the small patio. you order at the counter, pay at the counter and find your own seat. nothing fancy, jsut tasty Slices.
