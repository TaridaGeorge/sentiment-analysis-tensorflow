This place was awesome, the base for the soup were awesome. We got the combination and of hot and regular. The hot was a little too hot for me but  I guess I could have asked for it mild to begin with. The meat was soooo good, the shrimp puffs were amazing. We could not go wrong with the veggies and the mushrooms. The green tea cheesecake was very good too. The service was very attentive. I feel sad that the place was not busy but I kind of understand it with the weather being so hot, hot soup is not what one craves, but once we were inside, the place is cool and the food which is the most important thing was excellent.
