Always wanted to stop in and see what was the big hype about, I don't do a lot of make up or nails, but now that I am older and have that need to buy a certain shampoo to keep my locks looking shinny, I found this is a good place to get it.

I signed up for the discount card for coupons and mailers, and I bought my shampoo and conditioner.  Prices were better than expected and now that I know they have what I want, I will be back.  Good news, they got them everywhere even in Las Vegas, so I do not need to go far.
