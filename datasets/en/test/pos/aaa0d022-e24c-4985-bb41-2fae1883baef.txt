The food here is so tasty I can't stand it! I have probably been here for lunch more than a dozen times so far and will keep going back.  Their tzatziki is to die for - I could just eat that with pita any day.  They are always so friendly behind the counter and you get your lunch fast no matter how busy it is!  GO THERE!
