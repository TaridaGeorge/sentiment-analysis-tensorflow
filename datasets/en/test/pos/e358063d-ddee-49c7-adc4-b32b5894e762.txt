I've been to both the evening, regular service, and the mid-day dim sum.  Visited 3 times in total and was never disappointed!  The food is excellent, quality Chinese food and not just decent fast-food-esque Chinese.  Dim sum is also very cheap -for $20, 3 of us had plenty to eat and even took home leftovers.

The only possible downsides are that the dim sum is not a place for vegetarians.  Also, an Asian friend of mine was a little bothered that all the servers directed their questions to her and kind of ignored me and another white girl.  I blew it off because that was par for the course in Japan and I'm used to it.  It's not worth fussing about when the food is so good. :)
