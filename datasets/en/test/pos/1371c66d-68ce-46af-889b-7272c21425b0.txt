What's not to love about frozen yogurt with every imaginable topping available to add? I have never experienced such a fun, you make it how you want it experience! It is totally kid friendly, you can leave your artwork on the walls they provide, and they have outdoor tables as well. Be sure to ask for a yolove card (buy 9 get one free) and try out the liquid marshmallow on your yogurt some time...yummy! You can sample before you select your yogurt, and you pay by ounce..not as scary as it seems..I get a good amount of yogurt with lots of toppings for under $4.00. So be adventurous and give Yo Love a try..you won't regret it.
