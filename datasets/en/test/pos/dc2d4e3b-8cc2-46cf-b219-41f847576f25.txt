Aw, I love Civic Center. It's a great place bordered by great things!

The library, SMOCA, Old Town, and an array of nice restaurants, including a fantastic sushi restaurant. 

The park is beautiful. The "LOVE" statue perfects it. Oh, and the more recent addition of the "eye tests" (you'll know what I'm talking about if you see them) surrounding the fountains are interesting. The numerous sculptures and water features work together with the green grass and shady spots make Civic Center a marvel.
