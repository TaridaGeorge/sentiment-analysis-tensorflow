Best Chinese food in the valley by far...that is, if you like authenticChinese food.

Having lived in the South Bay Area and Los Angeles, I'm accustomed to hole-in-the-wall restaurants that offer authentic ethnic dishes... Wong's place is one of those establishments. Not only is the food great, but the price is just right also. And to complete the trifecta, the service will exceed your expectations. 

I recommend the sizzling rice soup for starters while garlic fried chicken or Hong Kong shrimp as a main dish.
