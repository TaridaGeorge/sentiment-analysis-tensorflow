The best help I've ever had in a Hardware store!  

This place is SWARMING with staff willing to help you. All of them wear goofy red Hawaiian shirts so you clearly know who is there for your benefit. The place is medium sized but they always seem to have two registers open, basically insuring that you are in and out in a very speedy manner.

I don't know why you would shop anywhere else ... nothing against Home Depot but I'm done with you. Service is king!
