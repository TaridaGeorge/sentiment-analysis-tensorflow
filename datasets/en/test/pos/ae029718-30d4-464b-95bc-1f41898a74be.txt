I just switched my insurance to Allstate and wow I was surprised how much money I saved.  I had Liberty Mutual for a long time but Ian over at this Allstate branch was able to really help me out and save some money with the multi-policy program for my home and autos.  Plus Ian is pretty cool since he is from England.  Cool personality and great service at this location.
