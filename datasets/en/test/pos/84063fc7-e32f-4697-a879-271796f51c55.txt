Words fail me. 

Lucky me had my first-ever sampling of FT brownies last year around the holidays. The selection and temptations were so wide, I didn't know where to start. Whatever the choice, you can do no wrong when you bite into a FairyTale Brownie. 

Seriously, if this is what fairy tales are made of, I hope my Prince Charming never shows up.
