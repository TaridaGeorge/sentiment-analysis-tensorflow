Truly a diamond in the rough! I am rarely in this part of Phoenix, and I was pleasantly surprised by Alessia's. The food was beautiful and delicious. The roasted vegetable appetizer was outstanding and the tiramisu is the best I've had in years. The atmosphere was warm and sophisticated and the service. . . outstanding! They stayed open late for us and were gracious and attentive when we were the last party in the restaurant. Our waiter was very knowledgable about the menu and wine selection and he was awesome! I live on the other side of town, but I would actually drive out to Mesa just to experience this place again.
