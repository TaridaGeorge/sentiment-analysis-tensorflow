This Is a Gay clothing optional resort type hotel it is clean and simple on the outside a lovely on the inside.
the owners are as nice as they get always helpful and accommodating.
it very affordable great hot tub and pool area my room as do all the rooms have full kitchen and its just a great way to spend a week or a weekend in a great private safe atmosphere.
no hanky panky on the grounds or seedy out door scenes but lots of hot men to meet. I was worried that it was not very well located but then again everything in Phoenix is spread out so rent a car or drive your own Lots of good place to eat and the local talent is not to be missed. have fun and thanks royal villa
