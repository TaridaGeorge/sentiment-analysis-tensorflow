Taliesin West represents perhaps the best tour I've been on in my life.  Dwayne, the guide, was animated, passionate, informative, and gave us more than 90 minutes of facts, stories, and intrigue about FLW and the amazing space the Taliesin West represents.

Based on my experience, I could not recommend anything but the 90 minute tour.  If you've driven our there, pay the extra few dollars (which supports good work, philosophy, and learning) and indulge your mind.

They feature several discounts for the 60 and 90 minutes tours, including those for seniors and active military.

Be forewarned; a large portion of the tour features the outside elements and on a cold and rainy day it can be a bit of a burden without proper clothes and an umbrella.  Even moving inside can be a challenge due to FLW's insistence on using canvas sheets for the roof.  Kick ass stuff!
