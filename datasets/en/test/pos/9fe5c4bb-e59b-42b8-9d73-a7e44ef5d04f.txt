Their prices are incredible. My boyfriend and I shared the chicken wings and Greek salad... both were delicious. I got a glass of wine as well and our total bill was about $20. The wings are grilled after they're tossed so they're less messy but the flavor has soaked in. So good. 

This place was packed on a Friday night but we were able to get a table right away. If you go at peak hours you may expect to wait a little bit for a seat, and don't be in a hurry to get your food. They had one server for the whole place when I was there. But, I knew this going in and wasn't in a hurry, so it really didn't bug me that much.

I've heard they have live music here too. I'm new to the neighborhood so I'll definitely be back!
