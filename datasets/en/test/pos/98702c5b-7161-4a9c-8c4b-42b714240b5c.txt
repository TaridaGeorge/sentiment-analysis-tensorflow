This is my kind of car selling experience!  I walked in at 1:50pm and was immediately approached by Lamar who asked how he could help.  I told him I was interested in selling my car and wanted to see what I could get for it.  He sat me down and thoroughly explained the appraisal process.  I answered 4 or 5 questions, and the appraisal was underway.  

20 minutes later, after a quick tour of the facility, my appraisal was done.  I was VERY happy with what they offered - it was about $1000 more than I what I expected for my 2004 Rav-4.  From start to finish, the whole thing took about 30 minutes and I never felt pressured to buy a thing.  Kudos to Lamar & Carmax!
