Love this place! Went here for my boyfriends birthday and it was such an experience! We got the six course menu, but we probably should have gotten the 4 or 5 course because they gave so many extras, we became full really fast. Their courses were so inventive, fun, and delicious!!! We'll definitely come here again for a special occasion!   I can't pick a favorite dish because everything was so unique and delicious!
