I'm a grad student who loves studying in coffee shops, but prefers tea. My favorite brew is the Mighty Leaf Green Tea Tropical. I have searched for months to find a cafe that serves anything even similar...and discovered today that Fair Trade stocks the real stuff. My life in Arizona is now nearly complete. (Now if only the girlfriend would visit from Cali more often)
