So NOT a dive bar. More like, a swanky basement bar from the 60s. Big black pleather booths, pool table, low ceilings, and a hefty wooden bar with a formica top.

I can't comment on the nightlife. I tend to wander in during the late afternoon, especially on Sundays. That's the way I like it chill, quiet, uncrowded, I get the bartender's full attention, and can rule the jukebox.

Also, word to the wise, if you are a bit of a vintage cocktail geek, such as myself, make your way to Shady's - NOW. They have all the necessary ingredients, and -- depending on who's behind the bar -- expertise needed to craft the obscure old cocktail of your choice.

Seriously, housemade grenadine and simple syrup, Aperol, Lillet Blanc, Maraschino; you name it, they have it. Cheers!
