Phil is amazing and know exactly what and how to cut a guys hair, i HIGHLY recommend this place to any guy looking for a great barber! Prices are perfect, the place is super clean and has great stuff to look at on the walls while you wait but the best part is Phil...his ability to cut your hair and make you actually leave happy and not wondering whether or not they did something wrong....you won't have that worry here with phil, he knows exactly what and how to cut your hair! and also, he is so friendly and makes good conversation :-)
