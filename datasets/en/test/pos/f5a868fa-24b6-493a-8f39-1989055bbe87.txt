I love love love this place!  I go there everytime a visit  to AZ.  I wish there was one in my town.  It's the best vegetarian deli I know.  One of my favorite dishes are the tamales!  The portions are a nice size and Always delish!  Yolanda and Lydia are great they are always helpful and take good care of me and my family.  It's tucked in a nice little corner, there's outside shaded seating only but my kids like it like that.  We get to people watch and enjoy a great lunch!
