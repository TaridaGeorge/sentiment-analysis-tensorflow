My husband used to frequent the Maggianos in Chicago, and he got me hooked on the Scottsdale location. There is usually a wait on the weekends. But, like I say... good things come to those who wait. The food is great, and the service is exceptional. 

I love that they tweet, if you tweet that you are there for a special occasion they will send someone out to mention it. 

Spinach Ravioli is by far my favorite. The drinks are also great. You can go casual to dressy here and you will see all age groups. We typically don't take the kids along to this one, but I'm sure you could. They sometimes have great deals where you get to pick a meal to eat there and one to take home for a great price.
