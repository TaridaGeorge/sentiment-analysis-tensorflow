What a beautiful hotel! The Clarendon is truly one of a kind. The staff goes above and beyond to make sure you have everything you need...and extras :) The pool area is gorgeous and the atmosphere is delightful. I had the opportunity to meet the owner, Ben Bethel. What an astonishing young man he is! I don't know which is more impressive, his efforts to make the hotel as "green" as possible or the fact that he helps guests with their bags as they walk through the door. I can't wait for another excuse to stay at the Clarendon again!
