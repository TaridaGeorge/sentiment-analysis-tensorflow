I have yet to have a bad experience and have been there plenty.... I would take any person here even if they dont drink, the menu is unique and delicious... The Tuesday TV dinner is a fun thing to do on a Tuesday night and the price is right ($10).  The beer taps are ever changing so you always can expect a new experience..  There is a lot of pride in ownership, everytime I have been one or both owners have been in the building walking the floor.  The staff can sometimes be aloof but never anything too bad and something that will be worked out over time and experience... A great time!
