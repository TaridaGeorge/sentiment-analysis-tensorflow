Protein style well-done.....going, going, gone! Every time it's the same for me.....the grilled onions are a MUST! Just recently, I added the indulgence of Animal-style fries to the order. I'll never go without again! As for the chain, I know what to expect and am never disappointed. As for this location, I was greeted with a smile, given prompt service, and found a nice clean booth to have one of my favorite fast-food  lunches when visiting AZ.
