I've been seriously craving a delicious Cocopotamus Truffle ( a delectable chocolate truffle that is rich and creamy) ever since I visited Candy Addict.  They carry so many treats (new, classic, foreign) there is always something new to try!  I was happy to find they offer specialty treats like Milka bars, bacon chocolate, and a variety of Haribo gummies too.

Their staff is so knowledgeable, friendly, and willing to help locate your favorites amongst thousands of choices!  The store is conveniently located on Mill Ave, it's easy access to the light rail and just a few minute stroll from ASU campus.

I can't wait to go back soon! :)
