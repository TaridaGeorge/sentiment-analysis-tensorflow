Great food, friendly staff. I ordered a spicy pepperoni pizza and while cooking it they made the bottom too thin so the pizza got a hole in it. They came by to tell me it would take a little bit longer and offered to give me the broken pizza as well as the new one once out of the oven. My only question is: why don't they make any reference to their pizza outside the restaurant? You wouldn't know that pizza was half their business unless you went inside.
