What great service!  

I walked into the store and was immediately greeted.  I was looking for accessories for my ipod 160gb to hook up to my surround sound.  Not knowing what I needed to purchase, I was promptly attended to and the store associate was helpful.  I had no idea that you are able to do so much with the ipod!!  So after getting cables and a docking station...I walked out of there $110 later! But what was great was that I didn't need to wait online to check out.  I was able to check out with the associate!  I love modern technology (when it works )
