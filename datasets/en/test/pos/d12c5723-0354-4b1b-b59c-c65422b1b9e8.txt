Went back again this time as an experienced pizza-orderer.  I got a wheat crust pizza with red pesto sauce, mozzarella cheese, real garlic, black pepper, jalapenos, gyro meat, spinach, and a side of wing sauce.  One word --- AMAZING!  As you can tell by the majority of my reviews, I like pizza.  I think I am momentarily hooked on Pie Zanos, because I like pizza experimenting on the fly.  Enjoy!
