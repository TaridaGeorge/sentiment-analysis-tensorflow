Went here on NYE and loved it! We had a late reservation so we came early to have a drink at the bar. Awesome margaritas. We were seated pretty close to our reservation time which was good considering how busy it was. It took a little while to get our food but out server kept checking in with us to let us know that the kitchen was very busy. The food was excellent and very affordable too. And great service from the bartender (who was also our server) and hostesses.
