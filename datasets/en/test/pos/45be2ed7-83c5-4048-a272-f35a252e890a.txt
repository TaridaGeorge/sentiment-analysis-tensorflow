I've always been happy with Green Wasabi. One of my favorite sushi places.

I love their special rolls. Who wouldn't want to order the Climax? 

Their service is amazing. Their sashimi is one of the freshest I've tried. Mackerel is always fantastic. Tuna, salmon, yellowtail, it's all good.

I love that they have drinks other than sake and beer and it never takes more than 15minutes to get your food. I've tried almost everything on the menu and there's not one complaint that comes to mind.

Keep up the amazing work!
