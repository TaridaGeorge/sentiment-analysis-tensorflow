Scratch is solid. Upgrading to five-star review because of consistent service, consistent food and that stability counts for a lot in my book. Really like the salads and sandwich on the menu, my fiance is an addict for sure, and while I am not floored by the pastry/sweets offerings they are not bad for the price and location. Scratch has become a nice place to visit for the weekend and nice non-chain place to take out of towners for a brunch before visiting Scottsdale museums, etc, etc.
