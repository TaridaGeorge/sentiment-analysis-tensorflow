(Inside) ambiance was very nice for a large restaurant.  I had the blue cheese crusted, bacon wrapped filet mignon.  Ordered it medium and it was cooked perfectly.  Very, very tasty steak.  Also had the twice baked potato and that was very well done as well.  It was all what I expected for the price that your paying.  Very good meat.
