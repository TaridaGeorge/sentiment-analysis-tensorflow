I have been seeing Dr. Kim Lucas for over ten years now and am happy to yelp off on her excellent service. The entire staff is friendly, helpful and extremely thorough when it comes to diagnosing illness or recommending treatment. She employs all women which helps to create a more comfortable atmosphere when getting the dreaded yearly "well woman" checks. I have seen her and her nurses for numerous illnesses over the years and they are patient and understanding and quick to discuss options other than medication. It is really wonderful when they talk to you about your diet and/or herbal supplements rather than just prescribing meds. Taking a holistic approach to the overall wellness seems to be the primary focus. Whenever I leave the office I not only feel better, but more educated about my body. I would recommend her and her team to anyone.
