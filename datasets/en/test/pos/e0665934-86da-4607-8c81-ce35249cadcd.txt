I've hiked at Usery Mountain Regional Park quite a few times (and just learned more about it than I ever knew by reading David S. B.'s review).  It's kind of a trek from Phoenix, which you don't quite grasp until you have hiked up the mountain and see the Phoenix skyline far off in the distance.  I've never seen this place too crowded, though not many people tend to hike mid-June (or maybe they were just there much earlier than we were).  

I've seen wildlife here more consistently than any other park I have visited in the Valley.  A wide array of lizards from collared lizards to chuckwalas (I'll add photos).  I've even come across a rattlesnake or two, so keep an eye out!  And as with any hike, bring more water than you think you will need.  We underestimated our need and had to turn around prematurely....
