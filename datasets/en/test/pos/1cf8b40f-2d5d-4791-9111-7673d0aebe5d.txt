Absolutely top notch on all fronts.  Locally owned and ran.  Easy location to get to and very clean inside.  Staff is extremely polite and friendly.

Excellent pot stickers to start and I had the Pad Prik King with chicken, hot, for lunch.  Hot on their scale is quite hot, so be wary.  I shutter to think of what their Thai hot would be like.  All very fresh and flavorful, including the egg-drop soup and the jasmin iced tea.  

We finished it with sticky rice and coconut ice cream, which was a perfect foil to the spicy entree.  This will absolutely become a regular visit in the lunch rotation.
