This place is fantastic. It's a little family owned joint that is totally non-descript but has some of the best pizza around. My wife has Ciliac disease (no gluten diet) and they make a wonderful gluten free pizza. The get the dough from a local bakery and it is seriously good. The only negative I have is that its a little expensive ($14 bucks for a 10" gluten free pizza). Our servers have always been friendly and knowledgeable about the ingredients of the food.    

I will definitely be back!!!
