This is my go-to for Korean food. No place will I venture off to in search of a home cooked bowl of kimchee chigae. I would rather go to an actual sushi place for sushi but this place is the bomb.

Reasonable lunch specials during the week
Their kimbab is the best
The owner (Richard) is super nice and always personable 
Multiple locations! Everybody can be happy now!
