Had the privilege of going to work thee for a year and a half working for the Cardinals.  When you see the stadium empty, you really get to see what a magnificent stadium it really is.  Blows old Sun Devil stadium away by a long shot.  Recommend anyone to visit UofP stadium to see a Cardinals game or any other event for anyone living in the valley or visiting from out-of-town.
