I love Sauce, oh so much. Their food is always fresh and everything I have had there is AMAZING. They have great salads with large portions, their pasta dishes are to die for, and I always ask for an extra bread because its just really good. 

Great place for a casual date night, girls night or just want to eat some good food!
