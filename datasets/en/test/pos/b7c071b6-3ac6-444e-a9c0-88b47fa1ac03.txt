I have yet to be disappointed with this place!  This is a great new bar in Phoenix!    Happy hour is never a disappointment and the drinks are awesome!  The Pom is my favorite drink and it comes with a kick!  I haven't found an item on the menu I haven't liked.  I've had a little bit of everything on the menu.  The nachos are my favorite with the homemade chips.  The grill cheese was my best pick for dinner.  Bacon and pears was a fantastic addition to this sandwich.  Pair this sandwich with the sea salt & vinegar shoestring fries to complete the dish.  I can't wait to go back to try the Mac & Cheese.  This place has it all: great food, great drinks and an awesome atmosphere!
