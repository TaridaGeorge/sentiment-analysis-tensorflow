Friendly service and a really creative menu. Everything was delicious. Went in for an appetizer and ate that, an entree, and dessert. Eggplant and tomato salad was unique and my favorite item of the night.

Fun twist was all Arizona wines, which were very good.

This place was just GREAT, start to finish. I am still stuffed...
