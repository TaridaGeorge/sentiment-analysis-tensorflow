Shawna is THE BEST! We adopted a 1 1/2 year old mastiff who had never been trained before. We took Shawna's beginner's class and quickly learned how to train our stubborn dog. He went from being pretty unmanagable to a (mostly) well-behaved dog, with Shawna's help. I have referred friends to her, and I'd highly, highly recommend her. She knows great tricks and tips for each breed of dog and she quickly had Toby eating out of her hand (literally!!). Shawna's classes are extremely effective - I wouldn't go anywhere else. She's great!!
