THE only go-to Chinese place in the valley.  Really, everything thing about this place is wonderful. 

Every bit, of every chicken dish I have had here has been tender white and the good parts of the dark meat and so fresh the little boxes will honestly get a little too hot to handle at first.  The rice is always fresh tasting and stores so well, its unbelievable. The people are friendly and we (the wife and I) have never once been disappointed.

Love ^_^
