They helped me (FREE) set up my laptop so I could stream Coachella. They are so helpful here and its always free. Whatever 2000 or 3000 more you pay for a computer seems really worth it to me as I have been in the store getting free help and free tips and polite customer service for 2-3 years. I recommend and LOVE apple. I just signed up for unlimited texting on my iphone...and they threw in free mobile to mobile where as last year that was an extra 20.00   Haters I dont know what to tell you, I am a happy happy Apple customer!!!
