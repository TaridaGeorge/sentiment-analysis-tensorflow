My dog loves this store as so do I ! It is in a perfect location right on Camelback road near 7th Street. Although the store is on the small side, the selection of healthy and natural dog food is amazing. The owner is soooo nice and will help you find the best product for your pet. (yes they do have some cat items as well). There is a full selection of toys, grooming supplies, supplements, food, and of course treats! Noble Beast also supports local rescue organizations by having dogs to adopt on site as well as hosing events where donations can be made. I am so happy to have a store like this in the city, but I think my dog is even happier!!
PS They have a store mascot dog names Otis who is a Pug- he will be more than happy to say hi!
