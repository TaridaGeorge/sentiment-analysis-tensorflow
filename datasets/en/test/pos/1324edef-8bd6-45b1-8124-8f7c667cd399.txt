Famous Daves satisfies that question when you have NO IDEA what you want for dinner.  Just remember that.

I'm sorry... I love the barbecue but I go there for two things... the sweetwater catfish ... and the BREAD PUDDING.  ENOUGH SAID!!!

The only bad thing is parking.  If you can't get their early... make sure you wore comfortable shoes.  Other than that... CAN'T BE A HELPIN' OF DAVE's
