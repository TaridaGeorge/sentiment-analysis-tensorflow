My daughter really wanted to go to Sweet Tomatoes.  After some prodding, I told her we could go, but I wanted to find out what was behind this instance that we have Sweet Tomatoes for lunch.  What did she hold to be the very essence of Sweet Tomatoes that was driving her to say that we must go?  Here is my interview.
