Okay, this is another local favorite.  My husband and I usually go here once a week on our way home from work.  Their wine, mixed drinks and draft beer are excellent!  GM Dave is super nice and always makes us feel welcome, as do his serving staff and the atmosphere is upbeat and fun!  The food is awesome!  I highly recommend their cheese fondue, spinach and artichoke dip, bruschetta, ahi tuna salad, french dip sandwich, turkey pinwheels...  okay you get the idea.  We haven't tried anything there we haven't liked!
