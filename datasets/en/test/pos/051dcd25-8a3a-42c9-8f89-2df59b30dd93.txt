This is probably my favorite restaurant in Old Town: great environment and great food. I highly recommend the Thai ribs with gouda mac n' cheese--oh yes, you heard me right. Gouda mac n' cheese. All dishes are full of flavor, and I really like that they work to source from local and sustainable suppliers.

A bit on the pricey side, so make sure you do it right.
