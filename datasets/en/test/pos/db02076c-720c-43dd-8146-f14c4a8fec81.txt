Oh how I wish Old Heidelberg was closer to home, maybe we should move! 

We ventured out for lunch today and as we were heading home I noticed Old Heidelberg. Having been here before it was a must stop on the way home.

Their freshly baked breads are absolutely fantastic. No plain old mushy white bread for this boy. I prefer hearty breads with flavor. Of course what turned started out as a stop for a couple loaves of bread turned into cookies, dessert and some great German sausages. 

Their bread selection includes Rye, Sunflower and another one I can't recall. You can get the bread sliced or unsliced. Pretzel Rolls are to die for plus they have a great selection of German Sausage from Stigelmeier Sausage Company in Wheeling, IL. 

If you're craving some great German deli items head on over to Old Heidelberg!
