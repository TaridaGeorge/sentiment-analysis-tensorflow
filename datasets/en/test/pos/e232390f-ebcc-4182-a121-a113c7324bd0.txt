I very much enjoyed this place. My first visit. Cool atmosphere and the HH specials are GREAT and delish! Get the bbq chicken pizza. They have HH every day of the week!  (3p.m. to 6 p.m. and then "reverse HH" 9 p.m. to closing.)  There HH cocktails are yummy too! I am very impressed by their WIDE selection to choose from, including making specialty drinks available on the HH price!
