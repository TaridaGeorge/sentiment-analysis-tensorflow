I had one of the best sandwiches ever at Orange Table. I believe it was the Prosciutto Mozzarella...yummmm.  Prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, fresh basil, with a light balsamic vinegar between 2 slices of sourdough bread. Each layer of the sandwich was very distinct yet the combined medly made my mouth sing!!  

A friend couldn't decide between the roast beef sandwich or the green chile corned beef hash so he got both.  The sandwich was pretty good but the corned beef was divine. Slightly crispy but not hard. 

They ran out of orange juice so we had freshly squeezed lemonade. Everything was terrific and the service was great.  Highly recommended.
