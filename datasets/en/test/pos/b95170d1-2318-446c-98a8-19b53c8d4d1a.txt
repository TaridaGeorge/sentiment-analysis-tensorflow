Sophie B. has me very confused:  You can get a sandwich & a drink for like under $10 bucks @ the Duck.

All the sandwiches are handmade right in front of your very face -- any time a restaurant prepares the food where the whole wide world can watch them do it tells me they're proud of their work & their food.  And they should be -- it's great!  They even have each pickle wedge individually wrapped in foil -- take as many as you want (within reason).   :-)

I've been a customer of the Duck since long before most of you moved to Phoenix.  Consistency -- nice people, excellent food, reasonable prices, wide selections of wines & soft drinks, seating indoors - outdoors - upstairs.  

No worries - The Duck is always good.
