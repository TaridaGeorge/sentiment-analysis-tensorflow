i have vomited in the bathroom here at least a dozen times, not from the food. it's always good to have a greasy burger after a night of drinking. i usually throw up before i eat so i don't waste all the greasy goodness that is 5&Diner.

as far as diners go in phoenix, this is one of the better options. it's a real diner as opposed to Denny's or ugh, whats left..most of the others are all long closed.

5 stars for the sympathy for my vomit bursts, 3-4 for the food, 4 for the fun atmosphere after dark. 
yay.




PS. i'm sorry cleaning staff. :(
