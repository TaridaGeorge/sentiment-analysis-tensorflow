I came here for the very first time yesterday. We came in for lunch.
 We were greeted and seated right away, in a cozy little booth.
However, before we eat we went to wash our  hands. The water in the bathroom is over the top hot. A child could really burn themselves on it. (Just a side note there).
Anyway back to the food, The lunch choices are very good!
We both had the Burgers,with cheese and veg. Fries are good Steak fries,nice and thick. We also tried the Potato soup ,which was also good. Drink refills were abundent!
Lots of parking in the lot and easy to get to right on Camelback.
By the way, this is the only one left in the Valley now. The others have all closed.
