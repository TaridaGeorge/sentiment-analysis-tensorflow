I was very excited to go there when I did. I had seen all the pictures that others had uploaded and everything looked delicious. My mind was set on trying out a burrito, but when I saw the menu I chose to have a chimichanga enchilada style with sour cream and guacamole...It was REALLY GOOD! i'M FOR SURE RETURNING AND GETTING A BURRITO WHEN I DO.
