Best place for girls night ever. 
The food is delicious and the atmosphere is fun and hip. When it cools off, the patio is awesome to sit on. The servers are mostly friendly and attentive. 

Pros- Great Food, Reasonably priced, Open late (2am! And serves food late too!) and Tons of beer on tap. 

Cons- Can get crowded during peak hours, Not insanely kid friendly ( not unfriendly- but the restaurant is smallish and my child can be very friendly with whoever is sitting next to her) and sometimes the fries are too good and I want to order more. 

We've been coming here for years. Definitely try the grilled chicken panini! You wont be sorry :-)  The to-go side is great as well. Definitely fast and efficient.
