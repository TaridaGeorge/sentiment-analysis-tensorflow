Amare Stoudemire used to eat here when he was playing for the Suns; you may disagree with his move to the Knicks, but you should trust his judgement in burgers. 

The Delux signature burger is pretty awesome, but I'm going to be real: I like the grilled cheese or the hot dog much better than the burgers. Even better than either of these are the sweet potato fries with aeoli sauce!

The service is fantastic! The waiters are some of the nicest I've ever met. Try to get Brad if you can!

Delux is open late, so it is the best place to go for food after a long night at the bars or clubs!
