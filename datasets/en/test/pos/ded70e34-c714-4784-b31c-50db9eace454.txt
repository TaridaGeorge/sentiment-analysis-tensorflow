This place is a blast. They have a huge draft beer selection, live music, and it's huge. I used to go out a lot in Scottsdale and Tempe, back in my hay day. If you bumped into someone or somebody bumped into you, which was inevitable, the other guys seemed to always want to fight you. At Copper Blues everyone is out to have a good time, listen to great music, and have a few quality drinks. I didn't try any of their food, but the atmosphere, the drinks, and the music will definitely encourage me to come back again.
