I was distraught when Pets Inc got rid of their dog and cat food section. I figured was now being forced to go to the corporate mega chains that don't have any of the good food anyway...

Alas, right down the block from my house was a place I had missed, Tempe Feed & Tack! I had always thought that they were just for horse stuff. Indeed, they are for horse stuff. As well as many different farm animals and pets. However they also have dog and cat food!

They have some of the best foods on the market, Blue Buffalo, Innova...etc. They accept competitor's coupons and give case discounts. They even have VIP dog toys, which are super tough (not tough enough for my lab...but what is?).

Excellent place to shop: small, local, and friendly!
