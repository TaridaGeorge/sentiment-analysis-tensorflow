Been going for a few years now.  Haven't tried much of the  menu yet as every time I go I simply MUST get sliders or a Firedog.  The fries are great, especially buried in cajun spice but the onion rings hold their own as well.

Also, I guess I'll throw in that the soda tastes like it's supposed to (some places manage to have awful tasting soda.  I don't know how that happens).

The place is small and can get busy during lunch but it also has a very comfy home feeling.
