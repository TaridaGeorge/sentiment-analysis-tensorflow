I had to pick a place to meet someone who worked nearby.  Not being from the area, I turned to Yelp for help.  
Boy did Yelp do me right here...  this place was perfect.  GREAT staff, wonderful food, super reasonable prices, and loads of TV's.  I was there on a Friday night from 5 - 7:30 and I can't figure out why this place isn't busier.  I will be returning on my monthly business trips to PHX.  
They have a great happy hour that includes cheap drinks and food choices.  I really had zero complaints about this place.
