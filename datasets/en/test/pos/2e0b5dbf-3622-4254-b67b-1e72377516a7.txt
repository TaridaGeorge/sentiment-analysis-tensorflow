Took my dog Tally, a corgi prone to shedding, to visit Melody yesterday and was extremely satisfied by the great grooming job she did. It's a zoo in there... and that's a compliment. There are dogs everywhere, which is great because she doesn't cage the critters after they are groomed, awaiting pick up! Her pricing was as good or better than the big box pet stores and the service and quality were far superior! Definitely will return there!
