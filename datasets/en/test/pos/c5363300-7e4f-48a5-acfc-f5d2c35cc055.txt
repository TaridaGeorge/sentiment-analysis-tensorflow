This place is close to the museum so we thought we'd give it a try.  YAY!  and  YUM!  The pulled pork was worth the drive from San Diego.  My sister from Alabama saw the peach cobbler on the menu and spoke with the cook who assured her it was fresh, hand peeled peaches and homemade.  My sister is quite the critic of peaches.  OK, the peach cobbler is the best there is.  No comparison - excellent *****.  Eat here you won't be disappointed!
