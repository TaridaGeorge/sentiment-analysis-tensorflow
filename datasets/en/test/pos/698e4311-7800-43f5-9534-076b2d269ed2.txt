This was my first time trying boba, and it was delicious!  Eba has an amazing selection of drinks (and ways to prepare them).  I decided on tea+soymilk, boba with coconut flavor.  Mmmm!  It was sweet and creamy and wonderful.

The cafe itself is bright and welcoming.  I joined several other Yelpers there for Office Hours and we lounged on comfy couches.  In addition to food they sell a selection of gifty items too.

Is it sad to admit that I craved MORE later that day?  Yeah, that's right... if this place wasn't so far from my house, I might have gone back for seconds.
