One of my favorite spots downtown. What to drink, you ask? I exclusively only drink the whiskey berry sours there.. it's hands down one of my favorite cocktails.

Great vibe/music/seating/lighting. There's not much I don't like..heck if they served food I'd venture on downtown far more often! Monday night is free Mexican food! And it's good! Can't beat that. :D
