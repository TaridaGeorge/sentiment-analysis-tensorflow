I did business with this company via internet/phone. The owner, Ken, is easy to do business with, very responsive to emails. This retailer offered THE BEST PRICE for the size of latex mattress topper I was shopping for. Don't hesitate to buy from Arizona Premium Mattress Co, whether you are in Phoenix or Philadelphia. Great pricing, service and shipping. I am pleased with the experience I had with them!
