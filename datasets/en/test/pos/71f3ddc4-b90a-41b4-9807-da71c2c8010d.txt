Yay for Sourdough!  This is East Mesa folks, not exactly a culinary destination.  But this is good pizza!  It's local and been around forever, so it's not exactly trendy.  Please don't take your first date here unless you are an octogenarian on a day pass from the assisted living facility.
No thin crust to be found on this menu.  But pile whatever toppings you can fit on the pizza and enjoy a hearty slice.  They have a decent drink selection, and lots of other italian items on the menu that I've never tried because the pizza is so good.  It's a popular destination for the winter snowbirds, if you go a little later in the evenings, you can avoid the rush.  But three generations of my family have loved this place and the next time you are crusin' Apache Junction, you should check it out!
