Have been using Del Lago Family Medicine for a number of years now as my Primary Care Physician, and allow me to say, Dr. Boor has been great for me and my entire family!  

Dr. Boor is a great doctor that truly listens and does not rush you.  Also, his entire team and assistants are very good at follow-ups such as medication refills, records requests etc.  Billing has always been accurate which is appreciated because it seems this is a problem for many others in the industry.  

As a guy, let me tell you - the best part is the good magazine selection also.  Popular Science, Mac World, and several good car mags!  Not that you will be waiting long because they actually schedule intelligently at Dr. Boors office.
