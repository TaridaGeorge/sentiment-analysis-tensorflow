Still digging on this place. It is now under new ownership but that hasn't changed them in the slightest. 

I stopped in this morning got a wheat everything bagel toasted with butter, SUPER YUM! And a turtle praline latte of sorts. STEAMED CHOCOLATE MILK PEOPLE!!! 

If you find yourself in the area give them a whirl. I haven't been dissatisfied yet.
