Finally got around to visiting Cibo last night...and didn't realize what I was missing. My advice: Just GO! Everything you are reading is true! This place really is as good as it gets. The food is fabulous, the atmosphere is charming and service is great. Yes, I could nit-pick about some of the minor details (you know how I am!), but the overall experience can't be beat. Just GO!!
