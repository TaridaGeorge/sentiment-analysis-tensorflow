This place is great. You pick the protein and any amount of fresh veggies you want so they can stir fry it together. Its healthy and taste great. They also have a Burrito like meal which they call MuShu which is AWESOME!!.. You can't go wrong, and be for the look out for the older asian lady, she is nice, so you should tip her =D
