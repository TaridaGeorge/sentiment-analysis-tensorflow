You could easily get lost in here and be happy that you are. Don't be surprised if you walk into Antique Trove when its light outside but need to turn on your car's headlights for the drive home. There is no such thing as a quick visit to Antique Trove.

If I am ever in a cranky mood, this is where I come.  You are guaranteed to find so much awesome stuff. Yes, some will be incredibly random but isn't that the point sometimes. In all seriousness too... there are really great pieces of furniture and art, which are VERY reasonably priced.  

!!!There is no longer any excuse to go to Target or Pier One for art when Antique Trove is right up the street!!!

Do yourself a favor and go to Antique Trove!  It will always be one of my favorite places in the valley.
