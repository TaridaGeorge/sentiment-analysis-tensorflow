I don't do the "Scottsdale Bar-Thing," but I have always enjoyed this classy place for years. I like taking people from out of town here, and I used to take dates, before I got married two years ago (to a wonderful, gorgeous, sexy woman... is that good, Dear)? It used to be touted as a gay bar, but don't let that deter you, hetero Dudes like myself; its a colorful, classy joint, and no one will harm you or look at you funny here!
