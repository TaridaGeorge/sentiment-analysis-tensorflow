Absolutely fantastic.  Some of the best ice cream I've had and then to expertly mix in alcohol?  Off the charts good.  Went in expecting an odd texture as others had described since they were able to freeze the alcohol, but I'm guessing they were just running into cookie crumbs and other tiny grainy bits of the mix-ins for the flavors they tried.  For me, the ice cream itself was super smooth, rich, creamy, borderline perfect.  The cookies and cream did get a bit grainy from the cookie crumbs, but they were identifiable as cookie so I wouldn't fault the ice cream.

Can't wait to go back next time I'm in AZ for baseball.
