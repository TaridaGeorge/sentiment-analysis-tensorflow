my sisters and I had just finished the race for the cure and stopped by wineburgers for a celebratory beer and something to eat. it was a sunday and wineburgers was hopping! but the staff was friendly and attentive. the owner stopped by to say hi. he noticed our shirts from the walk and bought a round of drinks for us. and he announced the fact we walked in the race for the cure and had everyone cheer for us when we left. super fun place...great staff...great food. i will be back for sure!
