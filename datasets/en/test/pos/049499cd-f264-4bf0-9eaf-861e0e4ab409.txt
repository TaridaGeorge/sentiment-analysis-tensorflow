Keegan's is still one of my favorite places and I have the receipts to prove it.  Yep, three times in the last four days. Don't judge. =) 

Check out the Football Gameday Specials! First beer is $1, happy hour prices after that. Plus, the 12oz M.O.A.B (Mother of all Burgers) is only $7.95 with fries! Monday, Saturday and Sunday during college or pro games!!

See you there!
