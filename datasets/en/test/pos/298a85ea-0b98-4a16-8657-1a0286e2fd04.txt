Great beer, great food, great ambiance, great staff!  I've been coming to 4 Peaks for years and love the place.  I'm there with my buddies every basically every Sunday for football season and still like to come here during the week on occasion.  The best Microbrewery in AZ without a doubt but the food is also far above your average bar food.
