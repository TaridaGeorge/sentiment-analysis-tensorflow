I'm hangin' around downtown Chandler more for some reason and this place always brings me back.  I dig it!  Food is pretty good and so are their sushi.  They have an entertaining menu and their drinks specials during happy hour is awesome.  I LOVE their decor...!  Asian art and old city loft feel.  They have a nice patio out back with an open bar and fire pit.  Every now and then they have a live band or DJ.  Karaoke much?  Well this place has their own private room which you can reserve and it's not over priced like most places I've been to around the valley.  Staff here are always friendly and nice.  This place gets my thumbs way up! :)
