My favorite west side sushi, love the exotic rolls here mostly.  I cant recall them because I make my wife pick them out.  I do know one is called the "climax"  because I am a guy and of course I am going to remember that.  The service is always good here the atmosphere is pretty nice considering it is in the Fry's shopping center.  I take my wife on dates here so its not too casual if you know what I mean.  I am pretty sure you can satisfy a sushi snob here but I am not one so I dont know for sure.  My wife is and she's happy.....
