REI - a virtual candy store for the outdoor enthusiast. REI most likely doesn't have the lowest prices in town, but it doesn't matter. The staff is always incredibly helpful. We have bought everything from backpacks to hiking boots there and every time a staff member spent 10 or 15 minutes talking to us about what we interested in doing with the equipment as well as our experience level. No one has ever tried to up-sell us.
