Oh Four Peaks...how I love thee....

SO excited that this location is finally open. Im a fan of the original location, but on weekends it can get bogged up w/ douc....less than awesome clientele.

This location is hidden in an industrial neighborhood, w/ plenty of parking. They dont serve food at this location, but they have partnered w/ several local food trucks. They serve up some tasty grub that you can then bring in the tasting room to enjoy w/ your brew. 

Theres a decent amount of tables, chairs and bar seats. I was actually surprised, they made it sound smaller. I LOVE the window into the warehouse. Rumor has it theyll be pumping out a few seasonal favorites from this location year round. Theyll be lots more canning and bottling going on as well.

This is my new fave Four Peaks location.
