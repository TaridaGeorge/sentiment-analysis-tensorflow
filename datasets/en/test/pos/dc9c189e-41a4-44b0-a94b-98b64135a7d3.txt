Ohhhh mama. Just thinking about Woodlands makes my mouth water. I know everything my boyfriend has ever had there he has loved. He tries out new things every time there. 

I, on the other hand, just stick to what I know and love and crave: the vegetable manchurian. It's spicy, delicious, deep fried vegetables with a nice cold dipping sauce on the side. The price is great for the awesome amount of food you get (one order is usually two dinners for me, sometimes more!). Ambience is lacking, but we tend to take our food to go. I just wish they'd open a location closer to Tempe!
