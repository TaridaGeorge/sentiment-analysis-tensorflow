This is seriously one of my favorite places to go out and eat with my boyfriend. Without fail I always order the Miso Soup as an app and it is always fabulous.  The service is outstanding; waiters are prompt, polite, friendly, and courteous.  Great quality food! Generous portions and great prices. I would really like to see more business here though, I am very surprised that this place isn't always crowded with locals.
