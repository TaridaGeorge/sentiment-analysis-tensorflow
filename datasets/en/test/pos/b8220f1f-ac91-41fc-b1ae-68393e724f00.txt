Best "cheap burger lunch" on the planet. Fries are made fresh cut in house. I have never eaten a bad lunch here for the last 8 years! Scottsdale also has an in and out on Frank Lloyd Wright. Expect long lines in the drive through with 20 min wait if you get there at noon. Seating can also be limited because of the demand.
