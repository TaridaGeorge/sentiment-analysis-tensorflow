This place was designed for the perfect Saturday.  There is a mix of old and new with most of the same charms from prior to the renovation.  I'm sure the dinner menu tastes as yummy as it looks, but with their bar menu and the bocce ball court, I'm not sure why you'd ever sit down to eat!  Chowing down on their burger in between bocce ball throws, sipping a super refreshing, perfect-for-summer cocktail, and staring at some of the best views in Phoenix is the way to experience El Chorro Lodge.  This place is great for everyone: big groups, a romantic dinner, a place to eat while the kids run on the grass, or a dinner with a client.
