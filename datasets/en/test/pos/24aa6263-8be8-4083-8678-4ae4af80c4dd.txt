I don't understand why people are bitching about small things here. Their Groupon specials are well worth it, $5 for a movie and a drink? Can't get better. The seats are just fine, and their chicken wings with hot sauce are the best! My other half doesn't like em but I absolutely love them. The service is fine too, I don't see nothing wrong with it. Although, I would not go back if I don't have a groupon because I do consider it pricey. Specially the wings that are $10 for 6pcs? But, they're GOOD.
