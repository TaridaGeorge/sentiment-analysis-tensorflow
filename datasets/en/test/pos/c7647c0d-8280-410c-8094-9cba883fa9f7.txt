So delish!  I have been wanting to go here for years and we finally went just as I am about to move to Portland!  Anyways it was so good.  We got the bruschetta and the scallops as an app.  The scallops were superb, perfectly cooked.  I got the penne putanesca, which was also really good.  To finish off the awesome meal we had the bread pudding.  All in all it was a great meal and I will definitely be returning when I come to visit my family in Arizona.
