Jeff and I drove to Basis last night, July 5th.  Our most recent attempt was a Sunday night and we were greeted by a notice that said they would not be opening Sundays in the summer. Total bummer. Last night we found the parking lot empty and the space completely bare of any fixtures or signs of restaurant life. Alas, Basis is closed. 

Owner Steve Short wrote a thoughtful piece regarding the decision and its available here:  http://www.atlastacatering.com/Basis_New_American.html

We are so sad to see them go; it was for us, a place of welcome and frequently celebration. Delightful food and wine in an atmosphere that was completely down to earth and as Steve says, unpretentious.
