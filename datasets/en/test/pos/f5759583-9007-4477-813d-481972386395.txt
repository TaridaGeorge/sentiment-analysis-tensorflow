Ok, I really like this place. I've been searching for the perfect biscuit sandwich since I left North Carolina. Yoli's has a delicious one that makes a Carolina girl happy in the morning. It's so nice to have a place for a homemade breakfast just a hop, skip and a jump from the office. If I ever stop obsessing over the biscuit sandwich (not likely), I want to try their breakfast burritos, skillets and french toast. Word on the street is that those are amazing as well.

You can also walk here from Gangplank if you stop by to work and need some good food in your belly. They serve lunch as well as breakfast, and I think they are open until 3.
