Really didn't want to like this Subway-owned chain...who's ever heard of fast food sushi?  But I had to try.  Granted, I have NOT tried the meat/fish here.  I wouldn't.  But the make your own veggie rolls...OMG.  Finally I can get a roll with tofu, sprouts, and mango in it...or jalape√±o, avocado, tofu....or sprouts, spinach, and avocado with sesame on top...you get the picture.  I LOVE vegetarian sushi.  LOVE that I can have it built my way.  LOVE that I don't get charged a fortune for it!!!!!
