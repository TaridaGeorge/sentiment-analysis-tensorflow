Hubby and I go there probably twice a month.We live in El Mirage so it's quite a drive. But today he took me and our 2 adult daughters there for my birthday.  The food is always great, as is the service. Today however my king crab (which I get every time)  was a little salty so I sent it back. The manager ( Grace ) came to apologize and proceeded to completely shock us w/ some excellent customer service skills. I did'nt think management like this existed anymore. We will definitely be going again and again. It's really nice to know that the place you patronize appreciates your business. Marriah, was our servers name and she was also very nice. By the way , neither of them knew it was my birthday which made what they did even nicer. Will definitely keep going there and would also recommend.
