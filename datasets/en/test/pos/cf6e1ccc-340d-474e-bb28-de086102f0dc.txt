Went there yesterday and found that the place has just CLOSED.  Another victim of a good chef with a bad location and business planning.  

Hint for future restauranteurs:  Don't open a Scottsdale restaurant in the summer unless you have the cash to survive with no business till the following March, advertise heavily, and don't locate your business where customers coming from one direction have to make a U-turn to get there, particularly if there's no good signage.

The Stacy's location in Phoenix remains open.
