Best. Pizza. In. The. Valley. Period.

I adore the Began's, as I've known them prior to taking ownership of Classic Italian Pizza. Several years ago, I even had my college graduation there. Over the years, Ahzar has added in multiple improvements and menu changes, making it one of the best pizza and wine spots in the valley. Bread is hand made, Mozzerella is fresh, and tiramisu is made fresh daily as well (A 2 hour process).

I love the White Pizza, as well as the four seasons. Their tuna salad nicoise and caprese are also must haves. 

Ultimately, I would put it up against Pizzeria Bianco any day of the week. Classic Italian Pizza is fantastic.
