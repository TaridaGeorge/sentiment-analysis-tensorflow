Wow!  You guys (the earlier reviewers) are prudes!  Naked statues shouldn't even get a mention.  This is a theater, not a Mormon temple.

The seating here was great.  Such a small theater that every seat is great.  (I was in Stage West i believe.)  The acoustics were great and the concessions were fine.  Not excessively priced, but still concessions priced.

Really?  Naked people get you guys that weirded out?!
