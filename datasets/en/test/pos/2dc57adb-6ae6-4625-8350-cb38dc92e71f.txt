This place is crazy good. As other reviewers have mentioned, it's definitely a "mom and pop" place with limited seating and slower service. But your service comes with a smile from a nice old guy who seems genuinely happy to have your business, which is becoming rarer all the time.

If you don't know anything about Ecuadorian food, you will have a good time and a lot of surprises exploring the menu. They have some things you might recognize by name, like tamales and empanadas, but bear in mind they are prepared in a different style from what Mexican restaurants would serve.

Be a little adventurous and try some things that might be new to you--I don't think you can go wrong at Mi Comida!
