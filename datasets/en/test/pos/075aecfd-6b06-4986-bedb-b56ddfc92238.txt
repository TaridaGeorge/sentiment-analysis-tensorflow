It's been several months since I've been to Veneto's so forgive me if my review is short.  Instead, I'll get straight to the point.  GO HERE!  My wife and I had one of the all-around nicest dining experiences here.  Everything from the appetizers to the entrees to the wine was outstanding, and the service was just perfect.  I would recommend Veneto Trattoria to anyone near or far.
