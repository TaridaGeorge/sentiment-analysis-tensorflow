I've been going to this place for years simply because there is no reason not to! The food is great and the staff is among the friendliest group of people you will ever meet. I'm usually greeted by name when I go in this place and am asked how my parents are doing (they eat here often as well). It's a little personal touch that goes a long way. There is nothing on the menu that I don't like and the pizza and wings are to die for. Love this place and the staff. The best pizza in Phoenix!
