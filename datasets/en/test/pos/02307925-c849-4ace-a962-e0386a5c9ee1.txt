We had AVC do some minor repairs on our tile roof after we purchased our home several years ago and they did a great job.  This year, we were hit up by a couple of different storm chasing roofing vultures from out of town that were trying to scare us into a new roof.  Tim came out to take a look and told us the real truth:  just minor wear and tear upkeep was needed.  Thanks Tim!
