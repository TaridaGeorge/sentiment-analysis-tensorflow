Wow! I'm sad that I didn't find out about this place earlier. I'm just glad I now know of a great sandwich shop that is very unique and not like many others. They really seem to come up with some creative and delicious creations. I got the bobbi and the cheese steak and both were very very good.

The Bobbi tasted like the morning after Thanksgiving day which turkey, stuffing, and cranberry. It really was the perfect combination. Not too soggy, not too dry. 
The cheese steak had a little bit of a kick with the peppers and it definitely had the right amount of meat and cheese combination. I can't wait to try out the Capistrami next time which looks amazing. 

As for value, i think it's quite good for a 9' sub (plenty for me) for about $7. I would definitely recommend this place!
