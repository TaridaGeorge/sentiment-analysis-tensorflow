Finally came here and tried their hot dog concoctions at the Phoenix Public Market, and I left super impressed (though not very surprised considering the great reviews on Yelp)!

I had the Aiko with a spicy beer hot, and I thought it was delicious. Honestly, I think the Naan is what totally pushes these over the edge--chewy, crispy, warm, and delicious.. the perfect vessel for a gourmet hot dog.

My little brothers were obsessed with the fact that they served Coca Cola from the glass bottles (made with Mexican cane sugar). And I was happy to see all of the additional topping options that I am definitely looking forward to trying in the near future.

The fact is, the owners are super friendly, they serve an original product, and it just tastes damn good!
