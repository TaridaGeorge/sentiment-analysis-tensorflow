It is definetely worth the wait. We got there at 4:00 and got in on the first round at 5:00. We sat down and ordered. The pizzas on the menu were absolutely unique and only could be found there. The pizzas we ordered were top quality and delicious. 1 pizza can be eaten by 2 people. Will go there again.
