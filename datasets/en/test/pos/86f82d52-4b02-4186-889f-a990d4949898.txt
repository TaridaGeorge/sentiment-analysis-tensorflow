Absolutely LOVE this restaurant!  The food is fabulous, the atmosphere is great, and they have some of the best servers around.  My favorite things to get are their bruschetta plate, tan-tan chicken sandwich, rosemary chicken sandwich and the flatiron steak - although everything I have had was amazing!  

The bruschetta is some of the best I have ever had and my boyfriend and I always fight over the last bite of tomato and onion jam.  It's hard to choose a favorite between the chicken sandwiches, they are both so good!  The special feta cheese spread on the rosemary chicken really elevates this beyond a normal chicken sandwich.

Also, they have some really great monthly, weekly and daily specials if you are looking for great food on a bargain.  Cannot wait to go back again!
