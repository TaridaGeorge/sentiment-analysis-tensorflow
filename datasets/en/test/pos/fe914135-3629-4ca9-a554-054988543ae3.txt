I stop by Lee's every time I am in the area (which says a lot given that I eat clean otherwise), and her delicious treats never fail to disappoint. I always look forward to delight my taste buds with her latest alcohol infused ice cream flavors. I enjoyed the in-house made wafers that had a hint of cinnamon... yum! So far, everyone I brought to Lee's has been pleasantly surprised!
Elliott also left a positive impression, remembering me after 3 weeks - great customer service, and his personality is the right fit for the crowd you'd expect on a Saturday afternoon/evening.
Highly recommended!
