Expectations are funny things.  Once you have them, you are bound to be disappointed.  But I have to say, Yasu did not disappoint.  Popped into this cozy random nook of a restaurant for a random Tuesday night dinner out and it turned out to be everything I hoped it would be and more... knowledgeable server, good atmosphere and sushi that melted in my mouth like butter.  All of the residual stress from a bad day at work evaporated like the haze of water droplets from a mister on a hot Phoenix summer day, leaving me feeling cool, calm and content.  Oh yes, Yasu did not just meet my expectations, it exceeded them.  And I am hard to please.
