We've made two visits here and have been pleased both times. Flatbread pizzas, wraps, panninis - even their flatbread chips are good. They have a lovely selection of side salads if chips aren't your thing. Add reasonable prices ($7-8 for meal) and you have a wonderful alternative to the fastfood lunch options around.
