This place is awesome. They have the best selection of independent and foreign films. The staff is always so helpful and knowledgable. It's overflowing with that laid-back, downtown homegrown vibe. It's fabulous!

I will warn you though - this place is difficult to get to right now with all of the lightrail construction on Central. Don't let this stop you - you'll be missing out if you do!
