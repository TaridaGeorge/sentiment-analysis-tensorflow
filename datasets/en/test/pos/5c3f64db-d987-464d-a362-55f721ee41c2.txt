I think this is going to be my favorite fro-yo place.  I liked the decor and the large selection of flavors, they not only had PISTACHIO, but also Banana, my two favorite.  Also, the texture seemed to be creamier than others.   I liked that the seating is low and round, so I can bring the twins without too much worry about sharp corners.
