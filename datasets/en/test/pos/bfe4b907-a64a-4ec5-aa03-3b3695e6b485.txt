Somebody recommended this place to me a long time ago and now I have been faithfully going here for years. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. I had a friend from Flag who was homesick for any kind of Din√© food, and brought her here...she was so happy to see a place actually run by the Tohono O'odham Nation, AND it was absolutely amazing to boot. I always get the "everything possible on it" green chile frybread, and they never let me down...so so so good. They spice the meat perfectly and the frybread is to die for...you can't go wrong with any of the frybreads here, ever!
