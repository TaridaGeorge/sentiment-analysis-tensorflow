Been open for a couple days now. I just got the chance... umm.. privilege to eat there today. Wow! Scrumptious sandwiches, with so much to choose from it's great! I chose the cuban pork sandwich, toasted, with mustard, pickle, and swiss. Very, very tasty.

If you buy their cookie, and it's ready first, scarf it down; don't wait! It'll cool off and then won't be soft, warm and gooey anymore.

Their ambiance is energetic, the music is good, and it's truly a bustling place. I'll definitely be back!

Lunchtime weekdays can be hard if not impossible to find a parking spot. Anytime from 11:30-1:00 is prime time over there.
