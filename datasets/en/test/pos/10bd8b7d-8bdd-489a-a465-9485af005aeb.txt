The store itself is a bit expensive. They do have some great things you don't usually see in a cooking store however. 

But the reason I am giving them 5 stars is for their awesome cooking classes. I took a saute and sauces class and thought it was great! It was 60 dollars and 3 hours and the very next day I went to their website to look for more classes I would enjoy. 

The class was about 15 people, we cooked about 7-8 dishes and then got to try them all. The chef who taught this particular class was very nice and helpful and she absolutely made me want to sign up for future classes.
