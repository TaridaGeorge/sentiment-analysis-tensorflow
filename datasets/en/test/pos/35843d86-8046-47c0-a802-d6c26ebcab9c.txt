Jiffy Lube is known for having fast service, but this is the fastest Jiffy Lube I've been to. I went in on the weekend expecting a lot of people, but there was just one other car they were working on. 

I asked the guys there if they took the coupon I had, and they did. After they were done I asked if they knew where I could get a tire air cap thing because I crushed one of my old ones. The guy walks back into the garage area and asks me how many I want. I said one, and he handed me one. =) SWEET! I told him that I loved Jiffy Lube, and he said Jiffy Lube loves me too. Aww.
