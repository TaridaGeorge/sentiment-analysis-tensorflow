I use the 3 dollar wash and love it.  No upselling!!  After my wash pull around the corner and use the free vacuum's.  They really suck hard, like sucking chrome off your bumper. (note: this is just an expression,  it did not cause harm to my chrome)

It a quick in and out which is great.  They best one I have found in my area.
