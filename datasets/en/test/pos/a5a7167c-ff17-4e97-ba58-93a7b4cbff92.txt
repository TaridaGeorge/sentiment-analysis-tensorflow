I wanted to update my review based on my last experience.

As usual, I ordered a half salad and decided to get the southwestern Caesar. I asked for onions and the nice guy behind the counter happily put them on top of my salad. The salad for a half size looked awesome. I also decided to try their baked potato soup and some sugar cookies for the fun of it.

All I have to say is everything was great! Salad was filling, soup was soo good I didn't want to stop eating it but had to because I was full. And the sugar cookie was one of the best I have had. I also was able to get a fork and noticed they were not lacking available utensils like the last few times. 

I left a very happy camper.
