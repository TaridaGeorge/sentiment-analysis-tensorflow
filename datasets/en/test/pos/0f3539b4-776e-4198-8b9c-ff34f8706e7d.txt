Yes it's the best in Phoenix and probably well beyond Arizona, too.  The sausage "Wise Guy" pizza is a national treasure.  We heard a rumor that they bring in the NY water. It starts with the home made materials and the chef does it right. Arrive by 4pm and you'll likely be in the first seating at 5.  Hardest working pizza chef needs a statue built for him.  Highly recommended.
