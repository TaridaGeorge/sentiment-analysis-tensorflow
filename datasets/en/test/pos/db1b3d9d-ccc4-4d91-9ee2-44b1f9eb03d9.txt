this cute little pizza, salad and pasta place in east chandler is great. my mom can't eat food with gluten, which pretty much rules out anything with bread. this place is the only restaurant i know of that specializes in gluten-free pizza. 

pretty genius as actually quite a few people are allergic to gluten and now they have a restaurant to go to! they have regular crust too, as well as gluten free beer and gluten free brownies. if you know someone who can't eat gluten products get them a gift cert to this place or pick them up a Brownie, they will love it!
