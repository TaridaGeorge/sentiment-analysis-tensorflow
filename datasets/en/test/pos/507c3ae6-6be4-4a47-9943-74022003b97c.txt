I needed to mail a package over lunch, and I didn't want to go to the post office. Of course, I turned to Yelp and found this little shipping store within walking distance of my office.

It's located on the west side of the AJ's center, right next to Samurai Sam's. There wasn't a line so I was in, out and on my way. 

Quick, easy and hassle-free.
