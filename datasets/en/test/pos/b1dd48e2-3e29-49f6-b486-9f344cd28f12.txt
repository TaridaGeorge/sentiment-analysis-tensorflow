This DUI has turned into an expensive nightmare so when I got the notice of interlock letter I was freaked out it was going to get even more expensive.  I was really impressed on how well the staff treated me from before install to after.   The interlock is only so good but when they took time to work with me and help me through this its 100% better.  I also missed a retest in my 3rd month but a girl there was able to get it removed so I didn't get extended and it didn't cost anything for that service.  I just wish the rest of the process was this pleasant.  Thank you for outstanding customer service!
