This restaurant is by the far the most unique restaurant I have ever eaten at.  I love the concept...taking the vernacular of southwest, native american flavors and incorporating it into fine cuisine.  The heart of this restuarant is the fact that they use local seeds, local flowers, local everything to make the food so extraordinary.  I always request the corner table at teh junction of the 2 windows at aorund 5:30 pm to get the best sunset views possible.  Then the experience begins...every waiter knows your name, everything is not overlooked, food is beyond exceptional, and the location is classic AZ.  If I could, I would add another diamond on top of the 5 it's already received.  Thank you Kai and Sheraton WHP for putting together an unforgettable restaurant.
