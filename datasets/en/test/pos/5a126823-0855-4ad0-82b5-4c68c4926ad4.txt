A vegetarian reviewing a BBQ restaurant?  Well here goes.....

On a recent trip to visit some family, we were taken to Joe's Real BBQ.  Everyone in the group was carnivores and all indulged in what smelled like some really good tasting BBQ.  Smokey pecan wood aroma filled the restaurant...and surrounding neighborhood.  I can't speak for the meats that everyone else enjoyed, but the salad I had was really good.  BBQ ranch dressing was very tasty!  Their BBQ sauce is really good.  Their Mac n Cheese was EXTREMELY good.  I had to go back for another serving of that.  Their cornbread was really good too!  Fun atmosphere.  Very friendly staff.  Highly recommended, even by this vegetarian!
