My roommate just showed this place to me.  Good Thai food has proven to be very difficult to find in the Phoenix area.  Seems everyone here has very low standards for thai food.  The places that are popular I've noticed are extremely bland.  Anyway I ate here the other night, and again today.  I've tried 3 dishes so far.  Pad Thai, Pad Se-ew, and the Drunken Noodle.  Along with Spring Rolls and a Thai coffee.  Everything so far has tasted excellent.  FINALLY.  Really looking forward to trying some other dishes.  Was happy with the service, the waitstaff was attentive and the food came promptly.  I would definitely recommend this place.
