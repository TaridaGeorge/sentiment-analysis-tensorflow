I eat here all the time and have been for a few years now.  I eat Pho anytime I am feeling sick and it knocks the illness on it's ass!  I went to pick some up since my man had a sore throat and I knew it would make him feel better.  For $15 I got Chicken Pho, crab puffs and spring rolls. $15 dollars!  This fed myself, my man and his brother.  It was a Monday night, the place was packed but it still took only 10 minutes to get my food.  While I was waiting 2 of my friends walked in.  Winner winner chicken dinner!
