While visiting Arizona a friend took me here to Leaps and I'm glad she did. Hidden in the west side I would have never found it on my own. A very cute coffee shop with a plethora of treats to choose from.  From coffee, custard, and sandwiches its an inviting place that you can take your children too as well as a great place to take friends to catch up.  A much better alternative with a better atmosphere then any Starbucks.  A cute hidden treasure for the west valley
