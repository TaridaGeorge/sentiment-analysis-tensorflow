Sat nite @ CPH. Early dining at the bar as is our wont. Lotsa room at 5:30; crowded by 6:15. Service was outstanding. Could not have been made to feel more welcome by the entire bar staff. They serve a killer sazerac and have a monster selection of liqueurs. Is there another place in town that features a ' sausage of the day'? Chorizo soup was the s-o-d this lucky night. A richly textured meal in itself, I piled on with the mac n cheese which could've earned the 5 stars on it's own. They offered to add sausage: Momma didn't raise no fool, I accepted. CPH earned the hype! Hope you love it like we did.
