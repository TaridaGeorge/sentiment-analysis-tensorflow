This spa is my favorite In Scottsdale Az. The pool and jacuzzi area is beautiful with a view of  the Mountain and hillside homes. The food is excellent and the service was great by the pool! My daughter in law and I go every year and we have a great massage and girl day!!! highly recommend this spa.
