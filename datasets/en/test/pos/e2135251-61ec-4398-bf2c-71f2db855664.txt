This is my absolute FAVORITE place, and I have been coming here for years (although I should mention I always stick to breakfast foods...I like the items I get too much to branch out). As a self-proclaimed muffin connoisseur, the blackberry bran muffin is my favorite muffin of all time. That being said, the other muffins are typically marginal at best, so if you are in the mood for a lighter breakfast, I would suggest the brioche bread or go with one of their english muffins. Mia's French Pancakes are delicious and I also really like the granola and yogurt. Since switching their coffee brand, the coffee is pretty great, and I suggest the iced coffee. 

As others have mentioned, parking is really limited and can ruin your experience. Avoid typical lunch hours (you will def. have to valet), ad weekends tend to be crowded too.
