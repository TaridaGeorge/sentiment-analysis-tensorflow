This is my favorite restaurant in  Tempe. The servers are great, it's not a chain, has an amazing menu & wine list, great outdoor patio, and it's centrally located. 

If you want to try something that has a great variety, and great service. 

I insist on coming here everytime I come to the Phoenix area!
