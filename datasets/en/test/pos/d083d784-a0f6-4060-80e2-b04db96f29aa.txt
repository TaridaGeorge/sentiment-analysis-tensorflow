Went for lunch by myself when I was serving as a juror at the Municpal Court.  I loved it.  The service was great.  The food was outstanding.  The price was good.  The old house had a wonderful feeling.  I will return again for sure!  

I had an eggplant parm sandwhich with a salad and highly recommend both!
