When I first moved to the area 2 years ago I had to find a place that had Bulgogi.  I searched but never found a place I liked.  A neighbor introduced me to this spot and I am now a regular patron...  I usually seat myself (if I come alone) and the owner never gives me a menu.  I've tried most everything on the menu but I always come back to Bulgogi, Galbi and Bibimbap.  It is kind of pricey but the food has a homemade feel.  The ambiance of the restaurant is nice, too.
