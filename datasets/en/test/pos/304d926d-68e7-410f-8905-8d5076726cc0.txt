Finally I had a chance to check this place out for lunch.  I was intrigued to find a Scandinavian restaurant in town since I'm from Norwegian heritage.  I ordered the meatball sandwich with the potato salad which was really delicious!!  The place was clean, the service was friendly, and I love the fact that they have games to play while you eat.  Just a cute little Mom and Pop restaurant.  I can't wait to return and try out some different dishes.
