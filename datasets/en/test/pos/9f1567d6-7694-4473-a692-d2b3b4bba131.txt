I have an cat named Lucy and have shopped at Bark Avenue Pet Supply for 6 years. The people are all friendly and knowledgeable and take time to help with decisions. We just adopted a wonderful stray dog named Max. I brought him in and they assisted with his dietary and toy needs. The food is quality and natural and I don't worry about their food having issues with recalls. I really recommend shopping here for your furry family member(s).
