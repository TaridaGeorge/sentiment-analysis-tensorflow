I love this place! Took my son yesterday morning. It is always clean and well organized. You can make a day of this park with so much to do! The park's hours vary with the season but typically opens at 10am. Purchase your ride at the front office as you're walking in.

The park has a fun train ride, carousel, a HUGE playground and large open fields with several ramadas for parties. You can bring in your own food for a picnic or get lunch (things like chili, pizza, pb & j) just north of the train station or visit the snack bar near the carousel (ice cream, candy, popcorn, chips, coffee beverages). 

The prices are very reasonable, especially for ramada rental. Visit, you will love this place!
