Yum! I have been eating at Havana Cafe over the last couple of years and never thought to check out this little place. I actually never noticed it until recently (is it new?)

I got a chocolate cookie. It was fluffy and wonderful. 

I saw almost everyone in there drinking a pink drink. I asked what it was, and the gal behind the counter told me it was blackberry lemonade....looked REALLY refreshing. I'll have to try it next time.

I was impressed with their savory combinations, from the salads to the sweets. Next time I go, I hope they still have tangelo scones. They sound heavenly!
