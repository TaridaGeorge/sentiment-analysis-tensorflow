BEST brunch ever! the steak &eggs is freaking delicious! The plate comes with fresh fruit, toast and obrien potatoes (BOMB). My friends ordered the buckwheat pancakes and LOVED them. The service is awesome too. 

fyi... On weekends, prepare to wait at least half an hr before being seated. This place is packed! Parking is okay.
