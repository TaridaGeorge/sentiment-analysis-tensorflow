A great place to spend the day with your kids or Grandkids.  My daughters and their pre-teens enjoyed the exhibits as much as I did.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but seeing the kids transfixed by some of the displays let me know that we did the right thing by coming here.  We will be going back since we were only able to see about half of the exhibits.
