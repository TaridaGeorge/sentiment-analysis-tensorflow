It's funny, reading down these reviews I really don't have much to add. I think it's best summed up by Nicki H. Starting with bubbly and moving into a nice red you will never go wrong at Atlas. Hey, even if you do want that white its only 20 feet away! 

Definitely call ahead. 

Seriously, pound for pound and what you get for your money it is the best date spot in Scottsdale. You feel exclusive in small space which is a turn on to most. I say go immediately, or as soon as you can get a reservation.
