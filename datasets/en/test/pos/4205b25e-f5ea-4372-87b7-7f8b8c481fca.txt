This is some real authentic Mexican food.  I love everything I have eaten here, and the beans are delicious!  They are also very fast with their service and I have never had any orders come back wrong.  It is not the most beautiful place or in the best part of town, but I feel that the food really makes up for that and once you eat you won't worry about any of that.
