There isn't anything I don't like about Bandera! The artichokes are fabulous. The Dip Duo Queso is like heaven in your mouth. Prime Rib is exquisite. I have never had a bad meal here and I've been coming for the last 15 years. From start to finish Bandera is a fantastic place to eat. 

Get the Banana Cream pie for desert. So yummy.
