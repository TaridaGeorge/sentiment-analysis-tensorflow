I went here a few weeks ago. Lucas is great- I told him that I had been diagnosed with carpal tunnel and he was able to figure out that most of my problems were actually coming from knots in my chest, neck, and head that were hitting nerves and making my hands go numb. He took a lot of extra time to explain how things work with the chart of the muscles, and show me some stretches that would help my issues. Since my massage, I haven't had any problems with my carpal tunnel and my neck soreness was completely gone.  I can't wait to schedule another massage with him! Also, the price is great...
