B-E-S-T Huevos Rancheros....big enough for TWO!  4 eggs...come on now!  Pair that with a $1.99 bloody mary or mimosa and well...enough said.  Atmosphere very fun...espeically on "Sunday Funday"....seems to be the growing trend between here and the Vig!  Great music, fun friendly staff!  Sweet potatoes are super duper yummy!  Definitely worth taking out of town guests to!!!
