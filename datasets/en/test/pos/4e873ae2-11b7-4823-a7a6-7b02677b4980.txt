What I love
-Your delicious and bountiful flavors. 
-Comfy chairs that I can sit back on for hours
-Free WiFI = great study spot
- Variety of seating. Indoors or outdoors. Outdoor seating is under a tarp, so the temperature is regulated.
- your shakes! 

Why you bother me
- cravings that can't be satisfied because I live too far from you
- I compare other gelato places to you and end up not as satisfied. The glass doesn't look half as full
- I can't say no to you.
