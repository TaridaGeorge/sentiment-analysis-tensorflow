Grimaldi's is the most consistently amazing pizza place in Arizona. We've been to this Old Town location quite a few times in the past year and not once have we had a bad pie. The pizza is always uber-fresh with crispy crust and amazing flavor. 

We've never had any issues with the wait staff, they're attentive and generally on top of things... but to be honest, even if the wait staff here was horrible, I'd still give the place 5 stars because the pizza is that good. I think they put crack in that dough, because I'm addicted. 5/5 stars.
