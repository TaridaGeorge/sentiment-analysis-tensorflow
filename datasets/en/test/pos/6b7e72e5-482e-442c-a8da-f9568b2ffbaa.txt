Last Saturday we tried Asi Es La Vida at the recommendation of a co-worker. Boy, am I glad we made the drive from Desert Ridge to try this neighborhood gem. I only wish we had places like this near home. Maybe we'll need to move!

We started with Chips and Guacamole...out of this world. I had a beef entree (sorry it's been a week) and my partner had pork. Both were excellent.

He had flan for dessert which he thoroughly enjoyed. The prices were reasonable and service was top notch. 

It's a little on the small side...so don't tell anyone about this little gem!
