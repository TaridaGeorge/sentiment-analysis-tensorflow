I had heard great things about Spinato's pizza and last night we ordered takeout from this one. In order to please the pallate of the three of us whom were consuming, the person on the phone suggested the sweet pepper and onion pizza. They told us it would be 45 min for delivery....
The guy arrived in about 40 min and it was well worth it. The pizza was delicious! Cut into squares, which I like that some places do this, it had a nice thin crust, plenty of cheese and sauce, and was also sprinkled with oregano in addition to the toppings. We were all thoroughly impressed! 
Today at work I overheard some colleagues planning on ordering the spinach pizza, which sounded wonderful. Will have to go for that one next.
