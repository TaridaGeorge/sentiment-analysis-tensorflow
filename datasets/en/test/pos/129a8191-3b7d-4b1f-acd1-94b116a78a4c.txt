I must say an absolute gem. Love the assorted menu, from Japanese to Italian.

The waitress was very attentive and friendly. 

I definitely recommend the shrimp tempura for appetizer. Crispy and tender, the sauce to accompany, exquisite.

I would recommend this to anyone who loves great tasting international cuisine.
