Dear Vig Hater,

I went back to The Vig for happy hour a few weeks ago, and I'm going to have to officially declare my disagreement with you. Even thought it was ridiculously crowded (and we had to wait for a seat on the patio at a mere 5 p.m.!), I thought the happy hour scene was dynamic and exciting; people were having a lot of fun, and the whole place felt alive. Plus, the well drinks were really cheap and the duck & mushroom quesadilla I had was really well-executed and satisfying. I would return here for lunch or happy hour in a second, and that my friend, makes for a five-star experience.
