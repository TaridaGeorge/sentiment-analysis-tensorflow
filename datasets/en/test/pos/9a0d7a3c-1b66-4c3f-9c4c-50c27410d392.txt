Love this gym. Not many know it's here..lunch time is the best to get in. I've been a member since Feb of 2009. 

While the trainers are nice, it's a revolving door. You are better off at this gym if you know what you're doing vs. needing 1-to-1 attention. Since LA Fitness just purchased PURE, this will only increase I imagine. Pretty disappointed that they no longer do monthly 're-programs'... But the gym itself is worth the monthly fee. 

If you're looking for a place to be left alone to workout - this is it.
