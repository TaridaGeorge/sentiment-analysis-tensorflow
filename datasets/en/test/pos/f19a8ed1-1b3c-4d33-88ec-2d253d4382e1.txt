We go to Mama Java's on a pretty regular basis. We have always enjoyed stopping in. The baristas are fantastic, especially Jency, she's our favorite. 

This is a great locally owned coffee house where you can go and relax and chit chat with friends or get some work done while using their free wi-fi.

A must for anyone that lives or works in the neighborhood!
