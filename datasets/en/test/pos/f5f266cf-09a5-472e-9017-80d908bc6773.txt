This visit was deff a 5 star!  Got the banh mi, and it was amazing!  For anyone who has never tried it, its a Vietnamese sandwich served on a baguette.  It is an absolute must, especially on the days it's too hot to eat pho.  

Service was awesome - Esteban is super friendly and cool.

Once again, I had a great visit with excellent food and drinks and will return soon!
