Well I have to say for being a small place in central Phoenix this has some of the best sushi in the city. Hana is owned by the same guy who used to have the place in the Biltmore called Ayako. 
You get great customer service and really great quality sushi. The prices are as generous as the portions. It is a really low key, unpretentious place right across the street from channel 3 on 7th ave and Missouri.

I love going here for lunch and dinner...even though it's out of my way. If you are looking for a new place for sushi that doesn't have that "chain" feel to it this is your place. Make a trip to Hana.
