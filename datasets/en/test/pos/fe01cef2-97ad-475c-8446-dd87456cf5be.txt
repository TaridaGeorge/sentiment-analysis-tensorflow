I always get top notch service at West of Soho. This family owned and operated business is very unique! They have the latest fashion at very reasonable prices. I shop here at least 3 times a month! They are always getting new shipments of clothing and accessories, so they have lots to offer! This is a can't miss shop at Cityscape!
