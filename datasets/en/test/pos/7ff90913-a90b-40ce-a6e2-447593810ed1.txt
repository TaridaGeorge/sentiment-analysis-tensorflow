I broke my cardinal rule of dining, which is never eat sushi/sashimi/Japanese food outside of California or Manhattan in the U.S., because the reviews of this place were so solid that I had to try it.

ShinBay blew my mind (in a super fantastical way). 

We did the 4 course tasting menu (we couldn't call ahead to reserve a bigger tasting menu because we only found this place online 3 hours before dinner on our last night in Scottsdale). We also got a bottle of sake from the less expensive menu. 

Every course was ridiculously amazing. The uni alone changed my world. It is the best sushi I have ever eaten in my life, and it may have ruined me for lesser places.

I will seriously fly back to Scottsdale just to eat here again, and I'm not that big a high roller. It's just worth it.
