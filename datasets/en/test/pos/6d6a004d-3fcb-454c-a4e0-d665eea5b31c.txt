The donuts are the best I've had in the valley. The iced coffee I really enjoy, and for 2 bucks you can't beat it. I made a mess in my car eating the crumble donut one morning, but it was so good I didn't regret it. I had a croissant filled with ham and cheese last time I went that was delicious.
I give this place 5 stars for a few reasons. My father is a true doughnut connoisseur. He came to visit me, and after I took him there once, he demanded to go there everyday on his trip and proclaimed, 'you just can't get a donut this good anymore'.
The other reason is value, you can eat a donut and coffee for a couple dollars. In a world where Starbucks will charge you $5 for a mediocre latte, I'll take Bosa over them anyday.
