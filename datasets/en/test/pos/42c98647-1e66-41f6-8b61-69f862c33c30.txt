Went in for the first time time today.  I was greeted as soon as I entered, by both human and canine staff (love that).  I was shown right where the food I had been searching all over town for was located, and chatted a bit. It was lovely experience and I will most assuredly be returning. My pups love the Honest Kitchen Preference, and it is hard to find in town. I am so happy I stumbled on this little gem of a store!
