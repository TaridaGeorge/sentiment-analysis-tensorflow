I really dig this place.  They have a lot to offer for such a small wittle store.  I am definitely in love with the low prices on flowers and plants, as I like to give my lady love pretty things from time to time.  The food is quite swell, with their vast selection of fresh and frozen goods, produce, meats, cheeses, wine (they have local wines!!), personal hygiene items, snacks, desserts, and so on.  The staff is always always ALWAYS very friendly and helpful, and just have a general sense of rad...like they enjoy their job.  I feel this review is short, but ain't it sweet?  Keep up the greatness guys!
