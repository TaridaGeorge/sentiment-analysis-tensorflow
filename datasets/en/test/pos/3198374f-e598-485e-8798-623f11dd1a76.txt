This place is a ton of fun, seriously. And it's a place where gays, straights, and lesbians exist harmoniously. Which is rare. There's a patio, a lounge upstairs and at least a few good looking folks. It warms up after 10, so if you go earlier, it'll be pretty empty, so wait it out. The drinks are pricey but not insane ($9 for a decent pour Absolut Vodka). I've been here twice (one Wednesday and one Thursday) and had a great time both times.
