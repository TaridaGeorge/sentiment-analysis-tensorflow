This is hands down the best pizza spot in AZ.  I have spent the last 8 years trying to find the best pizza in AZ as I am from Cali.  This is it!  The pizza is fantastic. My children love it too.  Not many spots where both the kids and parents are happy with the food.  We recommend this spot to everyone we can.

I have to add that the chicken wings are amazing.  I do not eat chicken wings anywhere, but here.  They are that good!
