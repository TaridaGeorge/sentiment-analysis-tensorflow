Holy cow!  This place has yarn literally hanging from the ceiling.  This being Arizona, they focus mostly on cottons, and other warm-weather fibers, but you can get some wools if you're really set on them.  They have the biggest Colinette selection I've ever seen. It's a thing of beauty.  

The staff was very helpful.  I told them I was looking for souvenir yarn from my trip to Scottsdale and they pointed me toward yarns dyed locally and some yarns made just for the store.  

I highly recommend the store and hope to visit again if I'm ever in the Scottsdale area.
