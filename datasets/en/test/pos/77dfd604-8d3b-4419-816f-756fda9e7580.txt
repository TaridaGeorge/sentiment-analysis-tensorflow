Very good Thai food!! I had the lunch special - Chicken Panang! Yummy!! I will be back since it is so good, so close to work and so affordable! Thanks again to my server, she was great! 

NOTE: Bring a few quarters for parking during main meal time hours, the parking lot is reserved so you have to park in the coin parking but really close, not a long walk or anything.
