A few days ago I was extremely bummed out to find my Blackberry Bold not accepting charge.  I called into this Verizon store  today asking a simple question of whether or not they do repairs for charging ports.  Monty, who answered the phone, informed me they do not do phone repairs in the store and inquired more about my problem.  He was able to look into my situation and discovered it was an issue still under warranty.  I was just about to be in the midst of filing an insurance claim before I called, which would have costed me just a little over 100 dollars.  Instead, my like-new phone from the store will be arriving this Friday.  Thank you Monty and Verizon Wireless for always having the BEST customer service!
