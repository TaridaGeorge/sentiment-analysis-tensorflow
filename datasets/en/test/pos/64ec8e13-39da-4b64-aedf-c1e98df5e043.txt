Finally was able to check out the actual bar area of this wonderful establishment! We had three beer samplers between the two of us because we could not make up our minds what we wanted to drink. They are super helpful here and they know their shit when it comes to beer, Chill low key vibe inside. Strictly beer, no food but people were bringing in their own stuff to eat so you can always bring your own grub if you wish. Tap rotates frequently; even changed a few while we were there so you will always be able to try out something new!
