I just love going here!  You can find anything you need and a whole bunch of eccentric and cool gifts that you know no one else will have!  

So normally I go there to browse in their extensive wine selection and end up leaving with a few bottles of dessert wine.  Or I grab some sake, which I absolutely love and can't find anywhere else.

It's at this point when I hit up their deli for a delicious tuna salad sandwich.  It's so disgustingly good, it's sinful!  The people that work there are so nice and helpful!

All in all, just a great experience!
