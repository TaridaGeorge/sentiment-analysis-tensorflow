i would say this is a dive bar. but it's kind of big for a dive... and it's got a pretty big patio, which doesn't really seem to be a "dive" thing. but you can bet on horses and dogs and that's pretty dive-esque.

a big, four-sided bar right in the middle and shuffle board (any bar with shuffle board pretty much kicks ass) and a skill crane game. they do free texas hold 'em every weekend, and all the participants are friendly and it's a good time.

they serve food, the wings are kind of awesome, but i'm not a wing connoissuer by any means. a great, cheap little bar to escape to when the usual scene gets old, i affectionately refer to it as the "Ho-Ho."
