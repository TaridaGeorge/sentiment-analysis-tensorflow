Our first time at Culvers, and it was a great 107* day for it! The girl at the counter took the liberty of explaining the frozen custard choices as we stood there with our blank stares.....what to get? They have a flavor of the day, as well as chocolate and vanilla. Then you can get a shake, sundae, cone or mixer (kind of like a blizzard at DQ). I opted for the mint and oreo and my husband got peanut butter cups and bananas.  We paid under $7 for two smalls.
They give you a number, you find a table and they bring you your custard! Hooray!!
