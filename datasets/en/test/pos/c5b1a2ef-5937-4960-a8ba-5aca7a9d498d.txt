There's a reason the pistachio gelato costs most than any other flavor; it's freakin' awesome. Rarely does pistachio gelato taste so warm, buttery and smooth.  The roasted pistachios are imported from sicily for this mix. All I can say is HEAVEN. And.. I'm not ususally a big pisatchio fan. This place is not to be missed - especailly after having the fabulous pizza next door.
They also offer creative mixed flavors such as Valentino, a combination of pomegranate, rose petals, lavender and dry berries.
