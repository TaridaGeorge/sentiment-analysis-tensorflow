Jeremiah is great! He is very friendly, patient, and knows what he's doing! 

We started off with the Drunken Cheesy Bread, it's ok. Not something I would want again. Nothing wrong with it, just not my taste. 

For lunch, I had the Chicken Parmesan sandwich, along with a house salad. The sandwich is great. Loved it. 
The house salad... I mean, I could not stop eating it. I have no idea which kind of dressing was on it, but it was AMAZING. I am craving it just thinking about it. 

The interior is very clean, roomy, very casual. I heard they have great happy hour, so I will be back again.
