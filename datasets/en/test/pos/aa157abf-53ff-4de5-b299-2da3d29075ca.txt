Beautiful grounds, great rooms and the restaurant is excellent!!! It's our favorite place for brunch. The room we stayed at was great and the bed was so damn comfortable that  we woke up in the middle of the night to comment on how comfortable the bed was!!

The spa was OK, unfortunately my therapist kept talking and talking and talking and I was a wuss (yeah, I know...) and didn't told him to please just....shut up! 
The pool area is tiny, so if you're interested in more of a pool scene, this is not the place.

4.5 but I'll round up because of the best bed ever!!
