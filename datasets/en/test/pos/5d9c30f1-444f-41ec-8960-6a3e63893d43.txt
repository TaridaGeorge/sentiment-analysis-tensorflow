Binkley's is wonderful. Cafe Bink is a similar joy, just more casual, and it's easier to get a table. The Duck Confit is to die for - - - and my favorite meal in 2008. The mussels are consistently excellent, and the fries - oh my - excellent, with 3 complementary dip sauces. Amy's bolognese is magnificently memorable - and a special, secret recipe. Best I've ever had. Finish it all off with a rotating choice of tasty desserts while relaxing under the shadow of Black Mountain. In the north Valley, what would we do without Cafe Bink and Binkley's? Highly recommended.
