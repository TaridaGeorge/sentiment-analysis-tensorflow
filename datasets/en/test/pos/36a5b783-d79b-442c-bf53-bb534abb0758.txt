Last minute trip east and had to have a sports coat and tie. Went to the MW on Camelback and they had the perfect set up. Problem aw, it was a 2 for1 sale.....man I'm traveling! Don't have room for 2 coats, 2 shirts and 2 ties that I will never wear.

No can do!! They explain....so my search, just by chance, took me to the MW on Tatum.

Enter Travis and Rich. I explained the situation....and they're answer was "you get we can take care of you!"  we found the same coat....the same shirt....and an even better tie!   And they discounted to the sale price for the one set!!  Now that's service!! And that's why I come back!!  To bad the other guy didn't get the memo!!!

Great job Travis and Rich!!
