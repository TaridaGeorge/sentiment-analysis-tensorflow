SUPER FUN!!!  It was my second time going to this small divey type bar...and I really love it!   I went with 6 friends to watch the Cardinal game on Saturday.  This place is laid back and adorable as it feels that you have just spent the day skiing in Aspen and now it is time to enjoy a cocktail or 2 with friends.  Very inexpensive, yummy food, great large TVs, pool table couches and yes even a faux fireplace!  I love the antler chandeliers and the moose head over the front door.  Ask for Casey....he is a great waiter and will take care of you!
