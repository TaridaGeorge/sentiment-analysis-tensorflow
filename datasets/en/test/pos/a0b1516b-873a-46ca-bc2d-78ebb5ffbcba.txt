What a great brunch/lunch place.  The decor was great...The breakfast burrito was excellent, and the servers went above and beyond to satisfy the overly particular freak I was eating with.  I am definitely going back again, without the freak.  If I owned a restaurant/bar establishment, I would hire these two young ladies away from Bacon, in a heartbeat.
