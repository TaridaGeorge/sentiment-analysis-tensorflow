Loral has been integral in helping me to launch a new product line.  She's bent over backwards to make sure we launched with success, and when I stopped by to see our product, she had created such an eye catching display.  I've seen her interact with other vendors as well, and she treats them all like celebrities.  Her whole focus is the greater good and building community.  Everything I've ever seen at ecocentricity! follows through on those missions.  If you're looking for a unique gift, she's the kind of business owner it's important to support.  She's actively seeking them out and bringing them together in a great, one-of-a-kind store.
