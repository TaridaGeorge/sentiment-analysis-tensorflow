Stopped back in here today for lunch with Arlin B., Robyn N. & Mike C.  They're still delivering the same upscale Asian Buffet experience here as before, including atmosphere, food & table service that are just tops so it's "Woohoo" again for this excellent restaurant!!     :-))

(See previous review for more details.  Weekday Lunch Buffet is still $11.99/$10.79 Sr.)
