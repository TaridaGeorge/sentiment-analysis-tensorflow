Loved this place! My friend and I got the groupon deal for the express pedi but there was nothing express about it.  I had no problem making an appointment and the staff was very friendly and did a great job.  The non-groupon prices are totally reasonable which is surprising because my other spa experiences in Scottsdale have been quite pricey. The pedi chairs are wonderful and they are arranged around the perimeter of a large room so if you are ever looking to do a bridal shower or party, this would be an ideal place.
