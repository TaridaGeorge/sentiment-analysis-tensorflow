Delightful and charming atmosphere tucked in the kierland area ( Scottsdale) area.

Four course meal was exceptional with homemade mozzarella, salads with delicious house dressing,  the signature ravioli and Lasagna di Nina and traditional Italian deserts. On a personal note the ravioli was so delicate and light it melted in my mouth, so full of flavor. Appropriate wine list to compliment the menu selection. 

Portions are suitable and the prices are modest in comparison to the fantastic quality.

A lovely family owned restaurant in the heart of Phoenix worth multiple visits. Traditional European dining experience. 

Impossible to find an equivalent quality Italian restaurant in the valley.
