Oh yeah. Awesome. Wait staff was great - not stuffy, they're very accommodating to ignorant first-time newbies.  The ambiance was interesting to say the least, but I love the music they had spinning.  The food, the reason anyone would go to a restaurant like this, was awesome.  I ordered the mackerel sashimi special, and Johnny Chu came out and went over it briefly with a blow torch.  The flavor of the fish, combined with the sauces, was incredible.  I snarfed the entire plate down in about three minutes.  We kept the rest of our order light and a little more traditional, which is hard in a place like this.  The drinks were excellent as well.  I'm coming back here at my earliest opportunity!
