When we finally arrived after a glitch with our GPS we were very happy campers.   The  hostess was very welcoming and the service was excellent from start to finish.  The green chili mac and cheese was excellent as was the shrimp cocktail--the shrimp were huge and very fresh.  My Dr Pepper ribs were excellent and very tender.  My daughter had the grilled shrimp over grits which she also loved.
