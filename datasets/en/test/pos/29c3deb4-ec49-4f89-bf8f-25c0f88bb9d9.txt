I've been there twice now, once for a mani and once for a pedi. Both times they were pretty busy, but very accommodating as long as you didn't mind waiting a little bit. The staff there are very very friendly and the place has a nice atmosphere. The shop isn't too big, about 10 pedi stations and 10 mani stations, but they make great use of the space and you never feel crowded. I'm a dude so I can't say much about their abilities to do gels or powdered nails, but all my friends who have been with me say its good stuff.

I frequently do this and I will for sure continue to come back to Paulenes. Its a good idea to make an appointment on the weekends as it does get really busy, but as I said before, they try to accommodate as best as they can.
