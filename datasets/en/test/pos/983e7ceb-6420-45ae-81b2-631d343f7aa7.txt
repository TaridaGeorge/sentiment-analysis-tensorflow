Had breakfast there this morning.  Under new management.  The staff is now much faster and on the ball and on top of it.  Very friendly and fast.   I had perfect poached eggs and super yummy wheat toast.  Coffee still delicious as always.  The girls had fantastic strawberry pancakes (i prefer the bannana ones).

Fresh layout and lighter paint job.

If they want perfection....they would do some acoustic treatment to the ceiling to knock down the sound level.  Someone threw some dishes in a bin behind the counter and the lady sitting nearby just about jumped out of her chair.
