Epiq is epic!!!!! 

After being fully revamped this summer, Epiq has become a new favorite for an awesome night out! It is nothing short of amazing! Once inside, the club has floor to ceiling mirrors that resonate the flashing LED lights on the walls and continuous laser lighting.  The music has been on point (EDM), with great DJs including the house DJ the STIQ, dressed just like the Stig from the show, Top Gear.  Most of the club is taken up by two levels of tables on either side of the dance floor, with the best table service. A table is the best way to experience Epiq... to dance the night away & some of those liquid calories too ;)
