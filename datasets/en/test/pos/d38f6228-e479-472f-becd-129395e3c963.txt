This has become my go to restaurant for burgers. It all started with just wanting a cheap burger alternative to fast food. Mondays their burgers are $5.55. Great! Little did I know it would become my favorite burger ever! I'm referring to the Switch house burger. Ordered medium rare it come out a perfect pink inside and super juicy. Only once has it not come out as ordered and they were happy to take care of it for me. I have had other dishes there that were very good. They have food and drink specials every day. Very reasonable prices and excellent service.
