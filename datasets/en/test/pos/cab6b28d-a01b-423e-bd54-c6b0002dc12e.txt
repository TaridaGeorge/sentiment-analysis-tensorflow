Simply the best there is. From their hummus (the jalapeno-cilantro one is my fav), to the chicken pasta (my wife's fav) to the falafel or gyro's... you can't go wrong. Great service, chill atmosphere, decent prices and... the food.... AMAZING. I don't know why I don't go here more often. And I've frequented alot of them (the one on Apache, Ray Rd in Chandler & Ahwatukee)... They are often busy, especially weekends, but its well worth it. I like the diverse crowd too... its not like its JUST a haven for yogi's & hippies, which is nice. Nothing worse than feeling out of place, and this place, doesnt do that at all.
