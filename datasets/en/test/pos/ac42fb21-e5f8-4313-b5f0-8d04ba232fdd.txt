I think this is my new favorite place...brings back so many memories of delicious, home cooked meals on the East Coast!  I ordered the jumbo stuffed shells and it came with a side salad and garlic bread, an Orangina and a cannoli.  I could not have been happier with my choices...yummy!  

I am excited to head back here and pick up items for a picnic.  So many great choices of meats, cheeses, salads, desserts etc.  

Friendly staff too!
