OK, each star represents a visit during my less-than-48 hour visit to PHX. YES, I WENT TO NAMI FIVE TIMES IN TWO DAYS. Don't judge. Vegan soft serve is hard to find, people.

3 trips were for tSoynamis.  AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!  had Fluffernutterin, Chai Tiramisu & S'mores.  brought non-vegan friends & they loved it, too.

2 trips were for coffee. the lattes were yummy.  also had a yogurt parfait, delish!

Amazing looking pastries- saving that for next time.

Staff are super friendly & hip & helpful.
