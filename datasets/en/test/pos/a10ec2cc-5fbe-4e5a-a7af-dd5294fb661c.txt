This store looks like one of those thrift stores from the outside but it takes seconds before you realise that they have an exquisite collection. 
My mom-in-law stays away from dark coloured garments because she is dark-skinned herself. Banning 'dark' makes it even more difficult for us to find appropriate swimwear in stores that revel in gloomy spandex. After rummaging through the over-priced tacky swim suits at Nordstrom and Macy's I breathed a sigh of relief at WWWS. 

The lady in the store, probably the owner, assisted us as soon as we stepped in. After assessing our requirements she directed us to the right racks. My mom-in-law pulled out atleast 10 good ones in her size and fit. We walked out with a fabulous swimsuit is olive green and red.
