This place just opened. I must say a hidden treasure indeed amongst all the strip malls across Chandler.

My friend took me here last weekend and I must say, this place impressed me. Being a sushi snob from LA, the portions were quite large and in charge and the sushi was fresh. 

Their Albacore was delicious. Melted in my mouth with the ginger and ponzu sauce. They also have some killer lunch specials and the staff have exotic eyes (one with blue eyes and one with a lazy). The tempura was also good- not oily at all and very fresh. Try their bento box lunches. Lots of food- most of it under $9 with edamame and miso.

Decor is gross but honestly come here for the sushi. It's really good for the price! (lunch for 4 was only $35!)
