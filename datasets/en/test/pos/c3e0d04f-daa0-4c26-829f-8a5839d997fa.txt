I still want to live here.  It's quite possibly the only vegan restaurant I could see myself flying here to eat at then going home.    

I've tried a number of things, and have come to the conclusion that this is the combination that will satisfy me each time:  

Green Burger with thyme fries and the Cookies n Cream Tsoynami.  

Their Green Burger trumps The Plant Cafe and Roam in SF--the only two places I've been to that somewhat mimic it (at least in color).
