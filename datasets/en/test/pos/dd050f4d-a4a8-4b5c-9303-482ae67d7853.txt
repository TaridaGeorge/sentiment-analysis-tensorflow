The place is huge and beautiful inside and outside. The entrance is somewhat hidden.

The service is very friendly and helpful from the moment that you enter, and there are employees everywhere!

I ordered the handcrafted strawberry lemonade. It was delicious.

I inquired about the spiciness of the crawfish étouffée, and ordered it with a request to kick up the Cajun a bit. I've been craving for some good étouffée since a recent visit to a place in Bakersfield.

The crawfish étouffée was excellent, the portions are huge. My order was accidentally split in half, and each half was huge! 

Yummy...

A freshly baked loaf of bread was delivered to my table.

Robert was a great server and did a great job! Thanks robert!
