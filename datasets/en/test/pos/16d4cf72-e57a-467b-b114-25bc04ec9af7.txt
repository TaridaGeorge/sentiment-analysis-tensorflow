I love this store. The salespeople are much friendlier than at T&CO.  They have let me try on my dream engagement ring on multiple occasions, given me booklets, heck the saleslady once offered to email my boyfriend the ring/details. (Which would have probably sent him running for the hills.) Anyway, if ever the time comes that we go ring shopping this will be my my first stop.
