Things to note - Roughly 30 draft and 150 bottled beers are never a bad thing; when you brew your own beer and are still ballsy enough to sell other beers, it's usually not a bad thing; when your servers are personable, helpful, and non-presumptuous, beer tastes sweeter; and finally, when you can either drink the bar's beer on premises or take it home with you, I'm completely sold.

Good prices paired with an outstanding selection make for a "don't miss" combo.  I was happy with the Oude Zuipers tripel-style ale while my fiancee enjoyed a unique IPL (India pale lager) from another local brewery.   We haven't eaten here but I'm sure that will come in time as beer undoubtedly generates hunger.
