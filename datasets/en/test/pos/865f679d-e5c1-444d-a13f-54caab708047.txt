I'm giving this a gracious review. I was hesitant in trying this place out since I am not fan of places like SW. However, I am so pleased I did try Firehouse! I had the smoked turkey on their honey wheat bread with jalapenos! It was delicious, warm and fresh. I will definitely be back!! Super close to my home and say NO to SW with the quality of Firehouse deli meats and bread it's a MUST try! I will have to try their other specialty subs. 

Customer service was very nice and appreciated! : )
