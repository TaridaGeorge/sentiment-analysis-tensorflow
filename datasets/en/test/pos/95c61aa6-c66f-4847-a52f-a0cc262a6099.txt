Did I know that Fuego Tacos boasted the best Pernil Asado tacos in Phoenix? Nope. Did I try them? Yep. Were they really the best? Hell yes. I could not believe how flavorful and juicy the meat was, and it was topped with a light pineapple salsa and sugar cured cabbage to complement it perfectly! 

I love how simple (yet cool) this taco joint is. You can order pernil asado, carne asado, chicken, fish, shrimp, or vegetable... and you can have it in two tacos or one big ole' burrito! The chips and salsa served when you are first seated were also equally amazing. The chips were hand made and very fresh and the pureed salsa had just the right amount of spice to it!
