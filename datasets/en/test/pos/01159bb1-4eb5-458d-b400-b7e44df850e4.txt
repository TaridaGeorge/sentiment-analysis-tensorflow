Gotta say, for a dry cleaner, this really is as good as it gets!

The service here is unbelievable!  When I walk in I am always greeted with a huge smile and warm welcome from atleast 1, but usually 2 or 3 of the people working there.  Seriously, you would think that this is the best job in the world from their smiling faces and positive attitudes.  I love it.

I always bring coupons so the prices are great.  They do a good job on the shirts - have only had 1 "issue" where the shirt had been pressed funny and had a weird crease, but they re-did for free, no hassle.

I know it's hard to get excited about a dry cleaner, but these employees do and it's contagious because I'm super excited to have them doing my dry cleaning!  Thanks Delia's!!!  =)
