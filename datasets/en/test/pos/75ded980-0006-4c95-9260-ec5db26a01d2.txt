This place was my first experience with chicken and waffles and man it was GOOD! The place was super authentic. Loved the waitresses and waiters. Though it was really hectic trying to serve our table, they all had a great sense of humor and were just overall very friendly.

Now to the food. Man, who knew how good the fried chicken-waffle combo is. However to be honest, the fried fish was even better! If i ever go back here, that's the combo I'd be getting...fried fish and waffles. It sounds not as appetizing, but trust me! It's good!
