If your looking for a good peanut curry or amazing Pad Thai, this is the place! My boyfriend and I go here all the time and we seriously crave this place like no other.
Food is always excellent, good portions, decent prices. Take out or sit in we have always had a great experience. Friendly and fast service! Yum!
