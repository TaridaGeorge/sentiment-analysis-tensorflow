I have used A-Professional Locks on referral from a friend to get locks rekeyed (12 locks and not one problem).  Recently my 90 year old neighbor had a front door she could not get out because a little spring inside the handle broke.  I went to all the logical places Ace Hardware, Home Depot, Lowes...waste of time.  Then I tried the internet...bigger waste of time.  I went to A -Professional and showed them the part (didn't even have the exact manufacturer)...the part that was broken is not available but they had an old unused knob to get the part I needed!  In this day and age it is hard to find a business with TOTAL INTEGRITY...definitely use these guys for anything and feel confident you are dealing with the best !!!!!!
