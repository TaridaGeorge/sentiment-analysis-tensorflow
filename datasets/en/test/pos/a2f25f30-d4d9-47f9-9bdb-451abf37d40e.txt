I like this place.  There are so many flavors of ice cream here.  It's fresh, it's fattening, it's delicious.

I just have to say that this place reminds me of my grandparents.  Every time I eat here I sit back and think of the vague memory of my grandfather taking me to a soda shop in downtown Glendale, and taking me to some train park as a kid.  The world was simpler then.  I am greatful for the reminder of times long passed.
