Can't sing enough praise for The Garage.

Happy Hour with the half priced appetizers is the best. You can get 4 big-ass grilled lamb chops for $7, and they will honor your Groupon as well.

Speaking of Groupon, they usually run "NOW" deals that you could redeem for lunch any weekday.

Hands down my favorite restaurant in Phoenix.
