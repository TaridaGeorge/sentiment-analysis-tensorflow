I'm from Las Vegas, riding the Valley Metro Rail for the second time now. The vehicles are very clean and sleek looking, the payment was quick and easy, the ride smooth, and the ticket fares were not outrageus for light rail. Only $1.75 for a one way trip. I wish we had something as nice in Las Vegas! Best part is that the north terminus point ends right in front of a huge, brand new SuperTarget! I will for sure be riding this anytime I'm in Phoenix.
