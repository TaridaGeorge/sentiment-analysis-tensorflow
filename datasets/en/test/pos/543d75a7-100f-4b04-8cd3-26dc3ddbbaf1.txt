On a business trip to Scottsdale, my colleagues and I found Chelsea's Kitchen on Yelp, and since the ratings were mostly very good, we decided to give it a try for lunch.  Thank you very much, Yelp!  While the wait was a bit long, it was worth every minute.  The food is phenomenal, service impeccable, atmosphere friendly.... this is now my go-to place whenever I'm in Phoenix.  I'd give it 6 Stars if I could!
