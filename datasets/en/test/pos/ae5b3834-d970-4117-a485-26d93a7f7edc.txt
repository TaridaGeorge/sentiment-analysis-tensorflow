Shriner's souvenir chapeau and a mid-century office lamp. Plymouth Fury dealer's advertisement. Suavecito pomade. Cigarette machine. Amazing finds abound--felt a bit like Indiana Jones digging for priceless artifacts.

Another reason to consider renting a place in Phoenix for the winter months. The woman behind the counter (like everyone in Phoenix, it seems) was warm, friendly and had a knack for pointing out the best stuff. Yes, Go, Kat, Go--even if it takes five and a half hours to get there from home!

Didn't see a cat, but would imagine that s/he would be equally informative!
