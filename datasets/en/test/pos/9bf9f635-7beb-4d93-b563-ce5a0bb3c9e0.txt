Really, really impressed with the vibe in this place. Filmbar is a nice mix of 60's throwback and Moroccan lounge. Sat at the bar and chatted with the bartenders and owner Kelly. Having just spent the last year in NYC....told him it felt like we never left.

There was a constant flow of people in just for drinks and to catch the next flick. I can't wait to come down and catch a film.

Great beer selection including lots of AZ beers. Love supporting local businesses. 

Bought a gift certificate for a friend's birthday.
