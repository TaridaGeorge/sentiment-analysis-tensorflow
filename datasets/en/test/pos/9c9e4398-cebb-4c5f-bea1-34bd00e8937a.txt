I came by here today to get my car washed after driving up to Payson... dirty with bugs and whatnot.  This place does all washes by hand so it does take a little longer than the automatic places... but I feel it was definitely worth the wait.  My car was so clean and pristine.  They do a great job and the employees are all so nice.   I will definitely be returning.
