Last night's "free time" was the best!  I had 1 Key Lime martini (not too sweet, a tiny bit tart and delicious) and 1 Coconut martini which was AMAZING.  Allow me to say it again, AMAZING.  Sweet and true coconut flavor!  I want another one now.  The galettes appetizer was very nice, the shrimp cocktail was ok and the desserts we shared were delicious!  The booths are comfy and our waiter was very nice.  Yes, it's a "beautiful people" place, but I was very happy and comfy and wrapped in the haze of good martinis :-)
