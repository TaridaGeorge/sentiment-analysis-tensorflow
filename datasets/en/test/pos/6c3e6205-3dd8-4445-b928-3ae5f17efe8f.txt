My co-worker and I went to Pita Shack for lunch today for the first time. I will have to say the food and services was over the top great. We walked up to the counter and was greated with a great big smile. We told the gentlemen that it was our first time there. He took the time to explain the menu and even gave us a lesson on how to pronounce dishes...I did a great job but my co-worker not so much.  The food is fresh not frozen and made to order.  I had the Chicken Shawerma sandwich and it was very very tasty. My co-worker had the greek salad and she ate every bite. I highly recommend this establishment. 

I will be returning for sure!
