I can honestly say this is the most I've laughed at a dinner theatre! The cast is witty and very funny! I have seen two of their shows now and always wish I had invited more friends. I'm so glad they have started shows on the west side too! 

My only discretion, if you're looking for a normal, conservative show, this may not be your best choice. It's more out of the box and the interactive but that's what I love about it!
