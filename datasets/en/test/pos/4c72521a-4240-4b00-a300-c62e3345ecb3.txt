Why isn't this place bigger???  During the tourist season, it is hard to get a reservation for this tiny neighborhood Italian restaurant.  Why?  Because the food is really good.  

Although Tesoro is in a minor mall, you should not think that this is your typical local Italian joint -- pizza, spaghetti, watery sangria, etc.  On the contrary, Tesoro is Italian fine dining, but with a slighty lower price.  

Of course, we only tried a sampling of their dishes, but I'll bet that everything is delicious.  The portions are not overly large, so you will have room for an appetiser, but by the time we finished, no one had enough appetite to order a dessert.  

NOTE:  I did overhear them saying they were closing for parts of July and August, so call ahead.  You will want a reservation anyway.
