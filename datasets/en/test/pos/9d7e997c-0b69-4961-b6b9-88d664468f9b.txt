If I'm having lunch in Old Town, chances are I'll be at 5th and Wine. I really liked 5th and Wine the first time I tried it, but I didn't guess it would become such a go-to place for me. It's a great place for lunch and I know I'll really enjoy my meal there. 

I went with a friend on Saturday and we both had their Prosciutto and Brie Panini with that comes with fig jam, arugula and balsamic vinegar. It comes on toasty sourdough bread with charred grill marks. Great combo!! Kind of like their bruschetta but as a whole sandwich! 

I took my mom there for lunch yesterday and we shared a plate of bruschettas. We had the bruschettas listed in my last review but subbed the tomato one for the pepper-crusted steak and horseradish (so good!)
