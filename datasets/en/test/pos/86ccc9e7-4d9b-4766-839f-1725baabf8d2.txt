Some might be satisfied with the blackened cardboard and meat filler they serve down the street from Two Hippies at "the place which will remain nameless" (yellow arches may or may not be involved), but I, for one, love to bite into a burger that tastes of beef and zany condiments.

I've long been a loyal customer Lucky Boy on 16th and Osborn for their burgers and fries.  I've gone there off-and-on for around 5 years, but I think after eating a Bacon Burger with fries from THMMB's, I've become a convert.  Not only was it good, it was better than any other burger I've had in the downtown/metro area.  

It's official: everything Two Hippies does is delicious magic.  Hooray for local Arizona businesses that outdo the competition (including competition from national chains!)!!
