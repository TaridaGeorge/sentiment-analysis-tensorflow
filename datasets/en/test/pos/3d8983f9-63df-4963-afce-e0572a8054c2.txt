Okay, here's how bad it is...My husband and I went to Cartel in December/January ONCE during a visit to AZ for the holidays and nine months later (today), I saw an art website that mentioned exhibiting in the Cartel Coffee Lab...and not really one to remember places like coffee shops, this was one we couldn't forget!   It was the kind of place we wish we had in our neighborhood.  The coffee is amazing, it's smooth, rich, and delicious.  Yes, they're a bit noisy, yes, they're fussy about what they serve but that can be a good thing, right?  Especially if the standards are high.  And, yes, it's hard to find.  But, yes! they have wireless.
