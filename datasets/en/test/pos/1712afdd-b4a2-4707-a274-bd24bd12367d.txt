I live an exit away I can't believe I'm just now coming here after 4months. Food was delicious, nothing fancy or pretty just tastes great. Raymundo was our server and he was so nice! All the waiters and waitresses seemed friendly and close as they joked with one another and working quickly but very well together. Customer Service is more than half of the reason I keep coming back to places. You either got it or you don't and this place has it!
