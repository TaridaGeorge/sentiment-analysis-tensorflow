The owner Serge was very French, but his head chef was not. I loved that their head chef came from another culture. He had fallen in love with French food. So much so, he had moved to France to study it there. The dishes he created were perfectly delicous. I remember his filet with crushed peppercorns; it was soft and buttery. The peppercorns gave a kick without being overpowering. The quail was delicate and succulent. The salad with lavender honey vinaigrette was perfection. His chocolate spice cake was phenomenal. It contained seven spices. I can't begin to describe the joy that cake brought to everyone. It was unique. It was at the time when chocolate souffles were at every French restaurant. Unfortunately, he's not there anymore. Regardless, my rating will remain until I have a chance to go back and say otherwise.
