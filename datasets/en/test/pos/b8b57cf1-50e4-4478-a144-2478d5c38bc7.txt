We're from the San Francisco Bay Area visiting the Phoenix area.
One of our regular stops is to the Honey Bear BBQ (done this for years).....and it's always the same: great tasting BBQ and friendly service.  We now have all of our friends come here on their visits to Phoenix and they share the same sentiments.
