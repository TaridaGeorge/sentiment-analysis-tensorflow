As a single mother, I have to admit that I sometimes need help with household fixes. Over the years, Turn It On Electric has been my go-to company for those "honey do" things. They have done rewiring, installation of lights, updates of switches, and even some troubleshooting on the electrical components of my pool pump. Without hesitation, I would recommend Turn It On to anyone.
