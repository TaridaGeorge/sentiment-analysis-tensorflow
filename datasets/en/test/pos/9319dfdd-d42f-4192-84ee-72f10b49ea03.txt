This has become my "go to" place in Tempe.  At this point I've had probably half of the items on the menu and have not been disappointed once.  They have Union Jack IPA on draft which, if you like IPA's, really can't be beat.  Brandon (I believe is the manager) is always friendly, attentive and helpful.  I hate to recommend this place because it's packed enough already - but hey, they deserve the business.
