This place is a perfect combination of very simple and fresh food with a very unique local feel.

Their service is like their food: consistent and simple.  My favorite item is their Sea Chicken sandwich.  It's chunks of tuna with cheese, mayo and jalape√±o peppers.  I'd never have imagine it would be so tasty!

Their bread is soft and a good choice for a sandwich -- or I'll buy a loaf (which they will slice for you by hand while you wait) and make french toast.

Their desserts are smooth and creamy with a perfect amount of sugar.

I can't get over how good their food is.  Again, it's a very simple shop.  Don't expect frills, except with the food that you order.  Get some cookies to go, any of their unique Japanese pastries or some very traditional American ones, too.
