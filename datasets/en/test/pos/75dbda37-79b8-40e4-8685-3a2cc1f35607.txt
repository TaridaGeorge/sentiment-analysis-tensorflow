Wow!  This company provides great, fast, reasonably priced service, and are wonderful with any follow-up concerns.  They installed a new door for me the day after I called them, and then when I had a "thunk" noise a few days later, Gary came out within a half hour of my call and took care of it completely.  I'm so impressed with Avondale Garage Doors, with Jeff and with Gary, and will continue to recommend them to anyone and everyone.
