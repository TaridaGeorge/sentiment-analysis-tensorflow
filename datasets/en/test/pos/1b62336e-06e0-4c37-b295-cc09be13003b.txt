Kelly has been my stylist for 5 years.  I've followed her to 3 salons and I'm very excited that she's found her personal studio which has an intimate yet fun ambiance.  Kelly is a skilled artist and an avid communicator, you will get what you want.  For the record, I travel from northern Nevada just to get my hair done by Kelly, the consummate professional who is blessed with positive energy!!!
