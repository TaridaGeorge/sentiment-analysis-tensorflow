I have been going to Postino Winecafe for about a year now, I am so pleased with my experience every time. From the wine selection, to the bruschettas, serving amount/portions, to the atmosphere (the outdoor setting area is beautiful on Arizona evenings). Every person that I bring to Postino Winecafe is pleased with their experience and even go back without me. They have great specials on Sunday afternoons too! With that said, try it out.
