Hands down it is the best Breakfast place in the phoenix metro. I came all the way from Maricopa, AZ to check this place out. I'm not a native Arizonan, but this place competes up there with all the breakfast places I've been to. The pork chop is is awesome! I was lucky enough to be the last guy that made it through the door when it opened hehe.
