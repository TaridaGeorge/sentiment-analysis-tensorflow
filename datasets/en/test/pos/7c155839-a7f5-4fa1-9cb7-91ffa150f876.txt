I've been a morning regular here for many years and I drink my fair share of coffee. This is probably the most consistently good and friendly Starbucks I have visited in the valley. Keep it up, guys! 

I don't do a lot of afternoon/evening coffee, so I can't comment too much on that except to say that the place is fairly quiet in the afternoons and the people who work then seem to be just as friendly.
