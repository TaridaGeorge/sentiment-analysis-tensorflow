So this may be a little premature, because I haven't actually eaten any of this pork yet, but just looking at makes me want to give it 5 stars.

I stumbled on this place after searching for some good pork for sausage making.  I got some pork butt and back fat.  Little did I know that I didn't even need the back fat because the butt had such beautiful marbling and a nice thick fat cap.

I was also able to get some leaf fat, which is very hard to find, but it's the absolute best fat to render into lard for baked goods.

I also snagged a nice grass-fed beef chuck roast, which was surprisingly reasonable given the fact that it's grass-fed.

I will be frequenting this place quite a bit, I think.
