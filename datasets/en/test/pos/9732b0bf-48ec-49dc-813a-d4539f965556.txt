I just finished my muffeleta sandwich from Dlicious Dishes and am trying to figure out a way to get back there as soon as possible to try more of the items! Workies and I ordered sandwiches to bring back from the office. They were D'LICIOUS! While there I also purchased some white truffle oil and 2 large wooden spoons. The place is filled with prepared foods that look amazing and priced well. There are also pastas and sauces and breads and all sorts of gourmet condiments. You need to check it out-- you can eat there or take it home. Either way, your tummy will be happy!
