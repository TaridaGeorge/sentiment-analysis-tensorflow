This place rocks!! Yes, it costs more than a Supercuts ($21 for a haircut), but seriously, it's your hair! Pamper yourself and pay the extra $5! You will be treated to a prompt, precise, barber haircut, straight razor trim (complete with the heated foam) hot towel, aftershave, shoulder massage, TVs, pool table?! Why wouldn't you? Try them today! Dave is my preferred, but if he's off, everyone is legit. Getting married? $45 The Works for you and your groomsman. (cigar included)
