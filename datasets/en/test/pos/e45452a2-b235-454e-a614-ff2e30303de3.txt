I absolutely love this place! I've tried many of the items on the menu and have not been disappointed yet. It's a little pricier than some places, but you get what you pay for! Working in the same office complex it's convenient and easy. I prefer their sandwiches rather than the salads, but then they are known for their sandwiches. You have to have the garlic sauce. It's the best!!
