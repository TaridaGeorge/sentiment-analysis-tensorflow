Went here with the gf. Fun and entertaining place to drink and have a good time. 

First of all, good luck finding any eating whatsoever. 

Two pianos duke it out with classic songs and you can request songs with a tip. Don't think they only play cheesy showtunes. They do at times, and sometimes you can just sit there laughing at grown men belting out every word like they are own stage. Other times they drag unwilling people to stage and make them sing the words. 

All in all, a good time. Minus the Arizona heat.
