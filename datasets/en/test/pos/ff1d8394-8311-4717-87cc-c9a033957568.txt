Have spent the better part of three days here while a friend (who lives nearby and needs to be near his house while we work) developing some Social Media webinar material.  Haven't found anything about The Coffee Shop that I haven't loved.  Have had the coffee (very good), the muffin/coffee cakes, a lunch and now an award winning Boston Cream Pie Cupcake.  Oh, had the Chorizo Burrito the first morning.  Their sweet tasting salsa was a great compliment to the spicy but very tasty Chorizo Burrito.  If I was here I may never step in another Starbucks again...
