My family and I love this place!! 

The outdoor open market feel is very nice and has a delicious upscale feel to it. My favorite spots at the village are:

Coach - Friendliest location I have ever experianced
White House Black Market - " same as above"
Macy's - smaller selection than the one at the Chandler Mall. However, they are never super busy here and the workers are especially helpful.

San Tan also offers one of the best play areas I have seen around. The children's play area is on what my family calls the "kids wing" of the village. It has a size-able splash pad in the summer and various displays and meet and greets during the year.

The only store San Tan Village seems to be missing is the Gap & Abercrombie which is a small bummer considering those are my daughters favorite stores.
