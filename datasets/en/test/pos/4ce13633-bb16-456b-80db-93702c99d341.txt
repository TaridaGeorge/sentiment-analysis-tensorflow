I recently adopted a precious cat. I went to Tempe Feed and Tack because of the reviews I read here. At first I thought their prices would be beat by local pet stores. However I found instead that many of the high quality products they keep on hand cannot be purchased at chain pet stores and online they are at a greater cost. In addition to this, they gave me good advice and were super friendly. I will definitely be giving them more of my business.
