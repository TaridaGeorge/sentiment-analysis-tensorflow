Amy and Byron were SO amazing and made the entire experience so comfortable, very professional in every way possible. The pictures came out so great! Amy did my hair and make up and made me feel absolutely amazing. The photos are a gift for my boyfriend who is stationed in Afghanistan as a Christmas / Birthday present. I cannot wait for him to see them!
