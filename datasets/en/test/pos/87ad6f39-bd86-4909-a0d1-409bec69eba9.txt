Dr Espinoza is an amazing dentist who has completely changed my life. I was born with bad teeth, some were missing, they were crooked, and I had a big split in the middle. I had the front teeth crowned when I was in my 20's and it was the worst job you have ever seen! Dr Espinoza has entirely reconstructed my mouth...He knows how to make a person feel good about themselves by creating a beautiful smile for them. It has changed me inside out. He has actually performed a miracle and made my dreams come true!
