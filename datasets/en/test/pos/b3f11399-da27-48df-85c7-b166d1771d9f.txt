By far the best experience I have ever had at a hotel!  The customer service was amazing.
I planned my friend's bachelorette party here and they were so accommodating.  They even sent up hand-written notes and a bottle of champagne.
The hotel in general is gorgeous!  The rooms are spectacular and so is the pool, bar, lobby, etc.
When I come to Scottsdale next, no doubt I will be staying at the W!
