I LOVE THIS STORE!!! This place has everything from shoes and clutches/purses to earrings and rings, ect. they even have wine glasses to match!!! The absolute PERFECT accessory store and all completely affordable prices. I shop there every time I'm in the area visiting family! I just wish they had a sore out here in California!! I'd be there ALLL the time! If you're lucky enough to live near one, I HIGHLY suggest you go!
