One of the best breakfast places in the valley, hands down.

We book a reservation for 8:45 am on Mother's Day and get right in (yay!).

Employees are extremely friendly,personable, and accommodating. Checked up on us just the right amount. 

It was my family of 4 that dined in. We ordered Hot Mama (a tad spicy which I like), she had Eggs Benedict, my son had Blueberry Hill (Pancakes), and we also had my baby, who didn't order :)

The orange juice is delicious, and also the hot chocolate (I know it's summertime in Phoenix!).

The food is unbelievable, worth what they are asking. Our bill was $38.

They are also very active on social media with their FB fan page and Twitter, which appeals to me.

I GUARANTEE you won't be disappointed
