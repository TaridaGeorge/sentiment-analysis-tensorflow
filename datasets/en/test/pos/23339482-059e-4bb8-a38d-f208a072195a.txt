have had them to my house a number of times (we live in an old house) They are always professional and courteous.  He originally quoted me a price for some work that needed to be done, but once he got in there and realized that he didn't need to do as much work, he charged me less.  I would have had no idea, it's very nice to see that integrity and honesty is not all gone.  I will use noone else for my plumbing problems ever.
