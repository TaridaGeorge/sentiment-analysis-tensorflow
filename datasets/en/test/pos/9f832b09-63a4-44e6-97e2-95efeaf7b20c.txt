Omg!!!! So good, I didn't even finish eating to write this!! Uruguay grass fed and finished beef cooked over coals, gives it that flavor that u can't create wit anything else!! No soy, canola and they can do gluten free. I'm in love!! The fries are done in rice bran oil, no HFCs used either!! Taste is like heaven on earth!!!
