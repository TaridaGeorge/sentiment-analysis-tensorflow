This is a wonderful restaurant. We have always loved the food and ambiance.   I recently gave a baby shower here and they helped me to make it a great success!  We were given a private room with a great table setting.  We had an extra table for all the gifts.  The food was delicious, the service was excellent.  Everyone had a wonder time.  I cannot thank the staff enough!  I know this event will be remembered for a long time by all who attended.  Thank you!

When you eat dinner here, don't miss the bread pudding.  It is "to die for!"
