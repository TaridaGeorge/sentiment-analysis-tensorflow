So not like after 63 reveiws and still a 5 star rating is my review necessary as I think we all get the point....BUT it is just so good I have to put in my 2 cents!

The flavors, the textures, the sweet girls behind the counter...everything is fantastic! I love love love the salted butter carmel and the basil lime sorbet is wonderful!

Seriously...can't get enough of this place!!
