The good:

Happy Hour! Great quiet location(not directly next to a busy street), beautiful woman left and right, great club like atmosphere. If you want to have a night out at a "cool" place with friends Ra is it.

The bad:

For the money not the best sushi. But for happy hour you can't beat the deal and this becomes a great value. You will get a great experience. Also it can be packed over the weekend so get there by 5 P.M to catch the happy hour.
