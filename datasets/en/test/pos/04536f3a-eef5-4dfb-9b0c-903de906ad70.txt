Went there today for the first time for color and cut.  Fabulous place and my hair stylist Christian understood exactly what I wanted with my asian hair and I love it! The cut was fabulous.   Great communication and prices.  I would definitely keep going back and would recommend it to my friends and family.  I was definitely not disappointed.  Thank you, Christian, for the great job you did on my hair.
