Pizzeria Bianco is a amazing place. Their Margarita with prosciutto and Biancoverde are my favorite pizzas. Yes the wait is long but worth it. You need to plan that you will be there the entire night. We usually arrive a little after 7PM and get a table right before 10 PM. I don't mind being next door at Bar Bianco drinking some wine with friends and a few appetizers. All in all, this is the best pizza in the country!
