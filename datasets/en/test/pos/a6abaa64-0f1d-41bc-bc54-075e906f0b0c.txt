My boyfriend asked me to be his girlfriend here over two years ago. Automatic 5 stars...

No, but really, Teakwoods (both this and the Phoenix location) has the BEST wings in Phoenix. For a sports bar, it's pretty neat. Tons of space, great food, drink specials, and tons of peanuts (which you can just toss on the ground as you please). Their hot wings are very hot-- I like to go for the El Hefe style wings finished on the grill (with the suicide sauce on the side). Mmmm mmm.
