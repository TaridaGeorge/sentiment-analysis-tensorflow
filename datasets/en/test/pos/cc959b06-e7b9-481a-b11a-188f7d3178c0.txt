Liberty Market is one of my all-time favorite places to eat. Great food, great vibe, great service. We go there for family dinners, birthday celebrations, date nights, girls' night out, or working lunches.

Favorites: picnic sandwich, caprese side dish, chicken pasta, crab cakes, red velvet cake, chocolate chip banana bread, cortadito.

I love the way the owners interact with their customers on Twitter.

Only negative experience I've had is I once had the caprese sandwich and it blew my socks off, but then the 2nd time it was dry and cold. Hoping it was just an off day. 

I (and all my friends) highly recommend Liberty Market!
