Love that they have full hot breakfasts, not just reheated breakfast sandwiches.  Best part is the thick buttered fresh toast.  I placed my order at the register, and a few minutes later, my eggs/potatoes/toast was delivered to my table, hot and delicious.  Large portion as well, so good value.  The staff walks around cleaning and asking if everything is ok.  The rest of their menu looked great- i got to try the chopped salad that was wonderful with very fresh ingredients...wish I had a chance to try more before I left Arizona. This location was spacious and has outdoor seating.  Sooooo much better than Panera Bread.
