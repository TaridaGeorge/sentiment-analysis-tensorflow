Lolo's is ridiculously good! I usually get fried chicken smothered in gravey and onions with a waffle on the side. There is nothing about this food that's good for you, but your taste buds will thank you!
I've been to Lolo's several times and I've always had to wait in line for a table. Parking isn't so great either, so you may have to walk a block or so after you find a spot.
