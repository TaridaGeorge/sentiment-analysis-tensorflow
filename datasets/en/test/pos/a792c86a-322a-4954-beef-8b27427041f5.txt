I can't think of a better Wine Bar to come relax at with a few glasses (or bottles!) and some tasty appetizers.  Count on Bomberos as a great destination to gather with some friends in an atmosphere that has all the warmth and relaxation of a lounge, with a little of the spice and energy of somewhere zesty.

The wine and the food is good no matter where you sit, but the outdoor seating by the fire is where I like to be.  Plush seating in a perfectly-sized garden under the stars (not too big, not too small), who doesn't want to meet up here for some downtime, any night of the week?

Try the paninis and bruschetta, especially any of them with salami, pesto, brie and proscuitto.  Yum.
