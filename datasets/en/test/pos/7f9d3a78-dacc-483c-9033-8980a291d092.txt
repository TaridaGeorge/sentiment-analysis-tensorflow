On a 99-degree day in I hMarch, I had a tasty, simple, and fresh prosciutto and parmesan sandwich on a great baguette, followed by an out of this world red velvet cupcake and a good americano.  I'm sold!

Seriously, the red velvet cupcake was the finest I've ever had.  I even took a picture and put it on Facebook.  Next time I'm in Phoenix I'm stopping in here for sure.
