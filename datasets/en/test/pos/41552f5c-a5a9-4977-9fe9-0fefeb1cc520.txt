YAY for Dutch Brothers!  I love the blended vanilla chai!  It is awesome and their breakfast bars taste like cookies!  YUMMY!  I do not drink coffee so it is great that their chai is great!  My son loves the strawberry smoothies and the chocolate chip muffin tops!  The people working their are always so happy!
