One of my favorite restaurants. Service is not too bad on busy weekends, but it makes up for the excellent food they serve. The owner decided to put two teppanyaki grills and it wasn't a bad decision, at all. If you want to save a little money on the teppanyaki, go during lunch. Sushi (rolls, sashimi, nigiri) are always awesome.
