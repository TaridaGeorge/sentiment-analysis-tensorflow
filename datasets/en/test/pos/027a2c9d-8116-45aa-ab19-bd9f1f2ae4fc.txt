I returned from a biz trip to PHX and my 2002 Ford Expedition would not start due to a bad battery, so after getting a jump, I brought it it Five Star Ford. They are close to my office in the SkySong Center.  They replaced the battery and tested the system. I received a call at 3:00 PM letting me know the vehicle was ready. When I got there, the service cashier was delightfully friendly. When my Expedition was bought up to the cashier's area, I was pleasantly surprised to see they had washed and vacuumed my expedition. The experience the Five Star Ford team delivered, along with flawless repair services completed an hour before they had been scheduled to finish make this dealer a "Five Star" in my book!
