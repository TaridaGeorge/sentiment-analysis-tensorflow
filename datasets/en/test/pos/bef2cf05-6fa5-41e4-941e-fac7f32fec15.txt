I hesitate to write a review because I want this gym all to myself :-p

The owners, Robert and Vicki, are super friendly and informative and still manage to teach me something new each session (I've been working out for a while now, so I was sure I knew everything. NOT!). 

They do a great job with offering a well-rounded health and nutrition plan to get results fast, and it's the good kind of results-- less body fat and more lean muscle, not just numbers on a scale. 

I'd definitely recommend this gym to anyone struggling with motivation and struggling to get their body where they'd like. It's tough, but it's been worth it!
