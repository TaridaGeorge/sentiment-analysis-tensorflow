LOVED this place! Location is prime (parking is a tad tight, but ok), ambiance is adorable and staff is friendly and attentive. 

I had the croissant sandwich and only managed to eat half. It was huge and so were the scones that my friend enjoyed (and only ate half). 

I'm not a huge coffee coniossier, but I had a non-fat iced vanilla latte and it was delish. 

If you're looking for a small and convenient place for a breakfast meeting  - look no further. This is it!
