My wife and I just had lunch today at Cyclo on a recommendation from one of the best restaurants in Chandler.  It is a small restaurant right next to the wall greens.  A perfect example of don't judge a book by its cover.  We got there about 1:30 and place was surprisingly busy for a late lunch.  We were immediately greeted by Justina, which is either the owner or manager, either way very friendly.  I ordered the pad thai and my wife ordered the mint chicken.  The food was incredible.  Best of all Justina came by to check on us and informed us that they allow you to BYOB!  As soon as we got in our car she was on the phone with some friends of ours planning our next trip back.
