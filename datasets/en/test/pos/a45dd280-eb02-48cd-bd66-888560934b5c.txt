Just took the kids here for lunch and had to write a review. My kids loved this place!  We took the advice on this site and ordered ahead.  Our food was ready when we got there and was the perfect temperature-not to mention fabulous!  I have one very picky child and DeFalco's was happy to cater to all of our specifc requests for leaving things out and adding things in.  I did ask the staff about the service comments listed here and they said a lot of people do not realize that everything is made fresh to order and that takes a little time.  I guess the same things that make it good make it a little slower (or it could be because the are picking all the onions out of my little ones dish for us)-but it is definitely worth the wait!  We will be back.
