I'm not one to write reviews, but after checking out Postino's for the first time today (after hearing all my friends rant and rave about how amazing it was), I must say I was pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere was upbeat and positive, the beer was cheap (only 5 for a whole pitcher), and my sandwich was probably the best thing I have ever eaten (don't remember what it was called, but the waitress suggested I get the one with bacon, and she was right). 
I'm writting this review because I read the negative comments belows, and yes, the music is loud, but it's enjoyable...and yes, the wait staff does wear casual attire and they do have tattoos, but honestly times are changing. Yeah, so Postino's might not be for the geriatric crowd, all the better for me.
