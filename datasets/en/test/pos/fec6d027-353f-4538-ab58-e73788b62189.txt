Dr. Constantine Moschonas is a friendly, caring neurologist with an excellent and well-organized staff. He is very up-to-date with the latest research and, as I understand it, is very highly regarded in the medical community. He has always treated me as an intelligent person, and takes the time to examine my MRI films with me so I know at what I am looking, where my problem areas are, and how that might affect me. I have not had a single negative experience in his office, and I would highly recommend him to anyone in need of superior neurological care.
