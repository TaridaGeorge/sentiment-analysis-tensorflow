Rachel has been amazing with my cat and dog!. My dog is older and has vision problems.  My dog has been quite ill as of late.  She started having seizures.  Rachel gave her her meds and took awesome care of my little doggie.  My cat is a bit younger.  My cat is a bit finicky - but she actually like Rachel...lol.  So, when I got home my dog was wagging her tail and my cat was content.  Rachel did a great job and is highly recommended!
