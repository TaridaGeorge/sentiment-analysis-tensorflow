This store ROCKS!! But what even rocks more is the cashier who rung me up. She is extremely nice and asked me how my week was going. I was feeling down when I walked into the store but she really made my day. To the previous reviewers who wanted to know,her name is Nellie. Someone get this girl a pay raise!!
