Yum! We were pleasantly surprised by this place! Saturday night and although it is busy, there were still tables available. We made a reservation an hour prior through Open Table. Love Open Table... Plus it was one of the reasons/recommendations of the website. We figured we'd be waiting at least an hour elsewhere. 

Blueberry mojito was sooo good. 52 beer selection. French dip and fries were really good. Husband loved the rueben. Awesome tender, sliced thinned meat and delicious. It was how Ruebens should be made. Cheddar mash potatoes were pretty good too!
