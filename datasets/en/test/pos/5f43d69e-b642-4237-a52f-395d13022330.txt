Played both courses twice while I was out in Scottsdale at the beginning of March. These courses are in excellent condition. (I was told there are no water restrictions on Indian Reservations). If you are going to be playing multiple times, be sure to get an OB Sports card (they manage these courses and another 4-5 in the Phoenix area) you can save 50% of the going rate for non-residents.
The greens and fairways were like carpets. I've been to the Scottsdale area a number of times over the years and I must say these courses are as good as any in the area and I've played most of them. It's worth the trip (since it's a ways from most resort hotels) to play at We-KO-PA!
