Chodang GOOD!! If on the cusp of starvation this is the place because not only do you obtain a grip of tasty food; but it is also served in a desired, rumble-of-the-stomach, friendly pace. Moreover, it is the closest one could get to authentic Korean cuisine in AZ; although, Chodang might seem little expensive, the quality and the quantity is definitely worth your time and your mouth. 

We recommend the jap chae (fried glass noodles with beef and veggies), the daeji bulgogi (spicy bbq pork with rice) and the tofu soup with spicy bean paste--the little side dishes are amazing. As a little side note to the wise, the dried seaweed sheets are supposed to be used as a wrap: perfect for a little rice and a tender piece of daeji bulgogi.
