This is one of my favorite places ever to get dessert or a refreshing drink.  The bubble tea/smoothies are excellent.  They make them with fresh fruit which makes them so flavorful.  My favorite dessert here is the "Diamond ice" which is shaved ice with sweet milk, fresh fruit, little gummi mochi, and red bean.  They give you a WHOLE lot for your money, so unless you're with a massive crowd of people that are going to share the dessert with you, beware of the large!  Well, unless you want to satisfy the inner pig in you : D
