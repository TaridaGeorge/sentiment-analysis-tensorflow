Exceptional Chinese restaurant because they will listen, accomodate and remember your needs. I've seen them serve Spicy dishes with no spice, take sugar and salt out of their dishes, remove and substitute vegetables, change sauces, and more to accomodate various people I have brought here. Superb Wor Wonton and Hot & Sour soup, also highly recommend the Mongolian Beef, Sauteed Three Seas, Moo Shu whatever, Bell Pepper Steak and any Lo Mein.
