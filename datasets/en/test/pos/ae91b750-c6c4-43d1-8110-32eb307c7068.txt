I am 100% for supporting little business, especially coffee houses.  I've been to ROOTS, LUX, NEXT, and ELEVATE and this place can compare. Small, cozy and simply good coffee.  Don't forget to try their muffins; I believe they are from a local bakery in  Sun City.
Last visit I was able to spend a few minutes talking to the owner...family style place keeping this location low-key.  I'd suggest it for an after-date night hang out  or a quick cup to go.
Either way, get the chance to enjoy :)
