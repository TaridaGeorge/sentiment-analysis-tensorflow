I am so happy to have a Lush here in the valley! They have all kinds of wonderful products for your hair, skin, face, body and they are all natural!!! I went into this store over the weekend and the staff is always so nice and they are so knowledgeable of their products and can answer any questions you could possibly have. They interact with the customers showing how the different products work and having them try it out, and they are so nice about giving you samples of a certain product to try if you can't make up your mind!!! A++ in customer service and quality of products.
