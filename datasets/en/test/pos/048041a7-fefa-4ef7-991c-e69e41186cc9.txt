Ok, as promised I went back. Truth is I've been back several times now, and it just keeps getting better. [Ms Aguilera, would you kindly get out of my head.]

Most recently I went for happy hour (an excellent plan). Half price on all glasses of wine and their fun cocktails are only $5 each. Bam!

The Forbidden Rice Bowl lured me into it's blasphemous clutches and I couldn't have been happier. Highly recommended!

Again, the Cucumber cooler should not be missed, even at full price!
