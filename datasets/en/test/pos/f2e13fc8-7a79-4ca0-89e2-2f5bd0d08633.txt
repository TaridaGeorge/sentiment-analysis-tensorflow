Came here based on yelp reviews and a convenient location. Though a very small shop and not totally is easy to spot, it was exactly what I was looking for between available selection and knowledgeable staff.  

I was given a ton of options on bikes based on where and why I would be riding it having my best interests, and price range, at heart.  Bought a bike through Kailen(sp?), upon recommendation, that was special ordered and received within 3 days! 

When the bike arrive I was "fitted" properly for it so I was 100% comfortable riding it.

Great group of guys very knowledgeable and friendly. You get great prices and thorough service. Whether you want a casual bike or a high tech racing bike this place can supply anything you need. They genuinely want to make sure EVERYTHING is right for you before you leave here!
