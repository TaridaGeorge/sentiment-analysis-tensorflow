I am so excited about this!
I have a dairy allergy and am pretty use to coffee shops using the cheapest soy milk they can find to pacify us non-dairy people, and then typically charge an extra $.50 for it. 

Nami is all vegan.  I was pleasantly surprised when I went there and asked for a  latte and they asked me, "would you like that made with soy, hazelnut, almond, or coconut milk?"  WHAT!?! choices?  They also informed me that once they get more settled they want to start making fresh nut milks.  
The hazelnut latte is awesome.  Also, the "Nami Cakes" are soooo good.
