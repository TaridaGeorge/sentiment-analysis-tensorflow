After recently moving to N. Phoenix from the southern valley, I needed a new barber shop. I found this place, and am glad I did.

I have gone to barbers in Oregon, New York, Chicago, Florida, etc., and this shop stacks up with the best of them. Prices are more than affordable (around $16 for a haircut, razor line up, and shoulder massage), and they give an excellent haircut.
