OMG THIS PLACE IS SO GOOD! Been here three times already in three trips to Arizona and I live in California! Sauces are spicy but amazing, all different meats have flavor and their chile rellano burrito is the bomb and then some!! And the food is made fresh! You can customize pretty much anything too! Def try it out and see for yourself!
