I've never actually been here (always had someone go and get it) and the only thing I can rate are their cheesesteaks because that is all I have ever had.  Based on that alone, it gets 5.  It is the most authentic cheesesteak that I have had in the PHX.

Shredded steak, melted cheese THROUGHOUT, not just shredded steak on a slice of cheese, and the bread, oh the bread.  That's all.  No cheese whiz, no lettuce, tomato, peppers ... just cheese and steak.  And it's heaven.
