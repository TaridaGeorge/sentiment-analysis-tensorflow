If your into cigars, this is a definate must try.  With over hundreds to choose from, you are guaranteed to find something you like.  New to cigars? The staff is more than prepared to reccomend you a cigar.  Cigarettes are also sold here along with pipe tobacco and other smoking accessories.

And you know the best part? It's not the prices, even though those are pretty reasonable.  It's that you can have a seat on one of the couches, tables, or bar stools, grab a beer or glass of wine, and relax watching one of the many flat screens here.  Yes my friends, you can smoke inside.  While the selection of beer and wine are limited, it's just enough to hit the spot on the way home from work or watching the game on Sunday. A+ my friends!
