This cozy little restaurant is tucked away in the airpark and is a real gem.  I Ordered a Spinach & Pecan Grilled Chicken salad and was very pleased with this dish. The portion size for the salads and all the sandwiches here are enormous; you get a lot more than you pay for. The Chicken is hearty and the vegetables all tasted very fresh; great Feta too. They have a dolmades & hummus pita "burrito" my co-worker wolfed down that I'm definitely going to try out next time.
