Best nail art in town and I even get my eyelashes done here!  Not the top quality when it comes the supplies used in the eyelash extensions, but the prices are phenomenal and I get tons of compliments on my lashes which look a lot like a baby camel if that gives you any idea how long and lush they are.  Sarah H and I will be back next week for some fancy toes before Labor Day.
