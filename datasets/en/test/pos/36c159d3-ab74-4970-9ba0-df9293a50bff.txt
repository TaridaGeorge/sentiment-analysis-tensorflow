You know, it is hard to go wrong when you have a store coupon, manufactuers coupons and the items you want are on sale too!

I LOVE Ulta.  It is the only place that still sells my haircolor.  They have a rewards program where you can earn free stuff based on the amount of your purchases over a period of 3 months.  They have the range of makeup, fragrance and hair products from the ultra cheap to the ultra expensive.  

They have really good sales too.  I always check out their clearance section too.  They have a salon there too, but I have never tried it.
