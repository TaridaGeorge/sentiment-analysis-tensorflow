Consistent with the east coast stores, great flavor selection, friendly and accommodating staff.  
The regular size doesn't look big but it is plenty for the price, not to mention the staff consistently fills above the top the cup on all products.  
A much better value than Cold Stone, Baskin Robbins, and self serve froyo.
