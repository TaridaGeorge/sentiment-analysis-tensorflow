With the liquor initiative passing in WA, It would be nice to have one of these stores near here. Last time I visited a few bottles of my fav, Laphroaig Single Malt, ended up in my trunk along with large bottles of Jim Beam Black and Gentleman Jacks...made the ride back to Seattle worth it (shhhhhh, don't tell anyone). Seriously, the selection is incredible and the prices are good, you can get the large bottles of just about any liquor for almost the same price as a fifth in Seattle. If you like wine, you must go there....selections are amazing!
