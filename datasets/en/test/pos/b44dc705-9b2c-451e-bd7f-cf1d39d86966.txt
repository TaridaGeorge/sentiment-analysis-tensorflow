They have a store upfront where you can pick up your own "Sause" and/or Rub, and a breakfast taco if you're in a rush.   The meat is very high-quality and the Sauce to die for.  First had Rudy's in the late 80's brought in from TX, I was hooked.  What a treat having it local.  I went there last week around 12:30- they were giving the breakfast taco's away, that never happens before you wait in line to buy food.  They are generous with the protein and you will discover lunch costs more at McDonald's.

Don't let the long lines fool you - it moves fast!
