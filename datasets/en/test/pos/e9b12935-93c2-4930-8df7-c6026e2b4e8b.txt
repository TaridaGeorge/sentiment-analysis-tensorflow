Santisi Brother's has awesome pizza and the best calzone I have ever had. I can't eat them anywhere else and I crave one about once a week.  There are tons of tv's covering the walls in the main dining room so if you love sports and enjoy watching several games at once this place is for you. The only problem I have here is that the waitresses give better service if you are a guy or with a guy. Ayesha is right though there are always cute boys here! One offered to buy me a sea monster shot and I fell in love. Aaaah!
