While in Tempe with the family and the mother in law, we stopped in for some Pho for lunch
We all had the Pho, My mother-in law who is Vietnamese, said the pho reminded her of Pho back home. Nuff said pho for lunch was great.  Service was great, though it was lunch time and we were 4 of the 8 in their at that time.  Really enjoyed the fried spring roll and the pineapple ice tea too.
