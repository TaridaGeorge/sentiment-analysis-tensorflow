I'll start with the disclaimer that I REALLY like the people that work at this place which is downstairs from my work.  The food is always great quality and if you need a last minute "gift," they have wine and many other goodies to make a  basket (which I have done).
The happy hour serves local beers and their house wine is only $3.00 which makes it irresistible for a bargain shopper like me (and it's good too).
Stop by and say hello to Ally, Pierce, Gloria and Dave - and rest of the gang.  People are not strangers there for long!
