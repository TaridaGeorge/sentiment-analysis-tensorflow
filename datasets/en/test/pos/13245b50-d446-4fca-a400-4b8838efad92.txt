My mom took me here today for my first time. She swears by this place because they do so many cute designs by hand... and I can tell you it was the best spa pedicure I have ever gotten, NO LIE!... salt scrub, clay mask, paraffin wax, callus buff, everything you can name... she worked on me for about an hour and a half... and then she did a PLAID PAINT JOB WITH JEWELS!!!!!! so fun!!!
I think it was worth every penny! 
Ask to see their book of hand painted designs.. or bring in an idea I'm sure they can figure it out!
WELL WORTH IT!!
