My rating is more for the spa than the actual hotel.  Don't get me wrong, the hotel is great (especially since they updated), but the spa is just out of this world.  I live in MN now and there is just nothing that compares to the Camelback Spa anywhere up here (or anywhere else I've been).

I've been to spas with my wife in Cabo and Laguna Niguel (Ritz) and neither compared to the opulence of this place.  It is a true, all encompassing retreat.  If you don't leave here relaxed there is something really wrong with you! :-)
