5 stars as compared to other food trucks.

Best food truck breakfast (the only 'meal' I've had from them).  Biscuits and gravy, fried chicken biscuit with cheese, bacon and gravy (!!) and the breakfast biscuit (egg, cheese and bacon) all were top-notch.  Fried chicken breast was moist and well cooked.
