Cafe Monarch is a hidden gem. Coming here is just not like any restaurant where you order something from a menu. This is a genuine eating experience. Chef Chris is a one man show and treats each guest with care. He is a distinct artist when in comes to preparing dishes that will satisfy each distinct palate. I have come here for dinner and lunch, and yet have to try one of his Sunday Barbecue brunches. 
Remember, this place is BYOB (beer and wine) and only takes cash. Every bite is worth every penny. 

Thank you Chris for your hospitality.
