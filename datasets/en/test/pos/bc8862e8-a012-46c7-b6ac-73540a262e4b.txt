Very nice Stadium and love going to games and concerts there.

Lacey, you're a bit naive to think that a stadium with a corporate name actually belonged to the corporation with the name on it. Most stadiums around the country for professional sports have a corporation that pays to put their name on the stadium.

UoP Stadium has nothing to do with UoP other than they pay to put their name on it. Did you think UoP had a football team that played there? It's not at the UoP main campus because it actually has nothing to do with the UoP but is where the Arizona Cardinals play. It is the Cardinals stadium so that's why it felt like "Cardinals Stadium".

Sorry you were confused but congrats on getting your degree!
