Fantastic pizza for Tempe.  The owner is always there making the dough and preparing all the fresh ingredients himself.  He comes around to the tables making sure that everything is enjoyable.  Decent wine selection as well.  Recommend the asparagus appetizer and the fresh bread rolls, wow.  This is the epitome of an excellent local pizzeria.
