I love this place!  Lots of books, and friendly librarians can help you with whatever you need.  The new self check out machines are amazing you can put up to four books on the table and it checks them out all at once.  Especially helpful on a big trip :).

If you need a quiet place to work or study head upstairs to the fifth floor, tons of books, and even better desks with plugs so you can plug in your laptop and work.  Make sure you take a break and enjoy my sons favorite part the amazing views.  He loves to stand at the windows and see everything.
