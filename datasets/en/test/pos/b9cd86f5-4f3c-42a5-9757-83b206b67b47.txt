If you are looking for great service and friendly staff to assist you with your pet needs, this is the place to go. I have been bringing Snoop, our pug that we adopted from AZHS, to Wag N Wash for almost two years and they have never disappointed us. Snoop just had his first bath at their center and he loved it... was great not having to clean up the mess !! He even liked the blowdryers :)
