I've had multiple trips to Sweet Republic. They always deliver. Love the Salted Caramel Ice Cream, the Blue Cheese and honey is a yum. Almond Crunch was delish. I've even taken home a bottle of the Caramel sauce. It didn't last long.

Their treats are great as well. The almond brittle. The bacon brittle. And the Sea Salt Caramels are the greatest caramels ever. I swear I'm going to put a flyer together on how to ship this stuff. Last visit I had the Horchata and Sweet Cream Ice Cream. I wish the Sweet Corn was year round. Absolutely worth an out of a way drive or a long Phoenix layover.
