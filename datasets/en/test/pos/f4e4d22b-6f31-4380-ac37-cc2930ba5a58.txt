My boyfriend and I go here just about every weekend. Great breakfast every time! We have never had bad service or bad food. We've tried several different different breakfast items...all good. Everyone there is super friendly. Be prepared for a wait for a table at peak times on the weekends...and your food may be slow to come during busy times...but it is worth it!
