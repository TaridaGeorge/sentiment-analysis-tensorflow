I have been dining at this Indian restaurant for a few years now.  It was introduced to me by a close friend.  I have taken my co-workers, members of my ward, my mother and brothers and finally I get a chance to review it online.

I don't mind going in for dinner, but the buffet is to die for.  Their consistency has never failed.  This place is great!
