Wow! Great food, fun setting.

Carnitos: lean, slow cooked tender. This meal was one of the few where you add your own heat, to taste. hand made flour tortilla. Yum.

Flautas: wife and son-in-law's mom got these ( chicken, beef). Tasty, tender meat. Sour cream and guacamole took off some of the heat from the green (v. Hot) salsa

Daily special enchiladas: spicy with an egg on top, which may sound odd to some, but it really worked on this dish

Son-in-law got the burro. Distance runner (as in ultra marathon), who is a bottomless pit, and had leftovers to take home. 

We had both regular and K.A. Margaritas (as in  Kick Ass). Go with the KA!

We'll be back on future visits.
