My boyfriend and I had dinner at Zinc for Valentine's day dinner. This place is pretty darn authentic to a Parisian Bistro. We ordered the fois gras risotto to start, followed by the onion soup, the poivre steak avec frites, and finished with the souffle chocolate. Over all I would rate the food as some of the best I have ever had. The risotto was AMAZING.

Expect a very delicious, relaxing, high quality meal. This is no place to have a rush meal. Also, don't expect the massive quantities of food you may be used to getting at Cheesecake Factory. But do expect enough tasty, high quality food to be very satisfied. 

I would return to the Zinc Bistro again in a heartbeat. Great overall experience. :)
