Great ambiance, great service, and great coffee! If you're looking for something a little less caffeinated and a little more refreshing, try their Pomegranate-Mojito iced tea.

In terms of food, they offer Mi Comida burritos. I've only tried one, but the plantain and sweet potato burrito was fantastic.

It's nice to find a place with a cool, creative vibe that's laid back enough to make anyone feel comfortable. Definitely check it out!
