I live inCcalifornia and goggled computer repair places in Scottsdale. I saw all the good reviews and decided to let my mom know. My sister drove her there with her lap top.They live right down the street from the store. Nolan was VERY helpful. He looked at her computer and realized my mom had turned the internet button off. They are keeping her computer to check it out to see if they can convert some things in German to English. They were honest, fair and I now know  my whole family will take computer issues to them. Thank you for an honest place which is hard to find when it comes to computers. Too bad I am in California.Highly recommend!!!!
