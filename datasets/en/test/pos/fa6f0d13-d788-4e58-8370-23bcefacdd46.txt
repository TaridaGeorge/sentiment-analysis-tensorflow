After getting into a car accident, my physical therapist recommended I try neuromuscular message.  Because my back was recently fused from T3 to S1, there are not many professionals trained to work on a back like mine.  Lisa was different.  She understood the mechanics of my back and the pain associated with the surgery and the car accident.  After just one visit I felt significantly better. (My pain level dropped from a 6 to a 4 on a scale 10.)  I cannot say enough about Lisa other than to recommend her highly!
