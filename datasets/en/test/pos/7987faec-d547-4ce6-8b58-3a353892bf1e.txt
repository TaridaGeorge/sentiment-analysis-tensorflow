I have been going to this Gunnell's location for a couple of years. They have the quickest service I've ever experienced for getting tires rotated and/or balanced. I've never had to wait longer than 10 minutes - no matter what day or time I go in.

Recently, I went in to get my tires balanced due to a shaking at higher speeds. Turns out the previous owners of my car put the wrong lug nuts on the car - they didn't fit tight and the tires were coming loose. Scary! For $30, I got my tires balanced and the new, correct lug nuts.

This is the kind of excellent, attentive experience that you can expect if you go to this Gunnell's location.
