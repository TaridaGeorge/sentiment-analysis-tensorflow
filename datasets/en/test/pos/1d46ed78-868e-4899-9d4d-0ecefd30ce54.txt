The place you all know and love. Don't worry about the line, it moves fast. 

In attempt to lose weight and still be able to eat all my favorite things, when I come here I ask for 1/2 a portion of beans and 1/2 a portion of rice. That way, when I'm building my burrito bol, I can still get the beans and rice in it, without breaking the calorie bank.
