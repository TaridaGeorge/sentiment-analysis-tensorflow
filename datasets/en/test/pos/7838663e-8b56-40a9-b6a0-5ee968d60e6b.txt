Been a member since 2001 as well - only a move across country caused me to (very temporarily) suspend my membership, try blockbuster by foot & car (running like a panic mad-woman to hit the drop-box and not get nailed for late fees - i am otta breath even thinking of those old days gone by).

Anyhow, I LUV THESE GUYS!  easy, simple, amazing, instant gratification :-)  {WHO doesn't want that??!!}

When i get mags indicating new & up-coming movies, i put them on my reserve list, and before you know it, they move up my list & get ready to post, in my mail box, & promptly in my dvd player - while i watch sipping an ice cold martini - in silky PJ's - you can't do that at cineplex!  

Who~Hoo! luv my red envelopes in the mail :-)
