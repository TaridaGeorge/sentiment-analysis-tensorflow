Well I finally tried this place and I am kicking myself for not trying it sooner, being that I live across the street. 

I ordered the Gyros and Crazy Fries and it was just great.

Portions were more than enough and quite filling and every thing was fresh.

I am amazed of do called 'experts' on food who slam this place, they just do not know no better on what a good authentic gyro is.

Forget the critics and go try this place, way worth it if your in the area.
