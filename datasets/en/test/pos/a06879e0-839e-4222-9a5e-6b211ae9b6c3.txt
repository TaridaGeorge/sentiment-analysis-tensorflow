Pita Jungle is one of my favorites in town!  The food is amazingly crisp and fresh, and they have some inventive combinations as well as some authentic offerings.  The place can be a bit pricy depending on what you get, but it's a good value if you stick to the basics.

Eat at Pita Jungle - you won't be disappointed!
