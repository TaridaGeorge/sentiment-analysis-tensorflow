What a pleasant experience. The museum was well organized. Great use of the headphones corresponding with various parts of the globe.There's also a room where you get "hands-on" experience with various musical instruments. 

The cafe was fresh, yet fairly over-priced.

Would definitely recommend.

P.S. if you have B of A credit card, you are granted free admittance the first, full weekend of the month.
