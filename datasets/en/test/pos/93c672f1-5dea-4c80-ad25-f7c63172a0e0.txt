I really liked Smashburger! I had the black bean burger. Soooo good. The fries were pretty so and so, but the fried pickles were very tasty:). They workers were all super nice and very fast! I love love love the black bean burger! The place was also very clean and organized which I like. Another bonus is the dog friendly patio!
