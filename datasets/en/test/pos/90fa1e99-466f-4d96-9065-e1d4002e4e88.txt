Hands down the BEST sushi in all of Arizona. And although it is nearly an hour away from my house I come all the way to this location to get my sushi fix. Huge portion sushi rolls that always fill me up. Even my boyfriend is stuffed after 2 rolls. And even if your getting the sashimi or nigiri they give you giant slabs of fish unlike many other restaurants. The only con to this restaurant is that it gets extremely busy at times and service can be a little slow. None the less no matter how busy they are the food ALWAYS comes out amazing!
