Love this place, it's in my top 5 list of places to frequent for good service experience. Great food, great beer, and very friendly staff, make Pasty House a hit with any friend or client I have ever met there. They do get very busy in the evenings, dinner service is slower than lunch, and there is often a waiting line even on weeknights, but the wait is worth it. My favorite entrees are the Portobello Chicken and the Meat and Cheese pasties, but they are all good, I have never been disappointed with anything on the menu.
