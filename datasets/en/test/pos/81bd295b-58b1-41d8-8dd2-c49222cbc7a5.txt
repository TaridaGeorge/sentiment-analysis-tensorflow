My fiance and I had our first appointments at this dentist office and have nothing but great things to say about it! We both saw Dr. Erskine who is young, very friendly and down to earth! He took time with each of us to talk about any problems we might be having and gave practical solutions. The hygienists were amazing - they were so nice and patient! I think that I had the best by far - there has never been a time that I have enjoyed going to the dentist, so this is a first!!! Also check out their website for biographies of the dentists - there are two and I hear that Dr. Choules is awesome as well!!! If you're looking for a new dentist, definitely give them a try!
