This is one of my favorite places for lunch and sometimes dinner (my punch card even says so!)  Staff is super nice, price is super great, sandwiches are awesome!

They don't load up on the lettuce, give you tons of meat (which they slice in front of you) and it's just yummy.  Enjoy it!

A foot long did increase in price to $5.49 recently, but I'd gladly support this store!
