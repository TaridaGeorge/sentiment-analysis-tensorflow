I have eaten at this wonderful and beautiful restaurant many times. Every time has been great! The service was fast, helpful and friendly. The atmosphere is comfortable and upscale. The food is well portioned, plated perfectly and tastes delectable. There is many selections and will have something for any ones taste buds. I would strongly recommend the bruchetta combination for an appetizer.
