This is pretty much the perfect bar for me. Hip but not pretentious crowd; cute guys; friendly, down-to-earth bartenders; perfect lighting; good DJs (the live bouzouki on top of recorded tracks was a bit weird, but I give them props for trying); free, help-yourself water; and 20% off everything on Sundays.

I had my first absinthe experience here and will never forget it. The perfect place to lose your absinthe virginity if you so desire.
