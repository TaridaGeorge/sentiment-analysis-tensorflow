We LOVE this place!  The employees have managed to find that perfect balance- they're helpful and attentive without being intrusive.  The sandwiches are BEYOND delicious!  The bread is excellent, the variety is outstanding, and their hot sauce bar is brilliant!  We live less than a mile from Firehouse, so we'll be back!
