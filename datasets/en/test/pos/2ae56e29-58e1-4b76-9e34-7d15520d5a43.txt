If you're looking to buy an instrument ALWAYS check here first, ESPECIALLY if you are a lefty. We have purchased many instruments super cheap for my boyfriend here just because they are left handed and rarely anyone buys them so they want to get rid of it. If your lucky they throw in a free strap or something too. The guys here are very helpful and knowledgeable, sometimes they can be dicks but they always answer your questions and they don't screw you over. They have a huge variety of instruments to choose from, so check it out!
