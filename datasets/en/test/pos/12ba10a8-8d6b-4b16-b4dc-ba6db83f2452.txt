I have dined here a few times I think initially the delicious Sangria draws me back each time.  Then once I am there I remember how wonderful the food is.  First of all - save room for dessert.  The pina colada cake is out of this world - its is $10 a slice and worth each and every penny - wow.  The last time I was here I had the NY strip - perfectly cooked.  The bread is very good with sweet butter.  The service was great we sat at a long table in the bar area.  Our server was very busy but stayed on top of things.
