We don't often splurge on a $100 per person meal but for this birthday celebration, I'm glad we did!  We went with another couple and Flemings was amazing.  The wine was great, service perfect and the filets were exactly as we ordered them.  Had the chipotle mac & cheese as a side and it was something Bobby Flay would be proud of, just the right amount of spice in a great comfort dish.  Had the homemade ice cream for dessert and it was fantastic.  They generously gave the birthday girls a box of truffles and a card signed by the staff-very classy touch.  We'll be back!
