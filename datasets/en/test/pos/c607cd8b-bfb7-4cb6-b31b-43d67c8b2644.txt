This is a coffee roaster who provides beans to local coffee shops.  It is run by the affable Randall Denton, who used to be a barista and manager at the legendary Willow House.

Xanadu supplies a few local joints, like Sapna Cafe, and the coffee is delicious, and the rates are reasonable.  They also offer bags for the typical home coffee addict, and a subscription service.

I don't really know much about the bean process, so I'm going to stop myself here.  If you are a restauranteur looking for locally-roasted beans, or a coffee fiend who wants to support your local roaster, look this place up.
