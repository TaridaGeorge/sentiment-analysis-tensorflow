I actually looked up a place to have breakfast since I was on this side of town. We went in and found a table outside. It was supposed to rain and I thought it was cool they had plastic see through curtains with heaters on the patio. The server, Jeremy was really helpful and quick. The food came out quickly and was great. My husband got the flapjacks and I got the Tryst breakfast with shoestring fries. Everything was fresh, hot and delicious. I can't wait to try this place for lunch.
