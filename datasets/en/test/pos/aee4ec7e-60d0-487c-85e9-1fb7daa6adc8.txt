This place is awesome. If your looking for a dentist don't bother looking anywhere else. They have TV's on the ceiling and use vaseline on your lips so they don't dry out from that horrible torture suction tube that Dentists use. 

I recently moved away and felt compelled to leave a great review for Simply Dentistry. Everyone is super nice, very gentle and very helpful. They Gave me no hassel at all when I changed dentists, they sent all my x-rays and records over immediately. I almost considered commuting back to Scottsdale for my appointments but at the end of the day thats just not practicle. 

Thank you for the great servce during the time I was a patient. Good luck in the future
