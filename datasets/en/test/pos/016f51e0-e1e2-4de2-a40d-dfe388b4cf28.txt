This place is absolutely fabulous!  It has a quaint, relaxed atmosphere and friendly staff, and their bruschetta is absolutely amazing!  The portion sizes are generous, to say the least.  My friend and I split a turkey sandwich, and it was definitely more than enough to feed the both of us (with some left over!).  I would highly recommend this little gem to anyone who appreciates good food and great value.
