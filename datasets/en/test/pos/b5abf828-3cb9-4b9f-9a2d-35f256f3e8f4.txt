I take all of my pants to Joanna for tailoring. Whether it is jeans or dress/work pants, she does a terrific job and the price is great! I'm short, so I always need some of the length taken out of my pants, and she does it quickly, does it well, and replaces the hem for about $12 per pair. I've never had anything else tailored (shirts, dresses, jackets), but I can say that I have never had any problems with pants, and I recommend her to all my friends!
