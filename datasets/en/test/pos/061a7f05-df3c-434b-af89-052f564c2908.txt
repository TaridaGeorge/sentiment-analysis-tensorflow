This is my favorite hotel to stay at in Arizona. It's a boutique hotel which I love, no chains here. The pool area is so nice, and the rooms are amazing!!! They have different styles and names of the rooms. The hotel makes you feel like your in a garden somewhere magical.

T Cooks restaurant is inside and it's sooooo yummy! I go here with my girls.
