The Hen and I (thats what I call my mother) finally tried this place that everyone has been raving about. I was a little nervous since sometimes when people stress about how great a place is then it never lives up to your expectations. Definitely wrong about that! We sat at the bar and I wish I could remember the bar tender's name that served us because he was amazing! We had amazing wine and food and I cannot wait to come back for happy hour!
