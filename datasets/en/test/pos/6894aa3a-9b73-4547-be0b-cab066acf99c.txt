After being screwed over by my last mechanic, it was time to find a new one. It's hard to find a decent mechanic, especially for a MB because most mechanics look at the hood ornament a see dollar signs. After reading all the great reviews on Yelp I decided to give MB Motors a shot. 

My car's AC was not working, so I brought it in. Bud was very honest and did not try to up sell me or convince me to do any unnecessary work on my car. His communication was great, the price was reasonable, and I was able to drive away with working AC the same day. I would definitely bring my car here again.
