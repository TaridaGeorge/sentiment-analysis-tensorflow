Given the improbable task of finding a restaurant for 22 people at 6pm on a Saturday night, I brought the extended family to Spinato's.  I'm so glad I did.  The manager went out of his way to make sure that we were accommodated quickly, the service was excellent and so was the food.  All 22 people left happy, thanking me for the suggestion and raving about how good the food and service were.  If being able to satisfy such a large group on short notice isn't a sign of a great restaurant where the management and staff really know what they are doing, then I don't know what is.  We will definitely be bringing our small family back again and again after the relatives head back out of town!
