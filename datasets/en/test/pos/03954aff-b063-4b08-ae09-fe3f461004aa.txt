one of the best steaks i've ever had. every bite melted in my mouth. flavorful, juicy, superior steak. my sides were good but average. we got some appetizers which were very good as well. if you are looking for a great steak, this is your place. cool atmosphere. good service. will definitely have to go back just for the steak.
