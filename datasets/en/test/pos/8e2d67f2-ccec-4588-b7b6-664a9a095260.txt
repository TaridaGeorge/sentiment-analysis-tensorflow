The only thing that could make this place better is if Betty White walked into this former beauty parlor looking for a perm and staying for a beer. 

I mean there is over 400 reviews what more can I add? The food is awesome. We went with the corn pizza add bacon add chicken....ya we did it and it was amazing!

The service is great ,the atmosphere is cool and the pizza rivals the overrated Mr. Bianco. The only down side is everyone knows how good this is so make sure you plan ahead you could be faced with a well worth it wait.
