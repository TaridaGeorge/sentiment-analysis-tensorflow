Awesomeness! So smart but It's a bit confusing for a fist timer. Them muffins are great wish they put more sandwiches and breakfasts on them. The place is so rules free I hope people do not take advantage because they give the customer the benefit of the doubt.
    Pizza was nice, love to have tried the sweets but as it was January I was already way over my careful calorie count. The rockin tunes added so much though I am sure the format appeals to mostly a younger crowd. 
   Some Details, Counter Service until 4. Pizza day time only weekends. Sandwiches are picked up at a different counter than, pizza and burgers. There is a white bucket for your dishes.
