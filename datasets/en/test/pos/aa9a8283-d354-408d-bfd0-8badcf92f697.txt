Although I am an American, my wife is Filipino. We regularly go to the Halo Halo Kitchen. This place is clean and the service is excellent. My wife gets cravings for Filipino food from her home country and these cravings are  satisfied here. Usually I will have the Halo Halo Burger. It is cooked to order and I love it. 

The Halo Halo Kitchen does do celebrations and for my wife's 30th birthday, we celebrated there. The owners are very accommodating and our family and friends enjoyed it so much.

Friday night is my favorite. The man at the bar, Rick is so friendly and really knows how to make a great Margarita. He also leads the Karoke and it is a fun, friendly place to go.
