The fixx is a coffee shop, and venue.  they have a free show pretty much every saturday they are always fun to go too.  Coffee is excellent there barista trevor always draws a heart in my latte and I appreciate that.  If you want to feel comfortable while you drink your coffee the fixx isn't as portentous as other shops in the area.  Verry friendly staff.
