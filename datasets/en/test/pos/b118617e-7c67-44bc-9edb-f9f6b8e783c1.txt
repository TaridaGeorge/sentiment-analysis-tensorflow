I really like this place. They have great martinis and margaritas. I agrees with Nancy J., the pomegranate is YUMMY! I'm not the biggest hummus fan (but I LOVE chickpeas, go figure), but it's really good there. The hummus has a nice spicy punch to it and the bread served with it is nice on its own . I have had most of the salads and they have all been tasty . Fez has a very modern, cool, urban atmosphere but is very relaxed. Their staff is friendly and you can actually talk to your party without having to shout over loud music.
