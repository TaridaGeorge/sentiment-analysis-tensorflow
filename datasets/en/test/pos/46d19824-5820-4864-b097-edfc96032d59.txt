Fun hidden neighborhood bar with good food and relaxed atmosphere. This place has heaps of potential. I'm giving it a full 5 because my friend is a Karaoke host here and because the owner and staff are great. I didn't expect the food to be so good either. It manages to rise above simply "bar food." This place definitely caught me off guard. 

This place is a bit of a throwback, but it manages to hang on to its loyal regulars. A few more visits and I'll be one of them... You may catch me here on Friday nights once in awhile singing alternative hits from the late 80s and early 90s.
