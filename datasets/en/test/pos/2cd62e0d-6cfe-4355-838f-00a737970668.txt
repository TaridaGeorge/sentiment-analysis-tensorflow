I'm from New England, and this place brought me home.  i had the fresh mozzarella, tomato, and olive oil sandwich, and I added prosciutto and had it on foccacia and it was absolutely perfect.  I went there yesterday and it's 10 in the morning and I'm ready to go back.  Other hot entrees and sandwiches passed by that looked incredible, and hearty.  This place serves real Italian food and creates an atmosphere that takes you back east.  Another Arizona gem :)
