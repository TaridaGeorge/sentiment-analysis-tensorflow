This Wendy's is right by Paradise Valley Mall.  It has a completely revamped look, which is awesome.  I would recommend trying the Cheesey Chedderburgers on the dollar menu.  They are so great.  Plus, they're on the dollar menu....Hello?!?!  They are really fast and friendly there.  They also have those cool looking soda machines, if you like that kind of thing, which I do.  You get to choose different flavors of coke you would like.  It's just really cool.
