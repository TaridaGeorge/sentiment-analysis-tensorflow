Raves all around - LOVE the decor and ambiance - who designed this place?  It's perfect!  
Had breakfast - AWESOME Cinnamon Buckwheat Pancakes served with the best bacon!  My partner had a Strawberry Lasi and I had a mango lemonade - both delicious!  Our server was Sadie - a true delight - ask for her!  We can't wait to go back for lunch and dinner and of course breakfast again!!!
