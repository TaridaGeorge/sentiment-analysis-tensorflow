Freaking amazing! A MUST try!

I had the Prosciutto Wrapped Hawaiian Ono, again... AMAZING! This place is awesome, can't say enough great things about it! The staff did an exceptional job. Their $5 happy hour menu is a pretty good size with pretty good portions, would recommend two if your creating a meal.

The prices are good for the happy hour selection but the full meal menu prices are  a lil steep ($25-$35, couple items up to $40) compared to surrounding restaurants but well worth it. I will definitely be visiting Roy's again as well as recommending it to others.
