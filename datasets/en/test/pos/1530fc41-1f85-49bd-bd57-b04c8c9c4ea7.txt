I  LOVE JP McGurkee's!!  I've been going there since I went to West High in the early 1970's.  We'd get a sandwich and go to Encanto Park.  Now my teenage son loves the place too - a bbq chicken sandwich fan.  We always stop there when we are in the neighborhood.  The owners are very friendly and will accommodate you any way they can.  If I could give it more than a 5 star rating I would.  You owe it to yourself to try this place - YUM!!!
