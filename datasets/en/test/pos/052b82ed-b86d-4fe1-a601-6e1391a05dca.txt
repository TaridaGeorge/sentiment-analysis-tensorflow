Me and my wife love this place!

We always get the Tom Kim soup, an order or 2 of fresh spring rolls (1 usually with shrimp). She gets the Pad Thai, which she likes better here than another Thai place we have been to.  I vary what I get but usually go fir a curry dish. We are wimps as far as heat goes and get everything medium, which turns out great for us. 

We often will get a to go order for the next day whenever we make it into the city. 

I use left over soup as a base for making an awesome rice dish.
