It's taken me weeks to post this review as I've had a difficult time finding the words to express how impressed I am with the staff at the Jade Bar. Sure the view is awesome and the drinks are perfectly blended and chilled. Yet, they are each put to shame by a staff who presents each with class and style. 
We attended Mixology - which can only be described as Alton Brown's dream of a class on mixing drinks. You learn not only the unique history behind each drink but receive a bountiful cupful of the joy you've just learned about.  I highly recommend hitting this class with a group of friends. We had a blast and plan to attend again
