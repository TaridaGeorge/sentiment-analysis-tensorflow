This place does a great job packing in lots of rubber stamps and stamping supplies in a small store.

Stamp Works has the biggest selection of Rubber Stamps in the Valley. They also have a good selection of inks and other supplies for making cards too.

If you have wanted to learn how to use your Copic Markers, they have classes for that here.

The owner is super nice!

It's next to a few other free standing little shops that are older houses converted into stores, so it can be easy to miss when you are driving by.

They are CLOSED on Sundays & Mondays.
