My family and I LOVE this place. So hard to find good chinese food, we lived in Avondale for 8 years and LOVED Wongs. Finally found a place in Surprise that is actually BETTER. Food is fresh and very tasty. We order from them probably once a month, love it. Crab puffs are to die for. I dont like the egg drop soup, tastes like "dirty" water, not sure what it is I dont like, if its a seasoning or what, but, my boys and hubby like it so, who knows. They have a nice indoor ambience and an outdoor patio. You will not be disappointed in Big Buddha. I tell EVERYONE I know who lives out here about it. Great place.
