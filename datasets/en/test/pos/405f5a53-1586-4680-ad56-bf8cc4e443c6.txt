This is a great spot for a date, and the price is right!  Unique dishes and atmosphere.  Great specials and free desert.  I also can't say enough about the service.  Our server gave great recommendations and brought out 3 different deserts at the end of the meal.  To be honest, I had to think twice about posting a review of this place for fear that it's going to become too popular.  But I would give them 6 stars if I could.
