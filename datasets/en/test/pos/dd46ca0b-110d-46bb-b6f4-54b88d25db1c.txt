Chaos Comedy is located at the Dearing Acting Studio.  This improv troop has a great show for families on Saturdays at 7 in a comfortable theater.  Once a month they put on a 18 and over show at midnight which is awesome.

The players are excellent and the show is only an hour, so it is a great way to start off your Saturday night.  Prices are reasonable and snacks are cheap.

They have us laughing almost the entire time were there and everyone is very friendly in this family owned business.
