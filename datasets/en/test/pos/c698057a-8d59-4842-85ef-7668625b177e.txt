Really friendly helpful guys. My car is at pepboys right now where the guys want to run some expensive tests. I called whiteys intending to bring it there because of the good reveiws. The front office guy was so helpful and explained everything, basically verifying Pepboys decision. I was happily surprised at the helpfulness and honesty.
