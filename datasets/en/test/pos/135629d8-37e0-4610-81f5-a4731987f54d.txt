A-mazing. Before the arrival of this most conveniently placed Total Wine, the only place to get unusual booze in CenPho was A.J.'s... and be prepared to shell out big buckaroos for that fancy-pants shiz. If you wanted cheap and copious, you had to make the haul to a BevMo somewhere in the 'burbs. 

Total Wine -- well, its name alone is a bit of a misnomer. Yes, there are aisles and aisles of wine... but there is also a humongous beer section. But really? The most important thing is the liquor. Rows and rows and aisles and aisles of every flavor of every brand in every size. All at a VERY competitive price point. No stupid member cards. All just rock bottom prices on whatever your little heart desires. Bless them.
