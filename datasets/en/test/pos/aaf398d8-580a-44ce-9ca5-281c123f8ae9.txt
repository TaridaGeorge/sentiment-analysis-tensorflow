Very good Kosher, vegan restaurant.  The owners are Jewish and Vietnamese, they lived in Hawaii and therefore their food is a little Hawaiian based.  There were 4 of us that ended up sharing 4 entrees so we could try a little of each. We had stuffed tomatoes, braised ribs, ginger soy chicken and pad thai.  All were exceptionally delicious.  You couldn't even tell the meat was imitation meat. The flavor was great and everything was made to order.  We had a big group so he put in a little bit of the orders at a time since they were freshly made.   I would highly recommend this place and will be back.
