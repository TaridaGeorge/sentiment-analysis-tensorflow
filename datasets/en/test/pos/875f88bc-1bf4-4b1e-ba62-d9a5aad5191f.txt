The best indian food i have found in the phx/tempe area.

Royal Taj is awesome. tandoori anything...GET IT! delicious naan try the special naan...soooo good! So much saffron!

The owners(I'm assuming) are sooo nice and always remember my friend when we come in. They also bring us on the house sticky balls for dessert usually (I think these are called galub jamen err...something) 
One funny thing we always look for though is a poop stain on the wall in the womens restroom...it is ALWAYS there! makes me wonder about other things...but eh....BEST INDIAN FOOD IN TOWNZ!
