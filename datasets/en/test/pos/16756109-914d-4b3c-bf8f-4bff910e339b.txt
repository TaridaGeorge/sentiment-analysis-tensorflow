Prices are great and the food is delicious. One of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. Try the broken rice. A great little Vietnamese spot in a truly Vietnamese plaza a few steps away from an Asian grocery store. For under $7 you can enjoy a generously portioned meal and leave happy. I always get the 3 out of 5 visits i stick with the #64 Pork Chop.
