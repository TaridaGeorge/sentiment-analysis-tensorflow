This is one of the best coffee shops I have ever been to.  Very relaxing yet stimulating with lots to look at.  Never too busy. Great place to hang out and work or study.  Free wifi, great food options and the best coffee and tea. Reasonably priced as well.  The guy that owns it is really chill and cool. My wife and I hit coffee shops all the time to study and work and this is one of the best places we have found. We drive 25 miles just because this place is the best.  They are adding some sandwiches and a roaster later in '09.
