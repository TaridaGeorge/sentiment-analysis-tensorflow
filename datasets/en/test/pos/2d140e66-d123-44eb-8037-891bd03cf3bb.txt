Sometimes, you just want a nice photo. And Zach knows how to deliver.

I had won a free photo session after attending a Yelp event, then participating in a contest on MelonFish Photo's Facebook. After doing numerous freeze-frame jumping high fives with Husband, I kept in contact with Zach via email about the best dates and times to "claim" my prize. Communication was easy and relatively quick. I told him that we had an idea of where we wanted the photos to be taken and Zach expounded on our idea and ended up finding an even better location. 

Our photos turned out amazing, colorful, and creative! Zach was a breeze to work with and I would recommend him again and again!
