Lo-lo's is fantastic!  As hard as it might be to believe, fried chicken can be messed up.  Not crunchy enough, too crunchy, not enough seasonin...  Well, they get it perfectly here!  You can pay extra to get all-white meat if you want, but the dark meat is great too.  Waffles are also very good.  They have this slight cinnamon flavor, which is a nice touch.  The mac and cheese, collards, rice/beans, and cornbread are the sides that I tried, and all were amazing.  The decor has these pictures of cute little kids, and the service is really friendly.  An overall enjoyable experience.  Would go back for sure! 

Oh, you can't make reservations, and it can get fairly crowded here (we went on a Saturday for dinner).  So you might have a wait before you get seated.
