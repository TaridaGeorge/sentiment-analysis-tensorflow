I have been here several times now and have never had a bad experience yet.  Good food, good service; no complaints.   Still have never made it here for happy hour, but their specials during that time seem like quite a deal.  The staff are always friendly and seem to remember us from one visit to another.  I've only ever eaten sushi here, but they have a lot of other menu items that I would like to try at some point, but I always turn to the sushi as it has always been good and fresh.  I would recommend trying this restaurant.
