As per usual no disappointment for lunch and great wine selections for five bucks per glass.  We arrive just before 11 to get our favorite spot and order our usual Bruschetta (4 tough choices) to share.  Having tried all ten choices at one time or the other we chose 1,2, 4 and 8.  You will have to visit to see what we selected but please don't occupy our spot.
