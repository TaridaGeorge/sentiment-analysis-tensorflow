If Imelda Marcos visited AZ on vacation, this is where she would spend her time and money.

DSW claims to have over 2000 styles on display at any given store.  I believe them.  The aisles are packed with hundreds of shoes.  DSW goes the extra mile to make shoe shopping comfortable.  You are never more than a few steps from a bench or chair where you can sit to try on your finds.  They have mirrors everywhere so shoppers don't have to wander around looking.  They place large shopping bags on hooks throughout the store to make carrying easier, and the service is always fast and friendly.

Maybe Imelda would just move in.
