Last Sunday I visited the club as a guest of a member.  First of all I would like to say this is the nicest health club I have ever been to in my life.  The facility is immaculate, employees are friendly and helpful, locker room has everything you would ever need and the work out room has top of the line equipment.  If I lived in Scottsdale I would get a membership asap and go there on a daily basis.  I belong to a small club in L.A. and now I feel jaded.
