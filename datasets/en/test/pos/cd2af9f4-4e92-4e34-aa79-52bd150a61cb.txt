This place is awesome for vegetarians looking for a good patty in a sandwich. Their Veggie Cheeseburgers are awesome. Just ask them to make a good sandwich and you don't have to work on what goes inside.
They accept online orders on their website and the prices are reasonable.
The patty and stuffing makes the sandwich quite heavy so a 20 inch sandwich feeds four light eaters with ease..
