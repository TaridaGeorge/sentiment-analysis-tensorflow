This is such a fun place.  Whether you're hanging out with one friend at the bar or a group of friends at a table - you're going to have a good time.  

Even if you take away the amazing beer - the food is great too.  They have your standard bar food like the 8th Street Ale Chicken Strips (my fav), fish & chips and burgers.  But then there are the Salmon BLT, the Carne Adovada and Chicken Enchiladas - AMAZING!

The icing on the cake is that the staff is great as well.  Always nice and quick to give suggestions.
