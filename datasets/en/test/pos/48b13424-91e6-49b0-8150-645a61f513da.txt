I actually had a great experience with Furniture Creations. I ordered 3 pieces of furniture on Christmas Eve for 1/2 the price I could have gotten them here in NY. Additionally, the shipping was free. The pieces arrived yesterday in perfect shape and exactly what I expected. I did make sure that I had someone in my building waiting to unload and then put it together for me. However, the driver did offer to do it which I thought was nice. 

I feel very pleased with the company and I highly recommend it.
