We had the lunch specials and our waitress was very friendly and so was the hostess. You can park around the West end of the mall where it says Garcia's and stroll right in. We had Spinach enchiladas and they were so tasty, and even delicious the next day for my leftovers. The salsa is very tasty and chunky and of course delicious chips. They brought refills on that quickly and gave us our own dips and extra salsa. My coworker had the Poblano sauce chicken enchiladas which looked like it had a lot of chicken in it and my other coworker had a burrito and I didnt hear any complaints about that. We were all gabbing and eating so we really didnt discuss the food extensively but I definitely thought the spinach enchys' were great.
