I would LOVE to find someone to extract my sweet tooth...til then....I live for SMEEKS!  This is mine and my son's reward for a job well done...or just for surviving the day!  The vintage candies and toys NEVER disappoint!  It is truly a WONDERLAND of all things yummy and fun!  Great staff...AND if you don't see something that you missed as a child, they will get it for you!  This place helped stock my son's stocking AND easter basket....I am sure his was the coolest and most wanted!  THANKS SMEEKS FOR BEING SO UNIQUE AND AWESOME!
