My absolute favorite Thai joint and luckily its only 5 mins away from home!  I have only been there once for lunch during the weekdays but usually go there dinner.  The weekday lunch menu has very limited options but their dinner menu has a nice variety.  I grew up on Thai food and love only my moms cooking but I would still absolutely recommend this restaurant to anyone even mom!
