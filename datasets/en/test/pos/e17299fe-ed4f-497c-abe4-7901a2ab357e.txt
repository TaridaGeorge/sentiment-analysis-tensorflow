There are a lot of reviews about this place that do not really sum it up.  Look, awesome fine dining, it is not, but it is a fun time for family and foodies.  Just go in, have a fun time and enjoy the menu and the bar.

I went here recently with my family and we were treated well and enjoyed the entertainment that they had as well.  This is a repeat place for us for sure!

We had the Cheeseburger In Paradise and it was tasty!
