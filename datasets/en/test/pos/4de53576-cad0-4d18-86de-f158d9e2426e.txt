stopped by this past weekend for drinks and food. tried the habanero chicken tacos and they were awesome! my wife had some tofu dish with jungle curry sauce and fried plantains. i am a total meat eater but i loved what she ordered. i would tell you what we drank but that stuff was so good and strong i had forgotten what they were called. we will definitely go back sometime soon. fun atmosphere and great service. also a good place for a date or hanging with the friends.
