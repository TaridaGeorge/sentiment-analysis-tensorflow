The Wild Ahi Sliders from True Food Kitchen come with wasabi, radishes, cucumber and a sesame brioche. Don't be mislead, the wasabi is merely a nice little portion which gives you a perfect essence, no epic nasal burns here. I ordered mine with the sweet potato hash which was absolutely amazing and the Green Arnie (Matcha Green Tea & Honey Lemonade) for my drink which was very refreshing and a perfect match. If you get the opportunity to stop in, look for Nate he's the cool guy at the bar. He'll get you squared away. True Food Kitchen is a cool place, great atmosphere, with awesome people. Highly recommended!
