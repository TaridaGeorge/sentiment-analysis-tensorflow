OMG!  The BEST French fries in town!  Real, fresh-cut fries with the skin still on. The perfect crispness and greasiness!  
Their burgers are to die for.  Freshly cooked, pure beef.
The place has been around for 57 years.  It's had a total of 4 owners in that entire time.
Really nice people and service, too!
