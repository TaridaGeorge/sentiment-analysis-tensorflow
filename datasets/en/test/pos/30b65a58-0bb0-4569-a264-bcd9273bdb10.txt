I absolutely ADORE this boutique!!!  This boutique has excellent finds without the crazy boutique prices.  They have great clothes (not for those of us on the bigger side though), good jewelry selection, cute purses and some really cool knick knack stuff.  If anyone I know needs something special I always take them here.  They have a website but what's in the store is always a little different and worth the trip!!!!
