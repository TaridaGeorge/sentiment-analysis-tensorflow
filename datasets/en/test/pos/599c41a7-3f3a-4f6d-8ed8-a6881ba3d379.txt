This place has saved me many times. I do work on technical equipment and sometimes the batteries I find are obsolete, rare, and damn near irreplaceable. These guys know their stuff and can make just about any battery pack. 

Plus they offer open accounts which is huge for my company. 

Thank you Batteries Plus....Job well done.
