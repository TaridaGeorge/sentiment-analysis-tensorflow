I never thought I would be reviewing a doctors office. Ever.

But there comes a point when you have experienced awful and feel like you have hit the lottery because awesome comes and slaps you in the face.

This practice is exactly that slap.
Every single doctor I have seen at this practice has been generous with their time, adaptive to changing insurance policies and compassionate.

I hope, with every ounce of my now healthy self that I will never have to go anywhere else.
