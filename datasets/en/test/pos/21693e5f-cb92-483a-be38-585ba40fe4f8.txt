My friend's wedding was held in the Aztec Room at the Arizona Biltmore and was incredible. 

Everything from the service, grounds, food and other amenities were out of this world. I'm not often impressed by resorts (many boast similar qualities). However, this one stood out (perhaps it being in Phoenix) and has some incredible history behind it as well. 

Also, if you don't want to stay there, you can also just visit for a day trip and get pampered and eat at some great restaurants like Frank and Alberts (among others)
