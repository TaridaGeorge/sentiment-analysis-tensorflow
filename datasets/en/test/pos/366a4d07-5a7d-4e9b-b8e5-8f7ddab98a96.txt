O-M to the Gee. This place is so much fun with the bright colors and oversized candy bars and lollipops to purchase! They also offer non-edible items with your favorite candy logo like piggy banks, shirts, and slippers. My favorite, is more of the adult themed novelty gum packs, magnets, candy thongs, and plenty of other items that would be perfect for gag gifts or just to change up any gift you might need to purchase. 

If you are in Scottsdale Quarter you definetly need to check it out, it's not just for the kiddies running around in the water display in front of the store! But be prepared to spend plenty of time in the store browsing all the fun items and candy :)
