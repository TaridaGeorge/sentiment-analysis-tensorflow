I went to FSA's Circle of Stars banquet and ESA was the event planner. I was expecting the usual -  good food, good entertainment, good location but this was a lot more! They showed a movie that had a bunch of sports heroes in it and played the Rocky theme. At the end of the night everyone got to take home the cutest miniature boxing gloves! And they had life-sized stand up cutouts of famous athletes  in the reception area and they put a photo of each winner's face in place of the athletes! That was cool, I'd never seen that done before. Those "extras' made the night very memorable!
