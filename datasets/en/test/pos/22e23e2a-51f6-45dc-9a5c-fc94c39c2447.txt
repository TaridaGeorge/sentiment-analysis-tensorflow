I love Appaloosa library.

The location is great for me--close to home and close to other shopping, restaurants, retail.  The building is gorgeous, inside and outside.  Their childrens area is huge and clean and equipped with loads of educational toys/tables.  They have great kids programs, activities and reading times.  My son just participated in their summer reading program.  Their staff and their volunteers are incredibly helpful.  There is nothing that I don't love about this library.

I love books and libraries and am trying to also nurture that with my son.  Appaloosa makes it so easy because he loves going there and so do I.
