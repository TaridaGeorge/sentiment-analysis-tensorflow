Beautiful Justine, the owner, seems to always there in a slinky dress and 4'' high heals (Ole).  She makes you feel like you have known before you've ever met.  She is a friendly host and smiling all the time.  

My two favorite things are: 
 - the long beans and 
 - the beef salad.  

Although the food is vietnamese, it seems more exotic.  I never get Pho here, which is my standard at all other Vietnamese places.  I guess I am too focused on the items above to even ask about Pho.  

You can also bring your own bottle wine and open it at the restaurant for a small cork fee.
