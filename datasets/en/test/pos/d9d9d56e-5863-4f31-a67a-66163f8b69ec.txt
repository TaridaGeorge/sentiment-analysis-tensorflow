After a very negative experience at another salon, I thought I'd give Sanity a spin. I was scheduled with Aurora, and she did a fantastic job! 

The salon itself is very nice and relaxing, and the customer service was great, which was very refreshing after what I had experienced elsewhere.

Aurora really listened very well to what I wanted, and to what I disliked about the way my hair was when I came in, and took the time to explain back to me what she was going to do based on what I had told her. The color (highlights and lowlights) turned out fantastic! I have already received multiple compliments and it's only been a day. The cut is also exactly what I wanted, and my eyebrows are perfect- not overly skinny but shaped very nicely!

I will definitely be returning!
