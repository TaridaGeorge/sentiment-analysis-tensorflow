So, I have been to Joe's two more times and each time I had the grilled chicken with Pecan Pesto sandwich.  I have increased my rating from 4 to 5 stars based on the absolute loveliness of said Chicken sandwich.  Wow.  Go.  Get it........taste it and you'll be hooked too!

Go now, what are you waiting for?
