I came here during restaurant week and I ordered a bacon wrapped filet mignon with shrimp and scallops. Came with an appetizer of  buttered shrimp and a dessert (I ordered crème brulée but they didn't have it so I picked carrot cake). 

The buttered shrimp appetizer was pretty good. The filet mignon was the best. I always get it medium rare and it always hits the spot. The shrimp and scallops were a bonus.

They didn't have the dessert I wanted but the Carrot cake (à la mode) was a big slice (like 1/4 of a regular carrot cake). I'm sure I would've gotten diabetes if I ate all of it but I took a few bites and finished the ice cream.

The price was pretty good, all of that was $39. In my opinion this is a little bit better than Mortons.
