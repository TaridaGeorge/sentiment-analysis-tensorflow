Best burger in town. Easily. The sweet potato fries are great too. 

I think burger-purists will have a hard time getting past the modern decor and scenester crowd, but I count all that on the plus side. I've never been treated poorly or felt uncomfortable. 

But the burger is so good that I'd even compare it favorably to national-renowned burgers like those at Corner Bistro and the Shake Shack in New York.  

And the late hours are great too.
