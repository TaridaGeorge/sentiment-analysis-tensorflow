Went there for reverse happy hour last night with my sweetie and another couple.  Place was really good and the prices were great!  911 roll was very tasty but not spicy at all.  Also had the Philly roll, spicy tuna, salmon tempura roll(very good), dragon roll and seaweed salad and really enjoyed ourselves!  Not too far from home, and definitely worth the drive!
