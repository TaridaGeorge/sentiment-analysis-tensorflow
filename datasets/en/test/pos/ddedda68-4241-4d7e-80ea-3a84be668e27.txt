I have been going to this Goodwill for awhile and I have never had any complaints about it. This thrift store is the most hit or miss of the thrift shops I frequent. Even so the staff is very friendly and everything is very organized. It seems the people who donate to this shop bring VERY outdated clothes, so you really have to dig in this place!
