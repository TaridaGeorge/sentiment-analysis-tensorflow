First time, 
Cupcakes are deliciously bad. I ate 2 and i think my taste buds were going into a shock. I actually had to take a breather from eating. 

When in doubt just as someone behind the counter what they would recommend super friendly and really helpful. 

Truthfully this is a once in a week treat. I wouldn't go there more then that.
