I have no complaints at all about Golden Donuts.  

I've eaten food from here a few times and have visited the location once.

The donuts are really good.  I've had the Pastrami and Egg Breakfast Croissant, and it is EXCELLENT!

The facility is clean.  

The customer service is top-notch.  

Bye bye Bosa Donuts for me!  I can now have fresh made, delicious donuts from a privately owned bakery minus the 'tude.  (All you Bosa Donut customers know what I'm talking about..)  All smiles from here on out!
