I've been bringing my cats here for the last 5 years.  The entire staff is awesome.  There are 7 vets on staff and I have no single preference, because they've all been so awesome over the years.  I had 2 very old cats who were cared for through their final years here, and everything was handled with great compassion.  Brak's highest recommendation, a strong 5+ on the Brak-o-Meter.
