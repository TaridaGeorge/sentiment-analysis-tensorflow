I'm a smitten kitten. Just beautiful. The coffee was fantastic and being that Oscar's is no where near my area of town, I wish I had been able to explore Harper's Nursery a little more. Thankfully my mocha was so tasty there will definitely be a round 2...3,4,5 you get where I'm going with this...

A quaint, lovely place to relax and enjoy a great tasting cup of coffee. You could easily miss this nursery/coffee stand while looking for a caffeine fix and if it weren't for Yelp, I never would've known it was there. I encourage you to stop, take a moment, have a latte and pretend you're somewhere else.
