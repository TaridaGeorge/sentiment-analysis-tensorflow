Best.Yogurt.Ever.

Visiting from out of town, no place will every compare to yogurtland! Normally the fat free + sugar free flavors taste icey and blah..but not at yogurland. Every single flavor (and there were A LOT) tasted creamy and delicious. Too good to be true. My one and only minor complaint is that they don't have yogurt covered pretzels as toppings. That's always my one splurge. But, I got over it. The yogurt flavors and all the abundance of toppings made up for it. I want to go back. Now. :-)
