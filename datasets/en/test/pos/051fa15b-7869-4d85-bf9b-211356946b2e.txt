Worth making a trip for.

If you're interested in food and enjoy chatting with the chef, this is amazing. The chef/waiter/maitre'd/everything is super calm, polite, and skilled.

The cafe ambience is very warm, the open kitchen makes you feel very much at home, the coffee is great (there's chicory root), and the food is superb.
