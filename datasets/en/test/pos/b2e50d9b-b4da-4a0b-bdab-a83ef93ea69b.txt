Altered Tails is wonderful. They provide low-cost spray and neutering for dogs and cats, as well as, for feral cats. The staff is extremely friendly and caring. They took the time to carefully explain in detail after care steps to ensure my puppy would heal promptly. My dog was spayed a few weeks ago she started to open her wound during the night by licking-- they fixed her up for free and really took the time to take care of her. 

I would recommend this place for anybody looking for a low-cost spay and neuter clinic or if they are having a feral cat problem in their neighborhoods.
