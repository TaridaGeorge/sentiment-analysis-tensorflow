took some clients here for a business dinner after reading some reviews from other yelpers.  the meal was jaw dropping to all of us!

started with a seafood tower, which featured some excellent, fresh tasting selections.  continued with one of the best caesar salads i've ever tasted, then a great bone-in ribeye.  i highly recommend the lobster mashed potatoes as a side.  

everyone else reported high marks on their entrees; i also tried another person's scallops entree.. unbelievably good.  if i ever return, would probably choose that as main course.

bottom line, i dont think you can go wrong here.  we ordered a LOT of food, and all of it was stellar.
