I placed a to go order and had personal size with onions, olives and red peppers, it's probably the best pizza i've ever had.

The personal size is 12" so it's the size of a medium at most other places. The personal cheese pizza is $9.99 but I had to pay $8 for just 3 toppings, but once I got to eat it, it felt it was well worth the price.

I would definitely recommend it to pizza lovers.
