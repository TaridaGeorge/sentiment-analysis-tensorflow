PGP IS GREAT. 

I love the DC Ranch location, it is a great place for a quick bite, grandmas dinner, first date or lunch meeting. 

The service was on point, the food was excellent and we experienced some superb customer service. 

I ordered a large pep for the two of us to share. They brought out a 14inch pizza which is 4 good sized slices each. 

The waitress Jennifer mentions they made the wrong size, this is the medium and they will bring another one asap. We ate the medium and were happily stuffed just as another "personal" pizza arrived. It was a 12 inch pie. We boxed it and sent it home with the old coworker. He now has dinner tonight. 

THAT IS GREAT SERVICE! 

Jennifer did a great job keeping the drinks filled and the table clear.
