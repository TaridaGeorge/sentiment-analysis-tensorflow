Durant's is as classic as a 57 Chevy; then again, this is one of the most classic restaurants in Phoenix that I've ever seen (and I'm a native). The food is amazing but it's gonna cost you some coin. 

I went with a large group for lunch and this place is known for their steak sandwich ($30) or some of their other steak dishes... the prime rib looked delicious.  I'll come back when I get the Christmas bonus.
