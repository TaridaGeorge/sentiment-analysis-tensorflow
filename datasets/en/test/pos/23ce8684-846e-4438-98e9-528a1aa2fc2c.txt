I love Bosa Donuts! The batter is perfect, not overly sweet, and doesn't get that artificial taste like other chain donut shops.

What I really like, is the service at Bosa.  I am a huge fan of the maple frosted buttermilk bar. Some days, there are only plain or glazed buttermilk bars.  When I told the clerk that I loved the maple, she whipped up a batch of the maple glaze for me and put it on a fresh buttermilk bar!  The next time I came in, she remembered me. Customer friendly makes this location in particular the best  =)
