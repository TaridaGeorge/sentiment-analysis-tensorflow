I actually found Lychee liquor there!  Need I say more?

You would think with a place that looked like that, prices would be a little much....but they were reasonable if not on the lower end for some.

Rare and intriguing wine and spirits, knowledgeable staff.  I didn't try any of their foods, but I wouldn't mind going again.  One of the staff recommended a nice moscato.  I took it home and enjoyed a glass immediately.  How did he know?

Wow.
