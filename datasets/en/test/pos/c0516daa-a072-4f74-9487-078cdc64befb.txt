Cornish Pasty is a great example of my theory that food inside of food is always delicious!

I've never had a bad experience with anything on their menu, although I favor the Pesto Chicken and the Chicken Tikka Massala the most.

If you decide to visit after 5 on a weekend, be prepared to wait.  Any earlier than 5pm will usually result in quicker service, but in my opinion, the lack of a crowd sort of takes away from the unique atmosphere.

Their happy hour is great also; they have a fair selection of drafts, including one of my favorite Colorado breweries, Ska.  And nothing goes better with a piping hot pasty than an ice cold brew!
