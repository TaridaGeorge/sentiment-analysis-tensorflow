I wanted a simple, yet delicious, wedding cake. We were recommended Honeymoon Sweets by our venue, so we decided to check them out. They have a variety of different cake flavors, of which you get to taste them all. The designs range from simple (like mine) to off-the-wall bonkers insane (if you're in to that sort of thang). Our tasting went well and the lady gave us some good pointers. At first, I was leaning towards cupcakes, but that option provides only one cupcake person, wheras a cake will lead to second helpings & possibly leftovers. GOOD TO KNOW!

We went with chocolate mousse and amaretto filling. The amaretto is so (mouthwaterringly) good.

My mom also ordered cupcakes from them for the bridal shower, their frosting is so smooth and creamy and the cake...delicious.

Totally reccommended.
