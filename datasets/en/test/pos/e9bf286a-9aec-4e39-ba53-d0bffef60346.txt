A NJ girl has a hard time finding great pizza in AZ.  This place is Chicago style but not deep dish like pizzeria UNO.  The sauce is sweet just like i make at home.  Toppings are fresh and plentiful without being to much.  The bruschetta is fantastic!  No reservations so be prepared to wait but it is worth it!  The take and bake option provides a great product without all the standing around.
