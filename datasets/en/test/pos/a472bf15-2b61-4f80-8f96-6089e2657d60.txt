Wish I would have looked at the reviews on Yelp! before I tried this place.  I work really close, but thought this place looked like a typical dingy tasteless chinese take-out restaurant... so I had no idea what to expect.

The pictures of the dishes on the wall threw me off to start... and the saran-wrapped chairs really made me wonder.  However, for $3.33 they gave me a huge amount of spicy chicken, which I barely could finish (but wasn't going to waste!) As far as value, this kicks the kung pao out of Panda or any chain Chinese... 

There are so many dishes here it would take a year to try all of them.  I like americanized asian, but if you love authentic chinese they have that here as well, as everyone around me was eating things I have never seen before...

I'm never going to Panda again.
