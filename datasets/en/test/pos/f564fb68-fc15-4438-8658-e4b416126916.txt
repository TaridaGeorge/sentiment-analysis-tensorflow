The 5.5 mile hike up South Mountain is a great, if you can manage the mirage of getting to the top (or read the mile markers).   As you go up, you keep thinking you are just about there, then you turn a corner and wind all the way back around.   It really is a nice hike, (just don't forget you need to get back down!) and once you get to the top you have a great view of the city and downtown.  There is a good amount of parking at the base of the mountain, but beware there are no trash cans, dog disposal bags or water along the hike.  Also, the road is open to cars most of the time, so be careful.
