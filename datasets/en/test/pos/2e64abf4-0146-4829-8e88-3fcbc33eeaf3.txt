Since this restaurant opened I have been here 4 times.  I have had a perfect experience every time!  There are just not enough good things to say about this restaurant.  Every detail has been thought out.  I have gotten something different every time.  But the cheese platter and fresh potato chips with wine could be a meal in itself.  Awesome service, very knowledgeable about the menu and the wine list.
I will be back!  Thank you!
