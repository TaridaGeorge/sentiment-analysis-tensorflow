Now this LA Fitness is nice! It's one of their newer locations, clean, doesn't smell like a locker room. One of the things I really like about this location is that I don't feel intimidated to come here like I have at other gyms (*coughs* Gold's Gym *coughs*) The staff has always been friendly, I don't feel like the other gym members are mocking me as I try to work out. 
I do wish they had a bigger time frame of classes, especially on weekends.
The only one I like better than this is the one at 83rd and Union Hills
