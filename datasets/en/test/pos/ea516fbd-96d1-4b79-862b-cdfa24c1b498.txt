The atmosphere is comfortable, the staff is consistently friendly, the presentation of the food was gorgeous and the food is fantastic. I have been to Amano several times and always return because you really can't beat the quality of fresh ingredients used at such a moderate price. It is a quaint restaurant that is nice for both a date location or family dinner. I recommend always trying one of the specials!
