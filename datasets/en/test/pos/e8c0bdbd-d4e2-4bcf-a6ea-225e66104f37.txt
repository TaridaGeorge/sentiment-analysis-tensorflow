Woohoo, a restaurant where I (being vegan) can order anything off the menu!!!

The fare here is generally towards the unhealthy side of things, but that's OK once in a while.

The balsamic picnic salad was very good -- the dried figs were a great addition that you don't see very often.

As for entrees, my wife likes the bbq 'chicken' sandwich and the green burger.  I agree with the assessment on the green burger -- and the thyme fries are awesome!

The 'bowl' dishes are good to, but not as spectacular as the sandwiches.

The place is uniquely decorated, is very casual, and a little bit hippie, which I am totally cool with.

If you have room, maybe you can split a tsoynami with you friend.  It's good, even though I usually don't care for soy-based 'ice creams'.
