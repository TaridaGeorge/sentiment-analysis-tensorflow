Funky finds abound.  It's Suzie Cheescake meets Elvira.  Too many interesting things, crammed from floor to ceiling.  If you are looking for something to give to someone who has everything, this is the place to go.

The owner, Vyle (as in "vile, repulsive") is a stylin' sweetheart who spends a lot of her spare time helping others (so, don't let all the black scare you off).  She's created quite a place here and really needs to get the word out more.  This is one of Phoenix's undiscovered gems, a diamond in the rough.  It's worth the drive from anywhere in the valley.
