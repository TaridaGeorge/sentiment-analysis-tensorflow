I had the pleasure of dining with two lovely ladies this past Tuesday evening. We were coming here for Restaurant week, but ended up ordering straight off the menu. From start to finish, the service was outstanding. Our hostess greeted us with the biggest smile ever, our waitress was so very knowledgeable and I took her recommendation from my glass of wine ( Ancient Peaks Cab) to dinner (Grilled Organic Salmon on Crispy Potato Cake molasses, lime, McClendon's honey) to dessert (The "Beloved" Chocolate Mousse Featuring Guittard Chocolate) OMG! everything was amazing. The table even shared the Mac and Cheese made with Vermont Cheddar. I am telling you, if I was at home by myself, I would have licked the bowl. Same for the Chocolate Mousse. (still shaking my head it was so good)

Will I be back, absolutely! It really was a great experience from start to finish!
