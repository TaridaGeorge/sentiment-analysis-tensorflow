Went here today for the first time and boy did this place deliver. This place has a nice vibe when you walk in. They have cool art on the walls nice furniture and they even take your order and have you pay on an I-pad. But the best thing is the COFFEE. I had a Agave with soy (I think that's what it's called) it came with 3 shots of espresso and was Super delicioso! I will be back Screw Starbucks the Cartels moving in on their turf.
