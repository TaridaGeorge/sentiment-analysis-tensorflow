What a fun night!  I have a tradition of eating dinner at India Palace or the Ethiopian restaurant across the street then going to the Tempe Improv and neither ever fail me!  Since it was a holiday weekend and a Sunday night show, it was no problem getting last minute tickets.  The service was great and the comedy was even better!  I have been to many comedy clubs with cheesy, overpriced drinks, but the Improv has one of my fav Pinots for only $9/glass!

I also learned that with the purchase of an Improv Tee, one can get in free every Thursday night---I'm in!
