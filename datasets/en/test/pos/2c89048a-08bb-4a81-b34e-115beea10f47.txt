I've based my 5 stars on one visit to Zinburger. I had the best turkey burger I've ever had. It was so juicy and delicious. My boyfriend had the Zinburger which he said was also delicious. We also had two shakes. The Zinbar shake was awesome and the bananas foster shake was thick and so yummy! The service was good and the deal (2 burgers & fries for $20) was great! I wish there were a location closer to us in Gilbert.
