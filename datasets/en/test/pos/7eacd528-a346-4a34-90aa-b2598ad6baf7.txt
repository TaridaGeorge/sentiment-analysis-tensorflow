I have been back several times & I love it. Food is great & the staff is really amazing. The wine list has really evolved since they first opened. They are not a 'wine bar' but the selections are well thought out, and very tasty. Thanks Hulas for being a unique new addition to the neighborhood.
P.S. I am new to this "yelp" thing. So I am not sure if it is appropriate to comment on other yelpers reviews. But in reading through the recent reviews, I was really upset to see that there have been a couple of very mean comments. It seems like maybe these people have there own agenda. It kind of takes away from whole concept of Yelp. *O.K., I will step off my soap box now.Thank you for listening.
