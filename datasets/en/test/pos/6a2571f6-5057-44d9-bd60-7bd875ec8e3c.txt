Faith is amazing, I saw faith for a long time until I moved an hour away. My wife actually has a hair license but will only see Faith for her cuts, style, color, or whatever else she has done. My wife works in Scottsdale and drives from Gilbert. Funny thing is, is she has clients that drive from Queen Creek and Peria to see her. Faith Fixes $15 haircuts. She does not pay for reviews like a lot of stylists. Instead she gives her clients a free cut when her clients refer her business.
