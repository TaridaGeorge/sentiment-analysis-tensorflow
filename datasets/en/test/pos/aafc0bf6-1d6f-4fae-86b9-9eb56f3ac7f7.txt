My husband and I been going to Malee's for such a long time and really love it. Deirdre, the Owner is such a warm and wonderful person. We finally went to one of the cooking classes this afternoon which was bought for us a a gift from my daughter, Andrea. We really enjoyed it and it was well worth it. Learned so much about Thai cooking. We learned how to make Crispy Basil Chicken, Red Thai Curry Paste, Roasted Chili Reduction Sauce & Tom Ka Gai Soup. Everything was so delicious. Anybody wanting to try some Thai food need to go to Malee's. Their CoCo Chili Fish & Drunken Dragon Noodles are favorites of our's.  Thanks Deirdre, Chis & Meche for making our cooking lesson memorable. We definitely will have to do it again.
