This is the third time we have eaten there. Each time the food has been great. But tomite Alex our server was the BOMB!!!  My girlfriend ordered a salad and it came with mushrooms,shes not a fan and it wasnt listed on the menu . He gladly got her a new salad w/o mushrooms. She said one of the best salads she has ever had. Alex was one of the best assets this place has,besides the food.
