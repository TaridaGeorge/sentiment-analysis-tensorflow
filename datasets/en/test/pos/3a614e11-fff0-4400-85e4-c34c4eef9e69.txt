Great find in the Arrowhead area!  Prices are very affordable and fresh sushi is always around you. First time at a revolving sushi bar and it was a fun experience. Didn't have to wait for food, just picked it right off of the conveyer belt. Staff was extremely courteous.  Will definitely be back :)
