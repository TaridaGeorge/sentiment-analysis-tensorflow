This place is fabulous! I walked in and said, "Do you watch Mad Men? I need to be Joan." The owner responded, "I have the perfect Joan dress for you." She helped me find the perfect dress ($20), earrings ($6), brooch ($14) and gloves ($7) for the part.

The store looks like it used to be an old home. It's a bit crowded, but they have awesome vintage clothes, accessories and housewares. As you can see, the prices are extremely reasonable. Some may consider the owner overly chatty, but personally I appreciate shopping at small businesses with staff who are knowledgeable about what they sell and eager to talk about it.

This is now my go-to vintage store. Love it!
