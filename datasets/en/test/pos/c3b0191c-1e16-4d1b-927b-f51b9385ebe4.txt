Don't let the strip mall exterior fool you.  The interior is charming and nicely decorated, with soft Tahi music tinkering in the background.  This is great, authentic Thai food.  Its the real deal.  The spice is rated 1-5, and be cautious with the spice level.  I'm originally from south Louisiana and I like spicy food, and I order mine 1 or 2. I work nearby and lunch is timely and delicious.  The Tom Kha and Pad Thai are well-executed classics! Nice Job Palee's Crown!
