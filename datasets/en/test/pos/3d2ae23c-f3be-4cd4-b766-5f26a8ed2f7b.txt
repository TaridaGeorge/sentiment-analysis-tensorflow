I hate going out for valentine's day.  the prices are jacked up, and the menus are usually uninspired using the cheapest ingredients possible.  

I can't speak for their normal menu, but our valentine's dinner was amazing.  lobster bisque with corn fritters, lobster ravioli, pork 3 ways...the chocolate dessert that had a small peice of 6 different desserts...simply amazing.

the patio atmosphere is great too, the waitstaff were very friendly.
