Alright. Stopped here after making a pickup at the Mesa Airport. The hype is real. Love the story. Love the farm fresh ingredients. The food is great. I had the turkey jalape√±o dog and fried zucchini. My daughter had the mushroom sandwich with sweet potato fries, both with the hand squeezed lemonade.  We sat outside. Great mid century modern burger joint decor. When I get in the area again, I'll definitely stop in again.
