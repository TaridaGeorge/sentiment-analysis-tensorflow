I've been seeing Dr. Barry since she started her practice in the Valley.  I gave her 5 stars because she has saved me a couple of time's.  I had specialists & trips to hospitals with no luck.  So I saw her & she realized how much help I needed & began to bring me back to the land of the living.  She is a doctor that care's very much about her patients.
