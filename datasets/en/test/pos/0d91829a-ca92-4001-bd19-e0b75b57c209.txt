One of my fav's- They also have stores in Los Altos and Sacto.  I used to be stuck on the Chicken, but now it's the steak and enchiladas- If it's in season, be sure to have some of the cold vegetable salad- "Escoveche" or something close to that.  Great martini's and the service- well a buddy of mine lost a couple hundred dollars and got it back the next day.  This place is full of integrity and good food too!!  Try to get one of the open air booth's.
