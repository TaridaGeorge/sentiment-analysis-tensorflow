There is something strangely addicting about Spinatos. I don't like to think of this as traditional pizza, as the sauce is much sweeter and the combinations unexpected. BUT it's still delicious and I find myself craving it ALL THE TIME. 

Two thumbs up for "The Signature" and "The Other Signature" pizzas, as well as the calzones (with ricotta!) and desserts. The garlic bread is yummy, too. We always order the same things (see, above), but I am looking forward to branching out trying some other dishes (see: Antipasto, Sandwiches).

To all of the sauce haters: accept it for what it is and get over it. The sauce works with their pizzas, and if you don't like it, don't eat it! But don't hate.
