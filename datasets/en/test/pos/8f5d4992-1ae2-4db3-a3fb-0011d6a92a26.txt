Nothing helps melt away the stresses of the day or even a long week like the La Bocca bruschetta planks. With every bite of the smoked prosciuotto & fig, pulled pork & pesto and roasted garlic & goat cheese, anything on my mind instantly takes a back seat to the savory enjoyment of every flavor packed nibble I take.
