I just tried Lucky's Pizza for the first time last night and it was awesome!

They serve New York style pizza and it is some of the best I have ever had, just as good as Ray's Pizza, if not better! The staff working here were very friendly, which made it a pleasant experience all around. I also love that they send out coupons which makes this an affordable place to order from. We even have leftovers and I can tell you after heating them up that their pizza still tastes good the day after.

I think we have found a new favorite pizza place and I will definitely be back again!
