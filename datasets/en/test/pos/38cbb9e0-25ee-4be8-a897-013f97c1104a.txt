They have more seating now, including outdoors.   

Even though I previously complained about the parking - it has never been an issue for me.  The lot right across usually has heaps of free spaces and if you go for early morning coffee you can sneak a spot right out front by the valets.

THEY HAVE ALMOND MILK!! 

Seriously, these are the best lattes I've ever had - I'm sorry I gave them 4 stars. I take it back!!
