Nice and newer Courtyard. Nowhere to eat in walking distance, but there's a mall nearby with tons of places. Probably the nicest of the Courtyards in the Phoenix area. I have stayed in quite a few of them too! They have a person singing and playing guitar near the bar area on certain nights which is a nice touch.
