My husband and I had an absolutely wonderful evening at Caffe Boa on Friday night.  We sat at the bar and had such fabulous service from the bartenders and a truly delicious meal.   

My husband had the flatbread with short ribs which was simply a slice of heaven.   Don't miss this app!  We enjoyed it with a great Malbec which was so delicious.  We had a great pasta and finished our meal with a yummy wood fired chocolate chip cookie.

Really don't miss this great restaurant - a cool space, locally owned, fresh ingreds and great food and staff.   Perfect!
