Okay - I've been going here fairly regularly and I've upgraded this to a 5 star place. The food is awesome and the people here are rad. It's one of my new favorites. I don't know what I was thinking giving it a 4. I'm stupid.

This place ranges from quite busy to comfortably laid back as it turns out. It's always an easy place to go though. 

As for the pronunciation, I used to say it like "Frasier's" instead of like it's spelled and then for some reason started saying it like it's spelled for the last few months. Tonight I asked the owner and he confirmed it was pronounced like Frasier's. I feel stupid yet again, but at least I've been sending people there.
