This place automatically makes you feel high class. It's been a while since I've last visited this area. Since my last visit, they have redone the parking, changed the stores, and redefined the entire shopping and dining experience. 

The have a great variety of shops. There are fancy restaurants offering a wide variety of cuisines. The best part is the grassy area to sit and relax or people watch. 

The parking off of Camelback is now valet, paid, or validated; however, free parking is on the north side. Plan to spend an extra 5-10 minutes to park either way you decide to go.
