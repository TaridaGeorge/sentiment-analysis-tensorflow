La Bocca is definitely one of my favorite spots in Tempe.  They have a really 'lax area with couches and when there's a game on they will put it up on the wall and project it. The places and ambiance is very contemporary, yet casual and fun. They have an amazing Hummus appetizer and they have a great selection of pizza's. The truffled mushroom pizza is TO DIE for. It comes with saut√©ed mushrooms, roasted tomatoes(I personally hate tomatoes and go w/out these), goat cheese, fresh spinach lightly tossed in balsamic vinaigrette and a little white truffle oil for good measure. YUM! Oh and don't forget to have a glass of their House Sangria...SO GOOD!

Anyone and everyone I brought there or suggested they go there has loved it!
