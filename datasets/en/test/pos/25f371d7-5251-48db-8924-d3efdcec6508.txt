Humble Pie event? Yes, please! 

I'm not going to repeat what others before me have so wisely stated, but this event was, like all the others, an evening of delicious food and drink. The people of Humble Pie Peoria really gave us an opportunity to try quite a selection of their menu (although, I wish we could have tried more of the non-fried appetizers). The fried ravioli and margherita pizza were my personal favorites. Oh and I especially loved the two LARGE glasses of wine I was given. They clearly know what it takes to win over a Yelper. 

Thanks for another fabulous event. Good times were had once again!
