Last week I came home from work to a dead AC during a typical Phoenix August but I was lucky enough to find this wonderful company on Yelp. I have never seen so many perfect reviews but now that I have experienced the company myself, I can see why. Miguel and his son are so nice, fair and professional. I know absolutely nothing about AC units or most things that require "handy-work" so I was weary to hire a company that I had never used before, my fears were unfounded. They were prompt, fast with their work and very fair with the price. Miguel was also very friendly and easy to talk to. If you need any work on your AC or heater, Miguel is your guy!
