This is easily my all-time favorite restaurant. Excellent food, excellent atmosphere, and excellent staff. I've never been disappointed with any aspect of this establishment. The ingredients in the food are fabulous, full flavored, simple, fresh and delicious. Great art exhibits, clean bathrooms, and a low-key ambiance that is hard to find. 

My only recommendation is if you aren't from the downtown area or if you're a first-timer... Steer clear of this place on First Fridays.
