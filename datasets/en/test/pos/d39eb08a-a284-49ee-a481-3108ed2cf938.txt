LOVE, LOVE, LOVE fry bread, and love The Fry Bread House.  I have been a fan since 1994 when they had their little hole in the wall location near downtown Phoenix.  I have followed them to the location off of Indian School Road and thank GOD they are now in the East Valley roughly 15 minutes from my house.  Try EVERYTHING because its ALL so very yummy!!  My favorite?  Vegetarian Taco and honey/powdered sugar fry bread.  Native owned and operated so you know you are getting the real deal!!
