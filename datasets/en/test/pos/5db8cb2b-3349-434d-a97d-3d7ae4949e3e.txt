My friend and I arrived at Bosa tonight a little after it closed. The lights were shut off and it didn't look like we were getting any donuts. That was until an employee (or the owner) noticed us and opened up the store for a moment to make sure we didn't go home empty handed.

Also, I only had one donut so I don't for sure, but it tasted like the donuts are actually made fresh and not simply reheated like the larger chains do.
