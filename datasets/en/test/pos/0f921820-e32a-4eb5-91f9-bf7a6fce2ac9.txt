I have no idea what most people want when they go to farmers markets.

I came here on a Wednesday night with my mom, a dude from Canada, and a dude from Paris, France. All 3 of them, plus me, loved it. 

Live music was playing in the background. I got some fresh-made pasta for my deprived kitchen. Mom bought the sweetest carrots I've tasted in the decades since my family used to grow our own carrots in our Canadian backyard. We looked at jewelry and other locally made knick knacks. People were just milling around, which is an experience that's hard to come by in the Valley. 

So, while I'm no farmers market expert, I can't think of a reason to deprive the experience of even a single star.
