Being from the East Coast, it's extremely difficult to find good pizza here.  I live less than a mile away from Z, and I'm grateful to have found it!
I love the toppings!  They even have a white pizza, which nobody east of Lake Erie seems to know about!
The staff is always friendly.  I like going there by myself, reading the paper or New Times, and chatting with the staff while I wait for my order.
Yes, price is higher than most, but I'm willing to pay for it!
