Dr. Jason Kanarish is absolutely amazing.  I am a Physician Assistant in surgery, and  appreciated his "bedside" manner as well as medical knowledge, which was phenomenal.  He spent AMPLE TIME with me and answered EVERY QUESTION I had.  Not to mention, he was fantastic with my scared min pin. I cannot recommend him enough.  The staff is also extremely friendly and helpful!
