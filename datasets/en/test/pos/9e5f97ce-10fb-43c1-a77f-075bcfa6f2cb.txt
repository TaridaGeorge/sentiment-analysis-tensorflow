This is an adorable little gallery located in the middle of nowhere, Downtown Phoenix.  My art teacher friend got fixated on bringing me here when she heard me complaining about Phoenix being chain hell (and thanks to her and Yelp, I don't believe that anymore).  I think she chose wisely as I loved this little space.  

It was a nice place to stop and check out, and then of course we had lunch at the attached City Bakery.  A perfect activity for a half-day of school!  Hooray creativity and uniqueness!
