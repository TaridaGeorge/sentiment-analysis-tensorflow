During the Superbowl many people who don't attend or host a party search for the perfect bar to enjoy the game. With the U.S. Presidential Election bearing down on the county, those of us who know, go to Nixon's to watch the results roll in, the biggest party in town. I was there in 2000, as the place was flooded with Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians, Independents, etc. I was there to see Gore win, then to be withdrawn. I was there when Bush beat Kerry too. If you were there, Nixon's is what a sports bar is on game night, a big game night; it's the U.S. Presidential Election, the Superbowl of politics!

This November 4th, I won't be there though, as NIXON'S BAR HAS BEEN CLOSED. 

All the best to Phil, we'll miss your place!
