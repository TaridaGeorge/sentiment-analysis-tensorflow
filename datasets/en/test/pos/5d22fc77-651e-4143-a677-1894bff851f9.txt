This might be a star to high, but honestly when you can find good Chinese food that can deliver on a consistent basis. I will give it one higher. 

The food is always hot, even when we get it delivered. Now I am only a couple miles from the place, but still!. Other places Ive gone has horrible food and it was almost cold. Ive eaten in and always have gotten good service.

I have tried several things on their menu- the special beef is awesome. The schezwan anything is good too. I really like the wonton soup. the potsickers are the best. 

I will of course be back and my search for great Chinese food is over.
