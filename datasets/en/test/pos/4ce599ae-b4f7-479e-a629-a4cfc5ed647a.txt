Tried Deseo during Arizona Restaurant Week for the first time and was completely impressed. The Westin is already and awesome venue so when you walk downstairs into Deseo, you don't know what to expect. Their bar area has an amazing mojito bar. It's one of the first things you see and smell when you walk in. They have dishes and dishes of fresh fruits, vegetables, and herbs that they hand muddle into your drinks. even the virgin mojitos are wonderful. 
Try Deseo - you won't be disappointed. It's classy and has sassy cuisine! Dress up - the venue is worth your great heels, ladies!
