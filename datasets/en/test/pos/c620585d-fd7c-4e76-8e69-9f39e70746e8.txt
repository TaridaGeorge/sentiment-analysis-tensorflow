Was told this place was awesome and it is.

Bread is perfect. Meats are high quality and the prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you get. 

My fave is the capastrami as its a perfect blend of sweet sauce and spicey pastrami. I didnt coleslaw on a sandwich would be good but boy I love slaw anyways and it blended everything together perfectly.

I'd suggest to friends and I have so I figured id suggest to all of yelp aswell.
