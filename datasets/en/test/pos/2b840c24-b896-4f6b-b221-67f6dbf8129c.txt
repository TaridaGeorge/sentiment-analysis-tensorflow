BY FAR my favorite gourmet sandwich place that I've been to in AZ. They have a pretty extensive menu featuring both hot and cold sandwiches, soups, salads, etc. Try the... well, hell... there are too many great sandwiches to recommend to choose just one. Only drawbacks are: it tends to be pretty crowded during the lunch rush, the interior needs updating, and it's closed on Sundays.
