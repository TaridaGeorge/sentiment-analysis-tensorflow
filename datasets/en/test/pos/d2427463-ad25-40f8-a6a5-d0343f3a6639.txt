New favorite Tempe bar!

I can't believe it has taken me so long to get to Boulders.  Badass beer selection. Badass drink specials!  I love bars that have daily specials. I would say Thursdays at Boulders are the best... 1/2 off almost all bottles of beer!  *But make sure you look at your tab because the bartender forgot to take of the 50% at first*

It is quite packed with a college crowd but falls into the lines of a 'Casey Moores' more than Mill Ave etc.  

Have really great Trivia there on Tuesdays! Its a big place with ample seating and cheap drinks but the best part is that you can bring dogs on the outside patio.  I don't know any other bar that allows dogs on their patio! Its fantastic! Yay Boulders!!!!
