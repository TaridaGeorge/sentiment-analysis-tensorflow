Bammo!

Space 55 is quickly becoming the best place to see local theater and comedy.  
Here are some sweet ass things I have seen/participated in here:
Galapagos Longform Improv-- Every Friday Night.
The Phoenix Neutrino Project--Every Third Saturday
Seven Minutes in Heaven (A naked magician)
Blar Lar lar 
Drunken Shenanigans

Space 55 is to live theatre what  the Hindenburg was to fire awareness.

Go to Space 55 and see what all the hubbub is about.

Not to mention Shauna the owner is quite the nice lady and a looker to boot..
