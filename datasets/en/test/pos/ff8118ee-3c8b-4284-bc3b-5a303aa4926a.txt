I was in the mood to stick to a budget on an afternoon full of fun with the kiddo. Impossible you say? Not quite. This place was worth the drive up to Scottsdale.

Not bad for the price of admission, it was $10 for me and the kiddo was free (for those under 2) for al day access to the carousel and train ride. There are large picnic/birthday party areas and playgrounds as well. There were plenty of crowds for the lines for both the train and carousel, but not bad, it was not bad, maybe 15 minutes per ride.

The park has a museum, shop and plenty of space to run around and indulge in vintage trains and gear. The striped train conductor hat souvenir was $10 and the buttered popcorn was $1.50. We can't wait to go back.
