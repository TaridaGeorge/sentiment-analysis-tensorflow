NPR Rocks. It is like breakfast for your brain. They play jazz at night, pretty pedestrian jazz selection though. Who cares about the jazz though, NPR is great and everyone should listen to it as part of their daily routine. It is better than the rap crap you are likely bumping next to me as I listen to NPR....
