This is my favorite place to get my groceries, salsa, tortillas, chips and uummm EVERYTHING. On the weekends they often have a mariachi band playing in the Cafe area which is a treat for my kids to see and hear. The prices cannot be beat anywhere. The diversity of grocery foods along with unique items will blow you away. The staff is very friendly and professional. I only shop here and will continue to do so soon. I have heard great things about the cafe but have not had the chance to try yet. Your definitely need to give this place a try. And buy something you have never had before, there's  lots of that to choose from here.
