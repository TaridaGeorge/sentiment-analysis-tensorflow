After calling out a few different companies to give us a quote, we were sold when Chris came out from AZ Luxury Lawns and Greens. To be honest, the other guys were a tad less expensive, but the QUALITY of turf that Chris brought out was light years beyond the smaller companies' turf. I trusted Chris would do it right, and it was worth spending a little more money to have a better product and know that it was done correctly. Now that it is in, I am extremely satisfied with the workmanship, customer service, feel of the lawn (It looks and feels amazing - my dog LOVES it), and I will absolutely, enthusiastically recommend AZ Luxury Lawns and Greens to my friends and family.
