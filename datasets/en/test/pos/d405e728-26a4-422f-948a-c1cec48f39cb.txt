I have been coming to this place for many years now (over 5 years) since I moved to Chandler. I come here atleast, if not more, once a week. I love their quickness of service and the food comes out fast too. Even on their busiest days (Fridays & Saturday evenings), the service is always great. Oh and not to forget, the food tastes great too! Always consistent.
