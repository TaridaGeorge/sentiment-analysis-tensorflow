Wonderful food and service. I got the beet salad and mixed fries. The salad was enormous. Easily good for two. I would have preferred less dressing is my only complaint. I've been here numerous times. Last time I got the veggie sandwich which was delicious. I'm a vegetarian but everyone else ordered burgers and enjoyed their meals. If you go you HAVE to order the sweet potato fries.
