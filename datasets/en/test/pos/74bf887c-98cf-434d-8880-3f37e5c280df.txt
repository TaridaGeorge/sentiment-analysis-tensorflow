Love Orangetheory (OTF).  I've been a member since they opened this location and I work out 3-4 times per week here.  They have TONS of class times and all their trainers are really awesome.  I was really out of shape when I joined the gym and my fitness level is immensely better since I started my OTF workouts.   I really like all the trainers.  It you REALLY want to work hard, try Darren's workout...  he does this BRUTAL 5-minute squat/lunge section that is so hard (but so good for you)!  Everyone there knows the clients who walk in the door, and they really take their time to help anyone new to learn how to participate in the workout.  It is not the cheapest workout in town - but it is DEFINITELY the best - really well-worth the investment.
