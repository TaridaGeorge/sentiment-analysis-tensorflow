Gotta love this place.

Treasures to be found.

Though I wish they had less pyrex and more fireking - I love all the finds to be had. While shopping in these two small old houses you start your mission to find something fun, unique and special. I have quite a few fun vintage necklaces from Cheap Thrills (in addition to shoes, outfits and some random fun finds)

They have a fun punch card and after ten items you get 10% off your next purchase (this might be for just the Cheap Thrills house to the East, since the newer West house version is mostly furniture)

I love checking in every couple weeks to see what is "new" at Cheap Thrills!
