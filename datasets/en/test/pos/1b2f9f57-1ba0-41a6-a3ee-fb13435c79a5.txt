I've been living in Chandler for 7 years now. I go every chance I have the chance to. I am a sushi LOVER!!! I've eaten at every sushi place possible in AZ. No sushi place beats Mikado, hands down!! The service is always great! It always has a great atmosphere, they're very welcoming, and the food is great! I STRONGLY suggest anyone go here and try it! 

I always get the "STST" (shrimp tempura & crushed spicy tuna) & the "volcano" (California tempura roll & a diced mixture of sashimi) & the "salmon poppers" (jalapenos stuffed with salmon and deep fried & cut in half). I would really recommend this place! 

It will be worth it!!! (:
