I heart Rumbi!!!! Every single thing I've eaten here was good. I highly recommend the Aloha Mango Salad (hold the onions, though, they taste kinda weird in it), or the Bali Island Rice Bowl with Pulled Pork. Anything you get is bound to be over the top delicious though. The mango iced tea is really good, too. Their food is absolutely addictive!
