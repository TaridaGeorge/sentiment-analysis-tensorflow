This is a really great little store that has been here for as long as I can remember.
 Great location, right on the corner of Camelback and Central.
 The selections are amazing,fruit and vegetables you never find at other shops.
The bakery is really good ,even though most items are made at other shops, it is all about convienance.
The Wine selection is amazing and the staff knows all about them as well as the hard liquor. What they do not have they can order for you.
 True is is a bit of a higher price but, it is always a nice time shopping here.
