Was excited to hear that the Richardson's menu is available at the new location around the corner at Rokerij.  The waitnress shared with us the old location did burn down but they are building a new location which will open in October.  It will be right next door to the sister restaurant, Rokerij.  It had a great atmosphere overall.  There is a wine cellar/bar with couches and tables to enjoy a glass of wine at before dinner. 
We ordered the chips/salsa/guac appetizer which was served with warm tortila chips.  It was delicious.  For dinner I had the turkey enchilladas which melted in my mouth.  
Can't wait to go back for happy hour to enjoy their $5 small plates!
