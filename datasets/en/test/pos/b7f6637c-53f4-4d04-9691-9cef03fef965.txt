Pita Kitchen is HANDS DOWN the best new Mediterranean  in town.  Secondly, it knocks the socks off of every other place on the west side  The restaurant was spotless, beautifully/tastefully decorated, comfortable and classy.  Moreover, the food was savory, fresh, juicy, zesty and perfectly put together.  With all of that, I was shocked to see how inexpensive it was.  The service was also extremely efficient, friendly and quick!!!  Most of all the owners clearly run their business with integrity and pride, and it made me VERY happy to support them given that they've created the perfect "everyday style food" restaurant!  MY MOM DOESN'T EVEN LIKE LAMB, AND SHE SAID IT WAS THE BEST GYRO SHE'D EVER HAD!!! That's saying something!!!  :-)
