If you enjoy  the one on 44th street, you will love the new location in Scottsdale. The decor is beautiful! I realy love the bar top. It lites up.
I had some of the best french toast ever!! This location is owned by
a father and son team. I have the pleasure of knowing them both, they are hard working, and give great care in bringing to their customers tasty, healthy and generous portions. I will definitely dine there again.
