One of the best Gelato places in the valley that I have tried.   Only one I've been to better is in Tucson, and that place is like being in Italy, this place is a hairs width from that.  Wonderful service, great atmosphere, parking isn't too bad, and prices are reasonable for what you are getting.  We will be back, again and again and again.  They let you taste anything you want before you order too!
