LOVE this place!!!!!!!!! My husband and I discovered it while driving through Del Taco on Dysart. A few weeks later, my husband came home with pulled pork bbq, and sweet potato casserole. TO.DIE.FOR. I have since gone back and gotten bbq chicken (fantastic, meat fell off the bones, and still tender), and mac'n'cheese (very homey, breaded crust, pepper, lots of cheese, perfect). I'll be back soon for more sweet potato casserole. The people there were very friendly too!
