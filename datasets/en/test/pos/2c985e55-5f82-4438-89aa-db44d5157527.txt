These guys are the best.  They don't do service you don't need, the don't recommend service you don't need!  I bought an Acura 3 years ago, just so I could take it to them when the warranty ran out!  My previous two cars were not brands they service and I regretted that.

My friend took his '92 Legend to AZ Auto Doctor 3 or 4 times insisting he needed new brakes, and every time was told, no, not yet, you have more time on them.  What mechanic shop do you know that does that!!!!

You drop off your car, and you have no worries that you aren't going to be treated right.
