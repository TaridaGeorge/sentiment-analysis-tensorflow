Been going here for years. I even go back here for service though I moved across town years ago. Pat, the manager, is always friendly and helpful and you can trust the staff to tell you what you need and don't need done as far as your car. The one time they messed up they stripped my oil pan plug and sent me to a nearby Goodyear store to have it repaired at their cost. First rate business!
