After great reviews on Yelp, my husband and I decided to try out Z's and were pleasantly surprised! 

We both always get the Greek salad with grilled chicken...its delish! Greens are cold and crisp, vegis fresh, lots of feta on top and comes with Pita bread.
We eat here 3 times a week...it's that good!  
They even have a drive thru if you're in a hurry.
