First time visit was not a very good experience. Anyhow, I went there again for few times since I like Japanese food a lot. I ordered the Sushi and Sashimi Combination. The Sashimi was really good with big slices and the Sushi was very yummy. Due to this, I ordered Sashimi Combination again for my another visit. 

Most people go there for the Teppanyaki. However, don't miss out their Sashimi and Sushi as well.
