The problem with North Tempe is it's dominated by large chain restaurants and Starbucks. Steve's Espresso breaks the mold and is the boutique coffee shop and lounge I've been looking for. They have the best coffee, tea, and fresh made pastries in all of Tempe. It's in an unassuming location and you've probably driven passed it a thousand times and didn't even know it was there. Make a point to stop by and I promise you wont be disappointed. My favorite is a Mocha with Almond Milk, no whip, and a Chocolate Chip Cookie. So good.
