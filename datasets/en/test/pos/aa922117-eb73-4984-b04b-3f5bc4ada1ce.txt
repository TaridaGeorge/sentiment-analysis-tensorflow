Love, love, love The Big Bang!! It is almost always a raucous good time.  If you go often enough however, the songs can get  a bit repetitive, since of course the same popular ones are played just about every night.  But they have excellent musicians who do their best to put on a fab show, and decently priced drinks.  That's enough to keep me happy!
