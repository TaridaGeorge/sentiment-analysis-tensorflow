I've done some reviews on Capriotti's shops in Las Vegas, so it's fitting I visit the nearest shop to my home in Scottsdale and write about it.

Grab the Bobbie, the Capostramie, or the Grilled Italian. You won't be disappointed. The quality of the ingredients, the cleanliness of the restaurant, the taste....oh the taste.

Don't come here if you are looking for a limp five dollar sandwich. You can go to the underground train for that. You want a solid meal...come here.

This Mesa location is pretty new. Opened up back in August. 

Highlights: 

1. Staff is friendly. Even when I come in right before closing.
2. The menu, although the same across the board, is amazing.
3. Bread quality is high.
4. Restaurant is CLEAN!
5. PLENTY of seating!
6. A nice TV to watch the game.

Lowlights
None. This is Capriotti's. Duh. It's a winner.
