As I eat my way through the menu, my opinion of NYPD has not changed.

The sandwiches are good. The calzones are also tasty (but heavy on the ricotta, which I know some people don't like). Baked ziti is still as delicious as ever. And they make a mean caesar dressing. Yum!

NYPD has also added and expanded delivery since my last review. There's a fairly large minimum order for it to be free, but if you're lazy then you probably don't care.
