Ahhh, good old QT.  What is there not to love about QT?  They let you mix soft drinks and have sooo many good options for beverages.  Their food isn't awful (actually pretty good for convenience store food) and the people are typically fairly friendly.  Though it's a chain, I think this is a pretty good QT.
