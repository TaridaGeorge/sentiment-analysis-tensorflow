It's been 14 months since I posted an update on this one, so this is just to say that this place is still great!  Today I feasted here joined by Norm R. & Mike C., enjoying such treats as Shrimp Vegetable Soup, Cream of Spinach Soup, an all the usual American, Greek, Mexican, Chinese & Italian fare plus an array of tasty desserts!     :-))
