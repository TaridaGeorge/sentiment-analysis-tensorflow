The food at Matt's was delicious!  Went there on Thursday and got there around 10 and only waited 5 minutes.  I had the pork chop which comes with eggs, potatoes, and toast.  My son had the waffle with bacon. I also ordered a side of bacon so I could try it as we'll.  It was all delicious.  The food was very flavorful and well seasoned.  My son is 10 years old and is a picky eater.  He loved the waffle and ate almost his whole plate.

I will definitely be back!
