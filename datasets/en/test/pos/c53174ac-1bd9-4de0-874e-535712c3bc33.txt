Came here with a large group for lunch, and the place was packed. Our service was attentive throughout our meal and everything came out in good time. Everything I tasted was great, from our appetizer of sweet potato chips to my main the short rib tacos and black bean mango salad. The decor inside the restaurant was appealing as well. I'll be returning soon.
