This is a wonderful place to have some beer, food, or both. The service was great. The atmosphere is fun. The food is delicious. Everything was perfect. I ordered the Aegean burger and it ended up being the best burger I have ever had. It was thick and juicy, but cooked perfectly through. I cant stand the site of blood in food. The burger was cooked with olives and nuts. Topped with pesto and feta cheese. Each bright brought me closer to heaven. The thick french fries accompanying the burger were their own religious revelation. Cooked perfectly to be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Even the jalapeno caesar salad was a new and pleasant experience. They are also not shy on their portions. I ended up happily leaving with food coma.
