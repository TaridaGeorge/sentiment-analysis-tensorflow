I only had their catered sandwiches and salad before, this is the first time for the real restaurant experience, and I fell in love with it! It was that good!! 

Oh the bruschetta! I love them!! Every single piece was melted in our mouth! Soft and flavorful! Two of us also shared the ribeye steak (14 oz), medium rare was done great, along with some sauteed green beans and fingerling potatoes, and our waiter was really nice to split the plate for us. Along the wine (lucky star?), hmmmmm... And how about some cheesecake for dessert? I love this night!

Excellent service! I cannot wait till next my visit!
