Lux has always meant a most excellent experience. Jumping from pure coffee shop to a space with the same 'flavor' that is also hang out comfy with food was done well. If you haven't been there once or twice you really should go. My favorites are the egg breakfast after soccer in the winter and dinner whenever, just because. People watching is always in season. My thanks go to the entire crew. Well done. See you soon.
