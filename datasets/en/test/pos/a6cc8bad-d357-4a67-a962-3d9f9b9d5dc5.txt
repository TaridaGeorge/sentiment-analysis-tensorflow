We attended the Las Noches de las Luminarias again this year and since I've been away out of the country for the last four months, upon returning I can appreciate more the beauty and serenity of this particular desert botanical garden.  The night was perfect, not too cold, not too hot and there were 12 different musician stations playing throughout the garden.  
Amazing part was when you are at each station, you felt like it was its own private concert, with no interference from the other musician stations.
A lovely evening of great food and company spent in a lovely atmosphere!
