This place is tiny but oh so good.  I love places that have free samples out for you to try when you walk in.  They've got a great selection of healthy options for a lunch that won't leave you feeling all gross for the rest of your work day.  The owner was very friendly with all of us and our food was ready in record time.  I had the #3 sandwich which had turkey, pepper jack, avocado, green pepper, and red onion on wheat bread.  An excellent combination.

My eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach, so next time I'll be sure to take advantage of the half sandwich option.  They also have daily soup, sandwich, and salad specials and you can pick two of those for $6.50.  My only suggestion for Breadcrafters is to switch from styrofoam to paper cups.
