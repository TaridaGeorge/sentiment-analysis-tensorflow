We went to Stax for a quick bit before hitting Fashion Square. They have the best sweet potatoe fries and regular tater tots ever, but that isn't what makes this place! If you want the "not so ordinary" burger, this is it! They serve mini sliders so you can get a little taste of several different meats. Yesterday, we had lamb, red snapper and pheasant. Yes, pheasant! They change their game up weekly! Get it? Venison, Elk, Buffalo, Kangaroo..............you name it, they game it! The prepare everything fresh and add unique toppings that really enhance the meat you choose. If you go, try the Sangria! White or Red! Nice and refreshing with the heat at 100 right now and perfect with just about anything on the menu! We won't wait so long to go back again! Thank you Bran! Stan and Pamela,
