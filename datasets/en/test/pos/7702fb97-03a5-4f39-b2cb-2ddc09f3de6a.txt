This place is like walking into an art gallery!  It is clean and the decor is hip but very welcoming. Even the display for the body jewels was professional and cool.  The staff! Let me tell you how frustrating it is to walk into a tattoo shop and be greeted by the quintessential punk asshole...hate it. Not to mention the occasional rock-star mentality of some of these people....Not Here!!   They are soooooo nice and sooooo talented, truly ARTISTS!!!  They will guide you with your tattoo, sketching and advice on how to " wear" it. Give them a try and you won't be disappointed.  Remember:  Good tattoos aren't cheap and cheap tattoos aren't good.
