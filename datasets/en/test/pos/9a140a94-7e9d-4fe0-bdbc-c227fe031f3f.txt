Thank you Fuego for continuing to serve outstanding food! I came for dinner on Saturday and had the short rib and I ate myself in to a coma. 

The food is fantastic, the service is stellar and the patio is bustling and cozy now that the weather is cooling down. 

I continue to recommend this place to friends and family and I am always glad I did.
