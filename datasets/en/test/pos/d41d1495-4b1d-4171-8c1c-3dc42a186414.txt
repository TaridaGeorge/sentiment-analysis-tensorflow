My buddy got married here and everything was perfect. The outdoor setting the two pools one with a volleyball court and hot tubs. Nice staff especially the bar tenders. The reception room was ok, a little small but still pretty nice.Presidential sweet was ridiculous. My Free upgrade to a king room with a balcony that allows smoking was pretty cool too.   Maybe I'm jaded by leaving snowy Boston to 98 degree palm tree festooned pool sides, but my four nights here felt like a month in paradise.
