Never have I been to a friendlier business. From walking in the door you feel as if you are in a Katy Perry dreamland. The aroma of fresh cupcakes over take your senses along with the glowing smiles directed right at you from behind the counter. Cupcake flavors are constantly changing except for the fan favorites which you can count to be in stock any day of the week. I know when I walk out of there I feel as if the world is suddenly a happier place!
