One bite of this "butter burger" and I was in an instant transported back to my Grandmothers kitchen as she would fry-up the most delicious burgers in butter!!!   This place is dangerous!!!    

The fried cheese curds were a great accompaniment to burger heaven and the house brand root-beer was a perfect finish to an inexpensive burger.

Unbelievably delicious!!
