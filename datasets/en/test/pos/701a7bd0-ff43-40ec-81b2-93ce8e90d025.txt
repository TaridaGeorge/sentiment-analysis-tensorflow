This was by far the best salon experience I ever had.  Deborah invested a lot of  time with me, helping me with all my hair issues.  I loved the music, the natural decor, and especially the clean air, toxic fume-free!  Why would anyone want to go to a salon that is not conscientious about the products they use?  After this experience, I will never do it again if I can help it.  I highly recommend Pure Salon.  My hair looks and feels great!
