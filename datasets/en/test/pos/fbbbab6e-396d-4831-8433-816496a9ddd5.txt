Just tried it today and it's in, the best breakfast spot in the valley!  

I got a Poppyseed Bagel with Strawberry Cream Cheese, Cole Slaw, and Bacon. It was all delicious and a good atmosphere! The owners seem to be running the restaurant and they have a large selection of a variety of breakfast selections. I'd recommend trying it over Einsteins any day of the week!

Stop in and give it a shot. Don't let your GPS confuse you though as to its location like mine did.
