I have been going to Ann Reed for waxing (and the occasional facial)for about 10 years. When I lost track of where she was for awhile I would not let anyone come close to me with wax. First off, shes quick, virtuously painless...the wax she uses probably helps with that, her location is convenient, shes flexible and accommodating with her hours and getting me in on short notice, very affordable...especially for how great she is, AND She has an eye for the perfect brow shape everytime. I guarantee anyone who goes to her just once would never go anywhere else
