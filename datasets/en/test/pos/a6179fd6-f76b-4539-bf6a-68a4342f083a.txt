My main review is for the Photo department which I obviously work a lot with.   The photo staff remains in place for years....which I LOVE.  They all know me....know my quirks....and jump through hoops to make sure I'm happy (which I always am).  Can't say enough good things about them.  And the stuff that they can do (poster, capture old VHS to DVD) expands every year.
