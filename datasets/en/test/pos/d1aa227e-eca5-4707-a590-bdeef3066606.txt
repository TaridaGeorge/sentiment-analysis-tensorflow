One of the best sushi restaurants I have ever been to.  Do not go here if you are seeking some generic maki rolls.  The selection is very limited and did not taste all that great.  Appetizers and drinks are great.  The bar/lounge area is a great place to go on a date.  Sushi bar layout was nice as well.  

Definitely not a casual place to go for dinner.  Love being on the expense code.  You go here for the japanese grill.  Get the specials for the night.  Mine was a kobe beef stuffed with some crap it tasted so delicious... yum...
