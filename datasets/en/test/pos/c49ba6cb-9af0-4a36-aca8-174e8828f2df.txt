Great great restaurant, the ahi slider is amazingly done, and you got to try the cucumber refresher, it really does reshen you up.

Although, i have heard from alot of people saying that it's not a "healthy food place" because none of their dishes are uder 500 calaries.  If thats what you are looking for, then i suggest you stay home and chew on carrot stickes.  I think the food here has a great refreshing appeal, and paired pefectly with their juices.  Definitely not the type of food thats gonna send you to the hospital with a heartattach.
