My friends and I went for a girlie lunch and had a great time. The food was excellent...it's cinco de mayo so the special was fish tacos and they were awesome. My friends had other dishes and we all agreed that we were in love...it's fabulous supporting a local business and Kitchen 56 did not dissapoint!
