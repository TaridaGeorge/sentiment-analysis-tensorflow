When I was an ASU student, I lost track of time when I was in Hoodlums. This music store rocks!!! Located in the Memorial Union, the store is like a smaller version of Zia. The staff knows their music so be sure to hit them up with any questions you may have or even throw some music trivia there way. They love to be challenged! The store typically hosts live concerts and autograph signings a few times a semester so keep your ears open.
