I LOVE Boombozz!!  The BEST lunch deal anywhere, a pretty good happy hour, and daily specials.  Great selection and variety of beer and the pizzas aren't your typical, boring one or two topping pizzas.  The Tuscan Chicken is the best pizza I've probably ever had!  Prices are decent and a great place to bring the whole family or meet up with friends!
