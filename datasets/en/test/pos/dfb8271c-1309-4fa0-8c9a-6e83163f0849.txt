The Regular's hang here. Its always happy hour inside.
I love the caterpillar roll & the miso soup, but what I like most the bartenders! When ever Rocky makes an appearance its a special kinda night. Eric is the heart of Kyoto's business, if you haven't had the chance to speak to him, you've never really experienced Kyoto.
I regret my "regular" status has been downgraded but every time I go in I feel like I never left. The sushi is really good, the drinks are to, but the ambiance is paramount. Go to kyoto, get a Sake bomber or try an off the menu - Banana C. Sucker. for a slap in the face treat. Tell Eric that J. Reds sent you.
