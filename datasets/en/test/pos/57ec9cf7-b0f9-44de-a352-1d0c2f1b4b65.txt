One of my favorite things to do in the valley. Warning: this isn't your everyday hike - it's more like an intense climb. Be sure to pack lots of water and wear appropriate clothing (I always feel sorry for tourists I see that are wearing flip flops, jeans or other uncomfortable hiking gear).

Although it's a bit strenuous, it's a fantastic workout and has beautiful views from the top! 

Parking at Echo Canyon can be a nightmare on the weekends, so try to go super early or have someone drop you off/pick you up.
