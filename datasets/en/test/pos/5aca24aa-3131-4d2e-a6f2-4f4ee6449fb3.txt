Being from Texas, we always go and get our Whataburger fix on Chandler and I-10. So when we saw that they were building a Rudy's across the street, we were more than extatic! Another piece of Texas here in Chandler. Everything was great, as expected. The atmosphere made us feel like we were back in Texas, especially the limestone rock wall outside. BBQ is the best, no one here in AZ comes close! You won't be disappointed.
