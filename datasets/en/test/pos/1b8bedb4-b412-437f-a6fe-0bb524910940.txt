Two Hippies has earned themselves a new customer.  I was craving something different than the typical drive-thru/pick-up that's available and found Two Hippies on Yelp.  I called to place my order after looking at their online menu and my call was received by a very nice woman.  I ordered a Burger with guac, lettuce, tomato, and pickles with chili cheese fries! The food was EXTREMELY delicious and I could not wait to get home and tear through the bag to get a bite because of the delicious smell wavering through my car.  After the meal, I was extremely content with their food (as well as their Blueberry lemonade, just one of their many flavors I might add).  I highly recommend Two Hippies to anybody looking for a GOOD burger and not a small tasteless patty.
