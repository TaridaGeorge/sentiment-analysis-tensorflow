Pappadeaux is definitely my favorite restaurant.  The food is to die for! Cajun deliciousness and fresh seafood!  Who could resist?

Things to definitely try:

Oyster & Shrimp Fondue
Mediterranean Calamari
Shrimp Brochette
Pasta Mardi Gras
Crawfish Bisque
Mussels
Blackened Opelousas
Desserts?  Where do I begin???  Sweet potato pecan pie ala mode, carrot cake cheesecake, creme brulee, bread pudding, banana pudding, all are good!  The list goes on. 

They also have yummy cocktails, including the famous Swamp Thing.  It's a fru fru girlie's drink and pretty sweet and potent.  If you like that sort of thing give it a go!

Things to note:

If you are on a diet forget it, there is nothing lite on the menu. 

They have a happy hour M-F and a live band on the patio on Friday/Saturday.  

The service is almost always good and the interior is warm and inviting.
