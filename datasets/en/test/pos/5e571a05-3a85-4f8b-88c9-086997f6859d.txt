I have been to Centro over the last 3 or 4 months, at least 8 times. Each time I come away thinking I will not be back soon enough. Casey and his good friends make you feel like an old friend. All well heeled in the wine area and with the delicious Panini's, what is not to love. Excellent music too!
It is as good as it gets for a small comfortable neighborhood hang out. Period.
