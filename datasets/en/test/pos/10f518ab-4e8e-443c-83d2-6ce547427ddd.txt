I am not someone who likes hotdogs.. In fact, most times I turn my nose up at them... However, a few months back my friend invited me to a food truck event in Scottsdale and raved about the hotdogs.. I was up for an adventure and went for it.. and I was not disappointed. In fact, I've tried to recreate at home and I try to make it to the Short Leash Hotdog truck as often as possible. 

The Lady Dog is where it is at with it's rich chipotle cream cheese and tangy friend pickles. I would recommend Short Leash Dogs to anyone. I am now a fan of hotdogs.
