I'm not a vegetarian, but this place is excellent.  

This space used to be the "In Season Deli", another great establishement of 28 years.  However, Desert Roots has picked up where ISD left off.

The menu changes daily and is always fresh.  Although their are some things I like more than others- everything has at worst been good, and at best- been amazing.  

A locally gem owned among the commercialism of what is now Mill Ave.
