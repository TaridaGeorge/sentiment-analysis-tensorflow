I have been going to this restaurant for years, when they moved from Main Street I was sad and loved the atmosphere. They showed up at this place and I was glad to see the food hadn't changed and the brought an updated atmosphere with them. There still have some of the same waitress as the old location. My last visit was after a surgery and I had specific diet restrictions, the waitress and cook were very accommodating and made it a wonderful visit. It is a must when family visits or just want good reliable Mexican food!
