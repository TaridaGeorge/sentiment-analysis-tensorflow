Tyson Crosbie has three important qualities that make him one of the best in his field and top of the list here in Phoenix.

First, his work speaks for itself.  Sure, anyone can learn how to take a picture, use the correct lighting, understand composition,  etc, etc.  However the ability to capture great moments that require impeccable timing, in addition to having an eye for that perfect shot, are two things hundreds envy and only few possess.  Tyson is one of those talented few.

Besides his amazing photography skills, Tyson is a true professional.  He came to the project with ideas, was a pleasure to work with, and always made himself available after the shoot.  If you're looking for the best, look no further.
