If you like Chinese Buffets, then this place is not for you.  China Chili is probably the most authentic Chinese food I've had in AZ.  Makes me feel like I'm in New York, or better yet, CHINA!  I have a theory when it comes to Chinese food - if there are lots of Asian people there, its prbably good, because for them its food.  Order the orange chicken, salty squid, eggplant in garlic sauce or the mayonaise shrimp and walnuts.  All are out of this world!  I even had my wedding rehearsal dinner, that's how much me and the family love this place!  The staff are attentive, courteous and happy to answer any questions you have.  It doesn't get much better than this!
