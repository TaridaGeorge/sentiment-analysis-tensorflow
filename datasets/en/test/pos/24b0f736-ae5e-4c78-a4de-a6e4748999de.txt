This is as good as it gets. The sensory and educational exhibits are well organized and thought out. I suggest going to the web site to check out value packs and group rates for admission. 

As of June 08, food selection is only snacks (chips, candy) from the gift shop, so plan to eat somewhere else.

My favorite exhibits have to be the CD glittering wall and the Noodle Forest.
