holy cow! when you ask for medium, be careful. i'm usually pretty tolerant of food heat, but my mouth was on fire! luckily i had a thai tea to help cool things off, but man...
for NYE, the service was a bit slow, but the food was delicious. i ordered the drunken noodles and loved every savory, hot bite. the wife had the ginger fish and it was tasty as well. there are plenty of options on the menu so even the ficklest veggie will be pleased with all the tofu options they offer. 
our waters were kept full the entire meal. our dinner companions ordered the masaman curry and i loved the creamy, coconuty richness. 
prices are very reasonable and they also offer take-out.
