Big ups to the Vig.  Sometimes you stumble on a restaurant so good you wish it was in your own neighborhood.  I want to give this restaurant a warm deep kiss--it excels at everything.  The decor: Mid Century Modern.  Cool and inviting.  The waitstaff: attentive in every manner.  We ordered the chickpea and pita bread for the table and our waitress refilled the plate three times!  The food: the absolute bomb in comfort food.  I could live on the spicy chicken wings: the best I have tasted.  The Cobb salad is perfectly balanced.  The Pad Thai: a complex flavor bomb of Asian tastes.
