I will second Ellen's review under mine... and I am not biased!  Brian and Kara (the owners) are great - they have both done a ton of events and have great experience with triathlons.  They have limited selection but all high end triathlon products and really cute apparel too!

Triple Sports offers clinics for beginners and wetsuit rentals for those of you not ready to take the plunge and buy your own.  I always buy my running shoes at Triple Sports and I have not been let down yet.  Great goggles, swim caps, sports nutrition products, and even yoga products to complement your tri training!

Check out their website and sign up for their newsletter - it will keep you up to date on events coming soon at the store and in our tri friendly city!
