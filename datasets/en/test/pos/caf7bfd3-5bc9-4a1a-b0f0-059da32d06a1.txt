I am a total carnivore, but I have dated around 6 vegans ...so needless to say I have been forced to eat a lot of food I wouldn't choose if I was eating by myself. 
Let's face it...most vegan food sucks. It's plain, it looks unappetizing, and the fake meat tastes like chewy pieces of unflavored cardboard. 

This isn't the case with the food at Green. It is DELICIOUS. A million different options all waiting to explode your taste buds. 
I personally crave the Thai peanut bowl and Buffalo chicken wings on a weekly basis. The BBQ chicken sand which is amazing too. Don't under estimate this place. It wouldn't be as busy as it is, or stay open as long in AZ if it wasn't so incredibly yummy.
