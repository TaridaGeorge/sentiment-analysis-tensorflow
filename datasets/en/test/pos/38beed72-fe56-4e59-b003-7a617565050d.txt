I trust BOTH Dr. Hunt and her PA Mimi completely. They listen to your concerns, address your concerns, are not judgmental either.  Every procedure is thoroughly explained, both before and during. I had a LEEP done a few weeks ago and Dr. Hunt personally called me with the results instead of having a receptionist or medical assistant do so.  I love her so much that I will be driving from Vegas to continue seeing her. She is amazing!!!
