I've been going to North ever since it opened. Actually my whole family has been going there for a long time and the four of us are pretty damn hard to please. Dinner here is consistently good. WARNING: Parking is a bitch at dinner time but worth the hassle.

Favorite dish:

Pasta Bolognese - oversized shell pasta with seriously, the best meat sauce i've had in Phoenix, all toped with melted cheese. 

The atmosphere is chic and modern with glass windows that look out on Kierland Commons. Can be noisy at times given the space is somewhat small and the bar and kitchen is open to the restaurant.

All in all...North is one of my favorite places to eat for many years.
