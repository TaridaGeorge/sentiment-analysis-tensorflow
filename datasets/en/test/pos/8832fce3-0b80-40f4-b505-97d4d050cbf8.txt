You can't go wrong with any flavor from Ben & Jerry's. This particular branch is located in a modern plaza with a beautiful courtyard where you can watch performers while you enjoy your ice cream.

The customer service can't be beat! The staff member, who I think is also the owner, was just so nice. He gave suggestions of what to see and do in the area.

I'd come back again just for the excellent customer service!
