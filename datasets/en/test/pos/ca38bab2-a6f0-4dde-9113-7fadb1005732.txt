I admit, I am generally easy to please. This place however, was fantastic! The waiter suggested a wine to fit our taste seemed actually happy to be serving us. I had a brie beaujolais that was the sweetest little mix of warm brie, dried fruit, and sour apples. I would love to see this little local owned place booming with people. Its on a quiet corner with patio seating outside and couch areas for relaxing with wine and friends or cozying up with a date. I was more than pleased.
