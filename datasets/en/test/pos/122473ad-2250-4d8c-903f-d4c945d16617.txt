I have no idea how they do it, but they do it.  This is by far the best pizza in the valley.  Sure there are other gourmet type places like Pizzeria Bianco but who can wait 3 hours every time they have a craving for pizza.

Like many, I came from Chicago and respect pizza.  The meats and veggies that are used are top quality at Spinato's but their secret is in the sauce. 

Spinato's cranks out a crazy addictive sweet flavored sauce that compliments some many of their pies. 

Beyond their pizza they've got this amazingly awesome baked spaghetti calzone.  I know right?  They bake the spaghetti into a calzone and make a whole new eating experience.  So long for spinning noodles into a spoon!

Go and enjoy for yourself.
