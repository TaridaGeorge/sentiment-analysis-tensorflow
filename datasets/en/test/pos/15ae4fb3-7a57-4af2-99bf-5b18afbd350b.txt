This place rocks the house.
The Foie Gras was truly to die for. I know it's been said before, but the way it melts in your mouth is unreal. The flavor is off the charts.
The Steak Tartare was also pretty good, about on par with some of the other French restaurants I've been to in other states.
But for a French restaurant in Phoenix, this place is a true gem.
