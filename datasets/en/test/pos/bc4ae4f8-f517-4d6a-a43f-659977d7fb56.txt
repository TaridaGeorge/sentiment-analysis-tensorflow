Beverly Canyon for beginner hikes.
Park at 46th St & Baseline, really easy to find parking.
Take the Javalina Trail to Beverly Canyon to West Loop.

If you get lost, just follow the trail underneath the power lines back to your car.  Pretty cool, right?  You can see the power lines from everywhere.  Great tip from a friend!

this is a good interactive map:
