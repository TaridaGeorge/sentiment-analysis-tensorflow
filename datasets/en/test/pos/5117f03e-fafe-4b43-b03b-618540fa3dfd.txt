Great food and service. Even though the location is at DC Ranch, my wife and I take the 15 minute drive and always do our splurge dinners here. Last night was our 36th anniversary and Eric our waiter was great. Sunday, prime rib night is one of our favorites, as it is the best value. My bone-in rib eye was the best I have ever had and as always my wifes prime rib was delicious and cooked medium-rare to perfection. Excellent spot for H/H too with the 5/6/7 promotion.
