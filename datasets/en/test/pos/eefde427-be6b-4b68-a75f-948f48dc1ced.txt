Who doesn't love this place? I've been here a handful of times and am never disappointed. 

Fabulous cocktails by master mixologists, amazing patio views overlooking the city and great live music. It's the perfect place for cozying up to your honey or for drinks with some girlfriends. The grapefruit basil and pear cocktails are my fave, but my roommate gets one that they mix with egg white that is really good too!

I've actually been here the last two weekends in a row and can't wait to come back.
