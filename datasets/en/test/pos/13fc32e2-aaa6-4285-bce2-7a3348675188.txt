This is a great place for Happy Hour and special times like birthdays, etc. I went here for a birthday and really enjoyed it. We happened to arrive during Happy Hour so our dinner choices were a lot cheaper. We ordered the cheese flat bread and the rice bowl. Both were outstanding. Portions were so big that we had to request containers to take leftovers home and the delicious chocolate cake we chose for dessert came with a candle and was free! Wonderful service, great atmosphere and terrific food...highly recommend St. Francis.
