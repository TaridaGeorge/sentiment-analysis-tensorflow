You know what you're getting when you order pizza from Papa Johns.  It'll never beat the better neopolitan/rustica kind of pizza at a real restaurant but it's quick, cheap, and sometimes you just want fast food pizza right??  

I've had a couple of pies delivered from here and every time they come out really fresh.  Breadsticks were also hot out of the oven.  Not something you can say about every Papa Johns, so this one gets my vote of full confidence!
