Came here for a cooking class and happened to be early. I walked around the store and the store rep offered me a free sample of a latte. They have a display of cappucino makers/espresso makers right at the front. Basically this is your go-to store for anything in your kitchen. They have fun trinkets and tools for baking & cooking etc...

The ravioli class I took was taught by Chef Mac. It was designed to teach you 3 different raviolis with sauces. The class was about 2.5 hours but it's good to at least estimate around 3hrs since you can shop afterwards since you get an extra discount. Classes average around $69 but it was definitely worth it. Especially for something that I can't necessarily teach myself. 

The store is a bit smaller than other Sur La Tables locations and is part of the Kierland Commons shopping plaza.
