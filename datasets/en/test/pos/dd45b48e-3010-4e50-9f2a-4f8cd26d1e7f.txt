This place was Great! The man behind the counter was friendly and explained what each pastry was with each unpronounceable name. We got this double vanilla custard cream thing with a wonderful flaky top and the best deal going on a package of day old rolls that tasted fresh the next day. Fabulous and I am already trying to find an excuse to make the drive ack over.
