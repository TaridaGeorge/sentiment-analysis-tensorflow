I've been coming here since 1988 and I've always been very happy with the food. This is primarily a lunch Establishment with the best food, prices, and quality service in the Valley. This is the only place that I know of where you still can get a lunch that fills you up for a mere $5. The dinner menu is more or less identical to the lunch menu with bigger portions and an average of $1.50 more for each dish. The quality of food between the two different locations (Baseline and Central) are of the same caliber. You simply can't beat the combination of great tasting food, filling portions, and affordable price! This food is on par with both Pei Wei and P.F. Chang's except for the fact that it is far cheaper!
