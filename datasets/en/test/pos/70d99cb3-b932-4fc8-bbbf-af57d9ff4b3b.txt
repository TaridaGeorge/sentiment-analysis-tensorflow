I have absolutely no clue way people are complaining about the service, so pay no attention to anyone rating this 1 or 2 stars.  The service is excellent, fast, and friendly.  They food, for the most part, is excellent and reasonably priced.  The theater is comfortable and never crowded.  We go 2-3 times monthly and use Groupons to save a few bucks.  Bye bye Harkins!
