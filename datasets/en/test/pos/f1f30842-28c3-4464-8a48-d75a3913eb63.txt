I had such a wonderful lunch experience here, that I took my dad back for dinner.  

The Ahi grade tuna burger I had for lunch was simply divine.  It was a special, and I expected it to cost more than the reasonable price of $11.99.  It was so very delicious.  The service was excellent, and it's obvious that this restaurant prides itself on teamwork and efficiency.  

My dinner experience was wonderful as well.  We both ordered salads, and they were excellent.  We also ordered desert, both the brownie and the cheesecake.  The brownie was good, but the cheesecake was to die for.  I will definitely be dining here again.
