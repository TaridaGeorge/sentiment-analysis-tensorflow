Sushi Brokers is one of my absolute FAVORITE places to eat. I eat here quite often, they have great food and a wonderful staff! They have food for every one which is nice, especially for those who aren't sushi lovers. They have a great menu with a variety of "typical" Asian dishes, some deliciously unique cooked fish options and even a wonderful hamburger with some exceptionally yummy mix of regular and sweet potato fires. The sushi speaks for it self, they have so many great options I am never bored with what I'm eating. Enjoy!
