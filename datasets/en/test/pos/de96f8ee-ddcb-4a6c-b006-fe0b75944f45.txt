If you're from a part of the country that has Greek diners or small, homey Greek restaurants and you crave that food, this is the place for you. I have to eat lunch here once a week. What it lacks in atmosphere is made up by the warm pita bread, large servings and everything feta. I don't usually eat salads for lunch, just not enough food. However, a salad at Crazy Jim's is a satisfying, delicious meal. The Greek salads can be topped with huge strips of grilled chicken, tasty gyro meat or calamari. The lettuce-free salads, called Crazy Salads, are to die for. The tzaziki sauce is great and most of the combinations in the salads are also be served as pita sandwiches.
Fresh down-home food that never disappoints.
