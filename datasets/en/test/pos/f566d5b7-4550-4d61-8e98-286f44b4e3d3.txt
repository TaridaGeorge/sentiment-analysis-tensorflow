My favorite dive bar in the universe! If you want to go somewhere with friends that has dirt cheap drinks, a rad jukebox, & awesome random people, then JT's is it!

Allegedly, I got really drunk here, danced my ass off on the dance floor that exists in my mind, met the owner, got a free t-shirt, ordered a pizza delivered there at 1AM, made several inappropriate life decisions, & ended the night with an $18 bar tab & a taxi ride home. Allegedly.

I lost the fabulous free t-shirt they gave me too. The front of it said- DUH! I mean, can you get any more classy than that?

If you can't have fun here, then you should see a doctor cause you're probably all bunged up.
