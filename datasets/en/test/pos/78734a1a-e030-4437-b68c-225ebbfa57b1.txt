This is the MOST amazing food truck on the streets of Phoenix.....no, actually the most amazing food truck ever!  The tacos are absolutely amazing - flavors like you've NEVER tasted.  They are spicy and cool with just enough crunch.  They make all their sauces from scratch.  The fusion of Japanese and Mexican flavors is unique and beyond tasty.  There is nothing out there like it.  You have to taste it for yourself!  Just a plethora of flavors - not one ingredient is flavorless. I love the vegetarian options - potato tacos and the special fried cotija cheese in the queso taco.  I absolutely crave these tacos.....you will too....you just gotta try it!
