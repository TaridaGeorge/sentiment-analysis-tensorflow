This place is bomb. They actually have good Vietnamese AND good Chinese cuisine. It's like a happy interracial marriage. This place is always busy and full of Asian people and not that many white people (it's never a good sign when you see eight Asian people and one white dude at Chick-Fil-A, know what I am sayin?) Anyways, it's the closest Viet restaurant to me and plus the prices are phenomenal AND they actually refill your water here! GASP. Do yourself a favor and try the green beans with pork and house chicken.
