If you like BBQ, this is probably the best place I've been to in phoenix.


If you have ever been to Lucille's BBQ in California or tempe it is comparable. Been there about 5 times and everything is good. They have large group deals making it pretty cheap. Also right when you walk in you see a donut making machine, and they give you donuts when you finish your meal which is awesome. Freshly baked and very fluffy. 

I come back often
