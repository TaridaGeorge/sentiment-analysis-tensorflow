I cannot imagine my life without Pita Jungle.   We generally order take-out.   So easy and so friendly and efficient.  (parking always is a pain at the 44th plaza, especially on weekday lunch hour.  
I love the pita pizza, the shwarma, salads, and chicken pasta.  HUmmus is really addicting.  I also love that no matter how many ways you custom order your choice, Pita Jungle accomodates without any attitude.  How rare and great is that?
Always clean, consistent and never a bad experience.
