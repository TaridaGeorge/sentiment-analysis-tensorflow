This place has answered my prayers.  Just when I thought I couldn't find a really good, inexpensive middle eastern place, my friend brought me here.

1.  Really good, really fresh pita bread
2.  Awesome salad, very fresh and tasty.
3.  Great tzatziki, and I'm very picky
4.  Loved the gyros and chicken equally

Plus the people working there are super nice and friendly!
I will be back often!
