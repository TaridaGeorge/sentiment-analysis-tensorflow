Love, Love, Love this place! The service and food are awesome! It's a little place in a strip mall and fills up quickly on busy nights. Good wine selection and they usually have some type of deal somewhere (Val-Pak, Groupon, Local Dines).  I will keep going back and I normally do not go out for Italian because it's so easy for me to make at home. This kind of Italian is not something I could make at home.
