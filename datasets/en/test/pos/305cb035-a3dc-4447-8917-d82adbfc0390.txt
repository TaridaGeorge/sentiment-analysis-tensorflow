Samis is just great.

you get what you pay for. and that's a Quality meal for a fair price.
portions are plentiful and it's a Clean environment 


Sami the Owner is frequently on site and ready to make sure you enjoy your dining experience. The staff there is also Just as attending as the Owner.

This is why i frequent Sami's at least once a week.
