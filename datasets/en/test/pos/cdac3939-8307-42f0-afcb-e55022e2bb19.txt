I finally found a bakery in town that has some of the same pastries, breads and cookies that I had growing up in Michigan.

I bought my son a smiley faced cookie and one with sprinkles.  He enjoyed them quite a bit.  I bought some chocolate horns which were simply amazing, albeit rich and heavy.

I enjoy chocolate and it seemed to me that more items than not did have chocolate in them.  

The service is excellent.  They even give free samples!

Now to go work it off..........
