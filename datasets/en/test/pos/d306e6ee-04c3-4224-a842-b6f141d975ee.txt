Wonderfully unique atmosphere.   Good coffee,  fresh & very TASTY food.  Comfy cozy to stop in for a bite or hang out all day.   Free Wifi.  Yoga in the back cottage.  Very attentive and friendly staff.  Multiple rooms to choose.  

I will become a regular here.   ...And I've been searching high and low for the perfect reading spot with food and coffee.  After multiple weeks of testing various shops all over the East Valley...my coffee cup will rest here.
