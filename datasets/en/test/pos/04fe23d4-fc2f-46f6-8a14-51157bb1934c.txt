I've been going to Rock Star for over a year and love it! Not only have I lost 40 pounds already but when I dislocated my shoulder in softball, Curtis and Rachelle helped me get back! They are both so great at modifying exercises to fit your skill level and physical ability. I would (and have) totally recommend them to  friends and family.
