I came here looking for something fresh.  I found it tastily packaged in an easygoing ambience for a couple extra bucks.

The menu is simple but interesting.  Of the items I tried -- salads and the enchiladas -- they were ample portions and well-executed.  There are other items on the menu that would make me want to go back to try.

No complaints.
