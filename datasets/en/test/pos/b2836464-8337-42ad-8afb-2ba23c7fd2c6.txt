Clean, friendly service, delicious food. Everything that you'd expect from In-n-Out, w/ out the line!

I was very surprised that one a Saturday afternoon this place was practically deserted. We were greeted promptly, by just about the smiliest (thats a word, right?) guy Ive ever met. Our food was out w/in about 5 minutes of us leaving the counter, and of course it was delicious.

A much better choice than the "new" food court at Fiesta Mall.
