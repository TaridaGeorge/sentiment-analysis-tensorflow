Great portion size, affordable, fresh, locally owned and no B.S. 

My girlfriend and I had just moved to the area and were looking for somewhere to grab a quick bite. We asked Siri and the the "Full Belly Deli" appeared on our phone. Tucked away off the side of the road, with no real noticeable features on the exterior we pulled in and I proceeded to have one of the best lunch experiences I have had in awhile. The prices are right, the ingredients are real and actually TASTE that way, and a grown man can get a 6 inch sub and actually feel full off of it rather than feeling like you you ate was a mouth-full of bread. Everything was great, simple and easy & I would definitely recommend them to anyone in the area.
