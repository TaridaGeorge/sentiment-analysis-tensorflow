Yummy yummy yummy! I am not a vegetarian but my daughter is and I LOVED the food! I had the black bean burger with sweet potato fries and veggies with hummus. Crazy good! I also had the iced latte with nonfat milk sweetened with coconut sugar. I will definitely be back though not as often as I would like. A lunch for two as $36 yikes! The atmosphere is very comfortable bright and cheery. It was clean and smelled amazing and the staff is super friendly!
