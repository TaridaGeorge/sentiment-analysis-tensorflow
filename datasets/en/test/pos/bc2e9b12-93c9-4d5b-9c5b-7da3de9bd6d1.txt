I thought I was going to be devastated when my old local sushi spot closed! Rest assured my Happy hour search has been remedied after coming to Stingray Biltmore. Monday thru Friday happy hour specials are just the ticket to make this girl UBBER happy. The staff is always professional and courteous and food comes out to perfection. I dined one Saturday night and the mere 15 minutes wait was worth the food coma!! Came hungry and left happy...will be back very soon for sure
