HOW have I not been here before???  This place is amazing.  The cozy little location makes you feel like you're out in the middle of the countryside, even though in reality you're steps from Mill Ave.
Everyone - from the bartender to the host to the server - went way out of their way to make sure our meal went well.  I had the quiche special (chorizo & goat cheese) with a side of the soup of the day (califlower with basil) and both were out of this world.  Add in some stellar $6 by-the-glass wine specials and you've got a happy, happy camper.  I will definitely be back!
One tip - I didn't realize they had a private parking lot behind the restaurant; so initially I parked on the street at a pay meter.  Save yourself the $0.50 and park back in the alley!  :)
