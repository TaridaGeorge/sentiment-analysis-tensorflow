Ok, I'm jealous. Usually when I come visit the fam in AZ, I get jealous over SOMETHING. Pink Taco (RIP), drive-thru Panda Express, Saddle Ranch or whatever. On the way to g-ma's house I see "frozen custard" on the sign and HAD to stop...and I'm glad i did. 

The burger was pretty damn good, but the custard was DY-NO-MITE! Oh, and the fries....best fries I've had from a "fast food" place. If you live in AZ, you owe it to yourself to try this place. If you're not in AZ, u might wanna make a visit just for Freddie's. I know I will...until they get sense enough to open one in S.D.
