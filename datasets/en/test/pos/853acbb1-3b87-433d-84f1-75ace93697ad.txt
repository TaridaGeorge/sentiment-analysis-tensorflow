Great food and great service.  I visit Tee Pee frequently for lunch.  Always have warm chips and consistently good salsa.  Typically go for one of the lunch specials---large potions, served hot, and quick.  The decor---yeah, it is pretty dated.  The dinning area is not at all conducive to large groups---but for a quick lunch, it is near the top of my list.
