Haji Babba is amazing.  The food is cheap and delicious.  It's easy to "build" a meal by adding up a bunch of appetizers.  The combination plates are great too!  The feta cheese appetizer and falafel sandwich are my favorites.  You can't leave without trying one of the delicious varieties of baklava they prepare as well.  This is *the* place to enjoy Middle Eastern food!  The staff is charming and prompt.  The place gets very, very busy at lunch time, so plan ahead for work lunches.  The grocery store is pretty fun too, if you have time to browse around after you eat.
