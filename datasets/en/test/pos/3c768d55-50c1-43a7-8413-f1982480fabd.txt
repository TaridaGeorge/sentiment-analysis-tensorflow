Gabriel's Appliance is awesome! Our Maytag washer stopped agitating, spinning and draining. I called the office and got a very helpful person who scheduled me for an appt a couple of days later as they were very busy, which was ok because luckily the breakdown occurred after laundry almost complete. Nicole came out (within time frame specified)  and within 10 minutes discovered a wire had separated. She went ahead and checked the motor, etc. since it had been opened up, fired it up and we were good to go. Well worth the $95!
