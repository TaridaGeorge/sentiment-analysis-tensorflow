Every time I come here I can always rely on great customer service and cookies that my little chihuahua LOVES. I think its great there is a place like this that exists. They have a dog happy hour that I have never been to nor taken my dog but I have heard nothing but great things about it. They pet clothes are kind of tacky sometimes but for the most part the toys and treats are what made this place the best.
