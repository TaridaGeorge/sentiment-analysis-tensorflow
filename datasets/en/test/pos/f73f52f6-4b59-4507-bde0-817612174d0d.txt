When you're eating La Famiglia's pizza, you almost feel like you're in NYC. 

The slices are big, sauce tastes great, and ingredients have always been fresh. I also love their Sicilian slices and garlic knots. Also, their calzones are not the best I've had in Arizona, but definitely above average.

Service is always friendly and fast enough for a quick lunch. 

La Famiglia is a nice, chill, family owned restaurant that we need more of around this town. So, stop in and get a cut or two, I think you'll like it.
