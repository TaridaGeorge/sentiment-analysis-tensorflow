Started off with the pretzels and cheese and fritters. Both were great! Then for the main course I had the turkey sloppy joe which consisted of ground turkey, pablano pepper and pepperjack cheese on a homemade bun... Amazing! And I topped that off with the blueberry cheesecake for dessert (YUM!!!). Overall great food and a very good experience.
