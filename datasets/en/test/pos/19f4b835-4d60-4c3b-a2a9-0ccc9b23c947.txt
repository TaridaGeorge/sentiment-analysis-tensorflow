I worked here for about a year from 2006-2007 but I swear, I'm not biased.

Sakana has the freshest fish and I can vouch that the chefs and supervisors take trips to California to pick it up fresh and they also get some of it from BC. The service is always great as well as fast and the restaurant is clean. The staff is always loud and fun and I recommend sitting at the bar and conversing with the sushi chef Masa if you get the chance. He's a complete riot!

Also, if the 108 degree fahrenheit roll is on special, order it! The flavors and sauce are unbelievable. I used to love it before I went fully vegetarian and still to this day, that is one of the few non-veg things I crave.
