Appears as if I might be in the minority here, but I prefer The Grind's Hamburger over Delux by quite a margin!

Having tried two of the three varieties of Burgers on the menu, the "BLT" is humongous and quite fabulous, with real beef flavor coming through even the bacon, but bring your appetite to this one. The "Sweet and Spicy" is very different, but yet again the beef flavor does break through the accompaniments and I liked it very much as well.

Fries were excellent and the overpriced Scalloped Potatoes (essentially Mashed potatoes and cheese) were to die for and I am NOT sure why!

Five Star Hamburgers, in spite of the price!
