I love this restaurant. Great lunch specials and a huge menu. Lot's of sushi specials. Fast service and a great lunch staff. Will definatley be back. Best kept secret in Phoenix. Express lunch service during the day and wait service in the evening. Several wines to choose from, also Sake and Japanese beers. Good happy hour specials 3 to 6 and 8:30 to closing.
