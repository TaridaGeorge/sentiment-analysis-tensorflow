In my experience, Dr. McComb and staff are the best vets in the EV. Really caring, knowledgeable, always remember us and the dogs, and don't try to get you to do all sorts of expensive stuff that your dogs really don't need. They are really concerned with what's best for the animals. Also, the separate dogs and cats entrances are really helpful since my Jindo really does not like cats!

I've been to other vets- and one really, really bad one- and the experience here is totally different. You'll love Dr. McComb. Highly recommend! They're at McQueen and Pecos Roads in Chandler.
