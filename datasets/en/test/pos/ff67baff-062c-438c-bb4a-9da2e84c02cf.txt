After almost a year since my first trip to Jade Bar, I returned before dining at Elements. This time my husband and I brought my in-laws on their last night in Phoenix.  Jade Bar did not disappoint. Our server was incredibly friendly and even went searching for a fourth chair so that no one in our group had to stand. We all stuck to pretty basic drinks, but man, were the mixed drinks STRONG. I think there was just enough coke in my rum and coke to give the drink color. 4 drinks totaled $41.

Jade Bar is a nice pre-dinner spot or just a good place to relax while enjoying the views.
