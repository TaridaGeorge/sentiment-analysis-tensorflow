Currently doing my Divemaster through them, and have done every class up to this point with them. I went on a live aboard trip to Catalina with them, and it was a blast. Classes are frequent and well taught. I highly suggest them for any of your diving needs. In the same building is Aqua Tots that does swim lessons for kids, and Workplace Safety for, well classes on workplace safety.
