Hidden next to a dance studio, this is an absolutely adorable gem of a place.  The food is a both sweet and spicy.  The cornbread casserole is something that I dream about.  Portions are big and the service is always friendly.  I almost don't want to share how much I love this place :)  The drinks are strong without being too boozy.  Have never had a bad meal here.
