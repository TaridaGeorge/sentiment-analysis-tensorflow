UnPHOgettable is absolutely phenomenal and the service staff goes out of their way to educate newbies to Vietmanese food such as myself.  For example, Alexander C may not have been educated as to how to properly enjoy his shrimp and pork stuffed egg rolls.  My server showed my how to wrap the hot and crispy egg rolls in a piece of crunchy cool iceburg with pickled carrot and onion and dip it into the sweet fish sauce with added spicy red pepper sauce.  The contrasting hot/ cold and sweet/spicy elements came together in a refreshingly unique way.  Go in with an open mind and if you like, the staff is ready to provide you with a first class education on how to enjoy the flavors of Vietnam.  Lesson #1: unlike Thai food, Vietmanese food is typically not spicy (hot).  I would recommend unPHOgettable to everyone!
