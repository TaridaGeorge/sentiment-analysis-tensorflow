Wow! What service!! I stopped in right when they opened since I'm an ESTer and was ready for dinner!! The server went absolutely above and beyond, even to the point of getting me a blanket since he thought I might be cold! 

The food was equally as amazing. I had the filet with garlic mashed potatoes on this visit. The steak was a smidge overdone, but still incredibly flavorful. They serve the steak here on a SUPER hot plate, a couple of high end restaurants do similar servings. It's really an acquired serving preference, so if you're not a fan skip the steak.

I'd definitely go back and definitely recommend!!
