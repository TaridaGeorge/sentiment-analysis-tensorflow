Since Jeremy started fixing my computer it has worked better than when it was new.  My computer was just a year old when I lost the hard drive and DVD/RW.  It was still under warranty so I got the part and left the rest to him.  I am not computer savvy so I am glad I found him!!!  He does amazing work, and does not cost near as much as any of the large size computer department stores.
