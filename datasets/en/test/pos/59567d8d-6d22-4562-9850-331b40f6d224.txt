Wow, can't believe no one has reviewed this  "Small, High end, well managed, well staffed, get the best bike" shop in town.  This place is not your "Discount" type Bike shop - these guys are Pros'.  They know what they are doing, they know how to fit you for a bike, and they know the business.  They Ride, they Tri, they know their stuff.  From Tri bikes, to Mtn. bikes, to cruiser bike, to accessories - If you are serious or even casual about riding or just want to get the best service - this is the place.   If you are looking for a cheap bike and no care service, then don't go here -There are plenty of other factory type shops that can help you get the wrong deal. 
Really - they will help you find what you are looking for - again, great service.
