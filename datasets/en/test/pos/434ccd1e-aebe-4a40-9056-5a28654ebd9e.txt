Greatest gyros in town! 

Paul C. and myself tried one of the more expensive, fancier, Rep rated trend joints and there was no comparison. 

What they lack in atmosphere they make up for with delicious food and great service! 

One time I spilled tzaziki sauce on my shoe and nearly ate it without thinking...that's how good the stuff is. 

They would be the perfect sunday lunch place if only they were open on Sunday.
