Awesome local ale house tucked in downtown chandler. This is true gem. Was staying next door hotel and bar closed so early there, but all hotel staffs were heading to santan, so I followed. 

My fav was devil's ale. Name says all. Can't beat after a long run around the course and meetings all morning. 
Outdoor seating is nice, has this most machine tha keeps me cool.

Staff was friendly and service was fast...and they were good looking. 

This is actually good place for casual biz aft five.
