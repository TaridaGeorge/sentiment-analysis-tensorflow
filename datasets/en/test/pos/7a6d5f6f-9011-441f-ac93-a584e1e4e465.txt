My wife and I had to put one of our cats down today. The staff at Bark Ave. were soooo amazing. They didn't make me wait, as soon as I cleared the front door,they showed me to a beautiful private room at the rear of the reception area. The room had a couch,chair, pictures on the walls and a large animal bed on the floor. They brought the paperwork to me in the room to sign. The whole process was very tastefully done and really made today a lot easier. What a difference it made to have such caring people help us with this difficult time. Compared to the vets I have had to use in the past, these people were angels. I will tell EVERY pet owner I come across that this is the ONLY place to take your pet on their last day. THANK YOU.
