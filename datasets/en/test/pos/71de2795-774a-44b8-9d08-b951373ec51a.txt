We had breakfast here two days in a row if that is any indication of how good the food is.  We were staying at Scottsdale Resort and I have come to realize after staying in numerous places that if you want a decent meal you do not eat hotel food.  I found out about Butters from Yelp and the good reviews and we were really happy with it.  They have great waffles, french toast, and fresh squeezed oj in a chilled glass.  They give you a nice carafe of ice water on the table.   The service is great and all food is delivered quickly.
