LOVED LOVED LOVED this place.

First, the service was impeccable. Our server was great and others would come by and refill our drinks and check up on us constantly.

The breakfast portions are huge!! The standouts were the breakfast nachos (such a great idea!!) and the pancakes (so fluffy inside but with a light buttery crust on the outside). The hangover sandwich was tasty but overwhelming, it's all protein, which was yummy but left you feeling gross. 

The fresh squeezed OJ was great and a huge portion.

They seemed to have great HH specials, but we never made it back.
