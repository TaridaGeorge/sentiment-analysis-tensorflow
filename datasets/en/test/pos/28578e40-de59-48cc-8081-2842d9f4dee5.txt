I visited Sweet Republic after hearing a lot about how good it was. We split the Pecan Turtle sundae, which was plenty large for two or more people to indulge. We requested to substitute one scoop of ice cream for a different flavor and it was headed without any trouble whatsoever. The pecans and salted carmel were bursting with flavor and richness. The ice cream was fresh and sweet. It is a good idea to share, since the sweet salty richness is a bit much for one person to handle. Overall, the desert was amazing and I would like to visit here again. I wish this place weren't so far away from home!
