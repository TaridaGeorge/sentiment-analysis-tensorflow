My fave sports bar. Amazing food, great service. Pnut shells on the floor... must have menu items are the Jess Jess wings, pretzel sticks and edamame... but honestly everything I've had there is good. For the vegetarians, try this... Patty Melt with a veggie patty and add breaded tomatoes... even non vegetarians will love it!
