I had been looking for an excuse to go to Indulge Burgers for months, since I live in the West Valley. It was worth the wait. I ordered a gluten free burger and order of fries (baked.) It was a busy Saturday lunch crowd, so we opted to eat on the patio. I was expecting the service to be super slow out there, but that was not the case. The waitress came out quickly and took our orders. Soon we got our drinks, then came out the fries, then the burgers. YUM! It was fabulous. The gluten free options were as good as I could have hoped. And they are puppy friendly.
