Probably my favorite patio in the valley.  I absolutely love meeting friends for a great brunch, lunch, or even dinner on their patio.  Their food is always very good and the drinks never disappoint.  Try the white sangria with brunch- full of good fruit and a fabulous way to get your day going.  
No, it isn't a "cheap" place, but ya get what you pay for.  Sometimes when you want good food, you are going to pay a little bit extra.  

I always leave Chelsea's a happy customer!
