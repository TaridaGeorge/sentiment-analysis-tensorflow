My dad and I found this place last March when on the way to a spring training game. Liters of Hofbrau on tap...? CHECK!  Took one bite of the schnitzel and it was like I was 6 years old again at grandmas house.  Amazing! 

We came back a few days later, amazing food again. Get the sourkraut cake!

Do yourself a favor and put this place on your weekly dinner list. If I lived in Phoenix area, I know I would!
