This is wonderful church  -  Scott is a gifted preacher whose sermons magnify the gospel  -  not only is he able to articulate how beautiful the gospel is, but how it transforms and  applies to how we live our lives.  Scott is also able to preach in an understandable, heartfelt way that is not full of sanctimonious Christianize. 

This church has strengthened my faith, confirming that there is more  to my understanding of the gospel then what I was getting at other churches.
