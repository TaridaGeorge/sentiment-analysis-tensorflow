Have been back 2 more times since my first review and Crudo has never missed a beat! Love, luhv, luv hanging out on the patio with Cullen, Bubba and Dina under the stars with great wine and even better company!

Last two times I have had the 3 course crudo deal and have found shear genius in all of the plates! So much food with fantastic, clever combinations and please do not miss the fish crudos, especially those that come in fresh from the Japanese fish market! 

Really a gem in So Sco that should not be missed! See you again soon!
