I was introduced to The Good Egg several years ago, when I visited a friend who lives in Scottsdale.  When I visited my friend again, I insisted that we have breakfast here.  I like the welcoming, homey atmosphere. The servers are delightful and the food prices are reasonable, for the amount of food that you get.

This time around, I tried the "Veggie-X" skillet breakfast, which had spinach, mushrooms, onion, broccoli and zucchini. (Check out the picture that I posted.) It was very satisfying.

For dessert, I had the Caramel-Nut Roll. A cinnamon roll topped with candied pecans, drizzles with creamy caramel. What a way to end a meal.

I would come back to The Good Egg, next time I'm in Scottsdale.
