Consistent excellent quality food. Best chicken shawarma sandwich I've had, and I have had quite a few-no other comes close to this one! Very fairly priced, generous serving. Add feta to the sandwich-they give you heaps and only charge a little extra. Thinking about moving to Tempe just so I can eat here every day :0)
