I just discovered this shop yesterday and must say i was very impressed. I met Matt, the owner, and he's a very nice, open guy who is simply trying to do something different in the outdoor sports retail business. His selection is very good for a new, one-man operation...and he has not only used gear but also new, at good prices.  And he focuses on quality stuff which i appreciate.  Any bike shop which carries Pearl Izumi gear ranks high in my book.  It looks like he had a good setup for bike repair too.  There looked like a good range of hiking and camping gear along with a kayak or two. Its tucked around the corner in a strip mall so unless you look for it...you might miss it. If you're in the market for good quality outdoor gear...check this place out!
