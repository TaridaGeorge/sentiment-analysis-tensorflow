Although his tagline is that he steals souls for a living, the truth is that Tyson makes Phoenix comes alive.  When its through his fine art abstract photography of Phoenix's industrial/gritty, such as Phoenix 21, or his event photography, he makes Phoenix, and the people who inhabit it look GOOD.   

Even you feel you are un-photogenic, and that 99% of other camera don't do you justice, somehow Tyson manages to be the exception to the rule, he's able to find the inner beauty in all of us.  So buy a fine art print to hang in your living room, or hire his to do some shot shots for your social media avatar.  You wont regret it, and you'll be the envy of your friends.
