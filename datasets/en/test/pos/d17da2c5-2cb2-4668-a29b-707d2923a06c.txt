Another great meal @dos!  I have NEVER had a bad meal here.  I thank the Taco Gods when I walk in the door because they have every kind of taco you could crave!  The Mexican Crockpot cracks me up.  yummy pork served with chips.  Wonderful in a tortilla!
I simply adore the Baja Shrimp Tacos, street taco version sans rice and beans.  Downed my tacos with a couple Dos XX Lager and a Juicy Lucy cigar.  Oh ya, you can smoke on this patio!  Boo-yah! (no, i am not a smoker, lol).
I had the nachos once when I was totally sloshed and I remember they were really yummy, too.
