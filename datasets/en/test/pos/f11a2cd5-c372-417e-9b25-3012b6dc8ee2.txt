My new favorite pizza place!  The pizza here is delicious.  There's nothing fancy about the pizza, it's just good.  I order the ham and pepperoni pizza along with 12 wings.  It's a special they have for I think 13.99.  The wings are just fine, but I'm not really that crazy about wings all together.   It takes about 45 minutes to be delivered.  The delivery boys are very polite.  I will continue to order from them for now on.
