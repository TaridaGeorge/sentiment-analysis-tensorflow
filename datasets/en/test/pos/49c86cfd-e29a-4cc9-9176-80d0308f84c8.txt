Wow, here came another coupon for lunch at Church's for $2!  I am SO there!!

Ok, so this was a Leg & Thigh Meal , with fries & a biscuit.  The service was friendly, everything was right in the bathroom, the food was great (including the fries), the dining room was clean & comfortable, & lunch was TWO DOLLARS!  That's all there is, folks!     :-))
