After a long search found a restaurant in scottsdale which not only looks good, has great ambience but also serves outstanding food. The watermelon salad was very fresh and the bruschetta was double thumbs up!! Not very pricey even though it looks upscale. Absolutely fallen in love with this place and I just can't wait for the next weekend to try rest of the menu.
