I attended a private party at LTD's Studio 5c venue and it was fantastic!  The rooftop venue is across from Sun Devil Stadium and has great views.  This would be the perfect place to host a pre-game party during football season.  Studio 5c is large enough to host a party of 75 people and the company's rentals come at a discounted price.  The venue is a hidden gem in Tempe that would impress guests for any party. 

I highly recommend hosting a party at Studio 5c or using LTD for party rentals.
