This is a great local find. My coworkers and I eat there virtually every week. The food is great! If you are looking for a delicious burger, flat bread, or even salad, the Garage delivers. To top it off, the service is excellent. 

People may complain about the little things, but I think it is refreshing to find a great local place that isn't owned by a chain and has a little heart and soul. I have been happy with The Garage every time I have gone and it continues to be one of my favorite places to have a good casual meal. I highly recommend it!
