This was my first visit and from the experience I will be back many more times. I had the special seared scallops in a leak cream sauce, melt in your mouth goodness. My husband had a more classic dish and it was just as good as mine. We got the bruschetta to start and it was flavorful and the bread was nice and crunch. The patio was a very nice surprise, you don't feel like you are in a strip mall. They have a decent wine selection and next time I am hoping to save room for desert.
