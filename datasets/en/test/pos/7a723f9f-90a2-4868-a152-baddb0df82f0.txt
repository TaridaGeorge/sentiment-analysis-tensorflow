Stayed here for an anniversary get-away weekend. Reserved a mountain vista suite. We were greeted immediately upon arrival and check in was a breeze.

We were wowed by our room. Decor was modern, eclectic and very well put together. The mountain vista suite is huge (about 1,000 sq ft) and feels like a small home or large apartment. Nice comfortable sectional couch, fireplace. Balcony with view of the Valley and mountains with doors leading outside from both the living room and bedroom. Beautiful bathroom with marble and lots of space and storage around the sink. Bed was very comfortable. 

We were busy shopping and dining, so didn't get to visit the pool or spa, but heard good things about them. Grounds are pretty, but simple. Location is excellent - the resort is hidden away on the mountainside, not off a busy street. 

We would definitely stay here again.
