Had a great experience shopping for lighting and ceiling fans here. They have a nice variety of lights and fans on display. They can also order anything from a huge selection of catalogs. Ashley and Shawn were both extremely helpful with all our questions. They helped me find a kitchen under-cabinet LED lighting system to fit my needs. They showed me samples, explained installation considerations, and custom-fit a solution for me.  I bought all the parts from them, but unfortunately, I wasn't able to go with it due to a problem my electrician uncovered in my kitchen. Lighting Design cheerfully refunded my full purchase with no hassle. Will definitely shop there again for lighting or ceiling fans.
