Probably the best food I have had in Phoenix so far. We ordered the hamachi with avocado and grapefruit, the fish was fresh and did not have a fishy smell or taste. It was like eating butter and I love raw fish with fruits, savory and sweet. Their kimchi was delicious. We also ordered the pork belly with sweet rice wrapped in bamboo leaves. It was so good and I wish I got two servings. We also ordered their fried fish which was delicious, I love whole fish. Their soft shell crab salad was okay, the fried crab was good but the noodles were a little bit too vinegary.  Their meals was adventurous and reminded me of UCHI and UCHIKO back in Austin!
