This is probably my favorite restaurant... ever. 

It's not the cutest place I've ever seen, not the friendliest staff I've ever met, but my god... they know how to make a damn pasty. And as a vegetarian, it blew my mind to see a food I would normally consider not veggie-friendly to come in so many vegan or vegetarian options. I am not huge on mock meat so I tend to stick with the Cheese & Potato pasty. However, what I have had of the mock meat is pretty crazy good. The dipping sauces are delicious and the breading of the pasty is phenomenal. 

Great place to fill up on drinks and grub at a fairly reasonable price (and if you think it's expensive - it's worth every last penny).
