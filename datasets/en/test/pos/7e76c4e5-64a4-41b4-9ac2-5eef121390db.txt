My favorite restaurant/bar in Arizona.  This is the place to come to when you are visiting Tempe/Phoenix.  Great food/drink, great ambiance, it will stay with you for a long time.  Come at lunch for a relaxed atmosphere, or come for dinner in the elegant dining room.  Its quaint, has a lot going on, great draw for locals, foreigners, and its haunted! When you are in the Phoenix area, sit here for a spell, you will be glad you did!
