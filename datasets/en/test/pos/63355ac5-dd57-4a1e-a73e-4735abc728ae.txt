Starbucks is Starbucks wherever you go, so this review is based on the location/atmosphere.  I love all the outdoor seating here - there are tons of tables, comfy chairs, umbrellas, plants, etc.  Every time I have been to this location there are always tons of people filling these areas.  It's a good place to meet up with a friend and spend some time.  (Provided we're still in the cool season).  Enjoy!
