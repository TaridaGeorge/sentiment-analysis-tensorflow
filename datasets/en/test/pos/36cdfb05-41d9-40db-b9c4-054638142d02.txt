I'm so happy this is in Gilbert!  I've only been once, but I want to be here every day!  The decor is upscale casual, very pleasing to the eye, swanky, and the place is family friendly.  Plus, they play great music.

11am - 5pm everyday wine by the glass or a pitcher of beer is $5.  

Mondays and Tuesdays after 8pm $20 for any house bottle of wine and bruschetta.

This is a wine bar, but the food is what draws me in.  There's an OK selection of wines and beers, but go for the food and atmosphere.

Favorites:
- Bruschetta (choose 4 from 11).  I liked the Smoked salmon with pesto and Tomato jam & fresh sheeps milk cheese.
- Olives (expensive, but soooo good)
- Chicken & Mozzarella Panini
