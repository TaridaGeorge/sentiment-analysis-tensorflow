So good! I went in here expeting a little dive with delicious food. I was right! The place was pretty empty and from the outside, it does look like they are closed. The owner was very friendly and helped me pick some things out. The ramen was delicious and filling. I'll definitely be back. I didn't get to try the lunch menu, but it looked like a great deal. I'll probably try it out next time I go back. (The noodles in the ramen are thick, soft, and incredible.)
