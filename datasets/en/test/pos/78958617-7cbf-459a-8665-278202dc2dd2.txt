I was referred to David and Green ID by another satisfied customer, and I am just as happy with the work that was done as they were.  Even though SRP does not honor rebates for upgrades from an energy assessment on a mobile home, I'm going to save so much money each month that I will get back what I gave to Green ID in a short amount of time.  The work was done quickly and efficiently, David and his crew explained everything, and I'm saving money.  Highest recommendations.
