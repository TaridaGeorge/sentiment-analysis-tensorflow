Bosa Donuts has the best donuts in the Phoenix area, hands down. Additionally they offer a variety of delicious boba Flavors that are incredibly refreshing in the Phoenix summer. I'm absolutely in love with their apple fritters and melon boba. For a morning treat or an after-party snack, Bosa Donuts is the place to go!
