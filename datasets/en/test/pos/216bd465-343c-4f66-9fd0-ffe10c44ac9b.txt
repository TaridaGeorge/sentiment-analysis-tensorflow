Great meal there Saturday nite!  Our Waitress Allison was friendly, knowledgable and excellent at her job!

The environment was fun, nicely designed and comfortable.  

The wine list was complete with many offerings and I liked how Allison had both myself and my hubby taste it before pouring it!

There were so many delicious sounding choice that it was difficult to choose...but we ordered the Shep's Pie and the Pork Confiet....both were fabulous, filling and unique!

We saved room for dessert and we loved the bread pudding and pecan fig pie...the coffee rocked as well!

Make sure you have a reservation the place was packed...and deserves to be!
