Over the summer we did a little taste test experiment. We went to all the TOP NOTCH Steakhouses (thank goodness my dad picked up the tabs!) Of Ruth Chris, Morton's, Flemmings, Mastro's and Donovan's....Donovan's won. The service is amazing...yes, two waiters that are "on top of it" You will never have to ask for water or wine to be refilled.  My Dad, Fiance, and I are steak lovers and all agreed that this was the best of the places we'd been too.
