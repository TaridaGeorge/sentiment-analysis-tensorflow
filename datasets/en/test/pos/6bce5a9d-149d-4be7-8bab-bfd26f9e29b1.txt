If you want fast food burgers that are fresh and delicious this is the place to go. More seating than at ASU. 

Delicious and the smash fries can't be beat!  However, err on the side of caution! Way greasy food, I mean- the grease drips off of the burgers and onto the paper. The shakes are fattening but that's the best kind, because they are delicious and made with real ice cream! I can not possibly recommend the milk shakes enough! They even have malts.
