The best sandwich shop in AZ hands down!

It's all in the bread. Since they make their own bread on-site, it makes your sandwich tasting experience so much better. The aroma and that first bite into your sandwich cannot be put simply. You will need to check a thesaurus to come up with better adjectives to express your experience here.

The italian focaccia and wheat bread are the best, especially the focaccia. I stand by the staple Dilly Club. They don't short you on meat.

Other greats are the Blazing Buffalo, Dilly Bird and the Vegetarian Special. 

All terrific and delicious. 

This is the kind of place that will have you coming back the same week.
