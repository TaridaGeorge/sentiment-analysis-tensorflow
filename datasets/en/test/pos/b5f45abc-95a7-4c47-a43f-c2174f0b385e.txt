Love it! No BS here! Just fun stuff, good music and good company!
MOST soccer (futbol) games can be played on the TVs, just ask your bartender! All new TVs BIGGER and Hi-Def.. Huge beer selection! ASK for a beer list.. Specials Daily. Happy Hour (4pm-7pm) and REVERSE happy hour (10pm-2am) Sunday-Thursday.. BREAKFAST served on Sundays (Perfect while you watch the game!!) Open early at 10am during football season, NFL package and Game requests can OFTEN be met.. We DO have Tennents, Boddingtons and PLENTY more! Literally, Its a laid back place, and for the most part, ASK and ye' shall receive.
