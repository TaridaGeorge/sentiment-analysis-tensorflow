This little place was amazing because the owners make everything they serve -- even the mozzarella cheese and pickles!  

I ordered a full chicken sandwich loaded with avocado, cucumbers, and other yummy things.  The owner suggested I just get a half sandwich, and I'm glad he did.  It was more than enough, and brought the price of lunch down to $6.  It came with a choice of homemade cole slaw, potato salad, or caprese salad.  The bread had a crunchy outside and soft inside.  Delicious!

We sat on the patio.  The view isn't much to see, but the small fountain adds a nice touch. The Deli is always packed for both lunch and dinner.  Open Tuesday through Saturday.
