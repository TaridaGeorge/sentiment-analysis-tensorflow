Everything about Adobe is Five Stars. The staff is always friendly and welcoming from the front desk to the techs. They all go out of their way to make you feel special, like you're the only client they have. Dr Newland is super. He is kind and patient and has the knowledge that comes from years of experience. He keeps up with the new treatments and isn't afraid to try something out of the ordinary if it might help your pet get well. I have nothing but high praise for the care I have received there and never hesitate to recommend them to my friends and family. If you need a vet or are looking for a new one, give them a try. You'll wonder why you didn't come here sooner!
