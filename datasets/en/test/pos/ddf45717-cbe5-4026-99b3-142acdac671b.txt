I cannot remember a better sushi experience.  One roll was OK (don't remember which one) but everything else was amazing.  Spicy sliced-sashimi tuna appetizer and fruit spring rolls for desserts were 'perfect' bookends.

On top of the food, cocktails, wine, the service and scenery were all top shelf.  Gotta go back.
