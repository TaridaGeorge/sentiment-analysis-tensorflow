Great place for sushi and non-sushi lovers. I went there my second time today for lunch, and it is really easy to get to by car, walking, or light rail!

The restaurant is clean and simple, with plenty of table even during lunchtime. I had the Tiger Roll (shrimp, avocado and cucumber) and a side of white rice, which was perfect for my hunger level.  My boyfriend's Beef Teriyaki Bowl was very simple (rice and beef with sauce), but was very tasty!

Haiku Grill has a pretty extensive sushi and non-sushi menu, and is a good alternative to Mill Ave. for lunch!
