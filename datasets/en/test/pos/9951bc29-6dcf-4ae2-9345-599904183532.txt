Having lived in or traveled through 43 states, this is by far the best bar ever. I used to play volleyball here about 20-30 hours a week, and go home tired and sober every night. ASU girls and Luke AFB guys playing and chatting while in the rotation line on weekends. Mello grilling and fixing your own hamburger while sipping a cold one with Scottsdale Leisure League friends during the week. One special 4th of July playing till dawn with two beautiful women and my best bud Pete in a light drizzle. It was impossible to find, so only a good friend could turn you onto it. Thanks for all the amazing memories. Someday I hope to have a bar just like it. Kudos to the owners for making it the greatest bar ever created. So sad it's gone.
