I've been to Ocean Club many times and even had my husband's 40th birthday party there this past September.  However, during our last visit I ordered the crusted ahi tuna which I've had many times before and LOVED. This time, though, it didn't taste BAD but definitely didn't taste good. I didn't even eat half of the meal. 

By midnight, I was sick. I called the restaurant the next day to let them know and had an unpleasant conversation with a manager who was fairly unsympathetic and seemed unconcerned. 

However, I got follow up from the General Manager regarding my experience. His excellent customer service is much more reflective of my previous experiences at Ocean Club and of the reputation of the restaurant in general. I look forward to my next meal there.
