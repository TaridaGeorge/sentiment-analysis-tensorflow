This place is amazing! Clean restaurant, great service, and great food. I ordered the yellow curry chicken adorned with spicy potatoes, carrots and side of white rice. The presentation definitely added to the meal along with its perfect portion size. The next time I visited I ordered the pad-thai, the level of the spiciness was quite impressive as they got it just right. 

Worth a revisit!
