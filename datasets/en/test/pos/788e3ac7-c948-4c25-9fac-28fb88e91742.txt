I love this  mall!!! If you are in Scottsdale, Az  , you have to go there, and after you are done with your shopping, there s plenty of great..  I mean great restaurants to  walk to!

 One of the best mall i have ever been if  not the best!! Some  stores are very high end  but you  also have something for everyone as there is plenty of stores to shop too.
