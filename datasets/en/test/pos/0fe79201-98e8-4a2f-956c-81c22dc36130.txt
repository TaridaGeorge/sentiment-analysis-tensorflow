If you appreciate integrity and a commitment to quality repair, you will love Lovetts.  I had the front bumper of my 2006 530 repaired for 60% of the estimate I received from Scott's simply by reusing the existing parking sensors.  The shop is not fancy, but if you desire fair treatment and an engaged owner, you can't go wrong here.  I'll be going back the next time I need body repair!
