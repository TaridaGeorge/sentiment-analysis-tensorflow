We own a 2012 Ford 250 and needed some assistance with a tailgate that was mangled by our fifth wheel hitch. It was DOA but the folks were very understanding and didn't make any jokes til we left. Someday it might seem funny to us too, but anyway...terrific place and we will return, hopefully for normal maintenance.
