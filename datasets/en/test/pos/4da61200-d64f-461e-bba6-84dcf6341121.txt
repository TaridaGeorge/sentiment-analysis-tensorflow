Locally raised beef, pork, lamb and chicken?! YES PLEASE.  They have great weekly specials and any option you go with here is AWESOOOOOME!

Don't blink or you will miss their main shop or you can pick up a selection of items at the Phoenix Public Market.  Wow I need to get on their mailing list.  The staff with pack and cut the meat to order especially on Fresh Fridays! 

Here is a tip! Their bacon is SOOOOOO popular people order it a WEEK in ADVANCE for pick up on Fridays!  

Yeah I may be able to get some meat cheaper elsewhere but, you can't beat the flavor and the quality here!
