I love Desert Ridge Childrens center! Although the office staff seems to be ever changing... They are still competent.  I've always gotten right in if my son is sick and I've never waited more than 5-10 mins for my appointment. One time I even showed up on the wrong day and they still squeezed me in. We see Diane Becker and we love her! On occasion I've also seen Dr. Thomas and we like her too! It is super close and convenient with a beautiful office and we have never had a problem!
