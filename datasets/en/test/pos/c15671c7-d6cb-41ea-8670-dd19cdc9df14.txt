The first time I had sprinkles cupcakes was at the location in Beverly Hills. I was so excited to find out that they had a Scottsdale location. I've tried most of their favors and all their cupcakes are always flavorful. I also like their flavors that come out during certain seasons of the year, but the red velvet will always be my #1 with the black and white at #2.
