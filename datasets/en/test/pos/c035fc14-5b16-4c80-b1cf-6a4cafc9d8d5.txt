After a bad experience at our Favorite Restaurant Roca Akor in Scottsdale, we turned to Yelp and Roka's very capable manager Charles responded within an hour, invited us back and more than made it right.  We knew they had great food and now, thanks to Charles, we know they have great management.  We highly recommend it.
