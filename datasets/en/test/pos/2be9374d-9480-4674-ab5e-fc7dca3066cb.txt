I contacted the owners about making a donation to a fundraiser and they were more than happy to help out.  I took a friend with me to have lunch and pick up the gift certificate.  We were both blown away at the Hana Bento box ($15 and I was stuffed with leftovers).  We split two desserts, the creme filled tempura and deep fried mango ice cream.  Both were great, though the chocolate sauce was almost too much sweetness.  The waiter was very attentive, and when we asked to split the check with two cards he was overly-apologetic about explaining the $1.50 fee per card, which we were happy to pay.
I've heard amazing things about this place and I live nearby, so I'm kicking myself for not having gone sooner.  It is so fantastic and Lori and Lynn are philanthropists to boot!  Thanks so much you guys!
