I went to Dr Kendra with a stiff neck and lower back pain. I was totally surprised when I left after the first visit and could look "over my shoulder" to back out of my parking spot! I haven't been able to do this in months! She is a very caring doctor who called me after the visit to check on how I felt. I can't wait to get back and continue treatment.
