I have been going to Orange Table for Saturday breakfast now for over four years. It is recently under new ownership, but the quality of food has not changed. In fact, the overall experience might be better! The food is OUTSTANDING. High-quality, local, seasonal ingredients and all prepared consistently every time. I love the banana nut pancakes and the Greek omelet.  You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu though.  We recently tried the Hatch omelet and it was fantastic - chicken, hatch chilies, onions, and Manchego cheese. Excellent!  I also recommend their coffee drinks - they have a great mocha.   In addition, their selection of small brewery beers and mixed drinks is fantastic.  It is really the perfect breakfast place now that they have added highchairs (hurrah!) and offers wonderful food with the option of alcohol for breakfast!
