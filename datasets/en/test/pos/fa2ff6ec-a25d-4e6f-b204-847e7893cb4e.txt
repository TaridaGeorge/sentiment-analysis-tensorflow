There are so many great Thai places in my neighborhood and this one can be added to the list. 
I went during their opening week and they had a screaming deal for a huge lunch special. It cost 7 bucks and some change and included a free drink. I stuck with my standard chicken pad thai and it was a treat. It wasn't very spicy and they didn't ask how spicy I wanted it, maybe I should have offered that information because the spicier the better for me.
The interior is small and I would describe it as intimate. Well lit, well decorated, clean. I was politely greeted and served quickly. Definitely a place I'll be back to with more frequency.
