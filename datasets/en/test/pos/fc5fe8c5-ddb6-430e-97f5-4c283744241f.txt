Wow, we have been here a few other times, but only for dinners and we decided to have our mother's day brunch here.  The food was phenomenal, the services were awesome and the prices were more than reasonable.  The entire staff was extremely friendly to our son and we would classify it as children friendly.  Everything we order tasted great, the ingredients were very fresh, the portion sizes were perfect and we walked away very impressed.  I've always been enamored with the design of the building as they've done a great job then add on a killer brunch.... we will be back often!
