The approach coming in was awesome! Coming in downwind, then making the base turn toward the final approach allowed for a great view of the area!
An airport like PHX with parallel runways allows for better traffic management for arriving and departing aircraft. 

From I-10, the signage to return rental vehicles is good. After returning the car, just board the shuttle to the terminal.

I had no issues or delays at PHX!
