Thank goodness I found Laura again! I used to go to her when she was at The Brow Lady and since then, I've been bouncing around to various brow waxers, but it was always so hard to find a good one. And if they were any good, they would leave or close down and I would have to start my search all over.

Laura takes the time to see what your natural arch and brow shape is and just enhances it. She is very detailed and precise. I would recommend her to anyone!
