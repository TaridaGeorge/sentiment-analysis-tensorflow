Best place for pizza & wings, hands down!

If you're looking for awesome wings and very good pizza, Red Devil is the place to go. I'm not too sure if this is the original Red Devil, but it's very vintage. You gotta try their special that they have which is the 20 wings with a large pizza for like $25 bucks, I believe? Can't get any better than that. Their BBQ sauced wings are amazing on a dish. They're known for their perfect ranch sauce and fresh dinner rolls. I'm not big on hot wings, but my dad devours their hot wings every time we go, so they much be good! 

Great place to go and always great service!
