As long as you know what you're getting, it doesn't get any better.  I was here yesterday and had the $3.50 special- fantastic! Bacon was crisp as ordered, hash browns were crisp, and they say it's a two egg breakfast, but these have to be the biggest 2 eggs I've ever seen.  Today I'm going there with gf to get hot wings and potato skins (it's 6:30 a.m. I know but I've been out all night, and isn't it great to get wings at 6:30 in the morning?!!!), and I've never had the skins so idk if they're good or not but based on everything I've had, it won't suck. The wings are basic Red Hot/butter variety, but as good as Long Wongs.  Service is always excellent, even when the owner is serving.
