Let's cut to the chase: If you like Asian teas or tea shakes, you should be going here. 

The staff? Friendly and quick to make my orders.

The prices? Cheap and a great value for the money.

The atmosphere? Urban, upbeat, clean, and enjoyable.

The desserts? Tasty and excellent for sharing with friends.

Oh, the tea? That's also delicious. They don't have the same selection as some other tea shops, but what they do have is excellent and I've never felt that I lacked for choices.

If you go: A melon smooth with lychee jelly. Trust me, on a summer day you'll thank yourself for getting it.
