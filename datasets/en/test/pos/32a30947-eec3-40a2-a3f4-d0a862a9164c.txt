One of the best thai resturants in AZ.  I love thai food and will drive out of the way to eat a good one.  But luckily for me this one is in my naighborhood.  Three good dishes that they have are the drunken noodle, the lettuce wrap & the mussels (yuphia basil).  the mussels are unique and you should try it.  I've never had it anywhere else prepared this way.  give it a try.
