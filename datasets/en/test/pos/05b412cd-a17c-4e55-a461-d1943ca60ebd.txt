This place always has the best atmosphere.  Its clean, stylish, and never a dull place.  They even have art that changes from time to time to keep your attention in the center of the restaurant.  

The chicken calabrese is my favorite. 

If you're going to take someone to a restaurant in Scottsdale for their first time, I would take them here because you can never go wrong.
