Have eaten here 3 times and the food has been excellent each time. Lunch specials are $5 and dinner $10 to $12, portions are big enough that you will not leave hungry. So far we have tried the pepper shrimp appetizer, the Jerk chicken, curry chicken, and the goat. Very friendly owners, always talkative.
