Tried it based on the Yelp reviews & it was FAB!! I got a mini-pedi for $15 (not including tip) & 3 weeks later the polish is still in place & looks great. The only difference between a full & mini pedi is no massage with the mini, which was fine with me & my pocketbook. Highly recommend it to everyone.
