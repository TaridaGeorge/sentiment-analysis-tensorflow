Hello Owner, Boss of Roadrunner in Phoenix, Arizona,
I went in with a few new challenges with my feet.  I was hoping that I would work with
a great person.  I was so thrilled with my experience on Wednesday May 16th 2012.
I want you and all your employes know that Trayce Gannon is a gem, she is truly exceptional in everyway.  It's not always easy meeting and working with a true professional, you are blessed to have Trayce.  I hope you can keep her happy and well paid so she will be there when I come back again, I only want to work with her
because she's the best.
Sincerely,
Katherine Nelsen-Allan
