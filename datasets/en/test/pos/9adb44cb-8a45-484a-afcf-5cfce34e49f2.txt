Why, oh why!? My husband and I had our very first date at Zen 32 6.5 years ago and return every year for our anniversary. The atmosphere was stellar, the Zen Punch made me feel fuzzy all over and I couldn't get enough sushi and zen triangles. I am no sushi aficionado but I sure do eat it a lot and I know the crap from the scrumptious. Zen always served up some good eatin' and was a great neighborhood hang out for many years. Good bye, dear Zen. You will be missed.
