Love this place! the original flavor doesn't taste like sour milk unlike some fro-yo places I've been to... and the only thing I would ask them to change would be the canned pineapples and instead offer more fresh fruit alternatives then canned.

"Love" without the guilt, weight gain, and achy wallet! ;*
