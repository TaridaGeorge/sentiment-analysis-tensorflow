When I saw the "Now Open" sign over this shop, I immediately went from the far right lane to the far left to make a U-turn.  An amazing store for home decor!  When visiting family in another state, a trip to Rod Works was always on the to-do list.  The company recently started franchising, with one in Las Vegas and now one in Higley, AZ. 

There's none of the frou-frou, too-cute stuff you see elsewhere.  This is all about wrought iron, hammered tin vases and decorations, glazed enamel, unusual wall decor, and so much more.  Be sure to sign up on the email list and get a punch card to earn $15 off.  Prices are reasonable and there is always good stuff on the clearance shelves.
