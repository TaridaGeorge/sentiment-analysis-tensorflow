I've been here my whole life, and I've never had an experience as great as this. From the one forest to the low hot desert Arizona is the place to be. I live in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area and love it, what I like to say is you get 3 months of hell and 6 months of heaven. But the shopping, food, culture, and beautiful desert landscaping really draw you in and make you feel relaxed, and special in your own way :-)
