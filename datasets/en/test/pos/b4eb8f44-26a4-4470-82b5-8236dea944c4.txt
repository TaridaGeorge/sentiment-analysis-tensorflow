I love samurai sams and the service from Nacho (the cook) over the years has been great. He is always super friendly and makes the t-bowl just how I like it. I like the white meat chicken bowl with no veggies and brown rice. Comes out to 450 calories a perfect lunch. You can also grab a bottle of the sauce for 5$. My only suggestions for this location would be to have more reading material for the lunch crowd and to give out free side sauces rather than charge 25 cents. Sam Sams is a favorite for a healthy tasty lunch!
