We love the yummy Sweet Potatoe fries (you can ask for the Rumbi fries to be Sweet only).  My husband loves the Luau plate.  I usually get a chicken bowl and the large is so big I share with my youngest daughter.

My daughter with Celiacs Disease gets a rice bowl with naked vegetables and chicken.  They now have a gluten free sauce (yeah)!

The service is good, you order at the front counter and then they bring you the food.  The last time to food took a little longer then usual and they gave us a coupon for free meal with out asking.
