I started visiting FEZ in August of 2010 when I started law school a short walk away. Over the past two and a half years, FEZ has become one of my favorite restaurants (even though my school relocated). The staff is wonderful, they carry my favorite vodka (Hangar 1 from San Fran), and the food is always delicious. Try one of their salads or burgers for a lunch that won't let you down. And for vegetarians there is a delicious, house made black bean burger.
