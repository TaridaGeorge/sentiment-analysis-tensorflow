This is my favorite car wash in the phoenix area. I've gone there about half a dozen times so far, and they always seem to do a good job (much better than the chain carwashes I've been to). It is not the cheapest place, and because it's a hand-wash, it is much slower than most other places. But if you have the time and want to avoid the swirlmarks and other stuff that comes from an automatic wash, this is where to go.
