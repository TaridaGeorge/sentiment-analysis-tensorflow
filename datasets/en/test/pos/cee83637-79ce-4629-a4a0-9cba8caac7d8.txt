I had a very expensive pair of leather knee high boots eaten up by my dog. The zipper was immovable and there was a 2" hole in the leather next to the zipper. I almost tearfully  threw them away then found them on Yelp. The fellas at Broadway said "no problem!" I couldn't belive I had my boots back! 
I also brough them a pair of old red cowboy boots I bought at a flea market that needed to a new heel and insole. They made them look like I paid big bucks for them! 
Very affordable too! Got both of these pairs repaired/refurbished for about fifty dollars. Thank you Broadway Shoe!!
