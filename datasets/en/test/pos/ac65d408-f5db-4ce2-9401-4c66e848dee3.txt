Absolutely the best Japanese restaurant in Arizona.  Whether you're bored with the ubiquitous maguro, california rolls, etc., or just looking for a great bowl of Okinawan noodles, this is your place.  Besides, where else can you find shiokara?

Order from the specials board for the best variety of tastes,  Or you can do what I do and let the chef make whatever he thinks is best.

 Sometimes the ex-pat sitting next to you is a celebrity in Japan who is in AZ to anonymously enjoy a little golf.  And if you're a baseball fan, stop by during spring training; you may be sharing bar space with more than one major leaguer.
