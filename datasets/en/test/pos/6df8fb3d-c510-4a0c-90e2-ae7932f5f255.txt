I have been going to Solare nails for a few years and I am very pleased with the care and service I have received there.  There are A LOT of nail salons in this area but Solare Nails offers more to the consumer.  The salon is extremely clean and well kept.  They always have the most state of the art pedicure chairs and you rarely if every have to wait to be serviced.  I was recently in San Diego on business and needed to have a pedicure.  I went to a salon and I was SO disappointed!  I guess it's  because I am accustomed the high quality of service and care I receive from Solare Nails.  Their prices are fair and competitive for the area.  I give Solare Nails my highest recommendation.
