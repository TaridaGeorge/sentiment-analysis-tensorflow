I love Keegans. Does anyone know their secret to the grilled wings? I would love to duplicate them as close as possible. Im addicted to these thing! I love th beef stroganoff too! We visit this place about once a week. Usually the Ocotillo location though! And almost forgot to mention, the cheesy potatos are delish too! As well as the tomato bacon, I believe it was soup. Also enjoyed the crab cakes on special one evening but havent seen them again since.
