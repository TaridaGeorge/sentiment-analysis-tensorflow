These guys make their hamburgers just like my Mom(in Central Illinois), does.  I can't find anything on the menu that I don't like.  I almost hate to drive by Freddy's, because if I do, and I get a whif of those burgers cooking, my stomach screams for one of their double burgers, fries and vanilla shake.  I love the family atmosphere of Freddy's and the friendly attitude of all of the employees.  There are other burger places that I like, but this is definitely my favorite.  I just wish there were a store in the Moon Valley area.  I'm hooked!
