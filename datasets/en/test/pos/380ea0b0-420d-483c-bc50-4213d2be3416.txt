While this is an extremely nice facility, one wonders why they didn't invest more money for the parking lots. Be prepared for a chaotic parking experience but the rest of the place is great. Definitely have to try the pizza!! Seats are roomy and comfortable - not a bad seat in the place. Staff is friendly and the atmosphere is casual
