Likely one of the top deli's in the entire valley. I had heard this place had a great reputation, and they definitely lived up to it.

The pastrami and ruben are both amazing, even the fries are good. Plus, you just have to try their black and white cookies (I was too full and took one home). Service was brisk, pricing is reasonable, and the atmosphere is quaint, old-school.

Thank god for little gems like this surviving in the "Tempe Marketplace", "Mesa Riverview" chain megatropolis we live in.
