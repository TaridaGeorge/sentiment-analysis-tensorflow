We purchased our latex mattress about three months ago. I can honestly say that it is one of the best purchases that we have EVER made! I was a bit skeptical in purchasing a latex bed, but we were reassured that it had many benefits including longevity, lasting comfort, and no more flipping of the mattress. Also the owner, Ken, was great to work with and they make the beds here in Arizona, so we were able to get ours custom made with one side being firmer than the other. Heavenly!!!! I can't say enough good things! If your in the market for purchasing a new bed, not sure what to get, check them out. Great prices. Great customer service. You won't be disappointed.
