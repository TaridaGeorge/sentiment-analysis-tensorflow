I can't really say anything bad about this location at all.  They provide great customer service, place is clean and organized and the produce is fresh.  They have some really good deals sometimes!  This week they have rockstars for $0.79 per can for every ten that you buy.  That is a great deal.  It seems to always be a really busy place.
