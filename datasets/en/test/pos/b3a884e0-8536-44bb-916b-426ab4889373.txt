I am already a fan of European Wax Center and the method they use for waxing compared to the typical salon method. Much less painful and better in the long run.

I usually go to the Desert Ridge location for Brazilians, but since this one opened closer to my house, I went in for an arm wax. I was very impressed with the service. Briana was my waxer and was nothing but friendly, helpful, and clearly skilled in what she does. She explained all of the different things she was doing to me as she did them and made sure I was satisfied with everything before I left.

I will definitely return for my next waxing needs.
