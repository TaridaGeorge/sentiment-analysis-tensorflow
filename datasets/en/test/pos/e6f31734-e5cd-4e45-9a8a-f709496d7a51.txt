My husband and I bought our first home back in 2009 in Phoenix. John was incredibly helpful throughout the whole process, especially for us first time buyers that had a million and one questions. He knew the areas that we were interested in extremely well, and was always willing to go to as many homes as we were interested in. We have recommend John to many friends and family, and everyone has had the same glowing remarks about him. Without a doubt he is the only realtor we will ever use!
