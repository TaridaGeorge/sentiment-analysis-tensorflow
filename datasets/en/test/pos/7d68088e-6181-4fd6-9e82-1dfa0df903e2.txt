Molli is a wonderful person and incredible at what she does!  

I began going to her when I was eleven years old and have known her now for over twenty years.  In that time, she and I have had my hair nearly every color imaginable, in various styles and lengths (each one creative and beautiful), and she even did hair extensions on me for my wedding day.  I am a model and she has accompanied me on many photoshoots---always with amazing results.
 
There isn't anything she can't do!  I highly recommend her to women and men alike.
