Food is awesome especially the way they cook it over an open fire.  Everything is tender and melts in your mouth.  I had sushi rolls, veggie's on kebab and blacked cod which was the best part.  The presentation and sauces were phenomenal.  This is the first place I actually had a good high end sake that I took my time drinking it was so good.  I will definitely return many times.
