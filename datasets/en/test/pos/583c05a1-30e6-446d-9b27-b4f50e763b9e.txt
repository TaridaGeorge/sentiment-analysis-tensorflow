This is probably the nicest library I have been to, other than the huge Central Library in downtown Los Angeles. Definitely smaller, of course, but the ambiance of it is pretty cool. It has a beautiful design inside and out. Very peaceful surroundings outside, and when the weather gets cooler it will be awesome to sit outside.

I live 6 miles down from it and just barely "discovered" it. This will be my new study spot =)
