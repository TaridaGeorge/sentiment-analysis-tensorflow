as promised i returned to desert botanical gardens after the yelp in bloom event. i took my parents to DBG while they were visiting me last saturday.  we easily spent over 2 hours walking around.  in summer it would be intolerable time to visit DBG but in march it was definitely perfect weather. it is kind of expensive but worth it.. just go ...it's stunning! see my pics that i took with my phone.
