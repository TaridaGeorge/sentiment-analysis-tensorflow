I'll be the first to review the PGA Tour Superstore in Scottsdale.  Let me tell you, this store has EVERYTHING a golfer would ever want.  The store is massive.  The have a golf club demo area, a putting green, stuff for your home, stuff for your office, golf bags, golf clothes, golf hats, shoes, etc.  They had decent sale racks too.  Best of all they had two golf carts for sale out front.  One was an Escalade for $17000, the other was a Hot Rod for ONLY $10k.
