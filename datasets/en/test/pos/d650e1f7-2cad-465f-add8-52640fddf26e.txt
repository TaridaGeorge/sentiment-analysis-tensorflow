Well, I completely agree with Tina!  I went to the Bernina Connection for the first time and was thrilled.  I stumbled on their website and found out that they were open late tonight (Tuesdays only).  They have a wonderful selection of fabrics, notions, and some books.  I was given a newsletter and told I'd be getting emails about sales and classes coming up.  Great customer service - I'm glad to have such a great independent business nearby.
