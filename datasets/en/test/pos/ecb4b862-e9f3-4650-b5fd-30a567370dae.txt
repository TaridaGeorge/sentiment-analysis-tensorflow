Could this place be anymore fantastic!? 

They have better coffee than any coffee bar I have been to..including *GASP*...STARBUCKS!!! 

They have alcohal and food. Their drinks are made perfectly! I love being able to enjoy a drink while studying. Their food is great too! I LOVE their mac and cheese! its only $5 but tastes like a million bucks! 

Im kinda obsessed with this place, i go here about 3 to 4 times a week.

p.s. they are the only place I been to besides an organic farmers market that carries KOMBUCHA with the seeds!. 

long story, short: GO TO LUX!
