Where else can you brush shoulders with red necks, white collared workaholics, cowboys and bikers in Scottsdale?  This is it.  This is the melting pot of Scottsdale.  Where the past meets the present.  I hope it never goes away.  The ambiance it wonderful!  You have fire pits going in the winter.  Music to help keep you on your toes and hot totties to keep your blood flowing.  We miss this place, no that we are in Austin, and have many good memories here.  Go with an open mind and don't get too dressed up, leave your stilettos at home and come in your biker boots!  FOOD:  Burgers are good.  DRINKS:  Can't get a better priced drink in Scottsdale, than here at Greasewood's.
