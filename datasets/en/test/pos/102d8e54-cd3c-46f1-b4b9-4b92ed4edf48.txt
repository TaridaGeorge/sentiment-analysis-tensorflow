This hole-in-the-wall Vietnamese restaurant is awesome and one of my office's favorite lunchtime destinations. The Pho and various soup dishes are great and they don't skimp on all the goodies to go with, providing large plates of Thai basil, bean sprouts, peppers, etc. The rice dishes are good too. I especially like the beef with lemongrass rice dish. The pork and shrimp rolls are also excellent and very big - almost a meal on their own. The best thing about this restaurant (besides its very authentic and yummy food and quick - never a wait - service) is that it is cheap, cheap, cheap. Check it out!
