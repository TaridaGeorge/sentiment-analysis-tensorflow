Totally AMAZING pet supply! Wholesale prices to the public and super friendly staff! It's a bit overwhelming the first time you go so expect to spend some time there - you can call to request a catalog or go online to price items since the items in the warehouse are not priced (and yes, they accept credit cards). They are always busy so many times items are missing but they are constantly restocking the shelves. I priced the same items at Petsmart for $220, on Amazon for $125, and paid $85 at Ryan's.
