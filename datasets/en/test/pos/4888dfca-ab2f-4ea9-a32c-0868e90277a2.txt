I may be biased because my friend is one of the managers here, but it is one of my favorite places to start out a night out. Great rolls, amazing calamari, and good prices. I love their decor and have about 50 million pictures of me and my girls with the orange wall as the backdrop. It's also great for a lazy weekday dinner, too. You can dress down and still feel comfortable....in fact, i'm heading over tonight after monday night football for a quick sushi fix!
