My hard drive took a dump.  I had my entire life on that drive and nothing backed up.  All my photos from my 4 month cross country road trip, all my business information, my website stuff, everything!  Data Doctors quoted me "Between $750 and $1,500 depending on what's wrong with it".  Red Seven saved my life for under $300 dollars!  
They were professional and friendly.  I definitely will recommend everyone to them!
