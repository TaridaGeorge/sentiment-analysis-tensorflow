Beautiful restaurant, excellent service and delicious food. Made for a great night out. I had the sea bass with beans and it was so delicious!  The combination of all the ingredients were amazing. The calamari and the steak (tasted the NY strip and the petit filet) was the best i've ever had. Finished with a yummy apple cobbler.
