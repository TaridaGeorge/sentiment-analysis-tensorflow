Sweettouch is the company to call for your carpet, tile and grout cleaning needs.  I had my tile and grout cleaned a few months ago and it looks amazing.  Juan and Manny did a wonderful job, on time and professional.  Last week I called Michael for carpet cleaning in a rental and he was able to squeeze me into the schedule on very short notice.  I thought the carpet may need to be replaced, but they worked their miracle and it looks almost new.  They go above and beyond and no hidden fees.  A big thank you to Michael and his team.  I will be recommending Sweettouch to all my friends.
