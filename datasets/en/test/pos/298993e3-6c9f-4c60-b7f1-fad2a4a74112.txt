I have learned a lot a made big strides since I have taken classes there. I find the Staff are really helpful and give expert advice on making projects and taking care of sewing machines. Also, they have a machine tech who does repairs and maintenance on my different 
Machines.  Now I have fun sewing and I  love the new fabrics!
