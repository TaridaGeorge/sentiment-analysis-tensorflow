I heart Tokyo Express. I have been coming here ever since I was a little girl, when I would come to work with my parents. Now that I am a big girl, I still come here about twice a month for lunch, sometimes 3-4.

I always order the same thing, teriyaki lite bowl with egg rolls. But today I decided to switch it up & I ordered bento box a. It was ok, the best parts were the teriyaki chicken & eggroll so I think I will just stick to my usual.

The 2 girls up front who take orders are always smiling & super sweet. I have never had to wait more than 5 mins for my order.

Like I said, I heart Tokyo Express!
