Having just been to Thailand in April, I can safely say the Thai Yoga massage that I had from Pom was extremely authentic and totally rejuvenating on all levels. I am amazed that more Americans dont know about and/or select this their number one massage option. This place is EXCELLENT and I highly recommend it!
