This is a beautiful and great grocery store/ deli. I would compare this store to a Bristol Farms maybe. Everything was clean and put together really well. We were greeted by one employee who asked us if we wanted a wine tasting, and so we did and we were happy to find out thetasting was free, Awesome!! I came out of his store really wishing we had one in californa, in my neighborhood!!! Next time I'm in AZ, I'll shop here again!!
