I am beyond the pale to put it mildly and I was thrilled with the super service, streak-free tan and perfectly believable color that Chris gave me! Got so many people asking me if I had gone on vacation I decided to actual take one!! I have gone back every other week since. The color lasts me about 8 days...longer than any other spray tanI had before. I also really like a more recent formula she used on me that you wash off after only 3 hours.  NICE!!! I did buy the Hemp lotion which smelled great and I think may be helping me hold the color so long. Highly recommend and have told every bride I know about this place!!! Clean, reasonably priced and they have really cute dresses there too...
