Chompie's is the best New York Deli in the valley. Then again, there really isn't very much great competition. But it's still great food. 

The menu is filled with the classics that you'd expect to find in any New York Deli. It's all fit to be eaten at any time during the day. 
The prices may look steep at first. But wait until you see the portions. It'll be your lunch for at least two days!
