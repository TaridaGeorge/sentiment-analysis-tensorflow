This place has alot of stores I love to shop at. I can spend the whole day looking down the main mall area then onto the stores surrounding it. 

Just sucks the restrooms are way out of the way, best places, near mojo yogurt, barnes&noble, and paradise bakery.. haha

On the weekend they have local bands playing on the stage and the night owls come out to play... so its fun for everyone..

Only thing I question is the signs you see around the marketplace..........Why are there only white people in them?
