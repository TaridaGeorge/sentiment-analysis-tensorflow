This is a fantastic hotel. Clean and comfortable, but most of all the people that work there are fantastic. Very accomodating and a pleasure to deal with. I highly recommend you stay here if your travels bring you to down town Tempe. Within walking distance of many restaurants, nightlife, and shopping options.
