My favorite full-size grocery store.  Like other reviewers, I notice it is always clean and neat.  It is also well stocked and the fruit and veggie quality is excellent.  The employees are pleasant and helpful.  This goes double for the pharmacy staff who recently went out of their way to fix a screw-up by my husband's doctor regarding an Rx. I have been going to that pharmacy for 10 years and always get excellent service.  A couple times I've gone right after a doc appointment with prescriptions that clearly indicate I feel like crap (anit-nausea meds for example) and they bump my prescriptions up in the queue so I can get home ASAP.  Maybe they just don't want a sick person hanging around, but that's OK too.The parking lot can be a nightmare, especially right before holidays.
