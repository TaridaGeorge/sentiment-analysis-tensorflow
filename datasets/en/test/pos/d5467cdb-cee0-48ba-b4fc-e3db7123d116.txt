This place is so cute and chic. It was closed on the first few occasions that I stopped by, but on 'girls day', with my little girl, it was open! And what a perfect place to stroll around the little princess. I wish I would have had more time to get my craft on, because the scrapbook selection was amazing! I could not believe that there is this mecca of scrapbook goodness right around the corner from my house! Love love love.
