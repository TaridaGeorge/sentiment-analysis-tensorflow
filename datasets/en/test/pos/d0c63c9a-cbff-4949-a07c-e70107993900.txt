My friends and I were meeting at A Touch of European Cafe which we found out is closed until July 8.  Luckily, I remembered this place from Guy's show and found it really easily.  The three of us shared the Italian Stallion pizza and the Pizza Bianco.  We all agreed it was delicious and we even had two leftover slices!  We also had to try the hot zeppolis for dessert since none of us had ever heard of it before.  Yummy!  They are fried dough balls with powdered sugar.  The service was awesome, super nice but not overly intrusive.  Highly recommend this place.
