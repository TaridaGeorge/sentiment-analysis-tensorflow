What a great place, I did not have expectations except that my kids would get to see dinosaur bones and I was pleasantly surprised how large this place was and all that they had to offer.  The dinosaur exhibit was great, they had several full size dinosaurs and plenty to learn about them.  I was very happy to see that they had real jail from historic Mesa so you can see how the inmates lived.  The had gold panning (fools gold of coarse but the kids loved it).  They had history of AZ and meteorites and Indian history with all real artifacts.  I really enjoyed coming here and I didn't even get passes or discount (it was worth the cost).
