Seriously, this was my goto spot in college. They deliver late night which is really convenient if you are in the area. I live in Scottsdale now, so I am so incredibly  sad that I can't get delivery. I always get the chicken Caesar pita with diced tomatoes. They cook the chicken to perfection and you always get the perfect juiciness of the chicken combined with the crunch of the fresh romaine lettuce. I like to sauce it up with sriracha on every bite and it is...what's the word...DIVINE.
