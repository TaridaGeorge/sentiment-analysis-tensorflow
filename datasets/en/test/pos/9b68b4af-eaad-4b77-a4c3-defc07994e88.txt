I have been going to this place since long before the expansion, had a buddy that worked in the kitchen when it was a hole-in-the-wall.

Now, I am a carnivore as I love eating tasty flesh in all my meals.  However, when introduced to "the art of eating healthy" I was hooked.  I even tried making my own falafel but it is never the same.

The schwarma is good, the pizzas are all great, and since I do love chicken and spiciness, I love the spicy chicken wrap (or burrito as it is huge).  However, about 80% of the time I go I get the falafel pita.  The mix of falafel, tomatoes, pickle, red onion, crisp lettuce and tahini sauce, my mouth is watering writing this.

Also, the hummus is fantastic, especially the cilantro-jalapeno.
