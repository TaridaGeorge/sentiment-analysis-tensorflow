I always like to have an experience where I can't find any fault.  I came here during restaurant week, and they offered a great three course meal.  We sat outside on a perfect evening with a beautiful fire right next to us, but not too hot.  I started with an elderflower drink which was wonderful.  My steak entree was perfect, as was the coffee after the meal.  All in all, this is a great place to dine.  The main menu had many other things that I would have ordered, but they had a very interesting 3-course menu offering that I couldn't refuse.  I will be back for sure.
