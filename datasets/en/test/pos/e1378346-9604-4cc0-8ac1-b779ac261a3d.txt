I can never get enough of Durant's  . Maybe it's because of the fifties vibe that make me envision men in dark suits and old ladies with fur stoles. 
Maybe it's the walking into the kitchen with no apologies or awkardness just a big hello and on with the show. I love the traditional food of the place, my succulent shrimp cocktail , oysters  with hottest horseradish know to man , thick meaty prime rib and a lovely lemon drop cocktail that 
begs me to keep sipping away.  The place just symbolizes a different style and era of dining and I love it. If  they get rid of that red velvet flocked wallpaper I will seriously cry .
