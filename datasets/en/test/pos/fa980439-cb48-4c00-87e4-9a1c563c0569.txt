I'm not much of one for a lot of their products but I must say that the books I have bought have been very well priced and in great condition. The artists that setup for events there are incredibly talented and personable people. Bob and his wife (sorry can't remember your name!) and their daughter Amanda are wonderful people and they need the support of the local community now as ever.
