Had the opportunity to try this establishment tonight.  I have to say, I loved it.  Yes, there were 3 pr 4 young ladies waiting at the door. That made seating us flow smoothly. The decor was beautifully done, perfect for a steakhouse.
  I had one of the best dirty martinis I've ever had.  The bread was good, loved the bread sticks. My spinach salad was perfect, all the flavors blended so nicely.  I had steak, done to perfection. I loved the clarified butter on the steak. The side order of creamed corn was enormous and tasted like fresh off the cob.
  Dessert of caramel cake was sublime! Not for the faint of pocketbook as it was very spendy, but great place and nice addition to Scottsdale dining.
