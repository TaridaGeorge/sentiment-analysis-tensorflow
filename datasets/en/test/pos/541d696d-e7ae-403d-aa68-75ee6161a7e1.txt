First, I love that all glasses of wine are the same price and all bottles are the same price. This takes douchebaggy guesswork out of it, especially since I always feel pressured to take a pricier glass of pinot so my server doesn't think I'm a cheapass. I know, I'm so gullible.

Second, the food is very, very good and fresh. It doesn't have a very solid cuisine description, but I like that. Gives the place a little light-heartedness. 

Yes, kind of hate the valet thing, but you don't really have a choice in this neighborhood and it's FREE. Drop the 3 bucks for tip.

The ambience is super... I love the big, open windows and the oversized lamps and pots (very Chelsea's). The colors are vibrant and warm and the whole experience is comfortable. Again, much like Chelsea's.

I love the LGO Hospitality group!
