This has to be the best breakfast I've ever had!  I ordered the special which was scrambled eggs with sweet peppers, whiskey fennel sausage and Havarti cheese.  It was outstanding!  We had to wait for over an hour which we knew that going in.  The food was definitely worth the wait.  Looking forward to going back again!
