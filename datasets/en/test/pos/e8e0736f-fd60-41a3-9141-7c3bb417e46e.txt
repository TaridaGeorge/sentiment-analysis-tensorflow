This is one of the best overall bars in Phoenix. Free popcorn, free steel-tip darts, and one of the best beer selections I have seen. You can watch every NHL and NFL game here all while watching a live hockey game on the ice directly behind the bar. Where else can you see that? Live local music on Fridays and Saturdays. Support the local bands! Dogfish Head and Molson Canadian, enough said.
