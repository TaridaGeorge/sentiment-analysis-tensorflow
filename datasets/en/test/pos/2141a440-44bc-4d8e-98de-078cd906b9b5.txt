Loved this place!  I can't get enough of gourmet burgers and fries, truffle fries at that!  I love when I can get a burger with avocado, different cheeses besides cheddar, roasted red peppers and tell them how I want it cooked.  The truffle fries are a must!  And I wouldn't leave without getting the salted creme brulee milkshake, but split it as it is pretty large and rich.  I loved that the interior of this place was so modern, but they still had a bar where you could and they had the Monday night football game on.  This burger joint is fancier than most, but prices match the experience you will have and quality of food you will get.  Would go again!
