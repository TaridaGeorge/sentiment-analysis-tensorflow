Great food.  Great atmosphere.

We got an Olive Appetizer, a Cheese Plate, and Bruschetta (Brie & Apples with Fig Spread, Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, Tomato Jam & Fresh Sheeps Milk Cheese, and Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese)

I got the "Nine Iron"
Hickory smoked bacon layered with grilled chicken, fresh burrata
mozzarella, lettuce, beefsteak tomato and dijonnaise

My wife and her friend split the Vegetarian
Grilled asparagus, roasted artichokes, red onion, vine ripe
tomatoes, goat cheese and house made pesto

And, of course, a bottle of wine.  We rolled out of there STUFFED to the gills!

We will be going back again soon!

There is one problem...if you don't like to give your car to a valet, then you have to walk...far.  On the good side, it's only $3 for valet.
