My girlfriend was a bit scared, but she is now a regular. This place doesn't disappoint!! I order the 1b like all the time, love the spring rolls, egg rolls, lo me in, and the bun xiao. I NEVER go anywhere else but here!!

The Goods: FOOD, PRICE

The Bad: most vietnamese places that serves good food, are too busy for you, so get used to it, they dont care, and know youll come back anyways. But the service isnt bad, they are VERY friendly, just busy.

Overall:
My girlfriend and i have tried other places, NO ONE BEATS This place as far as TASTE and PRICE! Great combo!
