This workout kicks butt!! I am not good at it and the tires are a bit intimidating, but I really like it.  It's motivational and I love that these guys are dedicated to helping the community and kids.  They really care and you can see that.  I wish this company much success! The workouts rock! I have only been to 3 or 4 sessions and already feel stronger!
