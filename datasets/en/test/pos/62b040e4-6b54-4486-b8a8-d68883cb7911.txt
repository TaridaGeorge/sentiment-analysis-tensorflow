Quite simply THE place in the metro Phoenix area for beer lovers.  The Pizza and sandwiches are great and the food in general is definitely high quality and well thought out, but it is the 30 constantly rotating beers on tap that bring the craft beer nerds from miles around.  

Seems more crowded on Friday and Saturday nights but otherwise not too busy.  Unfortunately they do not open until like 2pm so don't drive all the way over there for a quick lunch.
