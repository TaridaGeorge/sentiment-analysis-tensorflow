This brewery is so fun!  Firstly, they have small samples of their beer for tasting.  Secondly, they have some great Yelp/foursquare check-ins for a free beer or a discount on purchase.  Thirdly, they have darts and foosball to play while you drink your delicious free beer.  And fourthly, they go on tours throughout the brewery to check it out!  Sadly I couldn't go on the tour for time's sake, but I loved this brewery and am a huge fan now of their IPA and their watermelon beer.  What a great way to get indoors from the heat and enjoy all that Phoenix has to offer.
