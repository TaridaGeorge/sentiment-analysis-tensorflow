I love this airport. The staff are very friendly and laid back. 

Checkin and security take no time at all. I always come about 90 minutes early and I'm sitting around for an hour because everything runs so smoothly. 

Allegiant air is cool if you're going to one of the smaller towns they serve. Also you have to know how to deal with their ticketing system.
