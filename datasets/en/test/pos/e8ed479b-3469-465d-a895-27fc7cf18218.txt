There's nothing you can do to not give this sushi stop 5 star!  The aesthetics, service and food are all traditional, spot on and wonderful.  I have gone here several times with friends on many occasions and its always been a hit.  The sushi is amazing and honest.  It's a good fix when your away from the ocean and it passes up some of the places I've eaten on the ocean coast.  Anything you get here whether it's the sushi or the grill will impress.  The deserts are also pretty rad as well and I love it that they keep everything traditional and rooted.  If you want to try something amazing and semi exotic get the Kama - Yellowfin Collar.  FREAKING STELLAR!!  Rice and grilled fish brings me right back down to the roots.
