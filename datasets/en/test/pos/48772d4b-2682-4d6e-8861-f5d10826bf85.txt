What an experience!!  My sister in law said we had to eat here while we were in Arizona and after looking at the reviews with only three stars according to Yelp we thought maybe not.  THANK GOODNESS we tried it anyway!  Fabulous food!!!  Great margaritas and sangrias!  My husband had the stuff Poblano and the sampler plate!  I can not say enough good things about this restaurant!!  You have to try the green corn tamale balls and the baja sauce is the bomb!  I enjoyed the fried ice cream as well!  And our waiter was very knowledgeable and right on it - thanks Taryn!
