I visited Scottsdale for the first time this past weekend and my friend took me to Daily Dose for breakfast. I was hooked! I ate there the whole weekend because there were so many things on the menu I just had to try. My favorite breakfast items were the pancakes and the hangover sandwich. The pancakes were fluffy and melt in your mouth. I will definitely eat there again the next time I am in town.
