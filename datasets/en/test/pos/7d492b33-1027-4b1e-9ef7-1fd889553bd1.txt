Have frequented this place for brunch over the past couple months and it has been a great relationship. I first came here by myself and felt guilty as my wife was out of town. Moreover the dining experience was great, not only the food but the location with plenty of outdoor seating near the canal. Eventually I did introduce my wife to The Herb Box, as well again this morning for brunch with friends from out of town. The fare here is always fresh. Every dish tried here has been spot on. The past couple visits I have been trying to find a fault in the food here, but have yet to discover one.
