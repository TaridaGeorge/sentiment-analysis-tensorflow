This location is the best in the area...by far! The next closest to me would be Town & Country - although that's a great location, it's terribly small and you are constantly bombarded by carts and people. There is hardly any space to move through the store whereas this location is larger, has a bigger selection and not nearly as busy all the time. 

The staff (as with all locations) are always super helpful and friendly. The items are constantly being stocked and they go out of their way to make sure you have everything you need.
