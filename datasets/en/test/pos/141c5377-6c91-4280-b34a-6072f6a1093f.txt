Best coffee in Arizona... hands down. Not only does owner Jason Silberschlag roast his own coffee in the place (specialties range from Guatemalan to Brazilian coffee bean) but his shop boasts the only "clover" coffee maker in the state of Arizona. Each cup is brewed to perfection. This ain't starbucks, folks. It's better. It's cheaper. It is worth checking out.
