There is absolutely nothing terrible I can say about this place. I am so grateful we actually have a public market. I am on roosevelt row and love being able to walk/ride over.  All vendors sell very quality based produce/products and are wonderful to talk to. Ive bought Alaskan sockeye salmon twice from the same farm family and it's the best and most fresh salmon Ive cooked. I will forever be a visitor and only hope to see vast growth in the future.
