A Lifesaver!
I found Ginny's Wash House 5 or 6 years ago when I first came to the Valley.  I lived in a rental with no washer/dryer in the unit, and the common area units were ALWAYS busy.  I found Ginny's and I have to tell you their service is fantastic!  Dropped my clothes off, they asked for my preferences on washing, and they were clean, FOLDED (I HATE to FOLD!) and waiting for me when they said they would be.

So, when I had a hand injury recently and couldn't bear the thought of folding a mountain of washed laundry, I brought the mountain to Ginny's.  And yep, they did it again! Clean, folded and waiting for me when they said they would be.
