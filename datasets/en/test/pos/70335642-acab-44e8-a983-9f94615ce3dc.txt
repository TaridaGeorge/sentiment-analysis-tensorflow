Selection deserves five stars, the prices are great, the variety is great (I buy chocolate here! Also get water, styrofoam coolers, and juust about anything you can think of), the staff is more-or-less great, and the Twitter account (@Total_Wine), in addition to being generally awesome, can do stock checks for you!  I love this place.
