I went there for my two year anniversary, the experience was fantastic, the decor is so beautiful and you feel welcomed. Yes it's a on a pricey side but you get what you pay for. 

The food quality is amazing, my steak was so good. Also, the sides are huge and really good, mashed potatoes, broccoli and spinach with garlic is what we had ordered. The food came out exactly how we wanted. 

Our server was very knowledgeable and a nice short guy. Didn't talk too much or too less, just perfect. In the end, they bought us a very cute cake for our anniversary, that was very nice! 

I definitely will be back!
