Best.Buffet.Ever.... I think those 3 words sum it up. Everything is delicious. I have never seen a selection of dessert so vast in my life. I come here with a game plan... start with cheese appetizers and end my meal with every dessert they have to offer. But my plan always fails. I can't start slow, this buffet is way too exciting. Totally worth the money and better than any buffet I've been to in Vegas. I'd come here every week if I was rich and had amazing metabolism.
