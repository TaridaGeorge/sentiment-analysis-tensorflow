Turkish food coma! Love this place- authentic Turkish food and excellent service!  I lived in Istanbul Turkey for a year so when I found Turkish Kitchen on yelp I had to try it!   The food is authentic and sooooo yummy!  Perfect  pide (bread) and hummus.   I had my fav dish Iskender and it was perfect!    We will be back!!!!
