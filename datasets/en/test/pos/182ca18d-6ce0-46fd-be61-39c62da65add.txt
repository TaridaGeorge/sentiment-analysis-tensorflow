Who would have guessed that Phoenix has one of the best Irish pubs around? Listening to Vinyl Station Band on a Thurs wondering why isn't this place packed to the gills?? 

Amazing live music (two bearded guys on guitar, both sing and play harmonica, one plays bass drum at same time too). Best covers and original songs we've heard.  Seriously--someone should sign these guys! No cover! Great wings (get the hot).  Super authentic pub.
