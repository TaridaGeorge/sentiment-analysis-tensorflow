We just got back from a fabulous meal at Mastro's City Hall.  I've never written a review about them before, but I thought it was time. Everything about the meal was exceptional from the service, ambiance to the food. We had the Dungeness crab cocktail and shrimp cocktail which were both super fresh. Then the steaks and king crab legs along with scalloped potatoes and sugar snap beans. I forgot to mention the excellent vodka martini's. Our server brought us two different vodkas that we had never tried and they were both excellent.  I might just switch from Belvedere!
There are many choices for a great meal in Scottsdale, but Mastro's City Hall is at the top of the list.
