I'm a soda nut, but unfortunately a slowing midlife metabolism has not allowed me to indulge the way I used to. 
I come here for one reason and one reason only: Jones Sugar-Free Black Cherry Soda by the bottle. Such an underrated and undersold flavor! Thanks to Pop I can buy the shit by the caseload. 
Lots of cool old-school sodas, they also have some candy I haven't seen in a while. Nice, hip staff.
