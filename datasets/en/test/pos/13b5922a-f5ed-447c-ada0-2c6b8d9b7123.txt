I've now used Kevin twice for home inspections and would highly recommend him.  He is thorough, and takes time to discuss the results and answer questions immediately.  Both of my experiences have been long distance so his knowledge of the area and its nuances were extremely helpful.  Kevin is very professional and a pleasure to work with.
