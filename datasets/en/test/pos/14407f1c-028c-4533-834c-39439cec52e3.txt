I've been there twice and both times I was surprised at how good it was.  The first time I had the falafel sandwich and it was fried perfectly crisp on the outside and bursting with flavor on the inside.  The second time I had the gyro platter, which is a mound of shaved gyro meat, pita wedges, jasmine rice and a Greek salad.  It was all great, right down to the Tzatziki You might balk at $9 but it's a huge meal, definitely worth it.  I also suggest the flavored iced teas that they have.  Really, it was all amazing.  You could pick this place up and put it in any city and it would fit right in.
