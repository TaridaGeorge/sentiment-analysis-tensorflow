Felt like a little Italy restaurant in NY or Baltimore. Great food and nicely presented. Been here 3 times with friends who are regulars there - they come from Chicago and are Italian. So when they go I go too!

The wait staff are attentive and the pace of serving the courses is just right. The veal shank is drop off the bone excellent, the  hef's special seafood was fresh and absolutely divine...I asked for a soup spoon so as not to leave any of the broth behind.

Fabulous. Thank you!
