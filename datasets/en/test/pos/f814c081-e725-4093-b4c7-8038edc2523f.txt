This Natural Hair salon is the real deal, walking into the space I felt immediately welcomed. My stylist was Shayla and she did a fantastic job with my hair I will definitely be returning to this hair studio. All the stylist including the owner were busy making the people in their chairs happy. They style both men and women and are very quick with their work.
