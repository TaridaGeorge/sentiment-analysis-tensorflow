The food was incredible. The wait was about 20 minutes at 6pm on a Friday night. They have this cool fountain drink machine that has all kinds of flavors of your favorite pop. Even raspberry diet coke!!! The manager was very helpful at finding us a place to sit as soon as it became available. For how busy they were, they didn't seem frazzled or rushed and everything seemed under control. Well managed place.
