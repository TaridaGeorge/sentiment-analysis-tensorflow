So I'd heard of Culver's, but never eaten there until this one opened up. Wow oh wow, what a great place! I've now been there 3 or 4 times and really dig their burgers!!! The Onion Rings were totally awesome too!  I even went for the Vanilla frozen custard (actually, I ate some of my daughter's).  I usually get the bacon cheese butter burger and what a fresh, well put together burger. Dopety dope, guess who'll be back pretty soon? This guy!
