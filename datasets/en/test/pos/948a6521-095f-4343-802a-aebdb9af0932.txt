Let me start off by saying that there are several Slices restaurants in the Valley. The one on Mill is by far the best. They have the most amazing and original selection of pizza.  No matter what you pick, it will be good.  If your favorite isn't available when you walk in, no problem! They will make it for you! If you are looking for a slice of heaven, you MUST try the salad pizza.  No, its not lettuce on crust!  It is simply the most unbelievable creation that includes artichokes, red pepper, and spinach.  It is great by itself, but ask for them to put balsamic dressing on top.  The balsamic takes it from being amazing to last meal quality :-)
