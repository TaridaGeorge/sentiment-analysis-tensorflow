Stopped in for lunch today, to this Greek equivalent of Matt's Big Breakfast.  This little place is very busy, very friendly, & the parking is iffy, with an attendant to help make best use of the lot.  Inside, I found a stylish, inviting atmosphere, a crowd of cheery diners, & a fairly wide ranging menu to choose from.

For this first visit, I went with the Gyro Pita & a bowl of Lemon Chicken Soup for my included side.  The soup was different & delicious, & the big, non-Kronos gyro was a terrific feast!  The service is a bit leisurely, so come here when you're not in a big hurry, relax, & have a good time!

Gyro Pita with bowl of Soup $7.90.  I can't wait to come back to this great little restaurant!!     :-))
