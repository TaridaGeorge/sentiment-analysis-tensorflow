My husband surprised me for Valentines Day and we went for dinner. The atmosphere is refreshing and engaging. 
The live band was fantastic as was our waitress and all her little helpers. 
Then the food came.... WOW! SO delicious! We loved everything we tried from the pupu's and tidbits to the amazing entree and the mouth watering red velvet cake for dessert. 
A nice adult place for dinner where we were still able feel comfortable in jeans and enjoy delicious food and great music.
