Good Asian market with a wide selection of fresh vegetables, seafood. The supermarket also has aisles dedicated to regional food. 
"Little India" Asiana Market is a virtual substitute for Indian grocery in the North West Phoenix area.  Two or three large aisles are dedicated to Indian grocery items, ready-to-eat food, 'dhals' cereals, rice etc. 
Five Star for Shopping experience: 
*  The vegetables and seafood are stocked separately so vegetarians will not 'smell' seafood. 
*  A large parking lot with ample parking space
