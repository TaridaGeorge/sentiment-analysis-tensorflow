OK, so this is how much I love this product. I first tasted Lee's at a Yelp Elite event and waited and dreamed a whole year to eat it again. When I was invited to the next year's Elite Pleydate it was the topic of the first question out of my mouth. "Is Lee's gonna be there?" ( Ok, maybe the whole French restaurant's Bone Marrow gravy came to mind too, but I digress) When I made it inside to Pleydate I literally ran to that booth having desert before dinner. I am all about the alcohol infused ice cream now. The funny thing about that is I am not even a big ice cream lover. I will have to visit the shop soon.
