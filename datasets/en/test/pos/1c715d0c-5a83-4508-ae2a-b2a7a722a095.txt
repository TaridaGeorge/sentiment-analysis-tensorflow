I usually get a salt, cheese or veggie bagel, all of them are great and under a $1, if you just want it plain.
I love their flavored coffee. I don't have to put a ton of milk in it, I can actually drink it black...I save the calories for the bagel. 
The service is always fast and friendly. Stop in, I can't imagine you'll be disappointed.
