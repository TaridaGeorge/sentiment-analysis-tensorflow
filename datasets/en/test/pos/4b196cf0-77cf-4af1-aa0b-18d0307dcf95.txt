I can't remember how long it has been since I started going to Honey Bear's BBQ.  It has to be at least fifteen years.  I love this place.  

I was there today for lunch and had the shredded chicken and a couple of hotlinks.  Delicious!!  Also had some coleslaw too.  I think I've had just about everything on the menu and it is all GREAT!  The service is good and the staff is always friendly.

If I have one complaint, it is that I am sticky and smell of BBQ sauce the rest of the day.... it could be worse.

Any place that's slogan is " You don't need no teeth to eat our meat"  has my vote.  The truth of the matter is, the slogan is right.
