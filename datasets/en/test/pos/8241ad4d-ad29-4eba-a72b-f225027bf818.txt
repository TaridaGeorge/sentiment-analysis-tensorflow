This was my 2nd time here.  If you order the mussels for a starter, be prepared...  they bring enough to feed 4 people.  The wine sauce with the mussels was the best I've had. My only complaint, there was no bucket.  You have to shell on your appetizer plate.  I had a beef dish that was marinated in brandy or some liquor.  Delicious.  My wife had Mahi and she loved it.  The service is 5-star.  Wine list is insane and they have a lot of wines by glass.  They also have a great selection of rare drinks like buddhahand vodka.  Lastly, I'm always a big fan of complimentary valet parking.
