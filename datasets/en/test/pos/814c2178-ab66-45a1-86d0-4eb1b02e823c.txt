Zoo Lights is so much fun! I walk around in awe as I look at the light-bears, light-frogs, light-leopard, etc., and can't help but wonder how many people and how many hours are involved in the set up.

This is a great event to go to as a date night or as a family. It is better to go earlier in the season, and on a weeknight, to avoid the big crowds. Grab a hot chocolate and watch the kids squeal with delight as a giraffe talks to them, see the few animals that are awake, and check out the lights.
