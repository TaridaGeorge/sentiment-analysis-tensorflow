Everyone needs to hike this! As others have said, this "hike" is really more of clambering over boulders...but if you can manage to employ all your limbs at any given time and make it to the top, it's well worth it. Coming from the SF Bay Area, I'm not used to seeing such large expanses of land all around me, and the summit makes for a killer panoramic view of the valley. 

Parking is ridiculous on the weekends, so don't even bother going up Echo Canyon Pkwy to look for spots. Instead, go west down McDonald and find a sidestreet without those unfriendly DO NOT PARK HERE signs. The extra half-mile walk won't kill ya =).
