Love it!  This is such a weird lil theater.  My girl friend and I stopped in to catch a chick flick after eating at Yupha's Thai restaurant... I was pleasantly surprised at the low cost and crazy decor.  They've got it all set-up for Halloween right now so it's pretty interesting!  

Anyway, to make a long review short... $3 a movie?  Can't beat that.  

See ya there!
