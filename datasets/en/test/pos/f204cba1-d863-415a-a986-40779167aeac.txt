Gelato is one of those things that makes up for a crappy day or a long week.  It also makes a great night out even better.  The Gelato spot has so many delightful flavors, from the rich and decadent chocolate varieties to the tangy fruity flavors.  You can sample the flavors to find the one which suits your mood best or you can stick to what you know you love.

Service is usually friendly and fast, but there are the usual girls behind the counter who look and act like they would rather be anywhere else.  Fortunately, I have had more good experiences with these girls than bad.

Gelato... it's like a hug for your tongue!
