These guys know a thing or two about making stellar sandwiches. This is a local, family owned establishment and they've already served up over a million sandwiches.

I would eat here more often, but their hours are limited. 

First thing for a superb sandwich is bread. Bread is key, and their sourdough is soft perfection. Second is meat, and they use top quality Boar's Head meat.

I've also ordered half-sized sandwiches, which is also a plus.

They carry a number of special items in addition to standard fare, such as Poore Brothers chips, specialty sodas, and Swedish goodies.
