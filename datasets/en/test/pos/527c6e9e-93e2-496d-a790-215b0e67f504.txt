This was the best burger that my husband and I have ever had!
   The atmosphere was awesome! Once we passed through the frosted glass door, it felt like we walked into a trendy bar/restaurant in vegas. We will definitely be returning the next time we are craving good food, excellent service and a casual atmosphere
