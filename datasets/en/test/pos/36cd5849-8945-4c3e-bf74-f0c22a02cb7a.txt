A little tid bit most of you don't know, when I was growing up, I was nick named "Neil Burger" Got this tile for eating the 1 LB burger at Tractons in LA when I was 7 years old.  Well I have found a match, you have gourmet burgers, fast food burgers, even veggie burgers but these guys have it done right.  Soft Buns that hold up to the fixings (Don't get Soggy) Flavorful meat 80/20 most likely. A price that makes McDonald's look expensive! If you love burgers of old, and really want the best burger for your buck, get to Lenny's and have a bite of heaven wrapped in paper, the old fashioned way!
