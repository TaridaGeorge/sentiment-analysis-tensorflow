This place is more expensive then what I remember tanning salons costing, but some of their membership levels are higher end.  It's a nice place, really clean.  Unfortunately, like most salons, the radios don't get the best signal, but you can always bring a CD (unless I am the only person who still uses those).  The staff I think is the best part, they are just really friendly and considerate girls.  The other day I left my lotion in my car, because I'm bright like that.  When the girl saw me coming back in she asked if everything was ok then offered to reset the timer since I had run out.  I probably didn't really need to recover that whole 45 seconds but I love that she asked and did it for me!
