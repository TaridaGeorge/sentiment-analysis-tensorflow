best.breakfast.joint in E. Valley- period!  Between my husband and I we've had just about every breakfast meal they serve - and have never been disappointed.  They do need some help with the mimosas, they use freshly juiced OJ which creates mayhem at the top of their flute glasses, but it's easily solved with a spoon.  I've taken out-of-town guests there for lunch and it's been just as good as our breakfast experience.  Many props to the owner and staff - we love your work!
