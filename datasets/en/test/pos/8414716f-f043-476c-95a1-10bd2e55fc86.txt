Coming to Switch for lunch was quite a surprise as I didn't expect the trendy interior and it almost had a downtown San Diego kind of feel to it.  I can't comment on the pricey dinner entrees that I saw on the menu but their sandwiches were delicious.  I ran through the list and looked for whatever looked the most unique and I settled upon the apricot BBQ chicken sandwich.  What comes in that sandwich?  Apricot BBQ sauce, cilantro, feta cheese, aioli, spinach, red onion, and all of them on warm fresh ciabata bread.  And all that is served with some cesar salad.  You can't go wrong at all!!!!!!!

But running through their sandwich menu, it didn't seem like you could go wrong with many of the options. Switch it up and come here for a try.
