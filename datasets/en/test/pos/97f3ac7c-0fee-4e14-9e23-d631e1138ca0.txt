I don't always have a great experience with Discount, but I was really pleased with my visit today. One of my tires had a slow air leak. I went in to have it patched. They got on it right away, and patched the tire for free. The part that got me was that they didn't even ask if the tires were purchased with them (Even though they were, just under a different owner). I was in and out in maybe 15-20 minutes. Great experience.
