Simply put, my favorite lunch destination in Arizona. AppleCafe offers delicious wraps, salads, burgers, and breakfast served all day! They are also well-known for their amazing smoothies. The food is fresh, hot and generally very healthy. 

I always order a wrap, and my favorite would be The Big Daddy (egg, cheese, potato) but I have never had a bad experience. 

There is ample parking. The interior features indoor/outdoor seating with two TVs usually tuned to ESPN News. The decorum celebrates the owner's NYC roots which inspired the name (i.e. The Big Apple). FYI, it closes at 7 pm, but offers $1 longnecks during Happy Hour.

This is a great spot! Check it out, and you'll thank me.
