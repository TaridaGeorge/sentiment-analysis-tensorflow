My husband & I took a long weekend in Phoenix (he had to work two days, I vacationed) and had a glorious stay at Sanctuary. It was hard to believe that we were in the middle of the Phoenix metro area because it was so quiet & scenic.

The room was huge and very well equipped (kitchen facilities). We had a beautiful view from the balcony, parking right outside our front door, and plenty of room to relax. 

We will definitely stay here next time we're in Phoenix.
