There's nothing better than a bunch of spunky vegetarian restaurant people. So, the people were great and helpful when it came to my first-timer questions about what to order (vegan gyro, singapore noodles) for the hubs and me, and plain lo mein noodles for the kiddo. My concern always about a serious vegetarian place is that they skew snobby, rather than populist and happy. Green is the latter. Go Green - nice work! PS: yes the food is awesome. Just eat here, even if you like meat.
