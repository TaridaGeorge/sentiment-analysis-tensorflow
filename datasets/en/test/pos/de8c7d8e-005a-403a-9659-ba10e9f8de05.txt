Love this place!  My wife and I go as often as we can.  The last time she tried a Halibut breakfast sandwich with egg and salsa on a crusted wheat bread and I had a cinnamon bagel with a fruit bowl that was topped with some yogurt and granola.  And of course we both had some fresh, hot coffee.  Very tasty.  We will be back again and again.
