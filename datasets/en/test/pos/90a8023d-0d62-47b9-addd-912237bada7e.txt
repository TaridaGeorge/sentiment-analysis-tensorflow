My father in law took us to this wonderful place when we were visiting him and it made such a great impression on us that we decided to have our rehersal diner here! (We had destination wedding.) The food is fantastic and the ambiance is classy but not stuffy. We felt very comfortable and taken care of here. When organizing our rehersal dinner, the communication to and from the restaurant was prompt and detailed. They printed special menu for us with our names on the top - it was a nice touch and great addition to our wedding scrapbook. We are looking forward coming here again whenever we are back in Arizona.
