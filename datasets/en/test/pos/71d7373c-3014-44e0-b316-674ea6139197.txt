This is a hot-dog joint for people who love hot dogs. My father, for instance, eats enough hot dogs to put a baseball stadium out of business over the course of a year, and this is his favorite spot around. As he put it "No question the best Polish sausage in Phoenix." 

Service here is friendly and fast. On top of that, Friday's are the day to drop in as the owner's wife personally prepares brownies and rice krispie treats that are given out with meals for free.
