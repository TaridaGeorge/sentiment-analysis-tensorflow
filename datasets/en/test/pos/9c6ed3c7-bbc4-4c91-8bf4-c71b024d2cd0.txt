Once again a fabulous breakfast! Green flannel was amazing and my friend got the veggie hash which she said was delicious! While there is A wait, order a Bloody Mary (or a delirium which my friend said was light and crispy) and take in the great patrons! We sat at the bar which was fun and had the best service! Oooh, and don't forget the olive bread with whatever you order; it's so yummy! Great service and great food!
