Hands down the BEST car buying experience EVER! We have been a Honda family for many years and although we have liked our cars we have always had an awful time with the dealerships. This was the polar opposite for us. From end to end this was an all around amazing experience. We dealt with the fleet manager who gave us a fantastic deal on the 2011 Sonata and also offered us a very fair price on our trade in with absolutely no negotiations. Their finance guy was just as easy to work with. I cannot imagine ever going to another car dealership to buy a new car. All we can say is be prepared to be flabbergasted by this straightforward and honest team. You will be very happy! Oh, and the car.... AMAZING!
