Oh my god this place is good. Pulled pork, beef brisket, and oh yeah the Q-rools are all to die for. I would recommend anything on the menu cause I have tried it all. The smoasted chicken is unreal! For me I wont go anywhere else for BBQ except my own house.  The atmosphere is great and its a little dark &  there is a outside patio area as well. They have great lunch specials. The food portions are good size you will probably be taking some home.  And when your done and pay they bring you a little bag of the best little doughnuts ever.  Oh yeah Doughnuts.
