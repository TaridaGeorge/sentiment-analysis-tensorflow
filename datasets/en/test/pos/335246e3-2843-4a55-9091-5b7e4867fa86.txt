Went to the adult only play date and had a great time. I will be bringing my grandchildren here soon! There is so much to do, the facility is clean and well organized, and a lot of fun. The play date despite being sold out was not "oversold." Lines were not extreme for activities and there was plenty to do. What a great night and I can't wait to go to the next one. Great museum!!!
