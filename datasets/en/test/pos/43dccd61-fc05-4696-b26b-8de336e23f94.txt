Yes this place has great food. The ambiance is a bit like hanging out in grandmas kitchen with a bunch of tvs surrounding you and a bar with yummy drinks. I have no idea why this place is called bostons other than the fact the server understood my boston sarcasm. It's in a sketchy location, but not far from downtown Tempe
