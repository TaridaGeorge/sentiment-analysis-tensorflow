I was out and about in a new area of the city and spotted Lucky Boy. I've been looking for a place like this for a long time, since it's nothing but chain restaurants in Gilbert. I really enjoyed going here, and will be back whenever I get a chance. The food was hot and delicious, with generous toppings. This place reminds of a burger stand I used to love to go to when I lived in the Chicago area (Rosie's, 103rd & Cicero), right down to drive-thru's activity switch.

I had the 1/2lb burger with grilled onions and jalapeno slices, with fries and a large coke. It was $7 and change, and worth every penny. They have plenty of other choices, including many milkshake flavors.
