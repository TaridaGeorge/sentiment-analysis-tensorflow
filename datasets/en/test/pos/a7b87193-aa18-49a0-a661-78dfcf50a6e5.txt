This place is phenomenal, from the very moment that I entered the shop I was in awe of all of the parts that were strewn across shelves throughout the place. Mike was amazingly helpful, friendly and answered ever question I had with a smile. He saved me at least $40 when it came to fixing the instrument cluster in my car, and explained exactly how to fix it.

It's a shame that I'm moving out of AZ because with a Miata I feel that there is no better place to go, I'll definitely be going back before I move to get some more know how and parts!
