ORGANIC food is hard to find in a restaurant setting. And then top that with a great atmosphere, a great patio and friendly staff. What more can you ask for? How about a delicious portobello sandwich and sweet potato tots! Yum!! We happened to be there for happy hour so everything was half off. Enjoyed a tasty organic beer too!  :)
