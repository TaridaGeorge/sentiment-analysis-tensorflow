This place is awesome. It is truly one of the best restaurants/grills I have ever been to. The atmosphere is so inviting and the people are very friendly. The service is outstanding, accommodating, polite, and not at all stuffy. New owners, Jennifer L. and her folks are so eager to please. Finally, a menu that has something for everyone. The food is always fresh and prepared with care, not just pleasing to the pallet but to the eye as well. You cannot go wrong with any of the salads...my favorites being the Southwest Chicken and The Fresh Spinach and Chicken salads. Daily specials, Wing Wednesday, Thursday Ladies Day, Friday Night Karaoke... Wow, what a great place to enjoy yourself, and not just during football season either!
