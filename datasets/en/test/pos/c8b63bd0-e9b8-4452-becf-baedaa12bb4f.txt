Tales of the Old West.

I'm a coffee lover. I'm talkin' about strong, black coffee. Sure I love cappuccinos, lattes, espressos, caff√® americanos on ice in the Summertime and even Irish coffee but my cowboy coffee is black no sugar no cream. I drink it every day.

I order up a black coffee in a tin can so thick a horseshoe would float. Walk outside through a ragged screen door onto the porch made of lumber. Sittin are lovely ladies, I tip my hat and have a seat.

All kidding aside, the little town of Cave Creek and the Cave Creek Coffee Company is an excellent part of anyone's western tradition. The scenery is beautiful.The air is crisp. 

The coffee they roast is the coffee that "won the west."
