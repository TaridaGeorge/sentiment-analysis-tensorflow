I used to play on a Coed indoor soccer team that was sponsered by this bar and that is when I started to go here. If you are into authentic Irish bars then you absolutely must stop in. It is in a kind of hidden corner but once you walk in you will realize how charming it is. Even the bartender is actually Irish! They have $3 Carlsberg all day every day and other great Irish beers and ciders on tap. As far as food goes I have only had their fish and chips but it was delicious. We stopped in last Saturday night because they are the only Official US Soccer bar in Arizona and we wanted to watch the game. We were pleasantly surprised with the live music they had that night. It was really great and I think we will be going more often now!
