l have been to various Bath & Body Works all over the US, but this one at PV Mall is the one I visit most frequently.  All products are cruelty-free and absolutely smell divine.  They have a huge variety of lotions and potions, soaps, fragrances for home and even carry an entire men's line.

Bath & Body Works not only as the cutest packaging, they also have all sorts of sales and coupons available year round to make sure you get the best deal.

My favorite lip glosses and balms from C.O. Bigelow are carried here as well as the entire Patrica Wexler face care line.  

This place is awesome.
