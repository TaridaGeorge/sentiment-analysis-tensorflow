I have been going to this Discount Tire for years & have never been disappointed. I just got a set of Perelli tires on their recommendation & am very happy with them. They have consistent, knowledgeable, friendly & as their name states... discounted service. I have tried other places for my son's car but nothing compares to their bang for the buck. They take competitors coupon deals if you ask or mention them and match it. You can't beat that, so give them a try!
