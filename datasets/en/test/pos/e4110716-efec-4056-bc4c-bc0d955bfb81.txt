I had Cathy do my taxes this year and i dont know if its magic or not but I am actually getting money back for the first time in years.  Do I need to say more?  Ha ha, anyway, I stopped in and met with her on a recommendation from a friend and she was able to take all my records and put my taxes together in record time.  I look forward to going back since her and her staff are very professional, I guess its a family business and has been there for many years.....all I know is she got the job done very quickly.
