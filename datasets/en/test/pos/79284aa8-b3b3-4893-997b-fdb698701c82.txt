Cartel Coffee is a tasty diamond in the rough. Since moving to Phoenix, I have been rather unimpressed with the food and drink of this town. 

The coffee at Cartel is quite unique from other options in the area, with complicated flavors and delightfully different beans. It is kind of like the first time I drank really great wine.
