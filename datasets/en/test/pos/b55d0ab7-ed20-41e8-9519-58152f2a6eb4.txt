Not only does it have absolutely delicious vegetarian/vegan food, but apparently it's also a great place for celebrity sightings.  My friend and I saw Jim from Jimmy Eat World grabbing lunch there yesterday.  Clearly, we all have fantastic taste!

Favorites: the Sweet and Sour bowl with crispy tofu ... and don't forget the organic limeade!
