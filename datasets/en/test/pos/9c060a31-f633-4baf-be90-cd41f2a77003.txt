My mom took me here and we were the only non-Asian people in the place so we were VERY excited.  It was not very busy but it was during the week so maybe that was the reason.  We ordered hot green tea to start with then I ordered the won ton soup and my mom ordered a dinner special that was chicken chow mien with friend rice, 2 crab puffs, and 1 egg roll (I ate the crab puffs :-D ).  My won ton soup was HUGE and absolutely delicious!!  I want to tell the world about this place to share it's deliciousness.  It had wontons, chicken, shrimp, and steak pieces all inside this soup.  I couldn't finish it all and packed the leftovers for the BF to enjoy.   I'll be back (Arnold voice).
