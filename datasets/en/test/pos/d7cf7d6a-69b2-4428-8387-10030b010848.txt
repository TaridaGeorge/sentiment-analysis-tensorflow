A big THANK YOU to Capital Grille, Ann (the event coordinator) and the servers who helped us with my brother's dinner rehearsal.  We had 34 guests in the Biltmore Room.  The food was amazing and I can honestly say, I have dealt with many vendors and this event was seamless.  They went above and beyond to make our night special.  I feel horrible that I forgot the head server's name, but he was THE BEST.  Thank you!  I highly recommend this venue if anyone is looking to host a private event.  THANK YOU ANN AND CAPITAL GRILLE!
