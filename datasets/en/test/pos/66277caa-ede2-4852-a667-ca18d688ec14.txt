An incredible dining experience.  I would expect this restaurant to surface in San Francisco, Brooklyn, or Silverlake but not Phoenix.  The menu is soul/comfort food that is reasonably priced and served up in a warm, hip, atmosphere.  I was with a party of 5 and we split all of our small plates and entrees - each was better than the next!  We sat at a long table that was shared with another party and it felt like we were dining at a friends house.  Our server, Aron, was really friendly and helpful.

Also recommend splitting the $20 bottle of wine.  I think they switch up which varieties will get this "special" but I had a cabernet which did the trick.  In all, I wish more restaurants were like Tuck Shop.
