Oh my goodness. Perfectly crispy crust, fresh ingredients and a well thought-out menu. We shared the Wiseguy (fennel sausage, smoked mozzarella and wood-roasted onion) and Marinara pizzas (your basic basil, delicious delicious tomato, oregano and garlic, roasted to a potato-y perfection) and were able to finish all but one piece. Service was fantastic at the bar and my water was refilled every two minutes.

I also appreciate how all soda comes in bottles (Coke, Diet Coke, Bubble Up). Oh, Arizona... so lucky to have this treasure.

By the way, the Heritage Garage is an incredible deal - they'll validate your first hour, and then even then just $8 for 4 hours plus parking, garage open all night, and just blocks away from the stadiums. Whew. Coming from LA, this was a dream.
