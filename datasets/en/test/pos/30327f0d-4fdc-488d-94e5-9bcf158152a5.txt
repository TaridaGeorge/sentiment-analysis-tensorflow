Hands down the best breakfast I've had in Phoenix! I'm in love, if I could take this place home, I would take it out to brunch at Local Breeze the next morning.

The atmosphere is amazing the patio area is great I felt like I was at the beach. The patio had misters going and a deck area to sit at with a bar. I Think I could relax on the patio and drink sangria all day.

 Everything on the menu sounded amazing I went with the fire island eggs  and they were delicious! Thank you to whoever though of this brilliant breakfast food! I also had some of the Banana's foster french toast which was amazing. All the breads used are homemade and everything tasted fresh and original. I really can't wait to bike down and spend another Sunday on the patio!
