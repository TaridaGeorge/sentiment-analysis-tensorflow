Now I'm convinced my computer hates me. These guys fixed it about a year ago and for the past few months I've been having a different problem. Great. 
I dropped it off around 3:30 in the afternoon and they called me 6:30 that night with their diagnosis. They said it wasn't a major problem. They did explain it to me but since I don't speak computer all I heard was "wha wha wha...wha". 
How much? $25 for this evidently small problem. Ok that's doable. Once again they were timely, professional, good customer service. Thanks!
