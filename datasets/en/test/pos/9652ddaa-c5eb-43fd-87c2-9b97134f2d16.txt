this place is amazing.  i took my wife there and earned some major brownie points!  the place looks incredible and has a large patio with a view of camelback mountain.  my wife had some great wine and i enjoyed a few awesome beers.  the beer and wine selection was great!  a lot of local brews at that!  for an app we had a cheese plate.  some great cheeses on obviously fresh bread.  we ended up splitting shrimp scampi and a charbroiled lamb pita. we were not let down one bit.  both of us plan on coming back to this place very often.  it is really hard to find great food and great service at the same time but this place did it for us!
