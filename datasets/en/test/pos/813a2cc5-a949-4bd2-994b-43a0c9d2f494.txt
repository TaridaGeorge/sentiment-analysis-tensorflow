I have been performing home inspections for Stew for several years.  I am amazed that he is always so positive and willing to do whatever it takes to keep the process rolling smoothly.  It does not matter if it is a little condo or a million dollar property in Scottsdale; he always treats the buy and seller with the same respect and attention.  And with him using the latest gadgets known to the real estate market, you are one step ahead of the competition when you are working with Stew.
