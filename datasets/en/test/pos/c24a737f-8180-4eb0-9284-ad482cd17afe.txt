Cuban food? Never tried it? You don't know what you're missing. Havana's menu is delicious, extensive and includes the succulent Ropa Vieja. 

With respect to Lauren V.'s review, this is not Sonoran Mexican food at all and they share very few spices. There are no refried beans, no tortillas, no jalapenos, etc, etc. It is not "picante" food, simply well seasoned.

Currently, through October, they've added to the regular Cuban menu, themes from each Latin American country. We've enjoyed the specials from Ecuador, Guatamela and Argentina--all positively fantastic.

Certainly, most of the valley's "cocktail nation" has sipped a mojito(Ernest Hemingway's infamous drink) at various establishments--but, you must have one here--SUPERB!

Excellent service and guitar music on Fridays and Saturdays.
