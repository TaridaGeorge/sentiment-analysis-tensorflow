Every time I go to Scottsdale, I have to come here for dinner.  Since it is only about once a year, I HAVE to have the BBQ Salmon!  It is consistantly awesome, I promise.  We start with the queso dip and the iron skillet corn bread but honestly that salmon is a star and believe me I usually choose steak over fish.  This is a winner.  Where I live we have Houstons and I have pleaded with them to have the corn bread, cheese dip and BBQ salmon put on the menu.  They have declined...pity.
