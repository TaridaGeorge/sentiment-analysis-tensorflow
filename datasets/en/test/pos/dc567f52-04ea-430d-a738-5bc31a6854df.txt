Awesome new gelato shoppe!! It's so delicious that we have been here twice already in the same week...and were recognized by the staff already. They even remembered what we ordered the first time we went. Impressed! Very friendly, fun and helpful staff! They offered tons of samples and suggestions for mixing flavors to resemble candy bars, desserts, fruity drinks etc. 
I tried out their chocolate hazelnut, tastes exactly like those Ferrero Rocher chocolates [Heaven]! We also tried their dark chocolate and coconut ~ put it in the same spoonful and you'll be in Almond Joy heaven - sans almond [with a lot less guilt] :) They even offer a glass of water while youre enjoying your gelato, really nice touch!
