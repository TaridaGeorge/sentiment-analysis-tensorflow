Mad G's is a wonderful little neighborhood bar. My boyfriend and I live within walking distance. It doesn't look like much from the outside but it's work a stop inside! Their happy hour on Sunday is probably the best in Tempe. Plus, they carry a ton of local and craft beers, most on draft. The menu is really diverse and we enjoyed everything we ordered. 

I hope this place does well! It is a much welcome addition to Tempe.
