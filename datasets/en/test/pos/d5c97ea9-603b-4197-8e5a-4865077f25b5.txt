Based on their beer selection alone I'm giving this place 5 stars.  They  must have had about 10 IPAs to choose from, better than any other place I've been - including the Yard House.  I particularly like that the selection will vary, that I might have new choices next time (which will be soon).

The food menu seemed a bit limited, but what we ordered tasted good.  Everyone there was very friendly & helpful.
