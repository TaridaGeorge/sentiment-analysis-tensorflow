Ingleside is the best. For 7 years, we've trusted them w/the care of our animals. When we had to say goodbye to our dane, we were at an after hours emergency clinic in Scottsdale. We went to Ingleside the next day to let them know (as they saved her life about a year earlier and were awesome about routine calls to check on her)...Dr. Gilchrist and the rest of the team were very sad but also comforted us. They sent us a card within a day and also made a donation to the Morris Animal Foundation in memorial of our dane. 

They are top-notch folks.
