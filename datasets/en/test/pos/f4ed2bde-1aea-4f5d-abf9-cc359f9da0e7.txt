Oh Mac store I love you! My rating went up to a 5. I went in today because I "accidentally" dropped my IPod a few times, and it had a unfortunate battle wound. I was told not to tell anyone, but my "Genius" did me a big favor today and took care of my little problem. The issue was completely my fault, which I of course admitted right up front. My policy is when you've been bad just tell the truth. People already know, and they respect you more if you are honest.

I am not sure if it was my charm, or my boobies that warranted the special treatment, but I'll take it and say thank you either way! I love you Mac store, you always fix my problems. Why can't everyone be like you?
