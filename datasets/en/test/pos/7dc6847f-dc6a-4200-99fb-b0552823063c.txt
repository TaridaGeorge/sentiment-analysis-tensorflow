Wow, incredible service, fantastic food and great ambiance.  We had Spinach Gnocchi, Carpaccio, Calamari and New York Strip all exceeded expectations.  Desert was Warm Chocolate cake with Pistachio ice cream and Cheesecake.  Highly recommend as a date spot, just a get together or special event.  Well worth it!
