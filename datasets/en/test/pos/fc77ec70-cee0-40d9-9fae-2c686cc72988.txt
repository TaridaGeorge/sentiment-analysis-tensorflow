I happened upon Soundwerks because it was close to my condo in Scottsdale and had stellar reviews on Yelp.  The job was simple enough - install a tube amp in the back of my Sonata.  On the day of the installation, however, the amp (which was mine) wasn't functioning correctly, so Don said one of his techs would look at it the next day and get back to me.  Later that week, Don informed me that my tube amp was missing a $5 dollar part and the shop had already ordered it...and to bring the car by over the weekend so they can pop the bad boy in there.  Cool.

The installation went smoothly, and when I received the bill, there was no sign of that $5 dollar part.   Now that is good customer service.  I rarely Yelp.  This warranted it.
