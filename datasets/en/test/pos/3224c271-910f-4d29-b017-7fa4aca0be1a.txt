Undoubtedly the best and my most preferred Vig location in Phoenix. Not only is it close to Luci's Market Place (another favorite place of mine) , but it's also just up the street from my mom's place.
It was the Vig's one year anniversary the other night, so my friends and I decided to have dinner here. The restaurant  has a minimalist , trendy and modern atmosphere. 
We enjoyed several half off appetizers, 2 bottles of wine, Arnold Palmer ice tea and three kinds of desserts!  (See pictures) 
We did order a lot for three people and had plenty of left overs. 
They were half off, so how could anyone resist? 
I was also able to pick up wifi here and that automatically gets a boost in rating from me. 
I'm definitely coming back to bring my mom for brunch next time.
