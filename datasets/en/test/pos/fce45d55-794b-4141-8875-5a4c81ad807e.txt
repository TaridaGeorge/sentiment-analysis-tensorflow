The magazine is great. Only one problem: They never paid me for my article. I am owed $300 for an article I wrote in November 2006. The article was huge and took a ton of work and a lot of time to complete. They are in dire financial straits and have left many freelancers high and dry with regard to payment for past work. If you are a freelancer, run, don't walk, away from this magazine. I'm glad Lily A., who posted below got paid, but as of April 2008, I haven't seen one thin dime and the editors have stopped communicating with me. Makes me sick.
