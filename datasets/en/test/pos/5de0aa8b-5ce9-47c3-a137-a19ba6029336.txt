The first time I walked in here I felt like I was being catered to.  The family that runs the restaurant is incredibly friendly.  They offered me a free sample of their wonderful food.

I have eaten the Swedish meatball sandwich, the Swedish meatball pita and the tunbrodsrulle.  Each meal was incredible.  

The restaurant is incredibly clean, the family is very friendly, and the dessert is excellent.
