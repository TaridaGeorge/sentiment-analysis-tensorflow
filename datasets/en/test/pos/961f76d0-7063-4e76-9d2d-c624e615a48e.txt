It's finally here.. after waiting for so long!!!

I LOVE frozen yogurt.. not that stuff from the 80's but the new wave of tart frozen yogurt, you know the kind.. the stuff with live active cultures, fun toppings and textures set into a cool hip space. There are many knock offs around the valley and the country but this is the original tart frozen yogurt shop.. it's creamy, smooth and delicious! It's only slightly tart and is so creamy you'd think you were eating its high fat cousin. 

Ordered a large original with mochi, Fruity Pebbles and banana.. the experience for me is simply sublime.. all the textures and flavors working together in perfect harmony. I never knew it until now but I think Im in love with Red Mango, nothing like having the real thing.

XOXO
