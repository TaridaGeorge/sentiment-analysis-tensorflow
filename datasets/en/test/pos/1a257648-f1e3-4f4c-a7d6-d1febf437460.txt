I don't know all the details about this place, but they support Hospice care and are geared toward a greater cause of helping people. There is a counseling agency that works on the second floor.

I'm typing in the cafe (using their free wi-fi) and sipping on a mocha. My coffee drink is as good as any place else. And I LOVE the old and restored home. 

As one reviewer wrote, this is indeed quite a "feel good" type of place. Try it.
