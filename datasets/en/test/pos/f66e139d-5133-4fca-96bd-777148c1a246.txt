Recently moved 100 ft, right around the corner.  If you're having trouble locating it, its in town hall, footsteps from the Post Office.

I went for one of their Friday tastings and it was great.  Found a nice bottle of Tim Mondavi's Continuum and a substantial discount (normally much more expensive).  They also have other rarities like Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot.
Nice!
