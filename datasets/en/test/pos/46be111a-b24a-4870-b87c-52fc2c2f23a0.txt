Phenomenal training, friendly community, and a laid-back atmosphere. Laid-back, that is, until the workout starts. Which is exactly what you're paying for.

Ken is the best trainer I've worked with to date. He masterfully delivers top quality technical information in a friendly and accessible manner. While laid-back and snarky seems his default setting, he can bark out a coach's corrections with the best. You will learn to execute movements with correct form and demanding intensity.

If you're "looking for a gym," read the other reviews: this place is the real deal. Check it out, meet some cool people, work harder than you ever thought possible, become fitter than you thought you possibly could, and be home in an hour.

All in all, the perfect cure for my otherwise sedentary, computer-bound lifestyle.
