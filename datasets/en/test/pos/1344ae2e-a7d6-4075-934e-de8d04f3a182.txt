We've been fans of this mother and daughter operation for many years now. The Farmhouse is one of our favorite spots. The biscuits and gravy are the best we've had. The cinnamon rolls are a favorite, too. Chicken and dumplings on the Monday special is delicious. I have a friend who can't resist the meat loaf. When I feel like salad, the Cobb can't be beat. The friendly staff is great, too. Check it out!  

There can be a wait sometimes. If you see people out front, just put your name on the list by the front door. Sometimes we'll drive by first to see what the wait is like. If it's non-existent or short, we'll stop. They're only open for breakfast and lunch.
