Scraphappy Sisters is a MUST if you scrapbook!  I have taken MANY classes here, and have learned more about scrapbooking over the last few years than I ever thought I would.  I read the above comments, and am not sure about the store having older merchandise, as every time I am at the store, new merchandise is being stocked.  I always find something new each visit.  Sometimes it takes longer to sell items than anticipated, so maybe that is what the Penny Lane comment is all about.  
As a small business owner myself, I know how difficult it is to please everyone all the time, but this store comes as close as possible to doing exactly that.  Just ask for help, and believe me, you will get it!
LOVE the store, and the staff!
It truly is MY HAPPY PLACE!
