I love Postino!  I have visited more than half dozen times.  The waistaff are always friendly yet professional, and the atmosphere can't be beat for a group of friends.  It is not an ideal first date spot because it is "open" seating and usually very full.  However, I meet girlfriends here for wine and bruschetta all the time.  

Make sure to have the soup of the day, a great glass of wine (or a bottle!), and DO NOT MISS the bruschetta.

Enjoy!
