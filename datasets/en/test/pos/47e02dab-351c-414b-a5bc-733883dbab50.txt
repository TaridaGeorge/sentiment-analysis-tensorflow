Lindsey Sacco is the best stylist I've ever had, and when I moved to Tucson, she was the one person I knew I wouldn't be able to replace (service-wise).  I still have her cut my hair when I come up to Phoenix to visit my family, and I will keep going to her until she decides to move out of the Phoenix area.

The Millenium Day Spa itself is wonderful.  Everyone is nice, it's always clean, and every time I go there, it's a very peaceful experience.
