I had been in Tempe for 3 days when I found this place on Loqly. Great coffee, and coolest barista ever gave me all the info on the local music and art scene (thanks Ty!). Great ambience, relaxing, nice art on the walls. A great place to hang out. Food is limited to croissants and pastries but hey, you're here for the coffee, tea, and great people! If you do get hungry My Big Fat Greek Restaurant (great!) and a Taste of the Caribbean are in the same strip mall.
