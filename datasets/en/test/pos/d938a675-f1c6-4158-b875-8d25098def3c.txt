Visited family recently and was unable to get a haircut before I flew down.  Went grocery shopping at Lee Lee and saw this place.  Usually pretty picky about who cuts my hair and rarely take a risk to try a new place unless I HAVE to, and my this time I needed a cut bad.  Just grew it out from a short fade to actually being able to put product in it now.

Really happy about how my hair came out and it didn't take forever either.  If I lived down here I would definitely return.
