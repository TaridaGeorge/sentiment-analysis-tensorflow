Love the Tuck Shop.  Been going there for almost 3 years.  The food and service are absolutely consistent fast and delicious.  Wonderful comfort food.  Skirt Steak is my fave.  Portion sizes are perfect.  Love the stuffed dates.  Fried chicken and waffles are delicious.  Fantastic cocktails by Laura.  John the manager does his best to fit everyone in with limited space and he treats regulars very well.  Tuck Shop = comfort. ( as soon as you figure out when the best time is to show up.  )
