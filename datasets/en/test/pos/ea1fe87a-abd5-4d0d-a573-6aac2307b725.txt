I came here with two friends. It was my first ever massage and I was quite excited.
Everything was top notch. We were each called a day in advance to confirm our appointments (actually one of my friends made the appoints for everyone so the same person called her 3 times in less than ten minutes.)
Once we got there we were greeted and given paperwork to complete. We each had an interview and answered the questions we were asked and were explained the process.
My masseuse was great, perfect amount of pressure.
I felt like I was drunk afterwards. It was great! I even signed up for a membership!
Can't wait for my next appointment
