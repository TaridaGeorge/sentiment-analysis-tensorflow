AMAZING! 
The steak is unreal. It comes out sizzling and melts in your mouth. I have dreams about this steak almost every night--cant wait to go there again! We also ordered the truffle fries--SO GREAT! The side dishes are huge!

The place itself is VERY dim lighting and very proper. The waiter we had wasn't very personable but the bus boy was AWESOME! In the end the food made up for any negative aspects I had! 

Prices are high--BUT SOOOOOOOOOO worth it!

RECOMMENDED
