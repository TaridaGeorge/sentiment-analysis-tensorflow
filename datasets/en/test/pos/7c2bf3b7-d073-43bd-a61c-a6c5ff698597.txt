I love Discount Tire! My dad has been a loyal customer of this location for over 10 years, so naturally whenever my parents, siblings or I need new tires we go here. Yesterday a coworker noticed that I had a nail in my tire. I went straight to DT & they removed the 3 nails in my tire, patched it up & made sure none of my other tires had any nails. ALL FOR FREE! I was in & out within an hour, with about 4 people ahead of me. They have excellent customer service here which keeps my family & I coming back!
