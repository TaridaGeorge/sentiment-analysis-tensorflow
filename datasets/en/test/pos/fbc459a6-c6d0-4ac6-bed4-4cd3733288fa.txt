Otto's is wonderful. It's kind of tucked away on Ash & University, but it's a definite find. The business is family run and everyone working there is super friendly. The pizza specials are to die for. The slices are delicious, huge, and very nicely priced. Also, the ravioli is delicious and comes with a side salad. I'd personally recommend the spinach ravioli. I haven't tried everything, but if the pizza and ravioli are an indication to how awesome the rest of the menu tastes, I'm excited. So, really why wouldn't you come in?
