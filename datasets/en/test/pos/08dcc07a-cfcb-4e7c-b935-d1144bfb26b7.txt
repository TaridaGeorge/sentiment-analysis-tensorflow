All my friends know that I am not a fan of chains but I LOVE this place. 

Winestyles on Tatum and Shea is my Cheers. I am greeted by familiar faces on every visit and the staff is always suggesting wines they know I will love. The wines are priced nicely and the tastings are a steal. 

Kudos to Kara and her team for providing such great customer service!!
