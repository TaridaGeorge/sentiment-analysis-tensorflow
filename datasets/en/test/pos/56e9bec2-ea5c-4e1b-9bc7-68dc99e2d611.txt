This is the perfect place for a nice dinner. Whether it's taking your parents out or celebrating an anniversery, this is the place to go. The ambiance is nice the the food is amazing. It is a bit pricey but you definitely get what you paid for at the end of the day. 

I don't know how it is usually, but when we went, it was extremely crowded. Perhaps consider making reservations ahead of time if possible. 

Expect meal prices to be 15+.
