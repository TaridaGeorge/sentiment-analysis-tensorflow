If you're ever in Mesa, you should definitely swing by Mesa FroYo, which is a well-known secret to natives of Mesa.  There's always something great to choose from in their six weekly favorites and the swirls are always fun for variety.  Prices are fantastic and the small is always plenty for someone with an appetite like mine.  I like encouraging local businesses and this is one I've been supporting since I was in high school.

Just make sure to use the bathroom before you go because they don't have one.
