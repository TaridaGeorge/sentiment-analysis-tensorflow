I love this bar, have been going there ever since I moved to Arizona seven years ago. It attracts a friendly and fun crowd, I met a lot of good friends there. The owners, Jane and Dave are great people, always doing their best to make the place enjoyable for the customers. The bartenders are friendly, down to earth and always put a smile on my face. They have a great outdoor patio in the back where you can drink and smoke. And they have the coldest beer in town, perfect after a hot day of work. Highly recommend it!
