This place is awesome. Their food is absolutely delicious and pretty cheap too. The only downsides are how packed it gets in there, and the fact that they basically took all of Taco Del Mar's business. Then again, Roberto's gives you more food for a little cheaper, so eh.

Also, the people who work here are super nice.
