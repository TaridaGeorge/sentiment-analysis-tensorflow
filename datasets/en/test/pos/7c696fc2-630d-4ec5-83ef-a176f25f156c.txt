RIP to a great sushi place.  I went there today to get some food, and they were closed up with a sign on the door saying that they were behind on their rent and the landlord seized the property.

This place was not the best sushi I had in my life, but I gave it 5 stars for the value.  The happy hour was the best that I have ever seen.  Pretty good selection and GREAT prices.  The bartender/manager was a nice guy as well.  I moved here from Illinois and don't know a ton of people so I sometimes go out to eat by myself, and he was a friendly dude and very hospitable.  Hopefully they are able to re-open but based on the legalese that I read today, it doesn't seem too likely.
