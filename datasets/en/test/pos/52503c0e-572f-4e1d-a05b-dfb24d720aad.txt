I have rented a Toyota Sienna through Costco and picked up at this location.  No pressure or hassle to add-on insurance.  It was quick and easy!   If you are a Costco member, the second driver is free.  This is the best rental car place I have encountered.  The Manger is really friendly.  The van was clean and almost new.  I will definitely rent from this location again.
