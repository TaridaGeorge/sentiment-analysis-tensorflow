This is one of my favorite bars, its a cool relaxed environment. It has a great daily happy hour and reverse happy hour.  I have taken many friends and business clients, they have all wanted to go back.  Great food and drinks.  The wings in the Armadillo gold sauce can be voted Phoenix Best.  Their potato skins are the best I've had (when they don't come out a little burned I must admit).  Can you say Fried Pickles!  Give it a shot, if you like pickles you will love the Fried Pickles.  If you get the burger, you need to get the onion rings!!
