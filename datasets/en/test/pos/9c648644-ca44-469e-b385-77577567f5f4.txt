If you are a vegetarian.....you must try the veggie taco. The mountain of goodness atop the tasty fry bread will leave your belly too full, but your mouth will definitely want more. This is a great spot for a a mixed herbivore/carnivore lunch stop, as my non-veggie friends can't seem to get enough of the red or green chili tacos. I am much looking forward to returning to try the honey fry bread desert, as I have never had room for desert after the massive tacos!!!
