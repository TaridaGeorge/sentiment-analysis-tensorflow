Dr. Bryant is one of the most kind hearted orthodontists there. Although he is very professional and takes his work seriously, that shouldn't be taken in the way that he is rude and not willing to do work. I enjoyed my braces by him and now have an awesome smile! Also, I'm pretty sure he drives a prius every day..
