I love pet companion. Lon Miyahira is fantastic. the front desk staff is wonderful as well. I was taking my dog somewhere else that was recommended to me and after spending over 1000.00 with no results took her to Lon and boom he knew exactly what we bothering her and fixed my sweet dog back.. Anyone that writes a bad review is just an unhappy camper in life. This pet companion has always fit me in when i really needed my dog looked at, and has never charged me for things that were not necessary.. that is rare for Vets.
