I just had my eyeliner touched up and Heather makes it so easy.  Previous cosmetologists had me keep my eyes open and I just couldn't do it.  Heather does it nice and easy with your eyes closed.  Several of my friends (who have already had their liner done as well) ask for Heather's number because her work is far better than any of them have ever seen before.
