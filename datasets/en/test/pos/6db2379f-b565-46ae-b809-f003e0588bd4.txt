Visiting Scottsdale and happened across this lounge/restaurant. Made it just in time for happy hour and received half off our appetizers and maki rolls. Portion size was way larger than expected and have wonderful leftovers. Delicious sushi and the waitress was super friendly and helpful about info of the local area. Will def go again if ever in town.
