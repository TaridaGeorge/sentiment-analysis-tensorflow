Fez has become a mainstay on Central, I thought after all this lightrail construction the place would wilt out, but no, the light still shines in FEZ for cool urban people that like mod settings and cool friends. We are so desperate for modern cool places in Central Phoenix that this place gets 93 reviews and counting! Good on you FEZ I heart you.
