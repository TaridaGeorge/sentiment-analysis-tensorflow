What a simple inexpensive way to truly spoil yourself or a friend. Drop a bath bomb, have a glass of wine nearby (or your choice of poison) and the stress of the day just melts.  I have been a fan but my love for these special treats was renewed when I was given some scrubs and bombs for my birthday. I feel so loved. Tonight is absolutely wonderful, yelping as I sit soaking is blue bliss. I recommend!!! Buy buy!  The chilled scrubs are a special treat in these hot temps. Yummy!
