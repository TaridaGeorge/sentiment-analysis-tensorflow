The real Arizona deal. At amazing prices. Red Arden spa is incredible. Take time to spend in the lobby - talk to Les the historian. Let me show you around. Look at photos. Breathe the fresh air and history. Food at Litchfield's is superb. Eat at bar. Happy hour even. $4 glasses of good wine. Pools and relaxation. Who needs Palms Springs??
