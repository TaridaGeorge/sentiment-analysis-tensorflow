I visited Press on the recommendation of a friend and was not disappointed!  The ambiance is warm and inviting and I really enjoyed sitting outside on their patio.  The pumpkin spice latte I had was delicious and the breakfast burrito was fantastic and filling.  Their service was friendly, too!  Perfect place to stop and relax!
