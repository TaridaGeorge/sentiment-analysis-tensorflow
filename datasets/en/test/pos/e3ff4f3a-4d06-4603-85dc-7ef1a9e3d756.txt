This is really the best pizza in the country.  I live in San Francisco, and although pizzeria delfina was rated higher officially, I disagree.  I have been to many places in New York City and San Francisco and everything I eat a pizza there I think about Biancos being even better.  The salads are great, the pizza is great, the atmosphere is great.  I know people complain about the long lines, but you go there and know you are spending the whole evening there.  Get there at 4pm, grab a drink and wait in line.  Best Pizza you will have.  Try to not get too many toppings.  Stick with a plane Margharita or Bianco Verde.
