This four star review is mostly for the staff:

We came here for a goodbye party for one of our co-workers last week, it was raining and we ended up huddled at the bar by the bathrooms because it was so crowded. However, the rain let up a little bit and we decided to take a chance at sitting on the patio. 

The staff could not have been more accomodating, they set up the umbrellas so we wouldn't get wet if it started to sprinkle again, they encircled us with heatlamps, lit the fire and even passed out blankets!

I don't have much to say about the food, both times I've been here I've been too tipsy to really remember if it was good or not. But I highly recommend sitting on the wonderful patio and having a glass of wine.
