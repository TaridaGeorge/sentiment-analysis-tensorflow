Mama Java's is the colorful, neighborhood coffee house. This is where we go for gourmet coffee & tea, chat, and simple breakfast fare. They also support the local music and arts scene by providing a venue for performances for both local and non-local acts, an informal art gallery, and a selection of periodical and other literature as well. Free wifi Net access complements the offerings. 

Make no mistake about it: MJ's caters to a different audience than Acacia Cafe (thet new kids down the block). Mama Java's is really a neighborhood focal point as well as a business. Here people get to know each other, and most are worth knowing.

Truthfully I'd givce it a 4 1/2 rather than a 5 because of the limited food selection, but then again that's not the point at Mama Java's.
