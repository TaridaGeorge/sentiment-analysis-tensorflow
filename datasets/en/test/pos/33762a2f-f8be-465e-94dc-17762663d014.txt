Absolutely love the market. We go there almost every Saturday for fruit, veggies, bread, condiments. I can't cook with other onions and garlic now, because the difference truly is noticeable. And those pickles! They should be outlawed, they are so good. It's nice to get to know the people who spend their days getting this food ready to bring to you. I have turned at least a dozen people onto the market, and now it is more accessable by being open on Wednesday nights. Sure it is not as big as other markets in other big cities, but who cares? We aren't in those places, we are stuck here, and I for one am thankful for the market.
