Yep!!  Another great frozen dessert place that I can go to on my travels. 

This was excellent.  Very rich flavor so a smaller amount was sufficient.

Be prepared to stand in line for a period of time.  They allow sampling so everyone has to try samples which takes more time.

Well worth the wait.  Pricing very comparable to frozen yogurt places.
