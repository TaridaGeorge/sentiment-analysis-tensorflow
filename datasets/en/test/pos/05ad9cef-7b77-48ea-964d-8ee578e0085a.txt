This is a fantastic up scale resturant. Happy hour is cheep but the regular menu is pricy how ever that being said the food is worth the price! We had a fantistic time the fish tank is unbielievable and the decor makes you happy you came so do the servers. We had the 3 corse meal for $35 the fugi apple salad was the best salad I have ever tasted and the Coco vin was soo good and so much I had to box it up to have room for thechocolet suffle which is delish!!!!  The lobster potstickers were great everone loved their selections and koodos to Roy;s
