I joined SAR in July 2009; and only used the weights and some of the cardio equipment. In November I started taking their kickboxing classes, which were awesome!

Now I'm hooked! Their Spin, Rowing, and Boxing Cardio classes are TOUGH but worth it. Such a great value, the instructors are great, and at only $75 a year (for residents) it's great!
