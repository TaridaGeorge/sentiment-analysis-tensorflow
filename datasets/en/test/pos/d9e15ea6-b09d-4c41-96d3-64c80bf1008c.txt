This weekend we went to brunch at Bacon.  I was extremely excited to hear there was a restaurant that was named after one of my favorite foods.   Wonderful place, great staff and the atmosphere was open, clean and comfortable.  We even had a great view of Camelback Mountain.   Our waiter was extremely attentive and checked on us often.  A sign of a good waiter in my opinion.  
Watching what I am eating for the moment, I decided to get the Jerk Chicken Salad and it was pretty flavorful.    Others at our table tried different things and they all looked great.  I did manage to snag a little piece of bacon from my partners plate. ;)
