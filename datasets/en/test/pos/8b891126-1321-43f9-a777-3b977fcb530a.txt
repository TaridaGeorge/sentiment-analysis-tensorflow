HOLY CHEESE CURDS!  Literally!  They are so good they have to be holy and heavenly and all associated greatness.  These are hands down the best cheese curds I have ever had in my life.  I've had Beecher's in Seattle, and they are good.  I've had some curds from the dairy farm run by the polygamists up in Colorado City and those are really good.  Nothing can even come close to how good the cheese curds are at Petit Fromage.  They make the best midnight snack in the world.  They actually make a great breakfast.  I can eat them all day long!  I got some last week and then I begged the husband every 5 minutes to take me back there to get some more after I finished.  Do yourself a favor.  Stop reading this and go to get some curds!  Make sure you leave some for me!
