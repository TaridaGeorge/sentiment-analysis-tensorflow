This is really an outstanding ACE store. As a Single Mom trying to 'do it on my own', the employees are always plentiful and will consistently go out of their way to help you get what you need. Apparently (some?) of the Ace stores are a franchise type of thing; at least that was what I was told when I walked into the nearby Scottsdale location and found a COMPLETELY different (employee-LESS) store. Wow- what a difference a team makes. FH ACE has a well-stocked store, knowledgeable staff, exceptionally friendly atmosphere and a customer service-driven ethic. Kudos to them! They deserve any business you can give them!
