I'm not a coffee drinker so when everyone else in our group got coffee, I asked for their tea selection. 

The staff is super friendly and they recommended the mango black tea for the iced tea. 
I'm a big tea drinker and I'm somewhat picky so I was happy to see they do it right. I.e. Brew strong upon order, and chill with a large cup of ice. 

The tea was so good that I asked for what the brand of tea was, and they were super helpful.
