This place was AWESOME!!!!  A friend of mine noticed I had a big slash in my tire which of course is not safe to drive with.  My boyfriend and i located the nearest Discount Tire and were relieved to see that they were open for another hour.  

As soon as we stepped out of the car we were greeted and taken care of within minutes.  We walked away buying 4 brand new tires for about 500.00. with warranty.  Everyone we worked with was friendly and really helped us out.  I would definitely go back to this location in the future:)
