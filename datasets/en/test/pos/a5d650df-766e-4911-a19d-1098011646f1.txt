Outstanding!! Clean tanks. Clean foot "utensils". Great non "bubble" nail polish. I was there for the deluxe which was $30, and lasted for well over an hour. My nappy feet are once again happy feet. ;) Ohhh and only once was there that uncomfortable talk between the girls - you know what I am talking about!!!! Are try talking about my foot gunk or the customer sitting next to me.. Hee he Hee crap. None of that. :) 5 stars for that alone. They all speak English. 10 more stars for that!
