Husband and I really love this place. It's so nice to go somewhere with our Australian Kelpie where they call her by name! Their self-wash is super easy to use and, though there's a big blow dryer in there, they supply a towel for wimpy dogs like mine who hate the sound of blow dryers. Husband likes to stop in with the pup on a Friday for Free Biscuit Fridays and to ask the helpful employees tons of dog related questions after hitting up the park. 

If they start selling Blue's Blue Bones (those things are freakin' amazing), then they'll be the only pet store we go to!
