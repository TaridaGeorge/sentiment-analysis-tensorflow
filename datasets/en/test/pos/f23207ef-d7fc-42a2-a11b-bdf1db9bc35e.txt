this is THE best place i have ever boarded my dog.

they don't charge extra for stuff like giving treats, or bringing your dog outside, or playing with your dog. for the exact same price as other boarding facilities, they do much much more.

boarding is $33 a night, including daycare which is hours of playtime outside.

they also do an evaluation of each dog to ensure no aggresive dog will be around the other boarders.

the people that work here are super-friendly.  check them out!
