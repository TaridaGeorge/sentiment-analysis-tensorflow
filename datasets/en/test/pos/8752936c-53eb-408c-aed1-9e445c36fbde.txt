to be honest i'll preface this review to only be about one thing..ok well maybe two things. the Toddy Coffee and the Vegan Donuts


i love you.

i am absolutely in love with you.

typically i order an iced americano and then fill it up with stevia sweetener till my hearts content, and then enough organic half and half to change my coffees complexion to reflect halle berry. but the toddy i purchased at conspire was 1000% perfect just with ice. 

merry me.
