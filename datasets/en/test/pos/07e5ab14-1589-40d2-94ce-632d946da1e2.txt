Very honest and fair.  Their estimate of labor was in line with what I assumed should be the case which is to say it was almost half of what other large auto body shops were stating.   I even had scratches elsewhere on my vehicle and where other shops were charging and hour or an hour and a half for touch up paint labor, these guys just did it as part of the overall auto body work.   I would highly recommend this company and I am not an easy to please consumer
