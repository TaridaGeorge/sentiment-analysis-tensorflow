Three words.. love love love! First off, the cute little delivery boy randomly asked me if I had any wire hangers. Images of Joan Crawford swam through my head. Next, the prices are phenomenal. I couldn't even use the coupon I had because the entire meal was under $20. My friend devoured his pasta in less than 5 minutes and I shortly followed suit with my delicious cheese pizza. 

Normally, I am a strict pizza purist...just cheese with nothing else. However, judging by the quality of the foundation, I may be willing to branch out and see what other wonderful flavors are in store.

I'll also keep a wire hanger handy just in case.
