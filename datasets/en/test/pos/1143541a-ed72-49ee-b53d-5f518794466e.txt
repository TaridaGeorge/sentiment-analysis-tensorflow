I love Kona, in particular, I love their macadamia nut chicken. It's always fresh and hot. It's paired with this sweet apricot jam and brown gravy. The combination of savory with a splash of sweet is out of this world. I could eat this dish every week. As for the sushi, it fairly top notch. I usually get the Philadelphia rolls. Yummyness.
