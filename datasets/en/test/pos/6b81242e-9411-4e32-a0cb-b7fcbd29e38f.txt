Due to my dairy intolerance my flavor choices were a little limited. I went with the kettle corn ....O. M. G. that was the most amazing kettle corn I have EVER eaten! It was big and fluffy with the perfect level of sweet and salty....it's so so so so so addictive. Wow, wish I could try the dairy-containing flavors......I know I'm missing something amazing!!!
Yummy!!!!!
