Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe has the authenticity of Japan's finest "Mom & Pop" eateries.  This effect is achieved by trasporting diners to a quaint interior with friendly service and delicious food the moment the enter from the low scale strip mall exterior.  The Ramen with Pork Cutlett (chashu ramen) is superb as are many of their other Asian dishes and even their italian fare is done with care and skill.  Sometimes the servers aren't the best in terms of knowledge and attentiveness, but the quality of food, affordable price and friendly atmosphere make up for it.
