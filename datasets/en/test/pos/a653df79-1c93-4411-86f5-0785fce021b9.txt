Went here for the first time a few weeks ago.  They were very friendly and the service was quick.  They offered to clean my stuff by the afternoon.  It wasn't too expensive and I thought they did a pretty good job.  They are the only place that picks up their phone too.  I couldn't get ahold of any other dry cleaners close to downtown.
