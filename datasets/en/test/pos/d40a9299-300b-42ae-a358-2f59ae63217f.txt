I LOVE this place. Never a bad experience!
The food is great, I haven't had everything, as I do not like spicy foods.  Everything from the fish&chips to the spinich salad to the french dip always great and very consistent. The water is the best in town, which is rare.
The patio is always full, you will have to wait for a table out there, but it's worth it.  
This is a first rate place!
