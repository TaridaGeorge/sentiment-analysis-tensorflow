Wow. A great sandwich. I tried the pressed toast it was delicious. The baguette is tasty and has a perfect crunch to it. I also tried the blue cheese cole slaw. Wasn't sure I would like it as in not a big fan of blue cheese but it was very good. 

I'm not out this way much but when I am I'm going to stop by this gem and try another sandwich.
