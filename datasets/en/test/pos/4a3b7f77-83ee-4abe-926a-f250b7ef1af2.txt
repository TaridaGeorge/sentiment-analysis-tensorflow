I ordered and received the most awesome roof wrap for my Mini Cooper S. It was a Tie Dye Peace sign, and Mike and Hannah included a "perf" version for the sunroof area that matched up perfectly. I emailed and asked about installation and they advised having a pro do it. I did, and it turned out great! Although it was only guaranteed for 1 summer, I still have the perf on the roof (it's faded, but still cool), although I had to peal the solid part off last year. As soon as I take it off, I'm going to plan a new wrap for Aesthetic Creations to design for me. (FYI, for no cost, they sent me clear vinyl tape to finish off the perforation area, so that it would not peal going through car washes, etc.). 
Great products, great service, great after care!
