How could I keep driving by this place without going in? I live a few minutes away after all. 

The place does blend in, I won't lie. But now that I have stopped in, I have fallen in love. You have great service combined with quality products and a cute atmosphere. It's a win-win.

What's even better? We went about a month ago for the first time and we came back yesterday and they remembered us! Wow. 

I am completely impressed with everything here. I can't wait to expand what I experience here.
