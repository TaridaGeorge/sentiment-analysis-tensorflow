This is becoming our favorite froyo place!! The flavors are good and it's always nice and clean. They have several no sugar added flavors that actually taste good!! A few times some flavors haven't been quite frozen all the way, but that happens at all frozen yogurt places depending on when the machines were last filled. It's yummy and a fair price. Their peanut butter is good and the NSA chocolate and cheesecake are good too! Try it! Much better than Golden Spoon or Swirlit!
