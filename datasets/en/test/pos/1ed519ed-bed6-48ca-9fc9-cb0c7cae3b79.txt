Waffle House at this location is as good as it gets !

Great food.  Fun staff.  Weird clientele.

However, we are all there for one thing and that is to eat great food at a great price.  

My favorite meal is the two pork chops and eggs which includes hasbrowns and  toast all for about $7.

Its a cool place to hang out as well.  Their dessert pies are super cheap too.  

$1.50 are you kidding me ?
