I love this location, and I love this product.  

I think the prices are reasonable considering the quality of product you are getting.  If you've only been to the Scottsdale Fashion Square location and hate it, give this one a try.  It's got a much better vibe and is a lot less packed.  

Walked right in was helped, she grabbed what I needed and I was off.  It took all of 15 minutes even with picking out a totally new foundation then I used before.
