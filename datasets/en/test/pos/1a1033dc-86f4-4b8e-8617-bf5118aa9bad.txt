Stumbled upon this place today on a drive by. Looked so cool, was drawn in. Really a great spot and the food that we ordered was perfect. The service was super friendly, attentive and helpful (we are out of towners)...the owner and her daughter were fawning over our pooch which always scores major points for us.
