I have been going to Anita for about a year now to get my eyebrows threaded. I have sensitive skin that breaks out easily so I can't get my eyebrows waxed. If you have never had your eyebrows threaded before, I must inform you, it still hurts! It is pretty quick though and no chemicals are used on your skin. It is very hard to find people who do threading (unless you want to get it done in the middle of the mall with everyone walking by) but Anita is great. Make sure you give yourself atleast a week to get an appointment as she books up pretty fast. I don't know what she charges for other services but I pay $12 for my eyebrows to be threaded and it lasts about 3 weeks.
