I miss this place so much. I come in every time I'm in the valley and long for it when I'm back home in Seattle. To me, it is the perfect pizza. 

The sauce has that hint of sweetness, but it's still rich and savory. The crust is both chewy and crispy at the same time and it never fails to support the weight of the toppings. And then there's the sausage, my God the sausage. 

Don't forget to order the garlic bread with tomatoes and cheese to start, crispy garlic bread fresh tomatoes and I think it's like $5 so why would you not order it?

Please open a Nello's in Seattle. I've got some spare time I'll do all the leg work you need, hell I'll even pay to get a franchise just so I can have the Numero Uno whenever I want.
