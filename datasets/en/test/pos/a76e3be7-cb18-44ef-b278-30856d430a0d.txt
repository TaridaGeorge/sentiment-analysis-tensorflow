I love to grab a pedi at VKs mid work week.  It's a very popular spot on weekend, so mid work week is important.  They take their time with you - my last pedi was an hour and a half.  Can you just imagine that foot massage - it was divine.  And I now have the cutest 4th of July totsies in the West - see the attached photo!
