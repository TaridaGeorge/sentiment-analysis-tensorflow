Very pricey, and a once a year date night experience for us, but well worth it. This is one of the Best Kept Secrets of Arizona. This hidden treasure is unsurpassed in scenery and ambiance. We go in the winter near sunset sit on the front patio with chimineas burning and savor the dinner and the experience. Sunset views of the praying monk on Camelback Mountain are beautiful. This old house has tons of history and the wine cellar downstairs is magnifique! No I'm not french..... nor am I a snob.....it is just the only word that fits this unique rustic room.
