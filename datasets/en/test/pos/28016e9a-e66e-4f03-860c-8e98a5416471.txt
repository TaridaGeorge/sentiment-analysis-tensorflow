I went in because I thought my brakes were squealing and needed new pads. I have had previous cars in for the same problem and always was charged an outrageous amount. Mad Hatter took my car in for no charge, checked everything, inflated my tires to the proper amount, and topped off my brake fluid for free! The were HONEST with me and told me that everything looked great! Wow, didn't try to wring a dime out of me. Needless to say, they will be getting a thank you card and I am handing their card out to everyone I know.
