Love this place! The food is so fresh tasting and everything they use is locally grown. I've been here just for lunch a couple times, and each time is great. Today I had the Roasted Chicken Club (without the mayo), that comes with fresh greens on the side too. The grain bread they use is amazingly good and the entire sandwich is just fresh!

Also, Essence is known for their macaroons, which simply are amazing. I've had the mint and raspberry with rose filling and both are so tasty.

The patio (although small) is a great place to sit and relax outside when the weather is nice.

My only gripe is the single shot latte's - they only fill the cup half  full for $2.95. If you want a full cup, remember to order the double shot latte!
