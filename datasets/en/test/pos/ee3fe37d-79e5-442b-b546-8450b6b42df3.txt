This place is incredible! I'm a guy and I popped in here to get some stuff for my girlfriend as a gift and the staff was SUPER friendly and nice and had all kinds of suggestions for me. Usually in a place like that I want to get in and out and fast as possible but I actually enjoyed looking at all their products.

I knew they had a lot of vegan products (of which I am one), but after viewing their website I fell in love with this company. Not only do they not test and have vegan products, but they support causes like fair-trade and environmental concerns. 

Lush rocks. You can put that in your tub and soak it.
