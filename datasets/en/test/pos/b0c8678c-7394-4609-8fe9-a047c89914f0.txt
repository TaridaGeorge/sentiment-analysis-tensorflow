This has by far been my favorite movie theater and favorite movie chain in Arizona.  This location is better than the others I have been to - quieter, friendlier staff.  The theaters are clean and usually not packed either.

I love the t-shirt and cup program - and buying tickets at Costco.  I went to AMC last month, and spent a lot more money all the way around and did not like the theater either.
