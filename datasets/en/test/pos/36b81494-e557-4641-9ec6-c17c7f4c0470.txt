If I were to move out of Phoenix tomorrow, Lo Lo's would be the place that I would regretfully leave behind.  Its still pretty unbelievable to me that chicken n waffles is still a unique concept around the US -- this combo should be served at baptisms, first communions, bar mitzvahs, wedding, and wakes.  Indeed, every time is a good time for chicken n waffles.

However, ONE specific time exceeds all the others.  That is, chicken n waffles as hangover food.  Nothing soaks up those poisons like a Tre Tre's platter with a side of grits and a Dr Pepper/Red Kool Aid.

This is a perfect place to take out of towners, particularly because of what most consider a bizarre concept (until they try it .. then they're like all "ooooohhhhh") and for the cool southern-style coziness.
