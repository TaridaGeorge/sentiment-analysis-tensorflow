Best gyros in Phoenix period. The hummus is really good, too.  I love greek food and these are the best gyros out here.  The pitas and the meat are the best I've tasted out here.  Some places give you the preccoked presliced no tasting meat, and others load their sandwiches with tons of lettuce and tomatoes with no meat.  This place piles on the meat.  Special note: If the wife makes your gyro be prepared for biggest meat gyro you've ever seen, but the husband makes a better gyro giving you a better balance of meat and toppings.  
Unfortunately, I can't review the rest of their meals because I can't get past ordering the perfect gyro.  If it's not broke, don't fix it.
