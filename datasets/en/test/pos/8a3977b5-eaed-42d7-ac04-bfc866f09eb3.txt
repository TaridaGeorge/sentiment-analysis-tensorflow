I recently stumbled upon this amazing little healthy spot. I ordered a custom wrap and added cilatro pablano humus, quinoa salad, corn salad, wild rice with squash and mixed greens. It was so good I ate the other half that I was gonna save for dinner. Menu changes daily with the veggies that are available and posted on fb. I would eat here every day if I were close enough.
