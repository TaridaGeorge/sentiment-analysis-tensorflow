Thanks to Lindsey for another great Yelp event. And thanks to Mood Swings for having us Yelpers. It was a fun night filled with champagne, appetizers and mini spa services. 

The chair massage was great! They were even so nice as to let me get the mini manicure. I wasn't sure if I would be able to since I had shellac nail polish on my hands and I know it is a pain to remove...but they said no problem and just had me soak my nails for 10 minutes. Thank you! 

I look forward to coming back for a mani/pedi or a massage!
