Ever since I left San Diego for Arizona, I've been looking for a Vietnamese place that has my favorite pho dish, pho bo kho.  For some reason, no one around here seems to have it...

...except Pho Ao Sen.

And let me tell you, it's not just the fact that I haven't had it in a year that made it taste so phenomenal.  The broth had that nice thick heartiness that this stew-like pho should have, full of flavor.  There was ample meat, just the right amount of rice noodles, and all the sides were very fresh.

Also, the nuoc mam chicken wings were a fantastic appetizer.  Crispy, hot, perfectly seasoned and just the right amount of spiciness.  Nom.

This is now my regular stop for pho in the Phoenix area!
