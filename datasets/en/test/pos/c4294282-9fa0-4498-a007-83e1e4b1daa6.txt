Whole Foods is wonderful, albeit a little expensive. If you live nearby, my advice; if you are hankering for some of their delicious, hot food; is to buy it there, but take it home. My reasoning is that the store will tax you for eating on the premises and will add this tax to your bill. Granted, they are pretty clear about this at the checkout and will ask you if you plan on eating the food in the store. Alternatively, pay the tax and enjoy some of the tapas at the in-store wine and tapas bar (go easy on or abstain from the wine if you are driving of course). The atmosphere is pretty decent and the food is even better.

Parents will find a great selection of organic and gluten-free products for both themselves and their kids.
