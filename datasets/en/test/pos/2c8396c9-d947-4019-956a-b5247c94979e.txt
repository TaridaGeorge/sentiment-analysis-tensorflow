I checked out Centurion at the end of June after driving past it for the last month.  It was a great.  Very small but friendly place.  The chef and waitress were the only ones there when we got there but their enthusiasm more than made up for the empty tables.  They offered great suggestions and were friendly and courteous.  All of their suggestions for entrees to try were spot on and the chef let us know he loves suggesting wine/meal combos.  After we got there a few other tables got seated for dinner as well.  Everyone seemed new to the restaurant and everyone seemed happy that they stopped by.  I'll definitely be going again!
