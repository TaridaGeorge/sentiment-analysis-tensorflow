$5 glasses of wine from the WHOLE menu, ALL day till 6?!  r u kidding me??  Ya, baby!  Bring it on!  

I am so coming back to try the happy hour, so yes, they have even better deals, can you believe it?

I am really starting to think Gabby & I are leaving each other scent trails that we are picking up on each other within days of stepping into joints - or is it just me?  I had just seen her hosting the kids booth at the Old Town Farmer's Market, and afterwards was driving around on this beautiful Saturday Afternoon, (drop-top-down), and spied this cute place.  

Service was immediate, courteous & attentive.  Our waiter went out of his way to serve us.  Scott, the manager, even came over to make introductions, introduce himself and chat us up.  

Service with a smile, all around!
