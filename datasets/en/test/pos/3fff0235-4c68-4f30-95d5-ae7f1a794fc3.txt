My husband and I have been bringing our dry cleaning here for the past 3 years and we have zero complaints. The price is right and the service is wonderful. They get our things cleaned quickly and they always do a great job. Both of the employees are extremely personable and they remembered us both after only having gone a couple of times. They won Best of Phoenix in New Times for 2009 as well. We are moving out of state later this month and we are really going to miss Krisply Kleen!
