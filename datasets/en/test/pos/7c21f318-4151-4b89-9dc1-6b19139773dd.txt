Stopped by here for a gift for my buddy NBOD.

Jim greeted me as I entered the establishment, and asked how he could help.  I mentioned that I was looking for a gift for a friend.

After some qualifying questions, he suggested specific items from his stock, describing each.

After I told him I was with Yelp, he offered to give me a tour.  They have a room in the back.  It is Byob. Beer & wine only.

They have an 8 ft conference table, poker area, and dual flat panels. It's all free for the use, and all they ask is that you purchase your cigars there.
