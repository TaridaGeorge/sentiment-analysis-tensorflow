I have had the pleasure of enjoying the dining experiences Scottsdale has to offer and I have to say that Grimaldi's has not let me down. Time after time the management exceeds my expectations. The staff is amazing and consistent, the food is superb. Grimaldi's continues to be a favorite and my dining choice for friends and family visiting!
