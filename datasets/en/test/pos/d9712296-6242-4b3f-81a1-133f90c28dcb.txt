Still 5 stars, but sadly Amber is closing up shop.  Don't feel bad for her as it is not for the lack of business.  She is getting married and leaving the state and taking Spoken with her.  Damn her!!!  I did pick up some jeans and 3 shirts, all at 60% off.  So hurry over and pick up some bargains!  And wish Amber good luck!
