I was on my way back to the airport and decided to stop by here to pick up something to go.  Holy crap...this place is awesome!  I'm usually not a fan of baked goods, but I can keep eating those Chocolate Chip Banana Muffins!  The muffin was really moist and had the perfect amount of chocolate chips and banana.  I also ordered a quiche muffin and it was quite good as well!  I definitely need Danielle to ship me some of those muffins on a weekly basis...I'm still craving them!
