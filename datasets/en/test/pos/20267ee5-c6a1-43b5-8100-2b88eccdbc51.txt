I have been taking my car here for washes for 2 years.  This is the best car wash place I have been to.  I would highly recommend it!  The prices are very reasonable, the staff is always offering me coupons same day to use, the car wash itself is great, the staff is extremely friendly, and I don't feel they are overly pushy for sales like some other car washes. 
Today, however, I had a new experience.  I lost my cell phone while I was there.  It was an extremely busy Saturday afternoon at a car wash, as you can imagine it would be.  You wouldn't have known it based on how the entire staff, including the owner, treated me.  They all helped me search  to find my phone.  I could not ask for better service than that!  =)
