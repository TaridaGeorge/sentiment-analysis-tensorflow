This place is great.  It's becoming a habit.  JenLyn and Matt have their stuff together.  We love Fusion (their other restaurant) so we figured to try it.  Like everything they do, the food is always excellent, staff is personal and quick and the drinks aren't bad either.  My husband like the hangover.  I usually get the french toast or waffles.  We have been there for lunch as well.  You can't get anything bad here.  Trust me.  It's a gotta go to place.
