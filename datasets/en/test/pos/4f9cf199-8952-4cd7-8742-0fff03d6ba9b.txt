This is not a regular Barney's store but it's still a great place to get your designer fix. The co-op stores sells many up-and-coming designer labels and for a small store they carry a pretty decent selection of merchandise. Their service is great and the associates at this store are very helpful and nice. I am not the richist girl but I love to go in and see the lastest 3.1 Philip Lim and Marc by Marc Jacobs clothes they have.
