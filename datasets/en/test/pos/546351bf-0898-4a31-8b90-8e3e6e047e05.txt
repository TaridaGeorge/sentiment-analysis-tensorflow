Tried this barber out for the 1st time today. Needed a new barber shop as the one I've been going to for a few years got some tired young guys who you could tell really didn't want to be there. This place was really good. They have 4 chairs and all the barbers working did a really efficient and good job. I really don't need or want a "stylist" or any other frills. If you're looking for a good barber these guys get the job done. The name is now All Pro Barbers
