I was in for a great surprise when I walked in Thursday afternoon. 
I was with my baby and craving something sweet, yet sour and also good for me. 
I walked in and was immediately greeted/served by Betty's husband. After going through a display case of flavors to choose from, he told me they have key lime pie with homemade graham cracker crust. 
I swear, he read my mind! 
So happy, I almost snagged it from his hand. I sat down, baby was sleeping, and quietly enjoyed my key lime paleta. It was creamy, and very tart with a little sweetness. Just the way I love key lime pie. The crust is what made it all come together. 
I can't wait to go in for more. Especially after talking to Betty herself. She said everything is fresh. Meaning no frozen fruits/juices added and flavors are seasonal.
