I love this place!  I've eaten here here five times since they opened and every meal has been delicious.  I've had the Mediterranean salad, Cobb salad with crab cakes on top, turkey burger with sweet potato fries. Crab cake sandwich and an omelet.  What is great is you can get breakfast anytime.  Give the establishment a chance to work out a few kinks AND read the menu - very descriptive.
