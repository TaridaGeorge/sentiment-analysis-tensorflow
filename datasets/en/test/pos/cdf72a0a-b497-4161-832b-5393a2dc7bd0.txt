I have used Tammie Coe for as many years as she has been around. My family now asks me to take care of the cake for all our special occasions. (Like Tammie is my personal secret.) Her staff is worderful to work with. Our last cake was suggested by her staff. Our entire party was in Balck and White except for my Mom. She wa wearing a new dress I had bought for her Purple. Her suggestion a Cake encrusted in non pareils with a Purple Ribbon to match her dress. 
Not only was it Beautiful but Delicious as well!
