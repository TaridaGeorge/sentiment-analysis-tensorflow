My wife and I have been to this location twice in the past 6 months and the service and food quality have been top notch.  They have a wonderful ooutdoor patio that we love to visit.  This past Saturday we went to the Gilbert location to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  We had a wonderful time.  The service was top notch and the food quality was perfect.  When we ordered desert, they GM appeared and told us to enjoy our deserts as they were on them, and they brought us a small bottle of champagne to share.  AWESOME!! We will go back and will continue to take our family to this location for lunch and dinner.  Thank You Keg staff!
