My two favorite cuisine in the whole wide world? VIET tops the list then Thai trails behind closely. I've been to lots of Thai places around the Valley but hands down my favorite is this place. It's kinda confusing to get to (read: mapquest this place or else) but it is worth it. The shop is cute and cozy and the owners are very nice and accomodating. You'll never really find it crowded but they have lots of to go orders and they've been a stable here in AZ for over twenty years. I can't recommend any one dish because all their dishes are diligently prepared and fresh. The prices are pretty good too. Anyone wanna come with on Friday?
