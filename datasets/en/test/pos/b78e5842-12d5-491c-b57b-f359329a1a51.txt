I love Arizona Pet Resort. Shortly after posting my first review, our Dobie passed away and the staff was so sympathetic! I love all the doctors, technicians, and day camp staff. I couldn't live without this place! I have also recommended it to friends of ours that now take their dog and they love it too. The most important thing is that our pups are happy when they leave, the best testament!
