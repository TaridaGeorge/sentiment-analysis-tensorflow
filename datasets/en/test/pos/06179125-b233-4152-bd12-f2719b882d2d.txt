Outstanding coffee and incredibly sweet earth child barista (don't think I'm allowed to say "hippy chick").  And the first time I had their iced mocha (I think triple shot espresso) I exclaimed "wow, that's damn fine coffee".  Wish it wasn't 20 miles from my house!

They need to get a new couch or two in there.   But the coffee was so damn good I'd forgive them anything.
