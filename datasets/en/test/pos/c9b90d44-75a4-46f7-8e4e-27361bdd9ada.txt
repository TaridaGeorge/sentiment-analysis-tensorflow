I have to say I definitely love Ruth's Chris- one of the best meals I've ever had- from the silky lobster bisque, the sizzling melt in your mouth filet, to the super stud waiter Sean who was fabulous all night and then surprised me with the most luscious creme brulee. Mmmmm- I can definitely be seduced with this place- I think its named after me for a reason ;).
