Penzey's is a really cool place.  I would have never went if it hadn't of been for my friend, who happens to love cooking.  He took me along with him, and made me realize just how important good spices are.  And at Penzey's Spices, they have every spice known to man.  And they're all set out so that you can smell them before buying.  

The prices are really good, and the staff is super helpful, almost a little overly.  If you want to update your spice rack, this is the place to do it at.  It will cost you almost as much as it would at the grocery store, and you'll get higher quality spices than you would otherwise.
