I'm VERY happy with this small company's service, honesty, and promptness.  Highly recommended!

Half my power went out last night, including my AC.  Wet clothes in the washer and dryer too.  I spent a warm, restless night waiting for morning so I could call someone in to fix it.

Not realizing how early it was, I called at 6:45am (before office hours) this morning and the woman who answered was just waking up.  She was very kind and forgiving and had someone to my house at 9:30am.

Kevin quickly found the source of the problem and replaced a bad breaker at the pedestal outside.  By 10:30am I had my power back.  

Reasonable cost and very prompt service earned Efficient Electric 5-stars and my future business!
