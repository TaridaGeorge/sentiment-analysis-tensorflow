We were visiting Phoenix and found Lux on Yelp, and we were glad we did. Traveling with two kids isn't always easy, but Lux had many wonderful and tasty choices for all of us. The service was wonderful even though they were crowded both days we went. 
During both visits we had: coffee, hot chocolate, and fresh squeezed o.j. all were very tasty. As for food, butter croissant, cheese croissant, chocolate croissant ( see a pattern here?), coffee cake, quiche, savory Dutch pancake (amazing!), and biscuits with gravy. Each item was perfect, exactly as it should be.
Cannot recommend Lux enough.
