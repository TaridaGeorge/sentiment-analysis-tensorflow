Across the street from Postino, next-door to Churn - downtown's answer to ice cream after many years without (been talking about this forever!).  Saturday's happy hour included $5 draft pitchers of craft beers, including seasonals from across the country - this pleased me.  Happy hour had no food specials, but no real complaints there, honestly.  Loaded chips are seriously loaded with taste.  Chicken sandwich looked delicious, and I was happy to see a fresh made bun/roll that WASN'T egg washed - sheesh.

Tons of seating, in or out, or at the bar.  Hip music the entire visit, as with servers / staff.  Valet in the back, as with bike parking/racks.  This place says, "Phoenix *is* a food city.  Recognize us!".
