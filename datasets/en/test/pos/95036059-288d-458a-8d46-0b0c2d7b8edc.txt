Like many hidden gems, the Gyro House is tucked in a nondescript, pretty empty strip mall. Luckily I stumbled onto this place and it's become a favorite lunch spot.

My favorites are the gyros, which are made fat and fantastic. You can grab one with fries for under $7. They have a lot of Middle Eastern faves like falafel and baba ghanoush, or if you're in for a bigger meal there's the kebabs or shawerma.

Bottom line is you won't find a better gyro for the price, and the good food and friendly staff have me going back at least once a week.
