My favorite place for Mediterranean food in the Valley. I am going to miss this place now that I am in Seattle. My boyfriend got me hooked on Crazy Jims. Our favorite dish is the halibut salad. We are both vegetarians but we do eat fish and they have the best Halibut in AZ. You know what I mean if you ever tried finding good fish in AZ. Fish is not easily found in the desert. They have the absolute best house salad dressing. I don't know how they make it but it taste creamy and lemony at the same time. Their pitas are warm and fluffy and their hummus is delicious. It was always a treat to have dinner there. Good bye Crazy Jims!
