Mmmm.... Friday date night with my handsome man is something I look forward to every week. And it's always Pei Wei! I feel like it's inexpensive for the delicious foods we get. (2 Kung Pao Chickens, no rice, extra vegies, steamed chicken. Crab Wontons or Pork Egg Rolls. AND 2 lemonades!) We  have never had any issues, except for the busser girl eye humping my boyfriend ;) and they are always quick!
