I went here earlier in the week for lunch and had a fantastic pizza- "The Scientist".  First off, the crust was excellent- no soggy middle like the ones they serve at Pomo.  The toppings- dry cured capocollo, sopressata Salami, and one other type of meat, along with green olives really made his pizza special.

The staff was great as well.  Just from talking to them, they obviously take a lot of pride in their pizza.  

I definitely recommend this place if you are in the area.
