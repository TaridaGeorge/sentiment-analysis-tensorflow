I was reluctant to review a blood donation place, but then I saw Mark bragging about his 7 minute time, so I had to show him up:)  6 minutes here!!
This site really is a good place to donate, they staff is friendly and very attentive.  This was very helpful my first couple times donating when I nearly passed out.  I prefer these locations to the mobile ones.  Something about giving blood in an old cramped up greyhound looking bus just isn't very reassuring to me.
