In a city of sprawling suburbs, strip malls and chain everything, the Downtown Phoenix Market is a chance to meet local people who are putting their hearts, time and money into creating a community. 

What to expect: several produce vendors selling their wares grown locally using sustainable methods; small business owners selling breads and pastries, delicious salsas, canned goods, tabouli and hummus; artists and crafts people selling jewelry, aprons, bags, clothing and lots more. It is really a fantastic place.

In addition to their regular hours of 8-12 on Saturday morning, the market is now open on Wednesdays from 4-8pm and they will be expanding in 2008 into the building next to the lot where they are currently located. Check it out!
