Oh Yum, oh yum, ooohh yummm : )
I've never tasted better homecooked fried chicken at a restaurant. and chicken with waffles... umm, you're kidding! The cornbread was on point too. Actually, my only issue was how much calories dat meal was packing! Let's forget bout the big splodge of butter on top my waffle that i mistakenly dived into thinking it was vanilla icecream..
