Simple scrumptious. I love Cibo. I've been there for lunch a couple of time and the best thing is the dough. The sandwiches are so good. I recently went there for dinner. We sat outside and  there were plenty of heaters to keep you warm. It was nice because there was live music and the atmosphere was lovely. The pizza is my favorite. I think it's way better that Pizza Bianco. The selection is far greater, the staff is friendly and attentive and the atmosphere is welcoming. I love that the outside dining area is smoke-free. This is one of my favorite places to go. The crepes are amazing. We ordered the banana & nutella crepe and added strawberries on top. This is the kind of place where you can enjoy yourself and relax. You don't feel rushed to leave.
