Love love love me some Gelato Spot. We have a satellite location at my place of employment as well. Their flavors are undoubtedly the best I've had. The employees here are very pleasant. They keep the pans cleans and the displays are always neat. I used the Foresquare check in deal and even saved on my scoop which is an outstanding bonus! My son loves the bubblegum flavor while my favorite is tiramisu.
