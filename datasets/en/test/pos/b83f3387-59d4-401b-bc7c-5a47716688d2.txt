Love this place. Food is consistently delicious. They have great happy hour wine specials and a kick butt list. I dig that the servers all help each other, it makes for great service all the time. They also get to wear what they want which is awesome. It feels like the employees of MetroPark and the Buckle are serving me food. If they had more carb free items I'd eat here all the time.
