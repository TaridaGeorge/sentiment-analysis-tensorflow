Great location! Right near my office, we actually held a small meeting in there. Love the gelato and crunchy ice for my water (I like crunchy ice). The service was excellent and their pizza smelled wonderful (we didn't know they served lunch!).

Overall, I would definitely recommend to anyone who is in Downtown Scottsdale in need of a sweet treat.
