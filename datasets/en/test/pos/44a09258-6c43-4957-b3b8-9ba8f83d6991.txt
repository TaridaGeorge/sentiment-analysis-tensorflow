This is my FAVORITE Middle Eastern (or any other kind of  food) restaurant in town! I ADORE Byblos and go there every single year for my birthday.
The food is amazing and they have vegetarian dishes as well as beef, lamb and chicken dishes. My personal favorite is the keufta kache kache, along with felafel, tabouli salad and Middle Eastern tea. The desserts are lovely and decadent as well. Highly recommended- family owned and operated- lovely ambiance and great food!
