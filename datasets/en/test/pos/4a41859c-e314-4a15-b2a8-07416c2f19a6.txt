First off,  I went here during restaurant week.  Restaurant week is the greatest thing in the world because you get to eat at places like this for $30 a plate instead of the standard $50-$60.  That being said... this place is fantastic.  The meat is cooked perfectly, the french onion soup was great, and the creme brulee was the best I've ever had.  I've noted a few people say their meat was cooked improperly... I've never been one to send back food but at a steakhouse of this caliber, do so at anytime.  That being said.. please no wtf a medium rare steak looks like and what a medium well steak looks like.  

Will be back.... during the summer when they have essentially the same deal if you dine after 8pm... otherwise the bills around here tend to look like car payments.
