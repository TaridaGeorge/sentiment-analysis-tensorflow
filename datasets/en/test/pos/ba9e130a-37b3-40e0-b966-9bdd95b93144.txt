My wife and I were on a roadtrip. Got off the plane in Phoenix and rented a car to goto Sedona and Grand Canyons. It happened to be Sunday morning, we stopped at PCG and they were serving their brunch menu. It was one of the best brunch we've ever had. I had the stuffed french toast, my wife had some type of egg white omelet. The food and service was really good and they offered special drinks such as $3 mimosas. I highly recommend this place.
