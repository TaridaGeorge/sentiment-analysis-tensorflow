I have been a member at the Village since it opened in 2005...Wow, it doesn't feel that long ago!  I absolutely love the club!  But I must say I went for a deep tissue massage with Janet this weekend, and it had to be one of the best massages I have ever gotten.  I wish I could go once a week, but that is not in my budget!  If you are looking for an outstanding massage....go to The Village Club at DC Ranch Spa!
