Elis American Grille is hands down one of the best places in Scottsdale to hangout out for great drinks-outstanding food-& Greg-Tony-Paula the owners rock! They treat everybody thats walks in that door like family. Jeff the bartender is a firecracker of fun. Tricia Gregs daughter is a sweet heart. I would highly recommend Eli's..PLUS the Gourment sliders ROCK!
