Fantastic! I have eaten here twice now and honestly can't wait to go back. The flavors have been great both times and the servers are very willing to help with decisions or provide more details about anything. I really feel that you get a value for your money in both food and drinks. What I appreciated most though, is that both times the manager on duty came by and didn't just ask the usual 'how was everything?', but instead took a genuine interest in creating conversation about the experience and what bought us in. It was the effort that really gave everything 5 stars!
