Very delicious food! We are not vegans or even vegetarians, but we just love this place! We have been trying to eat healthy lately, and this place was just perfect for that. The consistency of the mock chicken dishes was almost perfect, and we weren't left with that sick, full feeling in our stomachs. Wish this place was closer to where we live!
