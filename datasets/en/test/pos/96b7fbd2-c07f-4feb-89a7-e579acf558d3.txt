Ice Cream Parlour.
This is one awesome place to get your old fashion Ice Cream. The place has been around since the 1940's. Has one long service counter. Decorations from years past. Comic Strips with the Sugar Bowl on the strips. Has everything; Cones, Sundaes, Fountain Drinks, Shakes, Malts and a bit of food too.
Must have the flavor of the month.
March is Peanut Butter Cup.... mmmm mmmm good.
Enjoy a Scoop or two today !
