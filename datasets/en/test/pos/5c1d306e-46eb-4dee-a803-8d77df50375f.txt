Pearl donated a dinner for 2 to a local nonprofit called Bent But Not Broken. My boyfriend and I went to dinner there and has an absolute blast! Our server was hilarious and really made the night (Nick). We had an awesome 3 hour dinner with tons of apps followed by sashimi and a few martinis. We had fun with the tables on either side of us and laughed a bunch. 
We are so grateful for Pearl's donation to this nonprofit! We wouldn't have tried as many things as we did had we not had the certificate. But now that we have we will definitely be going back!!! The atmosphere is a blast and the service is great! highly recommend.
