We went last night for my birthday and it was excellent! the hostess staff left a little to be desired, bunch of young girls at the front desk that don't impress, weak for a high end restaurant. Once inside the service was great and the food was outstanding. I had the bone in Fillet and it was AMAZING, my girlfriend had the Arctic Char and it was great, we split a side of saut√©ed mushrooms that were very good and huge quantity and the drinks and dessert were great.
