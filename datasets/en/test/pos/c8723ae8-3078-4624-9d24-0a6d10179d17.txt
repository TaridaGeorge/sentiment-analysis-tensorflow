One of the best kept secrets in Tempe I am told.  Had a wonderful time.  I only sat at the outdoor bar for drinks and appetizers, but I was quite pleased with the menu selection and service.  Perhaps one of the best caesar salads I have ever had as it is generous with the garlic.  Recommended for dates and romantic diners.
