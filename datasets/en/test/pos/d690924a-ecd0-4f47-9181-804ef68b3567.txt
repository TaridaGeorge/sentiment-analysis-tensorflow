We have had 4 deliveries now and couldn't be more pleased. Not only is the organic produce affordable but it is top quality. Every Tuesday when I awake my packages are waiting by my door. They are packaged with care and always on ice. Not only do I love the mixed produce box that arrive weekly but the baked to order bread, nest run eggs, fresh squeeze orange juice and local olive oil are all of amazing quality. I have participated in produce co-ops in the past but this is so much better! Give it a try, you will love it!
