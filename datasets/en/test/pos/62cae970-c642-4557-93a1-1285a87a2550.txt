this place is the truth they must be putting crack in their chicken.  The place is small so get there right when they open at 11 and youll be fine bring cash bc thats all they take who cares the food is amazing.  Sometimes i shed a tear on weekends that they are not open.  The owner remembers your order and they are pretty quick LOVE this place so much in fact today at 11 i will be there!!!
