I wish this place was closer to my house.  I love, love, love this gelato.  The creaminess and soft texture of this deliciousness is amazing.  I had the Grisbi, a lemon cookie gelato with little pieces of lemon cookies and the Choco Wafer, YUM, no DOUBLE YUM.   The best part, even for the small cup you can have 2 flavors.  That is the best.  What is up with other places only letting you get one flavor for a small cup.  Ok, stepping down from soap box.  I all be coming back with my twins, specially since my little boy is a gelato fan. Yay!
