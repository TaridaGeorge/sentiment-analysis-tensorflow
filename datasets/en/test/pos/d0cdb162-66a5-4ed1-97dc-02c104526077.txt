I work in the same dying business park as A.G.E. in Phoenix. Walked over said i need a new windshield, Curtis gave me a quote. Called them a week later best price in town next day FIVE STAR installation. no gimmicks, excellent service is what they do. 

I have had a few windshields replaced and this was by far the fastest, cleanest and top notch install. The last guy did not do a very good job replacing the molding on the windshield and i thought i wood have to buy new moldings. nope, dood was able to fit them in perfectly and looks excellent...

This company really is Auto Glass EXCELLENCE!!!
