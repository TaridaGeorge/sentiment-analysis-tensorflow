Chill spot!  Great vibe.  When the weather is nice out the patio is a really relaxing spot to have some drinks.  When it's cold they have heaters on the patio area.

Happy hour is good.  Drinks are stiff and taste great. 

Good place to grab some food and drinks before you hit the clubs in the area.  Good service.

the "Forget About Philly Cheesesteak" is delicious!
