I enjoy this little coffee shop right across the street from our house. My husband and I come here (almost daily) for our coffee fix. We like the seating, staff, El Salvador espresso and last but not least Steve! Steve Belt (owner) is such a great guy, very accommodating with our monthly PR meeting/group as well.

If you need a quick coffee fix or a place to work (free wifi), try this place! Quality service and drinks!
