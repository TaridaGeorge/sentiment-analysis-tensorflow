I took my car into Discover Hyundai for service and had the best experience.  I worked with Tim in the service department who was so helpful and determined to fix my vehicle. He kept me informed with what was going on with my car and had better communication than any car service advisor I've ever worked with. It was more like working with a friend. I will definitely be going back next time I need to take my car in.
