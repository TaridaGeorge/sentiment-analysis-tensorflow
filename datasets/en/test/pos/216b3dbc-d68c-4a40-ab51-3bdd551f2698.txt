My husband and I recently switched to a plant based diet and this place has made it possible!  I love how they organize the store and make it so convenient to find the foods that suit you.  I love the spice counter, veggie selection, vegan options, non-dairy selection is great, and they have their bars organized by vegan, gluten free, they have vegan chocolate bars that are delicious, and the staff is knowledgeable.  I could shop here daily, in fact some weeks I do. :-)
