Delightful service and some of the best Indian food in the entire state! All of this and charming ambience as well.  Definitely the best Indian place to take a date - and the courteous staff helps beginners make selections for a memorable and pleasurable experience.  I often recommend this restaurant.  The only con to list for this "jewel" - is it's location. While close enough to the action, it is tucked away and is certainly a hidden gem! Once you find it - you'll never forget it!
