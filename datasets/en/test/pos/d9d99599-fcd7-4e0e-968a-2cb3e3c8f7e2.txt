Forget McCormick & Schmick's , Fish Market... make this your Seafood destination instead... I guess one might be trepidatious in having seafood in an arid, land locked desert- but fret not- you're in for a treat- surely if they can put a hockey team in a desert- why not a stellar seafood restaurant...Go ahead put on that bib and try exotic presentations from Chilean bass to marlins to staples like a bucket of old fashioned Alaskan crab legs or surf and turf combos...Then catch a game with the Coyotes!
