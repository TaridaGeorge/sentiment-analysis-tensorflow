After searching 4 other nurseries for help identifying plants in my landscaping, with no luck, the staff at Whitfill's took one look at the photos on my camera and nailed three here-to-fore mystery plants.  And they had them in stock.  Very helpful and professional.   I have found my first stop for future landscaping needs.
