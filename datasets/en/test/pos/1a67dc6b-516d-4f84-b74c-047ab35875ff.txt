Go for the pizza, if nothing else (get the traditional, not a "Pizza the Hut" abomination covered in sausage and meat.).  Add a dry and fruity italian red like a chianti, brunello, dolcetto, or valipocella, and you might impress your data and find yourself as close to heaven on earth as it gets!  Absolutely the best pizza I've had on the west side.
