Yummy! I visited the Smashburger in Tempe for the first time last week, and it's delicious! Due to it's proximity to ASU, they offer a student discount which includes a classic smashburger, smashfries and a drink for $7.50. The classic smashburger comes with the regular crowd- lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, lettuce and tomatos. But this ain't your momma's burger, it's huge and delicious!! And the smashfries are made with rosemary and garlic and are completely addicting! If you're in the mood for a burger, but want to try something new, you have to check out Smashburger! They're popping up all over the valley- so chances are, there's one in your neighborhood.
