We really enjoyed our wine and appetizers on Timo's back patio. It was the night of the Sunnyslope Art Walk and they were slammed with people. After a reasonable wait, we had a very helpful server, great bottle of wine (Snapdragon Pinot Noir) and appetizers (try the warm fig and prosciutto - so good!). We will definitely be back to support this gem in our neighborhood...
