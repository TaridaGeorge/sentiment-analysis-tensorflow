My dear love and I went to the museum on a romantic date, and had such a lovely time. I hadnt been to the museum in years and it was a lot of fun to see some paintings I remembered from my childhood like the Frida Kahlo. They firefly room is utterly transporting as well. Frankly, I dont know if it was the art or my dear love that made the evening so wonderful, but we will go again soon. I strongly recommend a strolling date here. Wednesdays and maybe one other night are free. Oh and here's a tip-if you cant find a space, park across the street at the Viad Tower. Its free if you exit from the north side.
