Okay, as far a great produce and specialty foods and snack, Sprouts has Trader Joes beat.  This place is amazing.  The deli is home to the $2.99 sandwich.  The BEST sandwhich shop in Phoenix.   The best part of the widest selection of produce and snacks are the prices!  I am over the snobish Trader Joes crowd, their long lines.  This place has everything you need.
