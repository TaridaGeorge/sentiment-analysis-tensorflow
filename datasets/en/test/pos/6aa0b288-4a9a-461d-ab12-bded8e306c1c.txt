Oh Junkie, what can I say about a place that once hosted midget wrestling besides...I love you!  This is one of my favorite places just because it's not quite as snobby as Scottsdale locales can be.  There's three different bars which comes in handy when it gets busy, which it does often, and a few places with enough room to get your groove on if you feel so inclined.  Not to mention that they have a wheel you can spin with such options as "Body Shots" (I may or may not have had the wheel land on that one before...) or "Kiss a stranger".
