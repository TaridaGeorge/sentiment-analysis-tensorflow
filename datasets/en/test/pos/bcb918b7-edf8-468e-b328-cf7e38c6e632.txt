First I have to say I prefer Camelback to Piestawa.   You have to do some real climbing-not like the other one which is kind of like a almost paved path until the last few hundred feet.  Of course, I am one of those crazy people that likes to run as much as I can when going up Camelback.  The views are beautiful from wherever you are on the trail so if you don't make it to the top it is still well worth going at least part way up.  I wish the parking situation was better but you can't have everything.
