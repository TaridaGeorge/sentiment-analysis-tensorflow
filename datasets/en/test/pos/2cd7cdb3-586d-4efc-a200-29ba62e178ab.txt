I'm not a big chain restaurant type of gal, but this place is top notch not only in service, but as well as quality of food. The fillet mijon was tasty, perfectly cooked (medium), and still sizzling hot on my plate. We ordered mac and cheese, potatoes au gratin, and the asparagus for sides. Again, I cannot express the 5 star quality of food this place serves. To end our evening off, we ordered the chocolate lava cake. I'm don't have a sweet tooth whatsoever, but to see the hot chocolate oozing out of the middle of the cake with vanilla bean ice cream. WOW, my taste buds were in heaven. I will be coming back to this place sooner rather than later. Get the lava cake ready for me! This time I will make room to fit it all in my tummy.
