I had been going to the same dentist since I was a kid, and when he retired, I found Harris Dental from the Phoenix Magazine Top Doctors list. I've been twice now - I love the staff, that I can watch whatever TV I want when I'm there, and Dr. Harris helped me get donations of toothbrushes & toothpaste during the holidays for a holiday giving project for children in need I worked on! Need I say more?!
