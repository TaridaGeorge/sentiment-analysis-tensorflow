If Tumblr was a place, it would be The Lost Leaf. 

Their beer selection is magical. I saw a guy double-fisting Sam Smith's Oatmeal Stout last time I was there. I also like that they carry a couple different Nimbus brews. They also have PBR just in case you want to see how much you can drink before the Kongos start playing. I can't decide whether or not I like their Dia de los Muertos exhibit. Lastly, the bartenders are all very friendly, even if you don't have a sweet mustache.
