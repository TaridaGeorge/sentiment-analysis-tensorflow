I love me some Italian food and this place didn't disappoint!  When we got there we were told it would be about a 20 minute wait, but we only ended up waiting about 5 minutes.  The server was very friendly and made several reccommendations which ended up being great.  I had the Big 'Ol Ravioli which was AMAZING!  It really is huge so I ate about half and then brought the rest home and had that for dinner the next day.  The leftovers were still great!  I'll definitely be going back!  I'll just try to make sure I go to the gym beforehand so I don't feel guilty about clearing my plate...
