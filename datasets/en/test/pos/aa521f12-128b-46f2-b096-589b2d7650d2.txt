I finally ate lunch here after hearing my wife's rave reviews for years. 

It turns out that there was a recent ownership change, but my wife assured me that the menu has remained the same. The new owners greeted us warmly and we very friendly.

The food was fresh and amazing and the service was great. Recommended!
