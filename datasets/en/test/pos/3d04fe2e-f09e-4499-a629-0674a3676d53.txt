I really love Thomas Cleaners & Tailors.  I recently dropped off several items for tailoring, pressing and dry cleaning for my wedding and they did a fantastic job!  They turn items around quickly and are extremely friendly.  They did such a great job that I took all the items back after the wedding, including my wedding gown.  I will continue to go to Thomas Cleaners and highly recommend them to anyone that is looking for a solid place that you can count on time after time.
