I know this is an oldie but such a goodie!!
From the salads, sandwiches, pastries to pizza. The music is loud, the parking sucks but La Grande Orange has created its own buzz that I enjoy. It has created kind of a bohemian atmosphere with the tribal sounds of brazillian music! Sundays after a climb on camelback make for a great brunch/lunch dealio.
Every time I get a take-out salad from LGO - people always ask me where I got it from. They now have curb-side service so you dont have to aggrivate yourself for a parking spot - YAY!!
