Owner " Jay" Was very flexible with my schedule . Came out to my place and all I can say is.....things I didn't think would come out of the carpets did. Looks brand new....no longer smells of dog pee! I will be using this guy again....I will be telling everyone I know about his services. Price was great and a great guarantee!
