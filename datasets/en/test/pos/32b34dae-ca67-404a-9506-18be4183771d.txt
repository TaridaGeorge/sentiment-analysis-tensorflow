Total Wine is one of the best beverage shops I've ever visited. The prices are reasonable; however, it is the staff that makes the difference. I'm come home with fantastic (and reasonably priced) Irish Whiskey, Potato Vodka's and Scotch as well as wine based solely on recommendations of the staff. They never try to up-sell, but spend the time listening to what you like before they make recommendations.
