I actually finally signed up on yelp just to review this place.  Probably the easiest and best haircut I've had in recent memory.

Adrian took care of me.  Great guy, listened to what I wanted and suggested some other things that I would never have thought of.  Easy, enjoyable, and got a great cut.

It is a bit pricey, but you could pay 20 at some cookie cutter place and get half the experience.
