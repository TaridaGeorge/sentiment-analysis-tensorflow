A few months ago I was side-swiped sitting at a red light and my driver side mirror was snapped-off by a very impatient driver. I went in to Sterling on a Tuesday morning a few weeks ago with a replacement mirror I bought on-line and was out in little over an hour, and not as light in the wallet as I expected. Professional and timely service for such a busy shop. Rates are right in line with other shops in the area.  If I ever need any further body work, I will definitely go back.
