My wife and I met our two friends for at Maizie's for a Sunday brunch.  We were happy to see they were open right at 10AM.  We sat at a table on the outside patio with a covered umbrella which was perfect for a late November morning.  The service was friendly, and the prices were quite reasonable especially the $3 mimosas.  The portions were large, and the quality was excellent.  Everyone was quite pleased with their meals.  We were all over stuffed.  I particularly recommend the breakfast pizza --  delicious!  As an added bonus, they offered the locally made Madison's hot sauce which is an incredible rarity.  It also looks like they have a nice wine bar inside, but we will definitely be back for a future brunch.
