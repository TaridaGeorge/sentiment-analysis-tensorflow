Love Justina...!  She's got a great attitude to accommodate any type of customer.  

Small joint but some of the freshest and tastiest Vietnamese around.  The lemongrass chicken, green beans, and any of the pho (Vietnamese soups) are Awesome!  

Try the Vietnamese coffee for a treat.

UPDATE:  Cyclo is closed on Sundays and Mondays

Watch out for the busy lunch crowd... To get a seat I try to get there as close to 11am as possible.

This is one of my favorite valley restaurants.
