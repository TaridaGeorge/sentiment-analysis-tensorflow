Very good pizza. Every bit as good as the overhyped Pizzaria Bianco,and no 3 hour wait. 
Had a very good mushroom and pancetta pizza and a strawberry and gorgonzola salad. Both were top notch. Wine list is reasonably priced, good selection. Friendly staff. Anyone picking on their decor is really a bit off, nothing wrong with a simple decor. Warm, inviting. Nice bar that opens to the patio. 
Really all in all a very good experience. Good food, good wine, happy staff, reasonably priced. And I would have to say underated, so even though I think they are a very solid 4 star restaurant, I am giving them 5 stars to help get there ratings up. I'll be back.
