This is definitely the best place yet for home fitness equipment. Fitness 4 Home Superstores has stores in Tempe and Scottsdale. Bob Lachniet, the owner of Fitness 4 Home Superstores - has done something I have yet to see in other stores. Most other places I've visited, are focused on making the sale - and pushing product through their doors. WIth Bob and his staff,  they make sure you get exactly what you need - and they keep it within your budget!  The service I've received from his staff should act as the benchmark for what any store should provide a customer.
