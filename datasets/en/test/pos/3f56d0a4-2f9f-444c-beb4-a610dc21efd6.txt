what a cool bar!!!  Even if you are not a smoker, you have to enjoy your drinks on their patio at the back of the bar.  Its so romantic with the vines, trees and lights!   Not to worry because if you pick the corner tables, nobody is blowing smoke in your face!  The appetizers are de-licious (my faves are the Southwest Chipotle Rolls and Onions Rings) and they have the most amazing Long Island Ice Tea.  Its very smooth - not strong at all.  Don't forget to try their Sex Wax drink - Unbelievable!
