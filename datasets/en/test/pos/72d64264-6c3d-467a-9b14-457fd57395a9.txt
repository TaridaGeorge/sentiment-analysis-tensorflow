I attended my first class at Yoga Den this evening with a wonderful instructor named Piper.  The studio just opened their doors this past Saturday and currently offers a few classes per day.  It's a welcomed (and much needed) addition to our downtown area and I'm looking forward to exploring the other classes they have to offer.  It's a small space, but has a nice energy and the owners are incredibly friendly.
