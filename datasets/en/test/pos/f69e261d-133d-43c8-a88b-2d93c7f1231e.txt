The first time I visited Sprouts nearly three years ago, I felt like home. We live right inbetween Fry's, Safeway, Trader Joe's and Sprouts, but if I can possibly find something at Sprouts, it's my first pick. 

Over time, we've developed a nice relationship with most of the tellers. The prices on produce and meat are pretty terrific, and the beer selection improved considerably about two years ago. It's not a great place for wine, and I have to visit more popular supermarkets like Fry's for liquor and, say, tin foil. I guess you can't have everything, but what Sprouts does, they do well.

And yeah, like ashley d. said below, $2.99 deli sandwiches. I don't think that pricing exists anywhere anymore. GOOOOO SPROUTS!

(Also, say hello to Stephanie...she's my daughter's favorite cashier.)
