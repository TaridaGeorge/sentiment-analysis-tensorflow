My staff and I visit Planet Sub every Tuesday for Turkey Tuesday. $2.50 Turkey subs. Great bread being made in the restaurant. Mom and daughter owned restaurant. Very friendly. You have to tell them if you want you sub cold or it will come hot to you. They make the sub in the back of the kitchen so its not like subway, port of subs, etc.... The meat is not processed tasting and the bread is not frozen and then baked. It's fresh and baked same day. FANTASTIC!!! 

They deliver the subs to you. Affordable, nice environment and fast for someone who has one hour for lunch. 

They also have a punch card. Wednesday is double punch day.
