I love steak.

My family and I go to Outback frequently, and most often we go to this location.  The food is great, it's affordable, and it's close to my house.

Unfortunately I can't remember her name, but there is one waitress who has happened to have our table several times.  The second time was months after the first, and yet she remembered us...down to our individual orders!  The manager Amanda was very helpful the one time we had a small problem (the salmon was a little underdone in the center) and went out of her way to take care of us.  There are a couple of other servers who haven't left an impression one way or the other, but I have had no negative experiences.  I have no doubt we'll continue to choose this location when my parents are in town!
