They automatically get 5 stars for having Abita beer on tap!!!!  Bruschetta is amazing, and the butternut soup is delicious.  All the food I've had is great, the happy hour is amazing, and I want to live on the patio here.  Highly recommended - organized a large happy hour here and they were right on top of the reservation and the service.
