It does not get much better. 

First, Eddie actually cooks and you can watch him from one of the seating areas.

Second, there is nothing on that menu that is not tasty, falvored, and just plain yummy. 

Third, the staff, the servers (Lori) and others are as  pleasant as can be. They make sure things are good and do it in a way to not intrude.

Excellent Lemon Drop. Excellent Cream Bruella and Excellennt Cafe Lattes.

I had the Wonton Seafood for starters, members of the party Sea Bass, Meatloaf, and Seared Ahi Tuna. Amazing flavors and just a must visit.

Gonnabe back!
