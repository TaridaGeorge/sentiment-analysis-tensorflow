I've been coming here for years with my family.  

The bean dip they serve with the chips and salsa is awesome!  So yummy!

I usually get a bean tostada or a bean burrito with queso fundido sauce.  

I recommend giving this place a try.  Definitely try the bean dip and queso fundido sauce.  So worth it!
