Mariee Bridal is an absolute gold mine when it comes to bridal fashion and impeccable customer service!  I had some bad experiences when searching for my wedding dress and was bullied and almost forced into buying a dress that I didn't want.  James and Carrie are customer service at its finest and have made all of my wedding dress dreams come true!  Thank you so much for allowing me to come in and take my time in my decision making process.  You all truly understand the beauty of the process and are not out to just sell a dress!
