I owned a landscape company for years here in the Valley. Have been going to Bakers for approx. 10 years. Since I owned a landscape company and had access to all the wholesale nurseries I only went Bakers when I needed something special. But when it comes to special they are without a doubt the place to call. I've known the Baker Sisters for years as well as their Dad. No finer people exist. 
I was the Chair of my neighborhood Association. We went into Bakers and asked if they would support our neighborhoods beautiful house program. We give away a gift certificate each month to the house chosen as the house of the month. Bakers was more than happy to give us a $25 certificate each month. So they also support the community. A great sign of a local neighborhood business.
