This is the largest of the six national forests in Arizona, and it is spectacular.  It is close  to Phoenix and offers great desert and mountain hikes.  Some of the hiking trails are also approved for equestrian use, and in addition to seeing amazing mountains and cacti, sometimes you can see some pretty horses.  That said, it is never too crowded.  Of course, go in the fall, spring, or winter - not the summer.. it gets hot!

Well deserving of five stars!
