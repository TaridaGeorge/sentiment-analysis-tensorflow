Had dinner at Fresh Mint last night.  We ordered a delicious green salad, eggplant curry & pad thai.  

The salad had a very light and flavorful citrus dressing, walnuts, cranberries, apples, etc...   I wish the portion was a little larger for $9, but it was very tasty.  

The pad thai had nice fresh veggies and was very good, but the curry was much better.  It was a little spicy, which I like, and was very flavorful.  It wasn't a coconut milk curry (or had very little) so it was a little different from most Thai green curries I've had, but I loved it. 

I definitely would go back to Fresh Mint.  The food was great and I like supporting family owned/operated restaurants, which are scarce in north Scottsdale!!
