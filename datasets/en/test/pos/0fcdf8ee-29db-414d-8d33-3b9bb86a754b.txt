I've been enjoying visits to City Hall since Mark Drinkwater was a regular; he bought me chocolate covered strawberries once when he was plowed.  The name may have changed, but the fun times and excellent Belvedere Martinis have not - so I keep coming back!

I've celebrated 3 birthdays here, multiple break-ups, a new job, and several bonuses.  It's the place I discovered that rare plus was the best way to order a filet and the exquisite joy of sugar snap peas done right.   I've come here in shorts and I've come here in an evening gown. Either way, I'm always treated like an important customer and they've never gotten my martini wrong.  What more do you need to know?
