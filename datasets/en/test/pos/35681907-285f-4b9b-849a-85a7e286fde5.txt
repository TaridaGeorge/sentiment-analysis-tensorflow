I love this place- It's not pretentious what-so-ever, the Ice Tea is good and has free re-fills, the Coffee is nice, the people that work there are cool/ friendly/ cute... and the bathroom sink is really cool also, if that helps anyone... You actually don't mind washing your hands, what a concept. The pastries are really good, but I wish they had more of a selection of Apple filled croissants in the afternoon, although the cupcakes look good, but as Frank Zappa said- "Some people prefer cupcakes. I, for one, care less for them." 

Yeah, it's also a converted gas station, but aesthetics aside, this place is a great chill out spot for my Sunday ritual of actually relaxing from the work week. Check out the community board as well, it's nice to see what's going on around the Melrose/ Coronado/ Downtown community.

Enjoy
