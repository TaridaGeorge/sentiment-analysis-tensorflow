I had lunch at The House at Secret Garden during their opening week. The atmosphere was comfortable and the patio was so pretty. Despite the fact that there was a large group just ahead of us, the service was seemless, and our order came out quickly. The food was delish! I wasn't sure at first about the beet salad, but it came highly recommended, to my surprise it was a perfect combination of sweet and savory topped with a honey based dressing and fresh goat cheese. We also ordered polenta fries because they came with aoli, which was awesome. Then we finished with puddin' and pie for dessert, yum! 
After the first visit, my husband and I are talking about having our anniversary party there.
