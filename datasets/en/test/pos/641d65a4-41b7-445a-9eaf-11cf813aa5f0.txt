Very randomly ended up at Tuck Shop and so happy I did.  They have some great drink special ALL night long, not just happy hour times - made a mean Dark N Stormy.... yummy!

Its just the cutest, classiest, coziest, most welcoming establishment.  Makes you feel like you could spend hours upon hours there.  Our waiter/bartender was fantastic and I wish I caught his name.  The bar was full so we sat in the 'reading room' .... couches and chairs sectioned off from the bar and restaurant by bookshelves.  

Although we were not there to eat, the entire place smelled SO GOOD and the food looked wonderful.  I can't wait to go back there for dinner!
