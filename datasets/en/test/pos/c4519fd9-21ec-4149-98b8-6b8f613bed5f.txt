Wow. We went here on Christmas Eve w/ a group of friends. The happy hour prices here are awe-some, and the drinks are super tasty.

Love the tiki-chic ambiance and the patio is killer. Our waitress was probably the most attentive waitress weve ever had, she was awesome.

Cant wait to go back for another happy hour and some food!
