I like this store a lot!  It has a good selection of dvds and music in stock and if it's not in, it generally can be special ordered.  Rather interesting shirts can be had there it seems.  The incense smells wonderful, I might add.

The staff is the other bonus.  I don't recall ever having bad service there.  The staff is usually rather nice.  My last visit was over the top with first rate customer service and fun conversations.  

Before a few days ago it would have gotten a 4 star rating but my last experience was so good, I felt the need to add that 5th star.
