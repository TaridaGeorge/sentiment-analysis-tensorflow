The Cracker Barrel is the equivalent to a trip to heaven. The downside is that once you leave the place you miss it. The food is fabulous all the time. At the Casa Grande location I ordered my dinner which consisted of a lemonade, lemon pepper grilled rainbow trout with pinto beans, country green beans and mashed potatoes with dark gravy. Even though the trout is not a type of fish with a strong flavor, I still enjoyed the plate very much. The seasoning was good and it was well balanced. I should point out that this place really deserves 5 stars and not 3 just like at this point in time (Sep 2012). Hail to the Cracker Barrel!
