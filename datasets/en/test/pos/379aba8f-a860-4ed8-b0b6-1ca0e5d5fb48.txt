We adopted a dog form here to be friends with our other dog and they let us take out dog and kids to the center to see how they acted around each other.  We adopted the dog and we loved him but it didn't work out, they were very kind and let us bring him back and were were aloud to look at other dogs there.  This is a great place and there should be more places like this, they are treating the animals very good here.
