Actually, in response to the previous poster, let me begin by saying that it is indeed in a pretty ghetto strip mall.

However, coming from Chicago, this pales in comparison to the neighborhoods I have seen.  Actually, this is THE place to go in the "hood" for cheap drinks.  The crowd is quite mixed, and the bartenders are all quite friendly.  They pour a REALLY strong drink, and will call ya a cab if you need one.  I suggest that if you live in the immediate area, consider stopping in and see what a REAL dive bar is like.  New Times checked it out once as well:

My wife and I go there for the cheap booze, good companionship, and NO attitude from the bartenders like ya might get at other unnamed local estabishments.
