This place is an absolute gem.  An explanation of the food just doesnt do this place justice.  I am currently on my 10th different pasty (Just tried the Pilgrim) and I haven't been disappointed in one yet.  

There is a great vegetarian menu as well.  I haven't ventured into this area of the menu yet, but all of those choices look just as delicious.  

Every time I try a different pasty, it becomes my new favorite.  I'm sure you will feel the same way.

Dont pass up the $3 Irish Car Bombs!  Its so good when it hits your lips.
