What a find in the phoenix area! I was on the hunt for some lamb meat and found my self at Von hansons walking out with a bag full of goodies. Every thing was delicious. The beer brats, fresh beef jerky, the seasoned steak, ground lamb and kielbasi. Yeah I went kind of crazy. They even bake their own rolls which were really good too! The staff was super knowledgeable and friendly as well. They even have pet food products :)
