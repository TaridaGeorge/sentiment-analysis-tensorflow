We absolutely love this place! Not for the health food crowd, but definitely for people who do not mind pounded, fried meat and giant beer. They rotate between 4-5 soups and each are delicious and come with every dinner or you can opt to get a German salad for about $2.00 more.  It is impossible to leave this place still feeling hungry.
