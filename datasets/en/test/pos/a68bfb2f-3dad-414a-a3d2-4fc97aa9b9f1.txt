I know how to sew...rarely do I require the service of a tailor, except when it comes to hemming jeans.  When you have spent $$$ on a great pair of jeans, the last thing you want to do is walk around on your cuffs or lose the great stitching on your hems.  Mr. Wong removes the original jean hem, shortens your pants, and then reattaches the original hem so as not to loose the cool stitching.   The beauty of his technique is that the new hem does not flip up.  It lies flat and is almost impossible to tell that your designer jeans have been shortened.  And he is very affordable!   

So, when I don't feel like pulling out my old trusty Singer, I run over to Mr. Wong.
