Seriously people! This place is freakin ridiculous. My new favorite restaurant for sure! I can't even suggest one thing because EVERYTHING is to die for. My husband and I went here for Arizona restaurant week so we were able to try two apps, two entrees (with two side each) and two desserts. Not one thing was less than perfect!
