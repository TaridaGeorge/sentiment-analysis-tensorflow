I absolutely love this coffee shop.  The coffee is among the best and the pastries are all made in the back of the shop and are scrumptious! I'd love it if the chairs were more comfortable, but the rest of the atmosphere  makes up for it!
The baristas are all wonderful and are always smiling (another post said the contrary, but it takes a smile to get one)!
I also appreciate the hours of the coffee shop---I can stop on the way to work and read there in the evening until late (sometimes I go twice in one day!)  I also love getting a sandwich at Pane Bianco next door and a soy chai from Lux to go with it!

Among the best in Phoenix--keep it up!
