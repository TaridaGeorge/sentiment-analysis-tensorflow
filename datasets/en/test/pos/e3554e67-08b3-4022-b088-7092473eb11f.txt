I stopped eating hot dogs years ago...too scary, too salty, too mysterious.  But all that changed with my first exposure to Short Leash Hot Dogs.  I am not an overboard foodie who likes bleu cheese on a hot dog.  I am a purist.  Call me old-fashioned, call me a traditionalist, but I like my hot dogs BASIC.  Mustard only.  I love that they don't give me a sad look when I order, they just deliver a great dog that fills the length of the superb nan bread.  Perfectly prepared, no mustard drips on my lap!  
Childhood is a state of mind and when I take a Short Leash bite, I'm zapped back to ball games with my dad, summer days at the pool, memories of the real thing!  
As good as it gets!  Phoenix is so lucky to have them!
