I would definitely not classify The Little Woody as a dive bar... what has replaced the former dive Great Escape is a very cozy drinking bar with a casual vibe. This is definitely the kind of place you could disappear for a few hours, or say an afternoon, and not know whether the sun is up or down as you stumble out the door and back into reality.

BOTTOM LINE: I've got a bar stool here. Already.
