I love Loehmann's
Especially this particular location of Loehmann's

Here are my reasons:
1.  It's organized and clean.  Unlike Last Chance, Ross, Nordstrom Rack... which all give me a headache within 5 minutes, this store is like a normal department store, just cheaper.
2.  Everytime I go, its empty, like I have the store to myself
3.  Great deals

I recently went to Loehmann's in San Fran, and the same day I went to Nordstroms semi annual sale.  I saw at least 4 items at Nordstroms on sale, that I had seen at Loehmann's earlier that day for even cheaper!

I've also gotten Diesel jeans for 50$ from here... Betsey Johnson purses.... I love me some Loehmann's

Oh, and boys, their men's section is like a foot wide, so you may wanna skip this.
