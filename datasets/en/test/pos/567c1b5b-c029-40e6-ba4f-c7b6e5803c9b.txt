Best chocolate ever!  I tried Leonidas for the first time in Europe and have been looking for it ever since in AZ.  I'm so surprised they opened a store here, would recommend it in a heartbeat.  Also, staff was very friendly, a great place to get gifts!  I just got an assortment of chocolates and was very happy with my choices. The banana creme was surprisingly good and so was the champagne flavored...
