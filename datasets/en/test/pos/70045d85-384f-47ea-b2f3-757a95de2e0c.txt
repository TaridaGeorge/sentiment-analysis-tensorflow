Serious mochi craving that wasn't quenched at AJ's, so, off to TJ's!  They have an amazing produce section, with imported fruits you may not find at your regular grocery store.  Cheeses from everywhere!
I like the white cheese puffs, TJ's brand, to snack on.  I also like that they have cookies from everywhere.  I had a butter cookie craving along with the mochi craving and found everything here.
Hummus?  Arik would be happy to know there are several flavors to choose from.
It smells like Nag Champa.  Hippies man the cash registers.  Paper bags!  My cat loves playing in them.
Many organic products to choose from, too.
I feel good when I shop here.
