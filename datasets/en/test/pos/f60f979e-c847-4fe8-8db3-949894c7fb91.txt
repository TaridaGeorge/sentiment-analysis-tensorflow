Opening night!  The food was fantastic.  Same great pastries and coffee/teas as Lux. But now with wine and food.  Had a great time.  Ambiance is fantastic.  There are two work/study areas and a large dining area.  Service was great.  Good selection of beers and wines.  Great addition to the coffee shop.  Extended hours - so for all you night owls it's fantastic.  Hope to spend more time here!
