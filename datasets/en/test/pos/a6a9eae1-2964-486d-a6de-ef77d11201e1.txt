Every time I come here the night seems to end with a good story to tell! We always sit in the bar area, order some wine and sometimes a salad (LOVE the Spicy Mambo Salad) and make up stories about the people around us. 

To say I enjoy the people watching here is an understatement :)  The servers are great and sometimes give us clues about the other patrons. Everyone around us seems to be having fun and the place just has a good vibe.  It's a friendly crowd too, we always seem to strike up a conversation with someone and make a new acquaintance.  It's pretty dressy and I enjoy getting dressed to the nines once in a while, and this place is worth it.  Don't miss the pretzel bread - yum!
