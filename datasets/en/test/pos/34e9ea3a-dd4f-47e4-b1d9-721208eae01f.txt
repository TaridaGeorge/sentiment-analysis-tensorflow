We knew that Viet Kitchen was good even before we ate the food; the aromas are wonderful! Once we had the food, it only confirmed what we suspected . . . .this place is terrific. It is now one of our favor ties in Phoenix. 

Hong is very nice, she is helpful in choosing a dish, she explains what the dish is, and the fresh ingredients that go into making it, etc. 

If you are lucky enough to have leftovers when done (the food is so good it is difficult to stop eating it), it makes a great meal the next day! 

The soups are Spring Rolls are sooooooo good! The food is better than any of this variety that I have had growing up in Chicago. 

This place is A+++
