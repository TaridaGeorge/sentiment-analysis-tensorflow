I've been coming to this restaurant since I was a little kid - the best breakfast in town, hands down! The service is great (the Stepford-esque waitress thing is a bit odd, but whatever) and the food is always fresh and consistent. This place is packed on the weekends, so be prepared to wait. The best time to go is early on a Sunday morning before the church crowd arrives.

Try: Everything! My favorite is the Eggs Benedict, but the pancakes also rock.
