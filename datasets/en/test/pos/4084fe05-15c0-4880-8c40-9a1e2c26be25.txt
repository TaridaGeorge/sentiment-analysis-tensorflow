I like PHX airport for many reasons:

1) It's clean and pretty
2) It's easy to navigate
3) Free-Wi-Fi!
4) Lots of shops and food places
5) Nicer than LAX

Here are some not as nice things:

1) You walk forever!  Luckily there are moving walkways!
2) Picking up someone can be confusing bc their is a north and south curb, you must communicate or you will be confused!

And ps: PHX get a Pinkberry in the airport! It will do wonders.
