I totally agree with Rand H.  WOW, the best buffet in AZ.  I went to the Sunday Brunch event with my family.  The service was first class.  I did not find 1 item that did not taste good.  Asian food, Mexican food, Italian food, and American fare was ALL good.   Desserts were so good.  Too bad it was to early in day, I could not try a bite of everything.
