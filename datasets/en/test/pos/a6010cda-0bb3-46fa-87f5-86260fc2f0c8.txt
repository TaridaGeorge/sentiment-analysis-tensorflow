Great place for a New Orleans style feast.  The restaurant is easy to get to; in a great location; beautiful patio; and has a great atmosphere. I went on a Tuesday night at 7:30pm and there was no waiting.  The service was great and the food was excellent.  I ordered the blackened catfish covered with shrimp and crab in a cream/creole sauce.  It could have been a bit more blackened and spicy.  The house salad was good and the gumbo was excellent...just spicy enough for a good kick.  They serve a full loaf of French bread with warm, whipped butter.  There could have been more beer selections.  I may go every night while I'm in town here for 3 days.  MMMMMmmmmm.....GOOD!!
