I am a Mojo whore. They won me over with their delicious frozen yogurt, the unlimited access to sample cups, their fresh ripe fruit, their rotating flavors, their fantastic interaction with customers on Twitter, & their wonderful service in person. It's like they force me to come here. Clever move this making the customer happy.

I love going on Twitter Tuesdays when they tweet a secret word which gives you half off whatever you get. 

The employees are warm & friendly. Once when I had a problem with my debit card not working the guy just gave me the yogurt. He said he knew I was a regular good customer. Seriously? I am always surprised these days when businesses actually know who you are & appreciate you.

Damn this review, now I want to go get some Mojo today...such a whore.
