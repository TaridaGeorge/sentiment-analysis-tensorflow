Off The Grid Fitness is awesome!  I've been enjoying working out here for a few months now and would highly recommend checking it out if you are looking to join a fun and affordable gym in the valley (it's green too!).  I started taking the TRX classes through a Living Social deal and loved it so much I decided to become a member.  There are a variety of other classes offered, in addition to TRX, and the general workout space and equipment are top notch too.  Eric and the other instructors are always friendly, enthusiastic, and there to help you reach your goals.
