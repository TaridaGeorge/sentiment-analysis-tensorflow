I had an amazing time here! 

It was like a museum with all the animals around, a little scary but amazing. 

There were tons of different departments to search through whether it's fishing, hunting, camping, bow hunting, etc. 

This was my first and definitely not my last visit to Cabela's. 

The cafe was delicious!! I had the Bison bratwurst with fries. I was worried it would be too gamey but it wasn't and the fries were the best I had by far!! I will be back for more and soon.
