I love the new PAM! Every time I visit I am reminded of what a cool Museum this is. I am so pleased with the remodel completed recently, and am proud of Phoenix for such a cool space. We went most recently to see a lecture by Andres Serrano who was brought to Phx by Eric Fischl. The talk was fun, and inspiring! I also go here on occasion to see Nearly Naked Theater which calls a theater here home.
