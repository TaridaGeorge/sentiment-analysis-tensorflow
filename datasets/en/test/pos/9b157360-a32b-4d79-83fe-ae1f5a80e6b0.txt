Wonderful service! These restaurants seem to be known for that. Our server was fantastic!

Loved the French Dip here (as always!). Theirs is the best I have had! We all ordered it at our table except for one person ordered the veggie burger, and he is still talking about it a week later. Yummy brownie dessert as well!
