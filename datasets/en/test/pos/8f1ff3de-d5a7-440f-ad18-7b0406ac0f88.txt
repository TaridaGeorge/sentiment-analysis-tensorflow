The grand coffee shop litmus test is this:  how well can the joint brew a basic cup of joe? 
I went to Copper Star seeking reprieve from the mean little cups of hotel coffee I'd been forced to ingest during weeks of travel and found my new safe haven!  
The basic brew is fresh, good, solid coffee.  I also found they also rock americanos and cappuccinos.   

The baked goods look unpolished, but taste good.  I think the cupcakes are in desperate need of more icing and the sandwich I tried was sort of * meh *.  

Place is situated in a renovated old-time gas station and has a down to earth kind of luxury feel w/ plush sofas, and stolid wooden tables for lots of workspace.  Provocative, hippyish local art.   FREE blues band rocks out there every Sunday.  Baristas are sweethearts and they don't dawdle.    I bless you.
