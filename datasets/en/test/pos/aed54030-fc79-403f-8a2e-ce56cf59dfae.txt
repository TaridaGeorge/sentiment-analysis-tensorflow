I mostly use Walgreens to fill my prescriptions, but occasionally pick up odds and ends here as well.  Pharmacy is great.  All the staff are very curious and helpful.  If you need your prescription right away, they can usually oblige, and have them ready in about 20 to 30 minutes or so. The Pharmacists are very knowledgeable and make sure you understand your medications before you leave.
