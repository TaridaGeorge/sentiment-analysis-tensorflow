Wow, I was so impressed with this well run business. Burger and fries with chili are exactly what I needed. I could have used a tad more chili, but hey... that's just me... don't let that stop you. The burger was not a gross chewy cheap pice of burger, it was lean, flavorful and well cooked. The chili was thick and the extra sharp cheddar and raw red onion made it a big hit. It was just what I ordered. The owner and staff are friendly, attentive, accommodating and will go out of their way to make sure you get your burger your way.

Go try it and ask for everything just the way you want it.

High Fives!
