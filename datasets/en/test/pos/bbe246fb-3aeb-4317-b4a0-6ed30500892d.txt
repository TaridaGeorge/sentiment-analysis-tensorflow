Ottos pizza is so good!  The price is pretty low and the slices are massive.  I love that they serve fresh garlic and not a paste.    Overall The pizza is amazing, the sandwiches are just so-so.  But if you are looking for great pizza than this is the place to go.

Where else can you get 2 huge slices of pizza with 2 toppings and a drink for under 6 bucks?
