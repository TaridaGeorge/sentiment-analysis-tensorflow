I have nothing bad to say about this place. Absolutely nothing. Went here for my birthday yesterday afternoon with my family. Based on the location I was unsure of what it would look like, but it was just beautiful. They seated us in a quiet cozy corner in the back of the restaurant. Started off with the Golden Polenta Fries which were AMAZING. They came out piping hot and cutely displayed. The spicy aioli sauce paired perfectly with it! Extremely tasty. I ordered the grilled chicken salad, which was also displayed very nicely. Dates, goat cheese, nuts...a great mixture of flavors. The service was very friendly and polite. It was really a treat on such a lovely day in Phoenix. Would love to go back again and try some of the other items. Truly a gem of a restaurant in South Phoenix.
