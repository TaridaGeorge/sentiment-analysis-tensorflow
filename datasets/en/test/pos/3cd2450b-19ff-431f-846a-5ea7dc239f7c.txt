This is one of my staple restaurants that consistently provides great service and great food. They have many items on the menu including delicious chicken wings, salads, multiple pizza options (including gluten-free pizzas) and one of the best burgers in town. 

The place offers a great casual neighborhood vibe and is also wonderful for kids. Try a scoop of the house-made pistachio gelato after dinner - DELICIOUS!
