Awesome selection of goodies from all over the whole vide yerld! I found things here that I searched for vainly in traditional supermarkets, but to no avail.

Here's the stuff I walked away with that has enriched my home cooking:

Thai - Red Curry Paste, palm sugar, tamarind paste
Japanese - Abalone-flavored udon, soba noodles
Indian - Tahini, frozen paratha flatbreads

I'm intrigued by the Caribbean section, as I want to explore all of the nuances of jerk seasoning. I still recall jerk chicken I had in Jamaica and cannot duplicate it with the one-dimensional McCormick spice blend that I bought at Safeway.

And although I am tempted by the many foods we Americans shun (I think I spotted either pig urethras or cervixes), I will contain my impulse shopping and stick to the menu. O.K... just one bag of shredded dried cuttlefish. Yum-O!
