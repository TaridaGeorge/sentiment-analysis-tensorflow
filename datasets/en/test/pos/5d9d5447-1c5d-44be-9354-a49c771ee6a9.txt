All right, time to give Wildflower some props for good customer service - their founder contacted me, apologized, indicated that more high chairs had been placed at the location, told me he spoke with management and addressed the issue, and invited us to try again with a gift card.  We'll see how it is the next time we go, but in the meantime I'm adjusting my rating to reflect some quality customer care.

EDIT:  Next time we went, there were plenty of high chairs, the food was still great, and they were even cool with me bringing in a Chick-fil-a sandwich to pair with the soup we ordered (no matter how good your sandwiches are, it's hard to beat an amazing $2.99 Chick-fil-a original sandwich).  Well played, Wildflower.  We've been there several times recently and it is becoming a favorite.
