Delicious food! Sweet potato fries are to die for, wish I could make them myself just like theirs. They come in a little mini-grocery cart, so cute! I remember we had these seasonal beer samplers - I think you get like five samples of beer or something; they tell you all about each one. Very cool. I like sitting outside so you can people-watch. Gelato Spot is a must afterward (100 feet away or so).  

My only complaint would be the size of the place. You are in close quarters with everyone and can't really get the intimate feel if you're on a date.
