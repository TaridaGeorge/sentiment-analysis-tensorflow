This restaurant is great. It's relatively cheap but the food is quality, the servers are extremely friendly and helpful, and the restaurant has a nice ambiance to it. You can sit at what I assume to be African style dining tables, on the floor, or at a table if you prefer.

This place is great if you're vegan or vegetarian--especially when going out to eat with people who aren't, because there's plenty options for both.

I'd recommend the vegetable samosas, baba ghannouj (my personal favorite) and then getting one of the vegetable (or meat) dishes with 5 different 'platters,' which are sort of like tapas or dim sum but with flavorful African/middle eastern flavors.
