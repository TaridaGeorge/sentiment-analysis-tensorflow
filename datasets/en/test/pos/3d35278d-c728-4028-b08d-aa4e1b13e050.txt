I was looking into doing a short sale or foreclosure for my home but wasn't sure which was the best option for me and my family. Becky Cholewka sat down with us way after closing time and helped educate us on the different options. She was extremely thorough in going over each one and was super patient, friendly and accomodating. She never made me feel like I was asking the wrong questions and never pressured us to leave even after we had taken up quite a bit of her valuable time.

I will personally use her for all of my attorney needs going into the future because of her professionalism and willingness to help.
