Awesome bar areas and lobby- there is live music here on Saturday nights, so this is a great place to come and hang out for food and drinks (I didn't stay here so I can't comment on the rooms or experience in those areas.)  there are different option for food, ranging from a sushi bar, to a full service restaurant on the opposite side, with a large bar area. The lobby is half open so you can sit outside around a fire under the beautiful palm trees and starry sky.  There's free self-parking, but the lot fills up fast...luckily, it's pretty sizable even though you may have to walk a little bit further.
