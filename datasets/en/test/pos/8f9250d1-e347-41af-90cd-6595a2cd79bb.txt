I love conspire for a multitude of reasons, first John Sagasta makes a mean cup of coffee.  Second I love that there are many local artists featured, I bought my sister a one of a kind vase as her wedding present.  It was so beautiful and perfect!  Third I really like that you can get one of a kind clothing as well.  Lastly they are always having special events like poetry night or kickball games.  Very cool!
