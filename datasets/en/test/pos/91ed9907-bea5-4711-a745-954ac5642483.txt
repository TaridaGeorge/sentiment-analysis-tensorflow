This place is awesome! I take all of my out of state friends and relatives here when they visit. A must see! This place is cozy, and friendly. The staff is wonderful and the food is great! The food is like your grandma's home made dinners. It is lovely! You get so much for such a great price as well. The bears are super cute. It feels like home here. There may be a lot of people eating but the way it's set up it doesn't get loud so its nice. If you haven't eaten here yet, you are missing out!
