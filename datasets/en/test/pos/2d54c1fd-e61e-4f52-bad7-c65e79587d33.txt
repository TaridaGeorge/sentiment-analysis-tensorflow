My Bichon's mobile groomer could no longer accomodate my (admittedly stringent) scheduling requirements, so I found myself in need of a new groomer. Bichons are great but they require lots of grooming, so I tend to be picky. Yelp bailed me out with "Hug N Pups".....went in based on the glowing reviews and was not disappointed. They really treat your dog like it was their own....and as one poster said, they know what they are doing with the little white dogs! They even got us in when I called (for the first time) on Saturday at noon. That is service, people!
