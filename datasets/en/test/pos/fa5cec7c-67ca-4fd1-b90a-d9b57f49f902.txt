I ate here for breakfast with some friends yesterday morning, and we all loved it! I had the breakfast burrito with a few altercations, and it was beyond delicious, complete with a tomato basil tortilla and a side of roasted potatoes. 

 This would be a great place for anyone who eats gluten free as the menu is filled with GF-labeled options :) can't wait to come back.
