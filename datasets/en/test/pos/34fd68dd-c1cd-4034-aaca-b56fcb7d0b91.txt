This is a pretty good place to go for a hike in the valley. As opposed to the typical Camelback/Piestewa/South Mountain trails, there's little elevation change and the terrain isn't very challenging, but it's a nice trail to have a social walk with a friend and it's situated in such a way that for a good half-hour stretch, you couldn't tell that you're within an hour's drive of 4 million people. 

Bonus: the trail system and restrooms are probably the cleanest of any park in the metro Phx area. No broken glass to be found anywhere.
