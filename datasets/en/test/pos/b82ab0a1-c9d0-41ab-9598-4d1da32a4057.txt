Hosted our Engagement Party here on August 29th, 2011. First of all, the ease of planning the event was incredible. Cory and his family do such a great job to make everything fun and smooth. Cory gave us a Wine 101, which was super entertaining, down to earth and a wonderful learning experience all at the same time. Our guests had such a wonderful time and really felt they gained something from the experience. We tasted 5 different wines and every guest found at least one they loved (or 4 in my case). Can't wait to head back for a date night!!  Thanks for such an amazing time!!
