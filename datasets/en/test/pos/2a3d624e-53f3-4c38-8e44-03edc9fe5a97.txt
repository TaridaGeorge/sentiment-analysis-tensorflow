So I gave Oreganos another chance, and I'm glad I did.  It was a busy Saturday nite, we had about a 15 minute wait at the bar.  The service and food were outstanding!  This time we had the chicken pesto and and a salad, both were very tasty!

This was my 2nd time to the new location, and it seems like they worked out all the kinks,  we'll be back soon!!
