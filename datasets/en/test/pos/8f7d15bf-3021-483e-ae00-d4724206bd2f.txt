I thought I would try a new local shop today, and I wasn't disappointed. I ordered a "Lumberjack" I think is what it's called. I asked for a suggestion as it was my first time, and it tasted great. The atmosphere is my favorite part. It's quiet, easy to study or hang out with friends. The cabin theme is really cool, and done well. Price is pretty average for a specialty coffee. Friendly, non-overwhelming, staff. Overall, I'd recommend to anyone.
