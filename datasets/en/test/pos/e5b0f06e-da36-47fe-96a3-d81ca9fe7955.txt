I've never been disappointed with Aloha Kitchen...well, other than showing up on a Monday ready for lunch and then remembering they are closed on Mondays. My personal favorite is the Mix 1 plate...lightly battered fried mild white fish, teriyaki chicken, rice and salad. Time to update the decor though, been the same for a couple decades now.
