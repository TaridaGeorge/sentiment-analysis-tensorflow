I took my 2 daughters 13 and 15 on their first horseback ride here and I cant say enough good hings about this place. They are very professional and all the horses are very well trained. Our guide was training a younger horse while guiding us on the trail. It was so pieceful and beautiful. You will not regret taking a ride with these people. The plants and animals were cool and the views were unbelievable i coud not beleive how high up the moutains we were in just 1 hour.There are cabins to sleep in and spend the week end  the lake is beautiful and the river cool lots of birds and cactus i love this place we hope to come back some day.
