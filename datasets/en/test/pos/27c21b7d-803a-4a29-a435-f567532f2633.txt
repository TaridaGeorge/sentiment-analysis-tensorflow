VIP invite?  check. Arrive early?  yes - but so did the rest of Scottsdale!  WOW.  What. A. Party!  WHOOP~WHOOP!

So, this will be a bit biased, since the entire night was Gratis - so how can this be anything other than 10 stars - wait, there's only 5 here, damn...

I think 97% of the people here thought the roving wait staff who branished house wine was their only option, thankfully, because I seem to have a good feeling about these situations, I went right in for the Top Shelf Grey Goose La Poire  (that's Anjour pear Infused, btw).

All I can say is good thing I was dropped off and did not have a car!
{enough said about that!}

(Oh, can't wait to go back to see live band Fri/Sat evenings)

(and to experience their happy hour)

(oh, and to go when the crowd is under 2000+  )
