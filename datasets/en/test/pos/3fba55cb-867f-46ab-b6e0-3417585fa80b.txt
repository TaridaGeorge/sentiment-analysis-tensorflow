I live just down the street and love the how close the Children's Museum is to our house.  We have a yearly membership that includes one adult and 2 kids.  It was $125 for the year and totally worth it, since it is $11 per person over one year old.  We go about once a month and my girls love all the activities.  From the climber to the fort room they have created a wonderful for kids to play and learn.  They also use recycled items to great unique art around the museum.  It is very clean and the staff is very friendly.  If you have children under the age of 8 this is a must do.  I would not suggest going on a First Friday or Weekend as it will be packed, but hit it up during the week.
