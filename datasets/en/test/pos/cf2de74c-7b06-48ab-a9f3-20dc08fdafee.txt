I have been to quite a few classes here and so far every single one has be awesome.  I like that they have a variety of classes not just yoga.  The studio is decorated very nicely and the owners make you feel warm and welcome.  They have a wonderful schedule with classes at very early in the morning which is great for us people who have to work early, and also offer classes late at night.  I am excited to be a member at oneloveyoga and HIGHLY recommend them to anyone that works or lives in the area or even if you are in town visiting.
