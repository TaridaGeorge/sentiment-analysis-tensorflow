Fall off the bone perfect flavored jerk chicken. Off the beaten path a bit, decor is nothing special, but the food is a 10!! The little jamaican ladies always come out and ask how the food is. So nice that they ask. 
They do take their time getting your food out, but anyone that has been to the carribean knows....well thats just how it is. Always worth the wait.
I'll be back time and time again!
