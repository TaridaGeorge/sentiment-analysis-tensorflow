Totally love this place... my favorite restaurant of all time!!!!!!

MUST have the sangria and bruschetta... also be sure to try their home-made pesto dip made with walnuts instead of pine nuts (so good I think I could live off it). Everything on the menu is to die for!

They have half off bottles of wine Sun-Thurs and you can also get a pitcher of Sangria any day (not like I need to be doing that - but its a great deal, like $3 a glass so how can you resist!)
