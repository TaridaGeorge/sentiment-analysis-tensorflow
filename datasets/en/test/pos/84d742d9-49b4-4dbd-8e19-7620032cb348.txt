we just flew in from denver. driving back to the hotel. and said hey that neon pizzeria sign lets go there.. we walked in. and it was full. no waiting but 95 % tables occupied. which is our sign it must be good.. and OMGhey.. it was some of the best pizza i have had.. loved it. and the waiter was awesome too.. he recommended a few breakfast places to go to since i asked him... he also had a cute butt to boot.. i wish i had more than 3 days to stay in phoenix. but will go again next trip for sure
