This place gets a Phoenix 5. Probably lower if it were in a better city.

Postino is probably the best wine bar in the Valley, next to Kazimierz in Scottsdale. I like Kazimierz for its olive selection. Postino wins on happy hour wine selection (5$ any glass) and bruschetta.

I'd recommend this place to anyone who wants to drink a strong selection of varietals. Other wine bars seem to fall short on interesting, new and lesser known varietals.
