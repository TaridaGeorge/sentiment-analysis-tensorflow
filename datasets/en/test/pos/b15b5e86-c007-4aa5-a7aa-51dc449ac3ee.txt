Their chicken sandwiches really are the best. Even though you get this incredibly thick piece of chicken breast, its perfectly juicy and tender. I read somewhere it's due to them being fried in a pressure vat(?). I have no way of knowing buy nevertheless it white meat like you've never had. Also, get their "Chick-Fil-A" sauce. It's the perfect blend of ketchup, barbecue, and honey mustard. Once you try it, you'll never want to dip their awesome waffle fries into anything else!
