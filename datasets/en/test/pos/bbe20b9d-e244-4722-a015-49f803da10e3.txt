After hearing all the hype regarding The Parlor, we decided to check it out for the first time last night. The place is amazing. Very clean and modern. With that in mind, the building is understated and does not feel overwhelming like some spots in the valley. 

The service was amazing. The food was unbelievable. The drinks were stiff. What more can you ask for? I certainly recommend trying the funghi pizza with a fresh farm salad to compliment. With dinner, we shared a very reasonable bottle of Boom! Boom! and topped everything off with a table side french press for two. 

I can't express how much we enjoyed our experience at The Parlor. They have made a customer for life!
