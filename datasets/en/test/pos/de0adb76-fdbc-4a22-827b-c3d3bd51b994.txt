This place is beautiful and it has everything you need. I love to play the golf courses. Tough golf courses. Play them from the tips and you will know what professionals have every weekend. The pool is such a relaxing place to chill and have a margarita. And then there's Kai. I heard it's one of only 14 restaurants in the country that are both 5 Star and  Diamond.
