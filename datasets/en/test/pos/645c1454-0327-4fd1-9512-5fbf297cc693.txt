What's most important about this second outpost of Lola Coffee is that it doesn't stray from its original formula and doesn't neglect the history of the Gold Spot building. High ceilings, lots of natural light, old-time fixtures and concrete floors -- I imagine this is what the old grocery looked like some 80 years ago in this very spot. Nicely done!

What really makes this spot better than the original location is the full roastery room and kitchen. So, while you're enjoying your cup of coffee, you can smell the sweet, smokey goodness of Lola Espresso Roast wafting up the rafters, as well as the heavenly perfection of Sweet Pea baked goods. You can't beat that.
