Hands down the best place for bivalves. I've dropped about about two hundred bucks on oysters there and have never been disappointed with one of them. Sitting at the bar (go figure) I like to start with a Stella and a dozen huge slurpers with some hot sauce. When a few friends show up we move on to the crabcakes and crab legs.  After a few more Stellas and few more friends we do oyster shooters till Lindsey cuts us off. Of the oysters, I mean.  Apparently their labor costs were getting a little out of hand with our group ordering so many. I love this place for the food and the good service. A definite must at the Marketplace.
