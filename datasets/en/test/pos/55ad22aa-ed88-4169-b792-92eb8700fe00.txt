I am obsessed with Yogurtini! The yogurt is amazing...they are always changing out the flavors and last time I went in they had Acai yogurt! The place is really clean and all the flavors are non-fat. They offfer non dairy too which I love. The girl working said they have over 60 flavors now! Super fun in the evenings when there is a good crowd. Great music too! Beats any other of the competitors I have visited just on atmosphere and yogurt quality. I filled up quite a bit in one cup wtih three toppings and it only came out to $4.20.
