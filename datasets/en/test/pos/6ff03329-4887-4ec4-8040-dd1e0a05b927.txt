This is a great, old style, neighborhood store.  It has been in the same place for years and has been my go to local store for about the last two years.  Forget Performance.  If you want truly knowledgeable people without any hint of snobbery, I suggest you try this place out.  They have great bikes, clothing and accessories and are really helpful if you need some extra information before making a choice.  Their wrenches are top notch as are the people who do their bike fittings.  I have already purchased bikes for my me and for my wife and hope to get another soon.

If you want to go local or simply want a great bike store in the Ahwatukee area, look no further than SMC.
