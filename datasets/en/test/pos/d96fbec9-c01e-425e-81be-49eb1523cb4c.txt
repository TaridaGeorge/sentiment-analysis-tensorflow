I experienced my first Smashburger today. I had the classic burger, smashfries and tried some fried pickles. The burger's juicy meat is similar to a Five Guys burger, but everything else is different, like the smash sauce and egg bun -- which made the burger unique and delicious.

The smashfries were different (but good) as well, seasoned in rosemary and garlic. The fried pickles were alright, a little too salty for my taste though.
