As you can see, I choose only to review places that I like...Fez is a great place to go any time of day if you are hungry, or if you want a cocktail.  They have great kizras and their cocktail menu is very unique.  I prefer to go in the late afternoon before it gets too crowded with pretentious gay men, (which I like, but not while I'm eating) but then again, you don't want it emtpy.  The service is always good, lots of parking, and the drinks are fantastic.
