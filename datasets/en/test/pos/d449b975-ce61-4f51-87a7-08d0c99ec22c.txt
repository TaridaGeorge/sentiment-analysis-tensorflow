Great customer service is hard to come by, and yesterday I encountered one of the best customer service experiences I have had in an automotive store. Most times, the guy behind counter is there "just for the job" and "just trying to get my money" but not this time.  My experience was professional courteous, and ultimately he was genuinely concerned for the value of the money I was spending.  You have a great asset in Vince Miller, managers like him are like a needle in a haystack.  
Thank you and I will continue to send my friends and family to see him.
