Perfection.

From the friendly staff, to the precision from the kitchen, this was an EASY five star review.  5th & Wine, WELCOME to Scottsdale and please keep up the great work.  

Between the incredible cheese, the fantastic wine, and the rockin food, how does it get any better??

OH YEAH, DESERT!  Which totally rocked by the way. 

Indoor/Outdoor seating. Good for an elegant evening on the town.  It was so fun, we are going to try them for lunch sometime soon.  FYI: The Grenache is excellent.  

Make it a point to visit 5th & Wine.  Prices were incredibly reasonable given the quality, the portion size, and the ambiance.

ENJOY!
