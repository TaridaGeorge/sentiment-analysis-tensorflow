Good Egg how I've missed you!!! I lived in AZ for three years and we came here for Sunday Brunch every Sunday sometimes with only 2 of us or other times with 8 depending on what we did the night before and how hungry everyone was the next morning after a night of drinking!! The food has always been great and we always knew what to expect. Service has always been great! Even after all the years that have gone by since I moved the place is still great, still busy as ever, and still knows how to produce great food!!
