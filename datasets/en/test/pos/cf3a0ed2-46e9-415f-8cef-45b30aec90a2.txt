Great, great, great. Fabulous location [in my work 'hood], wonderful building, capable and friendly staff and the usual ahmazing food. 

Was so glad to know that this very fine sibling is close to work and just as good as the Arcadia location. I went for lunch and was not disappointed. A wait for tables but we saddled up to the bar and were served there. A busy hum to the place but service was tight and the bar tender attentive. For the record, I had the Mozzarella Chicken on ciabatta. Delish. More bread than I usually eat but totally worth the carbs. 

I could continue the rant but like so many others, I was blown away in the best possible way. And will return.
