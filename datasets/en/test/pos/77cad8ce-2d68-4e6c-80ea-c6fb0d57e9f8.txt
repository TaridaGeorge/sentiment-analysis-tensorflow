Super nice amazing place.. Unbeatable taste of Mediterranean food

I went to four different kabob resturants in Tempe and Mesa and i got an idea that kabob restaurants are all the same.. Same kind of food with slight differences in spices, quantity or may be the service
But when I went to the Flaming Kabob at Mesa location it was absolutly different.. the place is really awesome and the Combo plate was amazing specially the falafel and the rice. The lintel soup was really tastey..
Very good and quick service. I insist to meet the chef to tell my opinion and she was really nice and chearfull lady
Flamming Kabob will be my restaurant every time I have to come to Pheonix
