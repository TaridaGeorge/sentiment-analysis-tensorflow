I'm am an avid visitor of pita jungle. I live in phoenix and would go all the way to the tempe one several times per month. Now I am five minutes away and I love it. I had the honey glazed chicken lavosh pizza and it was amazing. The one in historic phoenix is urban, modern and the diverse crowd there is welcoming to all.
 Whenever we are trying to decide where to go eat pita is always first choice.  Pita jungle is and will always be my favorite place to eat.
