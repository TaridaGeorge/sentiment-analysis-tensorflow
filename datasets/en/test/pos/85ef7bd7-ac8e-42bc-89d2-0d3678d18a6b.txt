Iv'e been going to Don and Charlies for years and it is always consistently been quite good.  Last night I had the baby back ribs.  I order them well done and they are moist yet crispy.  The sauce is a little sweet and a little spicy.  Coleslaw creamy style and the twice baked are home runs!  Don't forget to ask for the chopped liver and rye bread, it is the best I've had.  The chicken snitzle is a good option if you want to try something new.  If you get take out check your bags...things seem to get left off.
