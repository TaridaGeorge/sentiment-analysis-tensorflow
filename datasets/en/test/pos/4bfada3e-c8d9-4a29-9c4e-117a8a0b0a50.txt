Best burger place in Phoenix! My favorite burger recipe is the potato bun, chicken, pesto, green peppers, blue cheese, lettuce, tomato, and guacamole.  Side of ranch for the onion rings. 
Oh and almost forgot, the fish tacos are the best i had in a while. Im so lucky to live not far from it.
Bring all your friends!
