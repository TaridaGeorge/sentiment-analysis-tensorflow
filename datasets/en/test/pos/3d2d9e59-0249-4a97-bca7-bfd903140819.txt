Support this local gem in downtown Gilbert. Simple modern architecture and a unique dining experience. 1st visit was for lunch and there subs are amazing. 2nd trip for breakfast - somewhat limited selection, but very tasty. Coffee bar and different deserts made fresh every morning also a reason to visit. Spread the word and check it out. A refreshing change!
