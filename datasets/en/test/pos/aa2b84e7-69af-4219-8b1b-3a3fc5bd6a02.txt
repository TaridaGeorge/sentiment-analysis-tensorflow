Called them about a DirecTV installation I was looking into and they were perfectly willing to do that for me, but Josh convinced me to take a look at Dish.  They completed the install on time, I'm paying less than I did for Cox TV, and they told me to stay with my Cox internet becaus that would be best for me even though thy had other things they could offer me.

I felt completely taken care of an they helped me navigate the confusing world of bundles and prices.  I'm paying less, getting great service, and couldn't be happier.
