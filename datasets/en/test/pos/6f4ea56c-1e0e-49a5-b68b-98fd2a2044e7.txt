I had the great pleasure of working with Andrea Stewart from Event Services of America. Revolution Tea needed a top notch Event Planner to help us launch a new product at the rooftop of a Scottsdale, Arizona Hotel. Andrea is hard-working and detail-oriented; her goal is to create a special experience for you and your guests. Our company was very grateful for Andrea and her ability to lead us to a memorable company launch party.
I highly recommend Andrea Stewart and Event Services of America for all your events, parties and special occasions. Not only is ESA top notch - but Andrea is a kind and lovely person to know.
