Went there the other night my boyfriend had #34 and ate the whole plate with shaved noodles.  I got the seafood noodle bowl soup and it was so delicious.  We had a side of pan fried dumplings and there were so yummy!  We are for sure going back there again.  The staff was super friendly :) Cash only for a reason and worth it!
