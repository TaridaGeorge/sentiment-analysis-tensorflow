We had heard about this delightful little place on DD&D and were in Scottsdale for less than 2 days and had to try it out.  It was everything and then some.  Super nice staff, great ambiance and the food was amazing.  I started with the Aperol Spritz, so refreshing, so different, it's a must.  We ordered the calamari and rice balls for appetizers.  Calamari with that broth was just delicious.  The rice balls were light and flavorful.  I had the Lemoncello pasta and my husband ordered the bolognese pasta.  Out of this world.  The pasta was fresh homemade, the sauces were perfect.  Tiramisu and Cannoli ended the meal, just as amazing as the appetizers and entrees.  I so wish my hometown had an independent Italian restaurant like this, more towns across the country need a Giuseppe's.
