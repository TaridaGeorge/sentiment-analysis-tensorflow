I've hiked both sides of Camelback and much prefer the Invergorden side.  Yeah the parking sucks but what are you gonna do...it's a beautiful spot and you aren't the only one who has discovered it.

I think this side is a bit easier but it, like the 40th street side, involves scrambling over rocks and families.  I think this side is a bit more less crowded.  I have to laugh and agree with the other reviewers...you do see a ton of scantily clad people with great bodies and crazy people who run up and down two or three times without stopping.

A few things I've learned:
-Take water!
-Don't attempt this in the summer unless you leave the bottom by 6AM
-You can do it!
