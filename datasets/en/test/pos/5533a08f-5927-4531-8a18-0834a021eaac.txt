My family and I still go here all the time, and it is still amazing. Now it's our fall back place if we can't decide what to eat, or if we're too lazy to cook something, or if we have guests and we want to take them to a "special" place.

Yes, this is the "special" place we bring guests to... because it's that amazing! Everyone can find something to eat here, from hardcore meat-eaters to die-hard vegans. Soooo good.

Basically, my update on this place is that it's so amazing, it's a continuous fall back place for my family and me to go to when we're in a pinch or when we can't agree on anything else. Yum!
