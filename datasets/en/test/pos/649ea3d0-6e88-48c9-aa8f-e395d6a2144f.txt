I can not even explain how much I love this place.  Their carne asada is the most amazing I have ever had.  Their guacamole/salsa trio is sooooo good.  The cowboy stew is to die for.  Even their buttermilk fried chicken with chipotle mashed sweet potatoes is wonderful.  I've moved to California in the past year and I miss this place sooooo much.
