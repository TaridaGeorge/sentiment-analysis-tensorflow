Another fantastic bagel and coffee this morning! So glad to have this place just down the street! Absolutely great! Rumor has it they are building a new location at 67th and happy valley! Very cool! Can't wait to try that one out! My favorite bagel is the traditional plain toasted with butter. So good!
