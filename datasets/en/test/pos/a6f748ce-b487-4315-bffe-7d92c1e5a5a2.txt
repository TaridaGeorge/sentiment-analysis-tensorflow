I'm surprised to read the bad review about Sprouts. Honestly, I haven't bought a lot of their meat because I come for other things, but its never been a problem for me. 

I didn't know this before I went to this Sprouts, but I LOVE pink lady apples. They are also usually on sale too, which makes me happy (and even when they're not, they're cheaper than other places). Other things that make me love Sprouts: their corn muffins are delish, they have a regular bulk section, but they also have a bulk spice section. Who wants to pay friggin $3 for a tiny jar of spice, when you need a tablespoon for a recipe you're trying out? 

I assume they also have a good deli because I see people getting the lunch special here, but I've never tried it.
