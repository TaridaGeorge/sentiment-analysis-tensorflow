I love Cartel. I work within 1 mile of Cartel, so I stop in there probably 2-3 times per week on average. The staff is always very friendly, even when they are slammed with customers. Sometimes the order line gets a bit backed up, but it because Cartel takes the time to make good coffee. I highly recommend Cartel for coffee lovers.
