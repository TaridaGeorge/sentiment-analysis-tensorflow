Just moved to Phoenix from San Diego a few months ago and enjoy eating Lisa's meat balls several times a month.  The drinks are good and so is the atmosphere.. Love the apple pie they had a few weeks ago!!  Went again on New Years Eve and they had a Berry Cobbler, Yummy!!!!  They always make us feel so welcome even on a busy night.  
Please keep up the great work!  See you Friday night:)
