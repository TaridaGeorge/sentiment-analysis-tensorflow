It doesn't look it from the outside, but Cartel is the hippest coffeshop in the desert. They roast their own beans to perfection, and brew up an amazing cup of joe--wait for it--on a customer-by-customer basis. That's right. No nasty metallic drip sitting on some heater from this place. It's all real, baby. And I want it all.

If that weren't enough, the decor puts my San Francisco roots to shame. It's industrial and gritty, yet refined and academic. Comfy couches, minimalistic tables, stuff made of metal, and recycled bike wheels. It says "we do coffee real good, but that don't make us douches."
