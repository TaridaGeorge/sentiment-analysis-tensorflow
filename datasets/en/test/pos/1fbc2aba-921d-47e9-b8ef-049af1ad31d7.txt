I've been going to knock kneed lobster since I was 5 years old. I am 31 now.  My parents have been eating at knock kneed their whole lives. I got my wife hooked and her parents hooked. It just takes eating there one time to know that they have the best seafood around. The outside of the building looks a bit rundown and the inside it a little bit older but when it comes down to the food your taste buds are in for a treat.  I will fight anyone who eats there and doesn't say it is the best!
