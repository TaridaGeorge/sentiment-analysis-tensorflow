Lee and Rhonda you guys are great people.  We had the best horseback ride and the kids are still talking about it.  They loved the stories the guide told Preston.  He was hysterical.  The scenery was amazing I love and got some great pics of the saguaro cactus.   My horse Picasso was well behaved which i was really glad as I have not ridden in quite sometime.   The whole setup was great..  having the western town with the pet pigs so cute!  Anyhow great service and fun!  I recommend this place to everyone.
