Stopped in for lunch after a movie. This is the second time I've been here, and the food and service have been excellent both times. This time I had the Smokehouse Burger. The burger was great, the bacon was crisp and the onion rings were yummy. Loved the fries as well.  The bread they brought out before the meal was amazing!
