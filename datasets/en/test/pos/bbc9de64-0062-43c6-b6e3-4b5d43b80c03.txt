Simply put, this is a perfect little independent and locally owned bookstore with a very pleasant and knowledgeable staff.  They have new and used books, and you'll find people getting comfortable and reading just about anywhere they can find a spot.  They have fair prices and most likely take used book donations.

I highly recommend.  If only I had more time to read.
