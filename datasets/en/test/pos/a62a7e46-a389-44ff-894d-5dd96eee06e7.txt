Hands down, they have the best fish tacos of anywhere I've been.   The corn tortillas are lightly cooked (fried?) and soft and warm.  The fish is crispy and flaky.  The cabbage is fresh and crunchy.  The white sauce is tasty.  What more could I want?  Maybe a cheaper price?  Unless you go on Tuesdays they are a bit pricey.  But you won't be disappointed by how they taste.  

I always get mine "to go" so I am not reviewing anything else about the restaurant.  This review is just about the fish tacos.  That's all I am interested in.

The only problem I have with them is the parking situation.  Anyone who has been in this shopping center knows how cramped the parking is here.  It's not the restaurant's fault, but still, it does make me less likely to go here very often.
