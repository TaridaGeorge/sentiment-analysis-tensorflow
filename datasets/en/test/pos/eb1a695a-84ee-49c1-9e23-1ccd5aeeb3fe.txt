Go to place for special occasion.  Just don't count calories.  Expect great    Steaks, extensive wine list, tasty apps and save some room for desert.

Bone in ribeye is one of the best.  Mash is always seasoned perfectly.   Very good service as well.

Only downside is the large bill at the end of the meal.
