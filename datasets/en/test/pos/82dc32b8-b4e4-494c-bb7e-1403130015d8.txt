Well it's a dive bar! This is by far one of my favorite places to chill out! I lived in Phoenix for 9 years and now I am in San Diego. This is the first place that I go to for dinner when I'm back in the 602. Their food is amazing! Their bartenders are great especially Jimmy! It's a must try... a great casual experience.
