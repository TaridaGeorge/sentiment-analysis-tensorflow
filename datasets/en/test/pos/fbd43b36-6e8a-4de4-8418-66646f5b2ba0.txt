I love love love this gym. Mind you I have never taken a class here, they always seem to be packed and I'm just not a gym class type of girl. I just love the huge-ness of the place, all the equipment they have and the people watching. That's what makes my boring cardio sessions go by in seconds. It's like "oh, I'm done already". Not to mention the place is super clean, has a "rock" wall (yayyyyyy!) and I love my after workout smoothies at the Lifetime cafe.
