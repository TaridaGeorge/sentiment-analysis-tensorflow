Impressive! Great menu with tantalizing ambiance. Sat by the fire and made for a spectacular evening. My wife had the wedge salad and I had the lobster and corn chowder. Both were regally presented. Nice collection of wines and a great assortment of craft beers. Lobster was mediocre, a bit chewy based on the bite that my wife gave me. Veal porterhouse melt in my mouth. Overall one of the better restaurants I went to on my tour of Scottsdale.
