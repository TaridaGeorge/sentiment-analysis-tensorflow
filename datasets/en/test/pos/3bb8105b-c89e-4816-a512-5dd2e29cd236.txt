Postino - $5 pitcher's of Odell IPA.   What more needs be said?

A great reuse of a 1950's post office with a perfect menu while enjoying a glass of wine or the aforementioned pitcher of beer.  My wife and I lingered her over two lunches on a recent vacation and even stopped by for a quick drink on the way to the airport; couldn't get enough of this place's charm.

The bonus is its location - across from La Grande Orange Bakery which is also super cool and Radio Milano across the street.  Anyone living in this neighborhood better realize how lucky they are.
