This place is the bomb!  I've been wanting to come here for so long.  DH & I finally made it out here and it was all I ever hoped for it to be.  The food was fantastic and our server was great.  We ordered the Big Night Out which includes smoked cheddar with Sam Adam's cheese fondue, wedge salads, variety of meat to dip in fondue for entree and a milk chocolate fondue for dessert.  We were stuffed by the end of our meal.  Wouldn't change a thing!
