Every time I come to Scottsdale to visit the in-laws, I look forward to our daily morning trips to AJ's. This place is a wonderland of food porn. I love to treat myself to a pumpernickel or pumpkin bagel with cream cheese and play cards on the patio with my little sisters in-law. There are always so many yummy things to look at in the bakery case, but I must say I have never succumbed. 

It's only been two days since we've been together, but I miss you already AJ's.
