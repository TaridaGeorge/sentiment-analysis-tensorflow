We have been coming here for years. Every time we come here we realize that this is truly the best Italian restaurant in the valley. We are done being adventurous about trying Italian restaurants. When we want Italian this is the place. Its fun. Great ambiance. Not its not pricey for what you get. Love it. Excellent service.
