Urban Yoga is a fantastic yoga studio. Relaxing, calm and wonderful.  I really loved the studio and the teachers are excellent.  They are talented and very good at teaching while creating a great workout even at the sunrise yoga.  Location, studio, massage therapist, and yoga instructors are all A+

I had a groupon but will definitely be buying a package soon!
