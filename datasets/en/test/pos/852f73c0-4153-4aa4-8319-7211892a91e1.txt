I'm pretty sure if I went to Zia on my day off I would spend the whole day wandering the aisles looking at just about every cd in the store. I know not too many people buy cd's anymore but I do and I love that Zia has so many- new and used. I've bought a few used cd's here and they've all been in solid condition. 

The staff is always willing to help you but if you say you're just browsing they get it and leave you to it. I like that about them, a lot. I also appreciate the fact that they sell tickets for a lot of local shows, saves you the online order fee and will call line frustration. Plus you have an excuse to go buy more music!
