So. Good.

My BFF & I go here frequently. The patio is great when the weather suits, and the inside tables are great when it doesnt.

Their happy hour menu is awesome. Select dishes/ drinks for $5 a piece. 

I havent had a bad item here. From the flatbreads to the bruschetta (the fig and brie is my fave), to the vodka scallops (served in a martini glass) and cheese plates. And oh the cheese, the cheese!

Oh and did I mention their mac and cheese menu? Cuz its bomb. Even reheated, bomb.

Weve never had a bad server here. Even though their attire suggests otherwise, theyre very casual and oh so very nice.

Go here.
