The office staff is friendly and very courteous . The environment is very clean, comfortable, and colors gives off a soothing effect. Appointments are easy to schedule. The physicians spend a great amount of time getting to the root of problems instead of the quick fix pill approach, listening and answering questions to help you fully understand your medical condition. Knowledgeable  physicians making recommendations that are in your best interest is what stands SCNM apart from the rest. I definitely would and have recommended SCNM to my family and friends. Keep up the good work SCNM!
