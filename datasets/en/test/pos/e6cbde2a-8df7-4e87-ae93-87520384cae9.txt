I never wrote a review for Palatte, though it was my home-away-from-home several times each week.  Frankly, I didn't write because it was too personal for me.  I loved the food, camaraderie and friendship of Ed and Christine (and Ruby).  Although I took friends often, it never occurred to me that the place might be under water; that I should do more.  In retrospect that was naive.  Great ingredients and good service cost money.  Palatte will be missed.  Downtown has lost its anchor.
