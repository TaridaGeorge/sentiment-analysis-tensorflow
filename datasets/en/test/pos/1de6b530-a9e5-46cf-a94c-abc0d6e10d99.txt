the parking sucks no matter when you go.

okay, i had to get that out of they way.  onto the good stuff.  the food here is heaven!!!!  i have tried the salads, reuben, tuna sandwich, red velvet cake and they are all great.

i love the green chile burger!  it's the best i have ever had!  damn now i'm hungry.  the fries are great.
