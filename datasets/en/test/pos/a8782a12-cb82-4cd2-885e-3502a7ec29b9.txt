Excellent happy hour! Having just moved to the area I have been searching for a location with quality food and tasty beer options with reasonable happy hour prices. Found it!! $5 apps, which I tried 4 of the 6 and haven't decided which I liked the best, as its a tough decision. Kona brewing co. Fire Rock pale for $3... yes please, and may I have another. 

Check it out! And maybe I'll see you belly up... pull up a stool!
