The. Love. Of. My. Life. Ted Baker is my absolute favorite designer and this is my very favorite place to shop when I'm feeling indulgent. Other than the quality clothing, the customer service is amazing. Easily the best customer service I have ever experienced anywhere ever. It's like we're right at home when we stop in, even if we aren't looking to buy anything at all. The people who work here always remember us and can even remember the conversations we've had in the past. It's not like we live here or anything, we come maybe once a month if that. Now, the variety is more limited than, say, the San Francisco location, but we still prefer the one in Scottsdale because of the amazing people who work there. Ted Baker, you make me so so happy!
