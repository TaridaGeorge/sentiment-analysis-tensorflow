There will be a wait at Pizza Bianco, and I mean a wait... and yes, it is worth it! So go here for drinks as you to prepare for a pizza masterpiece... Bar Bianco. 

It's right next door across the lawn like the perfect neighbor we all wish we had. A chill and relaxing place, like having beer and wine at a good friend's quaint and warm house equipped with a fireplace, paintings, hardwood floors, dim lighting and great music! It definitely will help pass the hours you could wait for the pizza (pizza that I would book a flight to Phoenix for). Just make your night about the complete experience and throw all caution about time out the window of Bar Bianca! 

Just writing about this has me checking flight times!
