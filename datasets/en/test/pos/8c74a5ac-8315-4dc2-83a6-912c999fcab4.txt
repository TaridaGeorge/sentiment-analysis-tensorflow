Another downtown joint I hadn't bothered reviewing because it's such a part of my regular routine.

I love hash browns and Matt's is a hash brown lover's paradise. I don't know exactly how they cook their eggs; I just hope that whatever they do, they keep doing it. It's tasty. 

I have friends from Tucson who crash at my place on an occasional weekend, and every Sunday morning before they head back to the Old Pueblo, they insist on my taking them here. They're as addicted as I am. 

Long lines on Sunday mornings so expect a wait and bring good conversation topics with you.

NOTE: MrK took some great shots of the place that you can see above. His last interior shot does indeed have Matt in the background, and the very cute Gretel toward the right (she also waitresses at the Roosevelt).
