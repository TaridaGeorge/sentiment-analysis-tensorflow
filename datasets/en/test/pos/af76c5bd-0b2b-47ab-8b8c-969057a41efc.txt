I loved Black Hearts Bazaar Noir but they had a fire and have been closed for awhile.  Vyle, the owner, opened up this new shop farther up on 7th Ave.  It's just as awesome as Black Hearts thanks to Vyle's interest in the strange and unusual.

The store is packed with all sorts of stuff, from beautiful antiques to peculiar bric-a-brac to fun little items like Koop playing cards and a Jesus themed toiletries.

You must go here and check this place out, you will not be disappointed!
