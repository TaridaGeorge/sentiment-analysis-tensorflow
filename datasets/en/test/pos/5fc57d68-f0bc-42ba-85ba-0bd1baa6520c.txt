Finally made it down to Cathy and Steve's Chandler location and I must gush about how easy the new location is to find!
The new spa is spacious with 2 bathrooms, 2 (heavenly 7-headed) showers, 3 changing rooms with lockers, 2 saunas, a lounge area that overlooks the lake, great massage rooms for singles and couples, a room for facials.
Of course the best part is the great variety of massages they offer. My personal favorite is the Lomi Lomi where getting the 90min treatment is a must since 60mins is just not long enough!  In fact, I got a 90min treatment a couple of days ago and it felt like it ended too quickly that I might just have to make reservations for a 120min treatment next time!!
If you are looking for a special and unique massage experience, this is the place to come!!
