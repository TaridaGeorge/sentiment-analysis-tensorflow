I came home today ( mid July) and I noticed that the AC was on but the house wasnt cooling down. I called on time AC and heating and they came immediately. I was so pleased at how responsive they were. When the tech came out he was professional and very courteous . I would recommend them highly to anyone who need excellent service fast. You can't go wrong with these guys!
