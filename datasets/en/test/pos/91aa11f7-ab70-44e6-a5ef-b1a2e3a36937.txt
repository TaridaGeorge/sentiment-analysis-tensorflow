YUM!!  I had the shepherd's pie and it was the perfect blend of meat, mashed potatoes, and veggies.  It didn't even really need the side of gravy, that was just a bonus.  The dough is perfect.  Wide variety of pasties to choose from and some very interesting combinations.  One pasty is very big and will fill you up.  Mine was so good I wanted to eat the whole thing, but luckily I exercised some restraint.  Please come to Southern California.
