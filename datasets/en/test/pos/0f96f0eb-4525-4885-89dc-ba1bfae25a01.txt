My boyfriend took me to Cibo for a lovely birthday dinner the other night. He couldn't believe I had never been... now, neither can I! The food was absolutely amazing (gnocchi with spicy sausage), the wine list had many great options, and the atmosphere very low-key and casual. We were able to enjoy our food leisurely and without interruption. Matt, our waiter, was timely, humorous, and charming.
