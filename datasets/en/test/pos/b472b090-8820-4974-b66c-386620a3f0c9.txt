The service here is impeccable.  Staff bend over backwards to make sure that even the smallest details are perfect and that you are completely content 24/7.  The pub/restaurant inside is great - my favorite burger in Phoenix (although, admittedly I have limited local experience...)  When you're travelling - especially alone and shuffling from airport-hotel-airport-hotel, etc...  it feels really nice to be taken care of the way you are at the Ritz.
