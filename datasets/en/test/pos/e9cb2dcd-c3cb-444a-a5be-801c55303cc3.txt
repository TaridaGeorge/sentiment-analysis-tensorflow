I have been to this and several other Chick-Fil-A restaurants and have always found the food fresh and tasty.  The restaurants are clean, including the bathrooms, and the service is outstanding.  If you are trying to eat healthy, this is probably the best choice out of the fast food restaurants.  As for me...I'm sticking with the chicken nuggets and waffle fries.  I love them.
