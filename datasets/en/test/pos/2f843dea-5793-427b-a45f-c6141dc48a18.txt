Had the best time on half price wednesdays. SUCH fun games towards the back, all the guns and target and shooting the monsters...Love the one with the RED guns where you can play in teams and you have to shake to reload...some of the others looked great but customers camped out inside the cars so I never got to try them...BUT I will be back on another Wednesday...nice hostesses also, and downstairs waitress nice too, all helpful and funny. Young staff but not the stupid kind, all knowledgeable and helpful staff here. Loved it!!
