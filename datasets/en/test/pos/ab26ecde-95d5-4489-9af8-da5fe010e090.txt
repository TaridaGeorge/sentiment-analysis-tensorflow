Bill, Bill, Bill.  You seduce my friend and I in from the 111 degree heat with ice cold beer.  You seat us in luxe leather seats and permit us to play trivial pursuit (the 1985 version!) for an excessive period of time.  You feed us bruschetta, and don't wince when I beg off a decision and insist that you choose the flavors (figs & honey, goat cheese & roasted peppers, what a guy).

And then you sigh with pleasure when my seatmate and I both choose to eat the succulent ribeye and crunchy beans, regaling us with tales of time long ago when many important members of the staff worked somewhere famous called "Flemings".

I was sad to go, but I'll come back to see you.  I promise!
