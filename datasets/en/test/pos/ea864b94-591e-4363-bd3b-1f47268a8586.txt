Great prices, great organic foods.  Love the salad bar, clean great choices.  One of my favorites is the meatball sandwich!  Very good.  Free ice cream cone when finished for all!  Great place to eat with kids, free on Wednesdays and organic healthy choices. 

Only thing that sucks, is no free wifi and booths/tables slide all over the floor. Very annoying.
