If this place becomes too big of a deal and I have to start waiting a long time I'm going to...well, I'm going to not be happy.

Tiny ceramic olive dishes! Calligraphy'd menus! A pizza oven that's RIGHT THERE! Dim lighting, a cute little (emphasis on "little") patio, perfect service and THE PIZZA. GAH.

Never mind. I was going to elaborate on the pesto-ridiculousness I've experienced both times we came here, but I don't want to share. Forget you read this. Carry on.
