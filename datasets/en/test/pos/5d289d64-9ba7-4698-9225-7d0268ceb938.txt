I have been going to this restaurant for years, even before it was Texaz when it used to be known as Lonestar.  They have been in the valley for YEARS and I can understand why.  Their food is simple and DELICIOUS.  Their chicken fried steak is huge and I cannot even begin to describe the flavor.  Their steaks are always perfectly cooked perfection and I always leave feeling full and satisfied.  If you're looking for a casual night out with delicious steak and potatoes I would recommend this place.  It's also fun to see what they've got on their walls as the place is packed with fun trinkets.
