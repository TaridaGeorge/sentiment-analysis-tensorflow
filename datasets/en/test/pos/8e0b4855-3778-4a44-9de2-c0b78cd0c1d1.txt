Last night I just wanted a quick bite. Being a regular cutomer, I went to Tommy V. To my surprise my bartener, Tabor, recommended a special for the evening. It was called Choppio Frutta di Mare--absolutely delicious--the fish was so fresh. They usually dont have specials, so I was estatic to enjoy something so different and awesome. I hope they continue to have more specials.
