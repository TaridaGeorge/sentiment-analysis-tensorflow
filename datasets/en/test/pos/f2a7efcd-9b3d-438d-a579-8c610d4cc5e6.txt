I am still reeling from my lunch here, dreaming about it, planning my next trip. I don't know what else to say other than I was totally surprised by how fantastic my lunch was. A Zinburger with truffle fries. Sat at the bar by myself, was on my way to the airport. Wasn't that hungry. I thought about taking the napkin to remember the place by. I don't know what you could find wrong with these burgers, truthfully one of the best I've ever shoved in my piehole.
