Oh my.  

Best massage I have had in my life.  And you know you are in good hands with the masseuse was kinda like Yoda.  She knew where my tight spots were, why I was feeling that way and even had suggestions on what do remedy them.  Wow.  I lounged in my robe after the massage by the private mineral pool to take a nap.  I haven't felt so refreshed in such a long time.   When you book your treatment here, take advantage of all the other amenities like the steam room, mineral pool or you can even order lunch after your service!
