If I could give Cibo 10 stars I would!! Every time I've been here the food is amazing!! The Burrata is so tasty I could eat it daily. My other favorite is the pear salad! All of the pizza is mind blowing :)

This is a great location for dates or just grabbing a bite with friends. The patio is enchanting with all the lights and trees. The little house and patio transport you away from Phoenix and make you feel at home. 

If you have never been here, then you're making a huge mistake!!!!! Be prepared to wait though.. Depending on what day or time you go there could be a wait but its well worth it! The wait staff is pretty good too.. Ohh and if you want to avoid the wait you can order to-go and grab and drink at the bar while you wait.
