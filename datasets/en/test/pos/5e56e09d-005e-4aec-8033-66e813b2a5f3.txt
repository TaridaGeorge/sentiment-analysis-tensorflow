The food, service and atmosphere were fantastic. I'm visiting a friend and she's definitely planning to go back. We had a bruschetta sampler, our favorite's being the roasted peppers and goat cheese as well as the fig, pistachio and ricotta. The salad selection was great and we also had that with the mixed greens, candied walnuts and Gorgonzola. The open air aspect made for a peaceful environment and as I told my friend, you could easily transport this restaurant right into the meatpacking district in NYC...and it would be a hit.
