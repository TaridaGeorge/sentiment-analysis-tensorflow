They've come to my rescue several times... from replacing a trackball (previous Blackberry phone), replacing the glass on my Evo... twice (before I broke down and invested on an Otterbox). They do expert work and they're as fair and honest repairmen I've ever seen.

They have two shops: on in AZ Mills (haven't been there) and the other's on the SEC of Dobson & Baseline).
