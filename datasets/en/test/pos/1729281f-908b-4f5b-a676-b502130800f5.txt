Found this place on accident a few days ago while driving out to Vegas. Loved it so much, we ate here a second time a few days later on our way back from Vegas. Everything we had (shish kabob, chicken shawarma and kifta kabob) was bursting with exotic flavors. Folks, this place is the real deal,  NOT immitation middle Eastern cuisine. If I didn't live 60 miles away, I'd eat here almost every day!!! I will be making some special road trips out to Olive Tree in the near future, ITS THAT GOOD!!!
