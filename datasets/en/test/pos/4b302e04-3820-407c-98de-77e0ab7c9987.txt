Visited smeeks for the first time after reading about it on someone's blog. Now I have taken multiple people there because I love it so much. It is in a great location downtown and there really is no other place like it. If you are looking for candy that you loved when you were a child this is the place to get it. I took my sister there and she wanted to buy everything. The staff is great as well. I bought some gifts there and they wrapped it up all cute for me. If you haven't been you need to stop in!
