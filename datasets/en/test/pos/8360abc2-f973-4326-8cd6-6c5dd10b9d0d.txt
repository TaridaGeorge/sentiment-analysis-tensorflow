Cafe Monarch is everything and more that fans say it is.  It is "more" when you experience it for yourself.  
Lately, I've been going to some really nice restaurants in town and I cannot find anything that can top Chef Christopher's food.  
Everything here is made right in front of you and it's so fresh.  Chef Christopher rarely serves the same thing twice. He's so innovative and comes up with the best flavor profiles.
Loved the ribs - they were so rich and fell off the bone.  The sauce and the polenta were amazing.  Every dessert I've had there has been amazing too.  Usually something involving a fruit but also chocolate, which seems to be a must when you go there.  
Talk to Chef Christopher.  He is a very  humble chef .  His talents are top-notch and really haven't been met by any other valley restaurants I've been to.
