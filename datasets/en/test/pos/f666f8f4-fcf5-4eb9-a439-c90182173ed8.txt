I was depressed when Jutenhoops closed and even more so when the Green Woodpecker went out of business because there was no place to get that unusual, out of the ordinary gift for someone. Well NOW there is!  The Secret Village has all those special mind games, puzzles, gadjets----. Great Kitchen, Dining, Decorating,
everything store.  A Man cave too!  Love this store (these stores) --- Should be in the gift catagory also.  I'm spreading the word to all of my Christmas shopping impaired friends in hopes that something creative will land under their trees.
