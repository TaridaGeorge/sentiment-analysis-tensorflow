This place is great! Right when you walk in the door you get greeted by girls with smiling faces. I didn't bother looking at the menu because you could tell that everything about this place was fantastic.

When they asked what I wanted for lunch, I simply said, "Surprise me!" I paid my bill and sat down an waited. A few moments later a lemonade with ginger ale showed up. It was all freshly squeezed and fresh. Lots of flavor and very refreshing.

Later, they brought out my French Dip. Wow this looked good. Big thick hogie bun and a generous amount of beef. Dipping the sandwich was great and the food melted in your mouth. This was great!

I will definitely be back to this place again!
