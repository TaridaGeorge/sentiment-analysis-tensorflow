I had excellent service to begin with. There were great appetizers, good..not weak..drinks. For my first time at a PF Chang's, I thought the main course was a little mild tasting, which we mentioned to them. They went overboard trying to fix something that I wasn't sure was broken to begin with. The waiter got us a free dessert and then the manager brought a new entree. Honestly, I never thought the original food was bad. It was more a comment about the different style of cooking. Anyway, I never had better service but after reading the other reviews I hope some poor cook didn't get in trouble from my offhanded comment.
