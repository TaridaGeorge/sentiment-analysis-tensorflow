The picture are accurate.  This Penzey's location has a non-pretentious general store feel to it, and you can go inside and smell jars of each spice available.  My favorite is the China cinnamon.  It has such a wonderful scent.  I also liked how they had plenty of salt-free spices and almost any spice you can think of.  Make sure to pick up their catalog too!  Penzey's is one of those places that you can easily take for granted if you don't live near it, but if you love to cook, you need to stop inside!
