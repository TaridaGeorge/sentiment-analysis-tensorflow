This is a win, win situation if there ever was one. I have 3 things to say... Shrimp & goat chesse bruschetta, beef beer bread & for me pumpkin porter ale will  keep me coming back forever all by themselves. The staff & service seal the already done deal. Last but definitely not least are the specials. Each day there are specials & they are very special indeed. The hubs & I had the pleasure of trying the crabcake samwich & man alive it was packed full of crab & not breadcrumbs. Just amazing! The food is consistantly great, the service fast & the seasonal ales are awesome. Thank you Four Peaks for being the best brew pub EVER.
