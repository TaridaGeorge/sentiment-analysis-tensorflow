I've been to this place a few times now on my lunch break and I love it. I just moved to Phoenix from Seattle and I'm missing my delicious Asian food a lot. Thankfully this restaurant is right near my work so I stop by here often. The Thai food is AMAZING, and the lunch deals are great. I plan on bringing my friends here in the future! Try the Thai iced tea, one of my favorite beverages and can make any day better.
