As we all know, Condor has been to many Pubs in the Queen's Empire, London, Sydney, Dublin, you name it. Yesterday, elbow to elbow at the bar of The Armadillo Grill, among kindred Sportsmen in the Valley betting on the Sport of Kings (Horse racing), at the suggestion of the gorgeous Armadillion Carrie, I tried "Richard's Pub Burger" from the Specials Menu. Needless to say, the juicy beef, cheddar cheese and delicately fried egg sandwiched between a crisp, toasted Thomas' English Muffin, rivaled the best Pub Fare in the world. Try it with a cold beer or, as my friend Jimmy said, "with a Bloody Mary! Breakfast of Champions!" Now if I could only pick a winner at Turf Paradise!
