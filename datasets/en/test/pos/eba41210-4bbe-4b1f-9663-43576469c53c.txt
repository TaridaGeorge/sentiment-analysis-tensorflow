I just want to park myself in this orange and brown blob of a place and stay and forget the world outside.  And not knowing what it is to experience doughnut nirvana before, it is here.  It is here with the plain sugar doughnut.  Very very friendly counter service.  And they have vanilla creamer if you ask.

I've seen this place for 20 years and only started stopping here in the past few months.  Amazing that I will go to little dives off Roadfood dot com everywhere else in the country, and it took me this long to go to the one right in my old hood.
