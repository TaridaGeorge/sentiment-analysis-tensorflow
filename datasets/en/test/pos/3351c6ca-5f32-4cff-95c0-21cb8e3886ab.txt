I absolutely love the yellowtail here - it is sooooo fresh and melts in your mouth. I also just sampled the baked mussels appetizer - the restaurant now offers a free appetizer coupon which can be downloaded on the site. The mussels were extremely yummy. I haven't had anything here I didn't enjoy. It's a bit pricey but well worth it. I will check out the new Happy Hour and lunch specials when I get a chance.
