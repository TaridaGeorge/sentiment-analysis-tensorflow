All I have to say is pulled pork sandwhich, it is so yummy and huge for the price. You can eat here for under $8 and be stuffed. The only bad thing about this place is they dont serve ranch, but they do serve bbq-ranch which is petty good. The mac n cheese is amazing also its crunchy on the top its great. 

I like that you can get your own soda and water its set up like a caferteria, which to me is really cool concept. The cookies are also amazing for $1.25 I would tell anyone to try this place its really good.
