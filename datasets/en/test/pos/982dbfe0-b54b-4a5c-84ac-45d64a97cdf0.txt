This is one of my wifes and I favorite places to eat. Wonderful selection of Soup, salad and sandwiches. They even have Italian syrups for making your own Italian sodas, and for only 1.50, they are cheaper than most peoples regular drinks. They have a new featured "world tour" soup every couple of weeks, where you can get a "passport" stamped to earn free food and drinks and ultimately a grand prize. The chocolate covered strawberry at the end is a nice touch. And the service is very friendly, you can tell management has put it as a priority. 

My Favorite Combo: Pulled BBQ Pork Sandwich and BBQ Chicken Salad
