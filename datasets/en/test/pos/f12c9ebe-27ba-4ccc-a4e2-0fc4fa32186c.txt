This place is exactly what it should be.  A great little watering hole (but NOT a dive in the least), it is small, dark (at night), and intimate.  They make some of the best cocktails I have ever tasted, all with fresh juices squeezed on the spot.  My favorites are the moscow mule, the margarita, and the cucamint martini.  My friends all live in this neighborhood and introduced me to it.  It feels like my neighborhood bar now as well.
