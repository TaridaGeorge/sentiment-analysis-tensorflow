We are staying downtown and had decided to go to Sunday Mass in St. Mary's Basilica, one of the oldest churches in Phoenix.  From the outside, it's an mission style stucco exterior, while inside, all the alters are adorned with statues of the saints, and the pipe organ in the upper balcony is absolutely wonderful to hear.  

Mass was very old school in that it was sung from start to finish.  It lasted 1 hour and 45 minutes.  Considering the Church is downtown, there were a large congregation present and not everyone looked like a tourist.  

It's a beautiful old Church worth taking a look at.
