I didn't mind the wait. Got what I had to get done, including a smog check across the street from this location which was top notch.  Smog service was a smooth experience. Wonderful employees and the general public was believe it or not...PATIENT. 

It would be greatly appreciated if the DMV of AZ could offer appointments when you have the need to see them inside their office. Representatives at the counters are very nice and know what they are doing. The Information desk personnel unfortunately, was clueless when inquiring about new registration as a new resident and transferring over. I found out I was misinformed greatly once I finally had my turn at the window. Good thing I didn't have to retake a number to start it all over again.
