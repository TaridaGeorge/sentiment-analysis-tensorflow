Off the Grid is the perfect place to get your butt in shape for the new year!  If you're  looking for a new exercise experience try TRX suspension training.  I loved it so much I became a member.  There are a variety of other classes too so you'll never get bored - Pilates - Power Cycling - Boot Camp - Kickboxing - Boxing - Kettlebell training.  

The equipment is cutting edge and the self powered curve treadmills burn 30% more calories than normal motorized treadmills.  It is a fun, neighborhood environment, and even at peak hours there is no wait for machines and the classes aren't crowded.  Eric (the owner) is always there to help you reach your goals and offers personal training and nutrition counseling as well.  Hands down, best gym in Scottsdale... check it out!
