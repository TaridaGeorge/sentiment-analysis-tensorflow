The best bagel shop I have been to ever!! They have sooo many choices of bagels, and listen to customer feedback (just added a Hawaiian bagel!! ) The staff there are very friendly and efficient! Anyone who lives around mesa must visit this cute bagel shop , you can also place an order to go. There phone number is 480 -807-5010. There prices are very reasonable as well.
I used to always get my coffee from starbucks in the morning, but i am now getting them here, they have the best iced caramel mocchiato's and are cheaper than starbucks..

They also have a punch card that you can use when you purchase anything .. 10th punch is on them!
