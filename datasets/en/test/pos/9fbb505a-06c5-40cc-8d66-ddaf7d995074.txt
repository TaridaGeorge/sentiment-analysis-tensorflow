I've gone here twice for wedding receptions and stayed in the hotel on one of those nights.  I've been impressed by the professionalism of the staff.  Also, the hotel is clean and elegant.  I will write a more detailed review later on, but in the interim, I did want to let folks know that the Renaissance should be commended for a job well done.  Thanks for the pleasant stay and for hosting the receptions.
