I would say this is the best Chinese food I've had so far in Phoenix area. Have eaten twice, though both times take out, when having dinner with friends who live close to the restaurant. 

The honey walnut prawns are really tasty, and my other favorite was their eggplant. So delicious!  I wish they were not so far from where we live or I'd go back more often.
