We had a birthday group here and really enjoyed the evening.  Many raves about entrees- short ribs, scallops, even chicken! A nice red wine.  The pastry chef had made a fantastic chocolate cake- so glad I got to take some home for the next day!  Service- good and friendly.  I look forward to going back.
