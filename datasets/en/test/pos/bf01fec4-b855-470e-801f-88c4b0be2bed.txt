The undated sign on the door suggests that they'll be back "in a month" (from 8/1 or earlier) but that seems unlikely to me.  I hope I'm wrong...  the phone IS still connected & the furnishings are in place, but meanwhile be sure to call before driving here to eat until someone sees them actually open again.
