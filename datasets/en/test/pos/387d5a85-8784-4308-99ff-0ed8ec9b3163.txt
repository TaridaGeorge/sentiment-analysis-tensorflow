BBQ is bar far my favorite food.  I just cant say no when Im around it.  Famous Dave's is the best in the valley.  Since Arizona is not your BBQ state, there's not much to choose from here, but this rocks.

Famous Daves has won many awards for their famous St. Louis style ribs, and something I eat everytime I am there.

They have amazing sides and the BEST corn bread I have ever eaten.  The best time to go is right around 5PM.  That seems to be when they bring out their freshest and new food for the dinner crowds.  

I love this place and its right next to me, so when I get the BBQ hunger, I'll head to Daves.
