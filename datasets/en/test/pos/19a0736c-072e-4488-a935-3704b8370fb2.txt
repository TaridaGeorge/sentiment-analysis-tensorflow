Now this is the kind of place I could really dig. It's a little bit divey, but still warm and inviting. My first visit there I got a greeting and handshake from the owner. The bartender was all smiles and friendliness. Every single person in there (and it was quite a diverse crowd) was enjoying themselves and just having a jolly old time.

On top of that, prices are great, they've got what looks to be a pretty nice pool table, and I hear they have steel tip darts. How can you go wrong there? I'll have to make a few return runs up here, for sure!
