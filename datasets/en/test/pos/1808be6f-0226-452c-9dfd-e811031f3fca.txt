What an amazing experience ! We always have so much fun going to Superstition Farm, the animals are sweet, Toby the farm dog is adorable and so loving. Everyone that runs the farm is amazing!! They have something for everyone. Always have fun events going on and very involved with their customers. Can't wait to go back !
