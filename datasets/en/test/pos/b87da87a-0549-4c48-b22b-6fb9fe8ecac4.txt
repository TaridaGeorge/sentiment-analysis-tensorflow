Let me just be blunt and cut right to the chase here, this place's bread pudding dessert is amazing. Like to die for. i live in New York and went here to visit Arizona State, but may i say one thing Arizona has are resturaunts! I also have to say that the Baked chicken dinner with the Candied Carrots is delish!! i absolutely love this place and will be returning on my next visit.
