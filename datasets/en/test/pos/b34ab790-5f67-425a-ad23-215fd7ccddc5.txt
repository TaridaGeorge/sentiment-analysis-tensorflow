Everytime we're even near the I-10 and Chandler Blvd, we stop here and get sandwiches.  Why?  VEGGIE MEATS!!!!  They have veggie turkey, veggie hamburger and even veggie chicken.  There's nowhere else (that I know of in Phx) that you can get a deli sub made with veggie meats...especially this kind of quality.  We always order the largest size:  a whopping 20 inches, which we can usually get 2-3 meals out of.

And of course their signature subs:  the "Bobbie" (w/cranberry sauce, stuffing, and turkey) and the "Cole Turkey" (w/cheese, turkey, and cole slaw) make this the ultimate veggie sandwich shop.  YUMMY!

p.s. call ahead and order...you'll be glad you did when the line's out the door!
