the food is awesome. 5 years here in arizona and never came across decent chinese food. cantonese they specialize in. this gem is tucked away in a small strip mall on lower buckeye road. my family and i enjoy the food and not to mention the staff. you need to try it~ everything is fresh, even the chow fun noodles. great size portion too.
