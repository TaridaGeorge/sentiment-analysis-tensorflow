I have eatin here 4 different times now. Twice before they expanded and twice after. They have the freshes fish around. Nigiri and Sashimi blows me away along with their other crazy rolls they have. I have not been to any other sushi place in AZ that has so many different rolls to choose from. Big fan of the rolls with jalapeno slivers and siracha ontop of them. Enjoy this place anyday of the week but make sure you pair whatever you get with sake and ichiban!!!!!!!!
