I find myself walking around Kierland a lot to window shop or meet up with some friends. Kierland is a great browsing mall because:
* It's not to big
* Interesting shops
* Lots of good restaurants
* Nice atmosphere

One of the reasons I find myself at Kierland so often is because it is literally five, if that, minutes from my parents house. Some of the stores I like to go in are Crate and Barrel, Z Gallery, 42 Saint, Cos Bar, Anthropologie, a huge Barnes and Nobel, Coach, and J Crew to name a few. It's a nice and relaxing experience unlike most malls which are crawling with teenie boppers.
