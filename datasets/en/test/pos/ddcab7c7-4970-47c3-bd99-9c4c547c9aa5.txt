I had heard about this place since I moved here 3 years ago... But had been detoured by the long wait that comes with the fantastic reputation.
I had some friends in town.. we ventured down there. We waited 45 minutes. We weren't expecting anything great by that point, but were committed to trying it.
The gave us menus in line & took our order, so that when we sat down finally, our food & drink followed immediately.
As doubtful as we were after standing that long, I have to say it was worth every minute. Down to the coffee, everything was spectacular. I ordered the special, steak and eggs. BEST BREAKFAST EVER!
Like me, don't wait so long to try it and don't be discouraged by the long lines. It is phenomenal.
