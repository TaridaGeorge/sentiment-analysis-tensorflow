We had lunch at Taggia about six months ago.  The food was definitely memorable since I still remember what we ate.  We tried the fried calamari, a few of the pizzas, the pumpkin ravioli, and then cannolis for dessert.  Everything was excellent, and the server was attentive.

Taggia is a solid spot and I would eat here even if not staying at the Fireside.  Next time I would like to check it out for dinner.
