I love Burgers & Beer. I love Beer and good food. The Burnin Love Burger at Red Robin rocks! The flavor is all over the place. I can say this about most of their burgers although this burger takes the cake. Oh wait, I forgot I added some of the fried jalapenos from my friends plate into the burger. Yum!

I prefer to sit at the bar to avoid being distracted from my delicious food by the "oh so lovely kids." The bartenders are always Awesome with the specialty drinks Red Robin throws out every so often. One thing I love is that they are cool when I ask to try one of the special drinks and they make a mini.  Although I would recommend the Mug Drafts!
