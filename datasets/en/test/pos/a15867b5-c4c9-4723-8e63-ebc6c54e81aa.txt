I havebeen eating at Nello's proabably for 17 years or so and I have to say that I am a pizza fan and think that they have THE BEST CRUST I HAVE EVER TASTED!!!! Also their spinach salad is to die for...they make all of their own salad dressings and their pesto bianca pizza with sausage and mushrooms is my all time fav!!!!
