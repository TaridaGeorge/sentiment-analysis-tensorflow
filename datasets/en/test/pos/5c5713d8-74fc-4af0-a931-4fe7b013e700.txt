I really like this gym. Just began going. I'm working with a personal trainer - Lorel Stevens. Saw someone else mentioned her as well. She is fantastic! I moved gyms with her when the other place she worked closed. This gym is very clean and modern. The equipment looks new and is well maintained. Typically in the mornings it isn't too crowded. The owners are very nice. While the place is small and doesn't offer classes like the large chains, it has a nice set up and is easy to work with machines or free weights. Lots of cardio options. A workout area in the back where you can do some stretching, sit ups, etc. I think I'm really going to like this place!
