What a great place, a diamond in the rough!!! If you like olives, you will love this place and if you don't....you will still love this place. Great vibe and the staff is amazing. Very helpful, not pushy. Stopped by for lunch and glass of wine and walked around the shop and hung out outside for a bit on a great day. Will definitely be back!!!
