Well, I'm a little biased being that I'm one of the members here; but seriously Eye Lounge exhibits some of the better up and coming artists in town.  A little plug for myself, come see my show there in November (it's in the west gallery Omer!)  If any of you want a card, email me your address and I will send one right out to ya!
