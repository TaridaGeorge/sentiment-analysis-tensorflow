I met some girlfrenz here to catch up and loved it! Staff was friendly and helpful. They were on top of it.  Atmosphere and vibe is relaxing and inviting. I will return and would recommend if you are looking for somewhere to chill.  They didn't have live music but we went on monday night, no big bcuz the malbec we had was awesome and so was the convo.
