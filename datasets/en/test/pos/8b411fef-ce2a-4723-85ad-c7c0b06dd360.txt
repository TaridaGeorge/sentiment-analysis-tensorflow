Fans of Mall shopping everywhere drool over a visit to the upscale Scottsdale Fashion Square. There's just so much to choose from it'll make your head spin!

My favorite shopping spot in the greater phoenix area; Dillards, is tucked neatly away here. They are a huge store with a nicely put together mens dept, which is easily just about the same size as other stores themselves.

There are plenty of nice food court shops and full service restaurants to choose for when you get worn down from an afternoon here.

I might suggest that you hide your wallet when you visit and bring cash or you might end up spending more than you mike like ;). As always spend responsibly and happy shopping my friends!
