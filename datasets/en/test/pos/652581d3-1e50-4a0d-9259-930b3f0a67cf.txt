Amazing find!  They have a huge selection of beers on tap, that are not your typical Budweiser. Also, beers come in Schooners, which just make it more fun to drink.

The bar area can get a little cramped, but if you come to watch the game, you're in luck cause there are flat screens throughout the rest of the tavern's dining area and above the bar that can easily be seen from outside.

I recommend the spinach and artichoke dip, tater tots, steak salad (amazing) and margherita pizza. We have been here multiple times and I can't say anything bad about it!
