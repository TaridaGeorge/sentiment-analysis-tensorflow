LOVE this place.  A great, extensive selection of flavors, from lots of chocolate, hazelnut, and coffee combos, to fresh grapefruit and more fruit-based choices.  

Sooo creamy and rich, big portions that can be mixed flavors for no extra charge, and great prices.  The owners are so friendly and welcoming, too.  A win all the way around (except maybe for my waist).  Tables inside and out. 

YUM.
