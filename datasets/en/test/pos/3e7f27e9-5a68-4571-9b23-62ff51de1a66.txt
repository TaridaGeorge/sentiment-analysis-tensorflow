NYPD delivered food to our hotel for our wedding weekend pool party, and they supplied everything, from the ice and drinks, to food, to utensils and plates. We were so grateful for their awesome customer service. We were fans prior to our catering needs: the food is always fresh, the staff is top notch, and their pizza is a little taste of (East Coast) home for me.
