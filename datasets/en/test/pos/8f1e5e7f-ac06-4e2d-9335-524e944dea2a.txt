One of my favorite downtown eateries, with a hip urban vibe. They get my vote for the best hamburgers in town. The Fez and Balsamic Bleu burgers are out of this world, especially if you pair them with the sweet potato fries. The garlic aioli dipping sauce is the perfect complement. The remainder of the menu items are equally well prepared. The kisras are like individual pizzas, and the lettuce wraps are flavorful and healthy. Wash it all down with the specialty of the house, the mojo-tini. Even our kids enjoy the food here, despite the eclectic nature of the menu. The chicken sandwich is their favorite. Service is always pleasant and responsive. Popular with the gay crowd and for girl's night out. Okay for breeders and families, too.
