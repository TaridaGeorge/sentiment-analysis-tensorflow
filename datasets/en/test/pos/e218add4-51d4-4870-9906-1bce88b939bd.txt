I had the sausage, egg & cheese on an english muffin for brunch today. I had it to go. The sandwich was large compared to your average breakfast sandwich at McDonalds or BK. Overall, it was great. Large egg and sausage patty with plenty of cheese. I ordered a coffee to go, which was decent coffee. The cafe had a nice clean atmosphere and the cashier was friendly.
