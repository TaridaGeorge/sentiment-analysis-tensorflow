...it's not just a gym, it's a lifestyle!   We are members because we obviously love it!  

My family (husband, 4kids-ages 12 thru 24) all frequent the Zone 3/4 times a week.  Sometimes we attend class together but usually we seek out different times.  Each class has a personality and a specific tempo, it's always fun matching personalities/moods to a set class.   

We genuinely look forward to our ZAP time and we will even participate in activities that take place outside the gym:  charity races, hikes, fantasy football, Monday Night Football or personal celebrations.   The members and staff support each other and strive for an enhanced experience.  

Highly recommend!
