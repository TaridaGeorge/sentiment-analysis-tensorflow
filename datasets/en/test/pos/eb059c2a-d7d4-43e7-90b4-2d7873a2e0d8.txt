I was visiting Scottsdale this past weekend and looked up a couple places with vegan food.  I was very excited to find out that zpizza offered vegan cheese.  I was extra excited that there was a restaurant.com gift certificate available for $25 off $50.  It sounds like a lot to spend, but if you get 2 pizzas and a salad, it's about that much.  We got a vegan cheese w/ artichoke, mushroom, and olives and a ZBQ for the meat eaters.  Also got a salad w/ balsamic and the hummus platter.  Everything was very good and everyone who took part in this meal was very satisfied.  I'd highly recommend giving it a try.
