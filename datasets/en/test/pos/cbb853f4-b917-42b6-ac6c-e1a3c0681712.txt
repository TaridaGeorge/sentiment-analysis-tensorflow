Great famly owned gem/neighborhood joint that is a wonderful find!   I am sure some of the recipies for their tasty food belong to the family as well.  Sevice is solid, food is fantastic - I can't find better Hummus anywhere and you have to try something with their House Dressing!  Vegetarian very friendly.  I have been going to Saba's for years (since the mom and dad ran to now being carefully passed along to their kids - guessing post college age) and consistently have experienced great, fresh food and service.  Dont pass this place up!
