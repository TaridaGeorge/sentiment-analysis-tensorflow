Jeff is great! He suggests maintenance but isn't pushy. I told him I had wiper blades @ home and he offered to put them on if I brought them in. Even though the manager at the Union Hills store insisted there was definitely something wrong with my brakes due to the squeaking he heard, Jeff said they were in great shape (see my review for the store on Union Hills before you go there). Great customer service. I will definitely go back to this store. Thanks Jeff!
