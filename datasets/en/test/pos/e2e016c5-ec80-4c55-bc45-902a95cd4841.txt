I hate most Mexican Food (not that anyone cares) but love this place. Very nice family runs it. Everything is fresh. Made to order. And the guy at the front counter is cool!  This is an Official "Scooter Club of Metro Phoenix" approved site.  And since the Scooter Club is Boycotting Flancer's across the parking lot... it's all working out very well!
