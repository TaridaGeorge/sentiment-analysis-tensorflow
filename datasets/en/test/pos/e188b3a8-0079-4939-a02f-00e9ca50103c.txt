This frozen yogurt is amazing. I mean, I love ice cream, but this was just as good, if not better, than any Ben and Jerrys I have ever had! 

The bar has ample but not overwhelming choices for toppings and even includes fresh mango. My conoction was tart frozn yogurt, va va vanilla, and chocolate....topped with captain crunch, Oreos, mango and strawberries.

Writing this review makes me want to return right now!!!
