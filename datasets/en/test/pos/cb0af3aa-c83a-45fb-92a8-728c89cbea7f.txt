I go here every Saturday to watch 12 hours of college football, and its always a great time. The food is actually really really good. I usually get the Caesar Wrap, Kilt Burner Wings, Longshank's Platter, or the Drunken Clams. 

NOTE: It's an Oklahoma bar during college football season, so be prepared if you're rooting for another top team.
