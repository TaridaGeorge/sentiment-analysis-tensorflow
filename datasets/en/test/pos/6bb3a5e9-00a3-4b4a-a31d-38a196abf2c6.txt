LOVE THIS PLACE!!!  I am not rich, I am the average guy a little extra spending money like to go there on special occasions.  Being in the service industry, I know ALLOT of the servers.  Every time I go in I feel like a ROCK STAR!!!  

The service is always great the staff is always wonderful and when I leave, I am full and happily wined.  

Good wine good meat good god lets eat~!
