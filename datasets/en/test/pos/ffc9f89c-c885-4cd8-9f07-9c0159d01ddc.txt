If you're looking for the unique, quirky, off the beaten path side of Phoenix, come to the Welcome Diner.  With 9 stools around a bar near a hot kitchen, it is a small place with a lot to see.  The cooks are very friendly and talkative, and will give you their opinion on their dishes if prompted.

Try the classic cheeseburger, fries, and soda - it's definitely a favorite.

The Welcome Diner is definitely small, but worth the wait (if there even is one.)  It is truly a treasure to the historic Garfield district.
