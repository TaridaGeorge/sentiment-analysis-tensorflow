This place is awesome. The food is great and they have just about any soda you could want and the fries are killer. Im lucky that this place is so close to where I live that I can eat there just about anytime I want. I still cant decide what burger is better the Teriyaki Burger, Philly Burger, or the New York Burger. They are all so good.
