I eat here almost on a daily basis so I'm not sure why it has taken me this long to post something about it, but it's definitely time.

First off, the folks that work here are amazing -  accommodating, friendly.  Prices are great, and the menu has a wide enough variety that I still haven't gotten sick of the food.

Everything it seems is purchased fresh daily - the bread, croissants, produce, and also there are always homemade soups to choose from...haven't found one I don't like yet.

I am sure that most of their clientele comes from the two office buildings on this property, but if you are in the area and are looking for a quiet spot to grab a quick, tasty lunch...drop by.  The girls will take care of you with a smile.
