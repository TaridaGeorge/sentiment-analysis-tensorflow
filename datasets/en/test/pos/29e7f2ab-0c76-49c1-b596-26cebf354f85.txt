My wife and I were very excited to find an Indian restaurant in the West valley.  We had been driving all the way to I-17 and Bell road to get our Indian on and now we have a much closer alternative!  We have been there three times and they have more than exceeded our expectations.  The buffet is terrific and varied with food that is piping hot (so be careful!).  As a vegan, I was pleased to see a salad, fruit and vegetables section of the buffet.  Again, the food is delicious and the service is attentive, don't hesitate to try it out!
