Honestly, I wasn't even a fan of beer before this place (yeah yeah yeah... What can I say, I love my hard liquor). All the bartenders are knowledgeable and helped me discover my favorite beer. They even let me sample some before I committed to the one.

Great service, convenient location, quick service, knowledgable staff, affordable prices for craft beers, and a overall sexy staff (has no effect on my beer, but great candy for my eyes).

Check this place out with your friends! My recommendation would be to be adventurous and try to discovery a new beer and don't be afraid to ask the staff tons of questions like I did!

Cheers!
