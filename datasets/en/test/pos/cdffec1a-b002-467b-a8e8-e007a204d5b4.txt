Still sending my daughter here going on 3+ years! Others are constantly impressed at how articulate and thoughtful my daughter is for only being 3...it's thanks to the great staff at MVCP. 

Now that my daughter is in the Preschool room things are starting to get really fun for me as a parent. Officer Friendly came in a few weeks ago to teach them about policemen and we're trick or treating at the Senior Center this week. 

The other parents and kids at this daycare are great and both my daughter and I have formed lasting friendships. 99% of the staff has been at the daycare since she started at 3 months old and I trust everyone there to watch my child during the day.
