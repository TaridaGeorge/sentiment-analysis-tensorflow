It is quite overwhelming watching football here on Sundays. With every game on and trying to pay attention to your fantasy team is tough.

I tried the "Big Unit" and I thought the hotdog, itself, tasted like it was microwaved. The Chili, for some reason I cant point out why,was the best ive ever tasted. The night before I had ribs and wings. Both really good

The bartender on Sunday was cool. I spent over $60 but the beer and food was worth it
