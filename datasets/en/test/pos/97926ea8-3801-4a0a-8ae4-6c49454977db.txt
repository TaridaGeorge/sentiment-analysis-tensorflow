My girlfriend told me about this place. Her and her husband's new favorite place and now it's mine! She lives in the neighborhood and I drove from N. Scottsdale for a breakfast catch up with her. This is REALLY good stuff! We got the hash and blueberry pancakes. Best hash I can remember w/ chunks of corned beef and potatoes,eggs poached perfect and a little hollandaise sauce. I wasn't sure about the sauce but it took it over the top! The pancakes also delightful with whipped butter and maple syrup. Very good service even when we stayed 2 hours catching up. There were only a couple customers and I'm worried this Ma&Pa place will be a victim of the bland omnipresent franchises. Please check this place out if you're in the area!!! I'm taking my sister and aunt saturday before going to the movies,
