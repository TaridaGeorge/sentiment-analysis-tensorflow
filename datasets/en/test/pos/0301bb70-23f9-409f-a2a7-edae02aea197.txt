d'lish is for sure the perfect name for this little place. When you walk in, the atmosphere is great, what with the snazzy furniture, friendly staff, and the plenty of customers in line, eager for the fresh food they serve up. Their menu is expansive and you might feel overwhelmed by all the breakfasts, soups, salads, wraps, sandwiches, are you feeling overwhelmed as I talk about all the choices that will overwhelm you?! Last time I went there, I ordered the nuts n' berries salad, the perfect toss of greens, blueberries, goat cheese, candied walnuts, and a raspberry walnut vinaigrette. It's perfect! I've also had their butternut squash soup, YUM! I try to try something different all the places I eat, and at D'lish, it'll be a while till I run out of new options. Go here!!
