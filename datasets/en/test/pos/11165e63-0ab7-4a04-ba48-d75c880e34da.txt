Wow, I wasn't expecting much from this place until a few of my friends told me about it. It was my first time coming here, and I got to say, there's no other bar like it.  I love the ambiance and decor. The lighting was perfect for a good night out and friends visiting from other states. I thought it was going to be fancy smancy, but it had a good casual laid back atmosphere. 

The one thing that makes it stand out from other bars is that they show movies. Sometimes you just want to chill out and have a few drinks while watching a movie rather than dancing or talking. It may sound weird, but it was actually fun. I am definitely considering this spot to be a great date night with a friend or someone I'm interested in taking. Very cool!!
