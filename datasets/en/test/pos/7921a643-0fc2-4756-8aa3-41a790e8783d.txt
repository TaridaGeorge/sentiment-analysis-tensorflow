Visited Rare Earth with a Groupon with a friend for a Friday lunch.  Shared the Caprese Salad, the Meatball Pizza and a glass of Boom Boom Syrah (OK, that I didn't share but my friend was driving soooo...)

I will definately be back even without the Groupon, the salad was amazing the pizza was thin and crispy, perfectly done, and the bartender/server Robert was wonderfully attentive!!

Looking forward to bringing a date or a group of friends !!!
