This place is awesome, exactly what Phoenix needs. 
They have cool clothes by local and hip vendors, like RVCA. They have tshirts, jackets, hats, dresses, jewelry, all things that you won't come across just anywhere. That is the great thing, it is independent and not your run of the mill clothing store, the stuff is actually cool. Not to mention is a locally owned.
The prices are high, but hey, it is stuff you won't find just anywhere and I don't feel bad about supporting a local business that is part of a great cultural change in downtown.
Drop in on First Friday and check them out.
