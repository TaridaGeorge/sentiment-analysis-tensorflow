We just finished a 3-day weekend at the resort and I cannot say enough about the facility or the staff , so I'll try to hit the highlights:

The pool deck staff are outstanding.  They are friendly and fast.

The pool and the hot tub are clean and both at the perfect temperatures.

The food is phenomenal.  I highly recommend the bento boxes and all the salads.  I would also suggest selecting the asian inspired creations.  The only average selection we had was the kobe beef hot dog.  

The spa is spotless and the staff is superb.  Both my fiancee and I reported to each other it was one of the top three messages we had ever had.  I would recommend asking for Tim C.

The rooms are tastefully appointed and the bed, sheets and towels are deluxe.

I am already planning another trip to the Sanctuary.

Enjoy!
