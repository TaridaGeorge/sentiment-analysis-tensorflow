Went with our young kids for a bite to eat after the youth museum. Home-cooking style place (cozy chicken noodle soup; pulled pork sandies were delish with the sweet hot peppers too and sides of mac-n-cheese for the sandies was enough for my 2 kids); also their milk shakes are one of the most generous in terms of ice-cream, ever! Staff was very friendly, place was small, but bright and clean. I would go back if I was in Mesa again.
