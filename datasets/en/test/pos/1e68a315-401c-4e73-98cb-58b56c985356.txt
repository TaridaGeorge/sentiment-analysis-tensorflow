My husband and I visited The Soda Shop on 7/24/10 and it was a blast from the past I got 4 types; a grape Pop Shoppe soda from my childhood, Nesbitt's California Honey Lemonade I could get these in Chicago as recent as 2005, and two new ones for me a DRY soda (marketed towards grown ups) and Reinhart's hand drawn Root Beer. This store front beats ordering off the internet any day so go give them your business people. If they don't have something you want let them know and they will call you once it is instock.
