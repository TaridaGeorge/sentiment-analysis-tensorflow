It has been hard for me to find a quality massage therapist. After thorough review, I decided to try Hawaiian Experience Spa. The staff was very welcoming and kind. My massage therapist Amy was very detailed in our initial consultation. Throughout the massage she verified if the pressure was okay for me. All in all, I will be back again for a massage. Massage Heights and Massage Envy are not comparable to the Hawaiian Experience Spa. I will be back again. Highly recommended.
