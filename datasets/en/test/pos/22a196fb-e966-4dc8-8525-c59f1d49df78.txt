Now, I've been to many yogurt spots and by far, U-Swirl has the best yogurt & topping selection. There are some places that have great toppings, but not the best yogurt and vice versa.  Some have really good yogurt, but not the best toppings.

I'm more of the fruity, sorbet type of yogurt kinda girl.  The milky, creamy yogurt doesn't cut it for me. 

Here's my regular "Fruitylicious" order:
I swirl the following flavors:  Coconut,  Mango, Pomegranate, and Strawberry.
Toppings:  Cheescake bites, Strawberry, Blueberries, Blackberries, cookie dough, mochi, honey pecans, granola, and last but not least, you top with 2 or 3 frosted animal cookies.

I have yet to find a place that tops U-swirl.  So until then, I will continue to visit once a week to get my weekly yogurt fix.
