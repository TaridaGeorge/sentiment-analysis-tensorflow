This is one of my new favorites places to bring people who are from out of town. It's something different that I think real "Foodies" will enjoy. Although the restaurant itself is dark and cramped, it's worth going to over and over again. 

I ordered the Shepherd's Pie Pasty, it was very filling and delicious. Although I had to wait 20 minutes for it, it was worth waiting for a fresh out of the oven pasty. But if you're ever in a rush, a good thing about this place, is that you can call ahead and request for them to start cooking your pasty so that it is ready to be served once you arrive.
