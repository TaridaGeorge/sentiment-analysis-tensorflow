everything about this place is simply "awesome".
spent an afternoon with my man gary and my dearest friend tangie for a bite to eat and delicious mixed drinks.
we had the place to ourselves before people began rolling in.
i cannot say anything negative when this is a sister restaurant to one of my favorite hangouts "AZ88".
every bite brought out each rich flavor - exquisite.
every drink brought through delicious-deliciousness. love the mojito.
ambiance, service, layout and design, and the history of the building is more than inviting.
i am going back for more - when i am in town!
