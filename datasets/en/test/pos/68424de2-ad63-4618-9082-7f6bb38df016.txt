This is a very nice place with fresh, homemade food including salads, pizzas and yummy baked goods. I got some cookies and was really impressed by how "real" they were (like something my grandmother would have made). I'm going to have to hit them up for breakfast soon as they have what looks like a pretty good set up for coffee and espresso, and I'm certain they have some marvelous breakfast treats too!
