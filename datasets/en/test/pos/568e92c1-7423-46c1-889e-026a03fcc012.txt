I've been going to Spring Training games here for close to ten years now and this place is really the closest you can get to a Wrigley experience in the southwest - part sports bar, part stadium, all fun. Make sure you get an Old Style from Mark the Beer Guy (he can usually be found around home plate on the mezzanine.) As a rule, I avoid the concession stand hot dogs in favor of a Vienna Beef cart serving up Chicago style dogs, but we've all had those before. So if you're feeling adventurous, try the pork tenderloin sandwiches from the trailer behind the left field bleachers. Not good for you, but good. Ridiculously good. Perfectly breaded and deep fried. A true testament to the greatness that is Iowan pork.
Oh, yeah, and there's some baseball being played, too.
