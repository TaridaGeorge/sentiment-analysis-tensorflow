I've been going to Pete's with my family on AZ roadtrips for as long as I can remember, so I know these well:

The rules:

No  debit or credit cards
No checks
No 50s or 100s
No separate orders
No ketchup--don't even ask.
No Sundays
No feeding the pigeons
Clean up after yourself, your mother does not work here.

So bossy, so cheap, so mouth-wateringly delicious. Forget about your precious ketchup, Pete's Special Sauce knocks my socks off. Careful with parking, it can be cutthroat--especially on Fridays.
