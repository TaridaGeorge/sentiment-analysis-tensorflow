With the yogurt craze being in full effect, I have tried yogurt at a lot of different places, but it is Yogurt Land that I keep going back to.  It could be partly because this location is the closest yogurt place to my house since Ice Tango closed, or it could be that they are the cheapest in town (only 30 cents an ounce....in Scottsdale), but truly I think it is the yogurt.  They always have a good selection of the tart and fruity vs. the rich and creamy flavors.  I love to get peanut butter and chocolate and load it with peanut butter cups....mmmm.  The red velvet is also yummy, and the Irish Cream they had around St. Patty's day was amazing!  Plus, those pink and green spoons are just too cute!
