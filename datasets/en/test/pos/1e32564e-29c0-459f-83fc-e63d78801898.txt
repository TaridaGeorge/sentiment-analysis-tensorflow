Try a Rainbow Sherbet freeze!

It is a shake with out milk, made with Sprite (or soda water) It is the most refreshing best tasting drink around.

If the person behind the counter looks @ you funny, just tell them Daren said just make it the same as a shake, same # of scoops, same ounces of liquid, etc. 

18 years ago, I was the one slinging the sherbet. (19th Ave and Bell Rd)

Thanks for the memories John and Mary Young!

I prefer mine a little runny, so I can actually drink it.
