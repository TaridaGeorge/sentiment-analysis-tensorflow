I am a self-professed donut junkie. I love donuts and will try them from local places whenever I can. Bosa definitely did not disappoint!

I had the Toasted Coconut Glazed and it was as fluffy and light as a cloud, with the perfect balance of donut and coconut flavors. I'd definitely go out of my way to eat one again! 

Also had the donut holes- it's a good thing that I only purchased a dozen. If it had been more, I'm pretty sure that I wouldn't have been to stop myself from eating every single one of them. Best donut hole I've had in a very long time. So good!

If you love or even like donuts, this is a must stop, you will not be disappointed!
