I went to Toyama with a few friends on Saturday night and had a great experience. The owner and his wife were very nice and she greeted us when we arrived at Toyama. 

The sushi was great, very fresh and plenty of different choices to choose from. We were all very happy with our food and service. 

They also had Toro available ... which has been hard to find.  My fiance is always asking for it when we go to sushi places and it's been rare that anyone has had it. 

Toyama is great  for a smaller place to have dinner with friends.
