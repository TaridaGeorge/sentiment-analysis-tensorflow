I have gone to this UPS store for years.  The staff are all very friendly and efficient.  One time I was in and a very senior woman was sending a package.  The man helping her was patient and courteous and treated her with utmost respect.  It was nice to see him treat an older person with such dignity.  They are very good to their customers and if you want a smiling welcome when you walk through the door you won't be disappointed.
