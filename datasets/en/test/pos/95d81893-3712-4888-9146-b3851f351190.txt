Simply  BREATH TAKING.. Went here with  hunny  for dinner .. It was simply  beautiful.. We had someone greet us at the doorstep, very courteous and friendly.  i love the atmosphere there because it's so relaxing, tranquil, and seems away from it all.

Dinner was beyond my  expectations  I had lobster bisque, not too creamy, I liked that. They often have some great vegetarian options as well.. I had the edamame/ scallion ravioli and martini which was delicious  . Hunny  had the fillet minus the bacon..

Oh...this place has some of the best views of Camelback and Paradise Valley .  Upon arrival, you can feel your shoulders start to drop and let the relaxation begin...
