Called Scott in a panic, as our dinosaur Dell 400 Vostro would not power up. Explained to him what the symptoms were and he knew immediately that our extinct but vital animal needed a new power supply and instructed me to come down. Got there, he took it immediately and 25 minutes and $66 later, we were saved. We are small family business that HAD to have this machine. Scott saved us and we will never use anyone else to help us out. He and Amy were courteous, fast and honest! Thanks guys!
