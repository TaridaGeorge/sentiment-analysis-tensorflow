Ah what can I say about the Newsroom. It's a non-descript place with bars on the window and it never looks like it's open. Oh but trust me, it is.

It's a place I like to go when I don't want to deal with people or get dressed up. Pete the owner is crazy, but has fun. The jukebox rocks and there are  pool tables that attract a lot of people. Some cool retro video games are there. The crowd is diverse from local artists chilling, to modsters, goths, freaks, bikers and old dudes from the neighborhood. It's one of those places that you would find in a shit-town in the midwest. And I would know.

Drinks naturally are very cheap and with a super long bar, it's generally easy to get seats. Always meet a diverse group of people there and Pete keeps everyone in line.
