Went to Tim at Mr Mechanic with a clutch problem.  A dealer told me I needed a new lutch for $860.  Another retail shop told me the same thing for $920.  Went to Tim & he took the time to check out the problem.  Result: I only needed a new clutch cable for $140.  Tim is the man.  Good diagnostics, good prices & good work!
