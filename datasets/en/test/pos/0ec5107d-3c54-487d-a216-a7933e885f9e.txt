After suggestions from the ladies at Made, Bunky Boutique, and Sage, we had to check out Palatte. One word: WOW!! 

It's an old house converted into a restaurant with a gorgeous, large outdoor eating area. The staff is friendly, courteous, and more than willing to offer up suggestions for and explanations of things on the menu. 

You order at a little window into the kitchen inside the house, and they bring your food out to you. The food id good. Correction: The food is great.  Correction of the correction: The food is really freakin' awesome. 

We just wish we could have made it back here to try the lunch before we had to head back home.
