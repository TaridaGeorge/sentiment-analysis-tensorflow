A sweet little gem, tucked away from the madness of Mill Avenue.  The staff is not only friendly but also very passionate about the food they prepare and serve.  They are recently under new management and working to restore the deli to the good old days.  Most of the items are vegetarian and there are even a few vegan options - including the tamales.  I would recommend a visit (and many return visits!) for the delicious tamales, tasty soups and flavorful salads.
