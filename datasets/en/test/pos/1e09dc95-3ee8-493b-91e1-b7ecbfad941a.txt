This is another business I'm surprised no one has reviewed yet. 

Today I took my Blackberry in because the internet wasn't working. I thought it was just operator error since it sends and receives emails and makes calls. What else should I expect it to do? 

Turned out it wasn't operator error, but a bad device. Dominique was courteous helpful and quick. Best of all there wasn't a wait at the service desk. He took the phone in the back for a few minutes and came back to let me know it wasn't my fault after all and that I needed a warranty replacement.  

I was in and out in just a few minutes with the information I needed to get yet another new Blackberry under warranty...my third one. Hopefully the third time is the charm.
