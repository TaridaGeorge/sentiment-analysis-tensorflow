I have had some horrible experiences in the past with other dentist. When I came to Harris dental 2 years ago, I had no hope. The Harris family helped me see that there was hope and I could have a beautiful smile again. The staff is so friendly and the doctors are so knowledgeable. I will never see another dentist!!
