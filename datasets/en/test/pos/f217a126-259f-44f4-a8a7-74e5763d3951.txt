After a week of no air conditioning and finally concluding that the cause was electrical in nature, I gave Good Guys a call. Mike answered right away and was able to come out to Gilbert that same afternoon! He was patient with my lack of electrical/AC maintenance knowledge and figured out the problem soon after arriving. Not only did he save me from the hell that was having no A/C, but also did so very quickly and at an awesome price. I would HIGHLY recommend Mike for any and all of your electrical needs!
