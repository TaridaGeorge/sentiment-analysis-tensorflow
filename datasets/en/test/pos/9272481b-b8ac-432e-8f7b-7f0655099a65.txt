This is a great coffee house and as the central PHX area starts to gentrify this place will certainly be one of the go to spots to meet up and chill out.  In the same space as the MonOrchid gallery, you can't beat it for chill atmosphere.  Coffee.  Amazingly well-done.  New drink for me: espresso-spritzer....yes, a fresh pour of espresso with club soda and a wee bit of agave.  Jump-start and refresh all in the same glass.
