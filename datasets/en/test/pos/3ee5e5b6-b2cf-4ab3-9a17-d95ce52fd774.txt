I have been going to celebrity tanning for about a year now and although the girls there have always been nice, I had a great experience with one of the girls there named Sierra. I waited while she was thoroughly explained why another customer needed lotion and just listening to her it became clear that she really knew what she was talking about which ensured the customer in front of me and myself that our health and best interest was what she was going for. The beds are amazing and give me a different kind of glow and I would recommend them to anyone! And if Sierra is working you'll be taken care of! Keep it up celebrity!!
