I grew up in the Bay Area in California, so I know good Chinese food when I taste it. This is the best Chinese food that I found in the seven years I lived in Phoenix.
The flavor is fantastic, the prices are reasonable and the service is something of years gone bye.
If you are looking for an upscale dining experience, this place is not for you. The atmosphere is casual and laid back. So throw on your shorts and flip-flops and head to a great restaurant for a great dinner.
(I also hear they deliver but I always lived outside of their delivery area. My wife and I would drive over twenty minutes each way just to eat dinner here.)
