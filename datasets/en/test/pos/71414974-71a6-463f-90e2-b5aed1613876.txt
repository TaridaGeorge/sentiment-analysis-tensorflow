Love this Target! Big, clean, New. Friendly employees. They have everything - pharmacy, grocery, STARBUCKS! Yes! 

I would stay away around the time the high school across the street gets out (2-4pm). The place is crawling with annoying teenagers everywhere, in the store, the parking lot, parents picking them up etc. 

I'm not sure if it's a limited time thing but currently the Starbucks there does this thing called a "treat receipt" where you can bring back the receipt within 14 days and get any drink ANY size for $2. Awesome!
