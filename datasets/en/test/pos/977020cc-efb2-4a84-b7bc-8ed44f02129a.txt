We were at a birthday party and there was this yummy 4 ft long sub there.  My daughter (5) declared it was the best sub she has ever had.  We have been to the actually place many times (sort of grubby in a grubby area) but it is very good.  The kids meal comes with a small soft serve cone in vanilla or rootbeer.
