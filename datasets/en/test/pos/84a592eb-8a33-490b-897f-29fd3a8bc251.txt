Love this little store! I just finished my very first tri, they were immensely helpful. I was able to rent a wetsuit with no problems at all. The staff coached me a bit on what to expect, and were so helpful. Way far out of my way to get here (I live in El Mirage), but worth the trek. Wish there was one in my neck of the woods!
