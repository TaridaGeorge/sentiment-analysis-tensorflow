I took 27 of my relatives here on a cold gloomy day and it was still amazing! Even though I have been here quite a few times before, I still learned things from our tour guide that I did not know about this amazing place. If you are visiting or have a guest visiting Phoenix this place is a must! Some tour guides are better than others, but the gentleman we ended up with this last time around was phenomenal!  Also, I would actually recommend going about two/three days after a big rain storm because all of the desert flowers will bloom and it looks absolutely beautiful.
