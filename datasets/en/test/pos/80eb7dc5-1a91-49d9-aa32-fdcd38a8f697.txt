Best park ever! So glad we found this place for our little ones! This place has the most authentic miniature train for the kids to ride.  Even a mini miniature train in another part.  Along with an old carousel and a huge playground with sprinkler system....can't be beat in that awful dry Arizona heat.  We spent hours here and wore our little munchkins out.
