Awesome caesar salad.  Really.  I love their caesar salads... which is kinda weird to say about a steakhouse....

I don't care.

I LOVE THEIR CAESAR SALADS!

I did once order the porterhouse for two, and it was ridiculously large.  Like, it could have fed a family of Somalians for a year.... or a black bear... it was freakin' huge!
