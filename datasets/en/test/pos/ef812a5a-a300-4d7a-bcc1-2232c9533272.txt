I really like this place a lot.  They have a great happy hour menu with a lot of small plate choices.  It looks small from the front, but it is quite large.  I really enjoy the patio out back.  Plenty of heaters for cold nights.  Food was very delicious!  Can't wait till the next time I hide my bike to rula bula.  Also patio is ultra dog friendly so that is an extra point for me!
