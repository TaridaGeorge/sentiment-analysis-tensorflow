For some reason this place is my all time favorite restaurant right now. I go here for lunch every time i visit my sister in Scottsdale. 
It is adorable inside and I love the little market so you can get the HUMMUS TO GO! I am obsessed with the hummus. It has tomatoes onians and feta on top, YUM!
I also like the grilled artichokes, which are not what you'd expect, its more like a salad, but a delicious one at that. The drinks are always good and the service is always friendly and attentive. I also save room and stop in the market to get some yummy gelato afterwards, perfection i must say.
