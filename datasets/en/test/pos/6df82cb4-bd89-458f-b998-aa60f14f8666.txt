What a charming, cozy restaurant! I went to lunch there for the first time. Onion Tarte is savory and delicious. The Roquefort salad is a good mix of savory cheese and the sweet apples and figs. The fillet torta is nice. DON'T skip dessert. I can't say enough good things about their pear tarte. Crumbly, buttery crust, and the tarte filling is so smooth with great vanilla flavor. The pear tarte was so good it made me cry!
