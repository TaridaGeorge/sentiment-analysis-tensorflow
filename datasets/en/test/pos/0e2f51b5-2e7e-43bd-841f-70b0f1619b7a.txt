So I have been to Stax a few time's now and figured I might as well start my Yelp experience on this amazing place. The burger's they are serving up here are legendary. all the burgers and sandwiches come on slider sided portions, so you never all have overfill yourself with the sheer goodness of these burgers. I always get 2 or 3 different types of burgers when i get there so I can try all the different types of meats offered. The menu always comes with some exotic type of game on the menu. You can get wild hair, wild boar, even  kangaroo!!! Grab a could different burgers and a nice plate of the smothered tot's and I'm sure you'll have an outstanding day
