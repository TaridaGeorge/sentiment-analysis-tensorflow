Hubbard Family Swim School has become a staple for our family. You can feel the warmth and dedication on every visit. Our kids love it and are excited to come to every lesson. We even have birthday parties here!

The instruction is top-notch and it's evident while watching through the huge glass wall.

Most of all, my 5 year old is a much better swimmer than I am, his father. Thanks to Hubbard.
