As far as atmosphere and drink selection go, it's hard to beat anywhere in Arizona, let alone in downtown Phoenix. I love how this spot books free live music every single night, displays local artists' work on the walls, has an ever-increasing selection of brews and is a great example of historic preservation. They also accept Phx Bux, so you can save some cash on your drinks. Score!

Yeah, it can be packed on the weekends. And sometimes there are annoying DJs. Sure, the "bar" is actually a half-kitchen, and the "tap" is actually an oversized fridge packed to the bones with bottles of suds. But I'll take this place over just about anywhere else, any time. Here's hoping they install the promised taps soon and open that patio space out back.
