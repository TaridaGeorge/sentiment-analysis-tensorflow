Today I decided to take a little light rail adventure, with Lux as the end goal.  I was very happy when I got here to find plenty of comfy seating and a menu with many different options.  I decided on the hot apple cider, topped with whipped cream. It blew my socks off.  

I then settled myself in to a supercomfy chair on the wall and spent a while reading and people watching and generally enjoying my surroundings.  Everyone at this place was giving off good vibes, and I had a fantastic relaxing afternoon.  I will be making this trip more often.
