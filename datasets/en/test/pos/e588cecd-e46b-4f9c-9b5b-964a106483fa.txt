For fast food it's awesome... I moved to Los Angeles and I always think about going back to get some of my favorite dishes.

Not only is the food great, the people who work there are really nice.

I've never had any issues with the food quality and I've been there many times. 

If you're going to get take out or a quick bite. This is the place to go!
