Sashimi is as outstanding as I remembered. The ramen and appetizer combo for $12 is a steal and leaves plenty for my lunch box. Got the junmai saki at the happy hour with a plate of gyoza. Nice and quiet on Wed dinner time. Love love the sushi chefs who always do an amazing job slicing those beautiful fishes!
