This is seriously the BEST gelato I have had outside of Italy. Maybe that is because it is owned and run by Italians!

That should be enough, but they carry over 30+ flavours of gelato even whipping up some unique seasonal flavours such as Green Apple and Pumpkin. I sampled the chocolate jalape√±o gelato which was delicious but different! I can tell you I never saw that flavour in Italy. 

I tried the Creme Brulee, Rum and Nut, and the Whiskey gelato. YUM!

I would love to stop in and have some coffee and a cannoli and maybe pick up a gelato cake for an event or birthday!
