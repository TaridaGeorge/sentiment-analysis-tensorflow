Just had our first experience with TIMO. Outstanding. Food, ambiance, service, etc.
The tapas are terrific and the environment is great. Try the bruschetta, the lamb chop tapa's , the escargot, and the creme brulee! You won't regret it!
Fans of Postino's will find it a worthy competitor/alternative.
