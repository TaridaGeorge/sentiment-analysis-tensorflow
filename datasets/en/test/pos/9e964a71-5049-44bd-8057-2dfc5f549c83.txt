This place rocks, plain and simple. These people know what they're doing. They have a special that I love -  a croissant stuffed with rosemary lemon chicken with some sauce and OMG, it is delicious. It came with a spring mix side salad with feta and a yummy housemade vinaigrette. I wish it was a regular dish because I've been thinking about it for the past two months. The macaroons are 3 bucks a piece, but they are worth it. I've tried almost all of them and the best ones are raspberry rose and caramel - buttery and oh so good.
