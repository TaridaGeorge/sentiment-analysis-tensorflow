Essence Bakery has a cozy atmosphere, friendly and attentive staff, and some of the best macaroons you will ever taste. Their award winning chef never disappoints. My favorite meal is the open faced steak sandwich with blue cheese. It's so tasty! While the inside can be a little loud with so many conversations going on, it is definitely a busy atmosphere and a nice place to go to lose yourself in your meal.
