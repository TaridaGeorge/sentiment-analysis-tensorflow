The 99 Only chain is not like other dollar stores, OK? it is way better. The best thing is they always have awesome bargains on produce. At the back of the Store you will find an array of veggies for way less than you would pay at the super market. Of course the rest of the store is also amazing and will force you to fill up your little purple cart whether you like it or not. Now, I have been to 3 or 4 different locations in Phoenix and they are very consistent, all laid out pretty much the same and the same merchandise so find the nearest 99 cent only store to your house and go NOW.
