I was impressed. Steak was cooked perfectly. I asked for medium-rare and it actually came out medium rare. The waitress was attentive and had a great, friendly personality. The sides were tasty as well. I had a couple mixed drinks that were made by a professional. So many people want to be bartenders but few actually are. The bartender here can call himself a professional. Great drinks.
