Wow, I cannot believe I have somehow missed a review of Echo Coffee when I have been telling everyone that I know about it!

I love that it is local.  I love that it is NOT bohemian (though I like those types of coffee shops too), meaning, it has a certain atmosphere of modernity and professionalism.  It is less frenzied than many other coffee shops I have frequented.  I love the food, and I think it is significant to note that they offer more than donuts and sweet rolls; the salads and sandwiches are great!  And ya gotta love it when they say, "Please sit down, and we'll bring it to you when it's ready."  Yea!
