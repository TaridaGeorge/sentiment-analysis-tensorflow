I have found that win or loose their games are super entertaining.  Living downtown I starting just attending a few games here and there....and for the 2010-11 season I took the plunge and got me just one REALLY GOOD season seat in The Club.  I am just 18 rows up from the court.  You'll find me there with my jersey or my cap, keeping the Suns in check, shouting "Defense" or hollaring at the officials for bad calls.  
GO SUNS!!
