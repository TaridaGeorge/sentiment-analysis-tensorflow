The Container Store has finally arrived in Arizona!

I fell in love with this store when I lived in DC and I'm so glad that we now have one in our own backyard.

The Container Store is an organizers heaven and a dis-organized persons savior!You can organize your entire house, office, closet, whatever you want...there is a container for everything! 

If you haven't been to a Container Store before, go and check out the new store here in AZ...you won't be disappointed!!
