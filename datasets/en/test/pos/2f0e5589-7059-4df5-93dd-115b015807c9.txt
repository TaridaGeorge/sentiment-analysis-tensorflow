This is the first location that U.S. Egg opened in the valley and now they have one in Scottsdale and plan on opening a 3rd in Chandler. It is a locally owned business by what I think are brothers. You can see them working at each of their locations from open to close. Their food is amazing and is perfect for lunch and breakfast. My business partner and I stopped in for lunch and to my pleasant surprise they have an entire menu dedicated to the Atkins and South Beach diets. I'm not officially on either of those diets but I do try to steer clear of carbs during lunch and dinner. This menu was built for me. I ended up ordering a grilled chicken breast with scrambled eggs, tomatoes, and avocado. It was delicious and I was in heaven. I will definitely be frequenting U.S. Egg more often.
