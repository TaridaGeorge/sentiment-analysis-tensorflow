5 dang stars. I'll give you my two disclaimers at the end.

Absolutely gorgeous hotel and grounds. The room was great. The service was great. Great, great, great.

The pool. Sigh. It was the adult pool. Life is so relaxing without other people's kids around. He he. They planted these flowers on ledges around the pool, and the multi-colored petals gently rained down on you throughout the day. Sigh again.

OK. Two disclaimers. Yes, the room's expensive. Duh. But they don't unnecessarily rip you off at the pool or the lobby bar or whatever. And second, we had the most beautiful weather in our trip to Phoenix. That's it.

5 star me!
I would go back in a second.
woot... yow, bill
