We have definitely found a new favorite place to eat!!! Down in the heart of Glendale, this restaurant is an absolute find!!! We got a sample of the pumpkin soup and was it yummy!!! The owner told us her husband made it for the 1st time last night and am I glad we were there for the inauguration!!! All the food we had, stuffed cabbage, goulash and noodles and pierogies and sausage was excellent. The service was fast and extremely friendly. There's only 5 or 6 tables in this restaurant, so you definitely need a reservation. We will be back!!!!
