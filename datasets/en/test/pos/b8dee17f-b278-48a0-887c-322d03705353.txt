What can you say about a grocery store?! I do the bulk of my shopping at this one, and i can say that i have never had a bad experience. The staff is friendly and helpful, and the lines move along pretty good, and the store is clean. Prices are a few cents higher than FRYS and SUPER WALMART but the meat and deli stuff are in my opinion much better. Also there is a Starbucks and US Bank inside. Also, online shopping and delivery is available at this location!

They also have a gas station, just becareful in the morning as the Coke guy stocks the tiny mart, nearly forcing you to climb over mountains of soda to get to the cashier!
