Inexpensive, incredible and the food is out of this world. Didn't expect this from a hole in the wall in Tempe! Cornish Pasty Company is a place you MUST visit if you are in the surrounding area. Not only is the food delicious, but the atmosphere puts you right into the heart of Eurpoe. A must have are the garlic "chips" which are actually thick french fries.
