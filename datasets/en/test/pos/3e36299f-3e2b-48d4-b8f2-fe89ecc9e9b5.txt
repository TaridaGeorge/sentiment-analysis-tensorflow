I was vegan, and now a am vegetarian. I loveeeee this place. So nice to go somewhere where I can eat ANYTHING I want on the menu. Everything I have tired is amazing. For a year I did not try the icecream desserts only because I was afraid I would like them too much. Well I gave in and had one.... AMAZING. So yummy. Their bowls are all really good, and huge enough to share.
