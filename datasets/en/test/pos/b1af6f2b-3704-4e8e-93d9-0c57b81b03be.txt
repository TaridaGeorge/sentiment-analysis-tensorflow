Nice.

I called in for urgent service and since they couldn't see me when I needed, the owner gave me outstanding advice for alternative, affordable, and reliable quick lube, oil, filter at a competitor who isn't looking to make a profit on the LOFR (as they have alternative motives for obtaining that business).  Means I can go back to Cary's but get my immediate needs handled.

Honesty is huge for me... trust is why you keep going back to a place or take their recommendations.  And it's why you Yelp about 'em.
