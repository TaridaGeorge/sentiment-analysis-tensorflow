Durants ROCKS.

I love the red velvet walls.
I love walking through the kitchen to get to the restaurant.
I love the garlicky cheesy bread that probably has a million calories in it.
I love the steaks.
I love the decor.
I love the bar.

We all ordered different items when we went here for dinner one night, and all raved about what we had.  I don't think you can go wrong, no matter what you order.  It's amazing, delicious, and very very unique.
