Billary, Obama and Edwards have nothing to do with the Democratic Party of Arizona.

Governor Napolitano was re-elected in 2006 by a margin of 27 points in a heavily Republican state. Terry Goddard was re-elected Attorney General by a margin of 20 points in a heavily Republican state. Phil Gordon was re-elected mayor of our largest city by a margin of 8 billion points. 

Nuff said.
