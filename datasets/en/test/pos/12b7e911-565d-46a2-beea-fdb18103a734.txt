Uber-fancy French restaurant in Scottdale! 5/5 

Thanks to AJ and J, we got a chance to dine and wine there last year! It is a super nice french restaurant in Phoenician Resort. My first fancy french dining experience! :) All four of us had the tasting menu that evening with great Ridge wine. The tasting mene has small portion but amazing food. As expected, it took us ~4 hours to get done with the dinner. It was the only drawback J could come up with... I think that was perfectly fine for me since we are dining in a FRENCH restaurant. Just enjoy the process! I would definitely go there again.
