Unbelievable selection of wine and beer - and their prices are some of the best I've seen in the valley. 

Plus, the store itself is beautiful inside, and it's huge! And it's very shopper friendly, everything is merchandised very well and is in alphabetical order by varietal. 

Several times a month they host wine tastings (which I believe are complementary), so keep your eye out for those!
