I loved it.  I met the owner at an event in town and he boasted about his off the bone ham, "freshly baked daily" and his sausage gravy, "make it fresh every day with six pounds of sausage."  I was looking for an authentic, stick-to-your-ribs breakfast place and I found it.  The biscuits were ridiculously moist, the gravy was chunky and very flavorful, and the ham (not normally my fav) was cut with a fork tender and really, really good.  

If you are looking for a real, no nonsense, old school breakfast place this is the "joynt".  I will be back.  I may have to start working out a lot more!!
