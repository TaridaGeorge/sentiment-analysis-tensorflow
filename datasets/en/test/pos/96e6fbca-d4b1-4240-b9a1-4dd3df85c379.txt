This is a great place that often gets passed by because of it's location - I'm typically not drawn to restaurants in strip malls, but this place came highly recommended. I was so impressed with the food, service and prices. It was honestly one of the most delicious and inexpensive Mexican dinners I've had in ages. I had the roasted veggie burrito, hubs had three tacos. Granted we were there during happy hour - but those two entrees with two bees was $15. I will 100 percent be returning, and urge you to check out this local gem.
