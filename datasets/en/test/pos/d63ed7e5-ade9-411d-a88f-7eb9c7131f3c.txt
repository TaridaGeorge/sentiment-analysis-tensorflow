All I had was a pepperoni and pineapple pizza and hands down it was the best pizza I have ever had in the Phoenix area.   The crust was light and just flat out tasted amazing.  I wish it was closer to me in Queen Creek.  Do yourself a favor and check this place out.  The whole group loved their pizza too.  Agreed it was some of the best they have had in the area.
