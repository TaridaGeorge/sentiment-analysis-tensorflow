We played 2 other world class courses this week (Troon North and We Ko Pa) and Boulders was the clear standout of the group.  We played in July so the back 9 of the South course was closed, but we played 36 holes here, including 2 turns at the front of the South (their signature).  This place is absolutely stunning.  Even in the middle of a raging summer, the course was immaculate and the service was spectacular.  If you are planning an AZ golf trip, make Boulders the hub of it.  Just awesome.
