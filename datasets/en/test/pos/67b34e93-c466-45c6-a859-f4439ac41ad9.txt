First - a little disclosure, living back east, you can imagine that the thought of an In-N-Out double-double can sometime be better than the reality. Not on this trip!! The burgers were just as fresh and just as good as I had remembered. This location was spotless clean and quick on the delivery. The parking lot can a little tricky getting into so on your first trip, pay attention.
