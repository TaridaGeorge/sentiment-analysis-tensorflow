This place is great.  Expect a bit of a wait during lunch time because it will be busy.  There's only a few tables inside this small restaurant so I recommend take out if you can.  One of the best gyros I've had and definitely the best on the west side.  Their prices are reasonable.  Two huge gyros, both with fries, and one fountain drink ends up being about $13.  The rest of the menu looks really good, but the gyro is so good I can't get myself to order anything other than that.
