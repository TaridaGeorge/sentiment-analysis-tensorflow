You know, I love this place. Some stuff is a little pricey, but for veggie transplants, flowers, etc. They are great and the service is awesome. You can tell these guys  are passionate about what they do. Also, I like the selection. I always see plants that are new to me here. It's worth the drive. Did I mention their large trees are quite reasonable as well and they have a nice selection of desert plants.
