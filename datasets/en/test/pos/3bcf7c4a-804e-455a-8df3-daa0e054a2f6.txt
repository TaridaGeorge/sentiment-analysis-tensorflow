Mondays and Tuesdays at Radio Milano are "neighborhood nights," meaning you can get a salad and an entree, or a dessert and an entree for $20.  

Last night was my second experience at RM.  Not only was the food superb, but I can't think of a single other place in this region or elsewhere where you can get a chopped salad and filet mignon for $20.  Everything was top-quality, including the service.

Great food, great wine, cool ambiance -- perhaps my new favorite neighborhood restaurant.
