Plaza de Anaya ROCKS - I have taken several classes and workshops there.  The instructors are all very helpful and it is a real chill and fun way to learn about the art of belly dancing!  The people that take classes help everyone fit right in and feel like you belong.  If you have ever wanted to take a dance class, any age, any size, anybody can do this and have fun!!!
