Update:  The Chandler location gave us a 2 for 1 coupon for our next visit.  The coupon was clearly marked with the Chandler location, but we figured what the heck and tried to use them at the Scottsdale location.  We thought they weren't going to accept them, but to our amazement they did.  It just goes to show that some businesses really do care about customer service.  And btw the food and service was just as good as the first time.
