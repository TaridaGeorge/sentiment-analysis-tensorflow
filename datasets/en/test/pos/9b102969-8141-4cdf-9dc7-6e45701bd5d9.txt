I love, love, love Nami!  I am not a vegan but EASILY could be with treats like the ones served there.  

The Oatmeal Cream Pie (OCP), chocolate chip cookie, peanut butter and chocolate candy bar, soynamis, etc., etc., etc.  Everything is delicious!  

The coffee is also awesome.  In fact, it is so good that I've gone in just for an Americano (and somehow managed to not get a sweet to go with it).  

The staff is super-friendly, too.  They are always smiling and pleasant.
