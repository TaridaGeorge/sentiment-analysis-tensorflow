Love love love this place... Winner in Best of Phoenix mag a few times. The coffee is good however I love their loose leaf teas. Hot or iced... Mixed and matched for unique favors... Records play over heard and you can bring in your own records to be played or choose from the lot they have ... Cool people, younger college crowd, very comfy feeling.  I've been coming here on and off for a few years now
