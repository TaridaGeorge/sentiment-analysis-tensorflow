I wanted to get my husband a nice cigar for his birthday. These guys were super excited to help, asked me questions about what he likes to smoke, and helped me pick out 2 quality cigars for the amount of money I'd told them (instead of just 1 expensive cigar). 

The building doesn't look great from the outside, but don't let that bother you.

This review is from someone who knows nothing about cigars, so take that as you will. But I felt completely comfortable here, and the customer service was great. Looks like they have a really big selection. They also have a smoking lounge.
