It's important to support local business, but that's not why I'm writing this.  I'm writing this because the creamsicle 1/4 sheet cake from AJ's had my mom, my grandma and the people at their combined-birthday singing my praises and acting generally wowed about it.  They were fawning over it, taking pictures and tearing up to tell me what an amazing daughter I really am.  

They loved the mandarin oranges, the birthday message frosted and curled on ribbon, and the painstakingly perfect peach roses that had my grandma insisting "cut around them!" Thank you AJ's for the reasonable price, the cake and all the glory that came with it.
