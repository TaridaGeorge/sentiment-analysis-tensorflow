LOVE this place and I miss it so much!
Be warned: slow service, but WORTH IT! A little old man works there. He walks slow and he's hard to understand, but he is so nice to talk to and I can't get enough of his food! It's definitely on my list of top 5 favorite restaurants (sometimes number 1 depending on what mood I'm in).
I highly recommend the coconut shrimp (something Cocado), Mi Bandido, and the wonderfully strange mango drink! It's creamy and so tasty! My husband LOVES the Carne Asada. 
I can't WAIT to go back! I highly recommend this place!
