I continue to be impressed by T Cook's happy hour.  The key is to have Connie as your server so that you can avoid the service problem mentioned in my previous review.  I'm moving up to 5 stars because of her.  Here are my 3 favorite happy hour appitizers:

Tuna Putanesca - Seared tuna served chilled over a classic warm Italian olive & caper 
Grilled brie served with Como Batard bread & jalape√±o 
Za'atar spiced edamame
