I love this place, their tortas are just as good as Los Reyes de La Torta, and it's never packed. The little man who owns the restaurant is always over the top friendly and hospitable even though he doesn't speak a word of English. The Cubana torta is my favorite, and the pureed avocado salsa is to die for. If you ever want a good torta, you need to come here.
