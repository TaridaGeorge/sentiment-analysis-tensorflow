Scottsdale Fashion Square mall is always my first choice when it comes to shopping because they have a wide range of stores and the customer service in every store I've been in is awesome. The sales people are helpful, never pushy, and It doesn't matter if I am in Burberry or Buckle I always get an honest answer to "How does this look"? Every time I leave the mall I feel good about my purchases and that's what keeps me coming back! Oh and five stars because they opened up an Arden B in the new wing. The shopping gods must have heard my prayers!
