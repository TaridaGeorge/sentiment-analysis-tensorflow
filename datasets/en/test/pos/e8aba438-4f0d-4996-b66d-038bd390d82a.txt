Awesome produce, all local and organic. Just bought a bunch of stuff and it was some of the tastiest veggies I've had. 
Other nice local goodies to be found here as well. Everything I've tried has been delicious. 
It's not too pleasant to visit during the summer since it is outdoors, so I just quickly get what I want and then run away to the A/C. Its nice to spend some time there and browse when it is cooler out though. I highly recommend checking it out.
