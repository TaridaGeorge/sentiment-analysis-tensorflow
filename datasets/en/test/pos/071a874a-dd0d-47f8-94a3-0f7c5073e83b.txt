I did not stay at the hotel, but we celebrated a birthday at the lounge on top of the W, hotel. This was by far the best lounge I have ever been too. It feels like the W is sitting on top of all Scottsdale, it has a great view and the service is top notch. 

They have different sections of the lounge, one section has sand and nice lounge chairs that make you feel like your in Hawaii. We ordered food, and I recommend the Kobe Beef Sliders, I am not sure if I was just hungry or this was the best beef id ever had! The drinks were great too, a little on the pricey side, but what do you expect from the W.

Overall this is a great spot. Whenever I am in the Scottsdale area I will definitely be visiting this place.
