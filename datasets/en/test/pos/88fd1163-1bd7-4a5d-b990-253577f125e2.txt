Top's Liquor is perfect! I have been in walking/biking distance from them for the past 4 years it's an amazing store.  They have a huge selection of everything; beer, wine, spirits not only an awesome selection but the staff is very knowledgeable and friendly.  I'm not so much a beer drinker but every time I go in and ask for a bottle of wine they are always spot on with their suggestion.   As long as I am in the state of Arizona I will be at Top's Liquor.
