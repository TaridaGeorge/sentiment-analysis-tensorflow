I love breakfast/brunch at First Watch.  It's always a family treat after church for  us to go eat brunch.  The food is delicious and I've always had great service.  On Sunday there is a wait, but the food is good and cooked to order, so it is worth the extra time.  We hang out and read the Sunday paper that is in a basket just waiting to be read.
