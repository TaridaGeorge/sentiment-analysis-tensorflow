Delicious cakes and wonderful icings and fillings. We tasted here for our wedding and we're going to choose this place!  Unlike another reviewer, we didn't have any problems scheduling our tasting. They had photo books of many cakes they've designed in the past so you can pick and choose what you want from there, sort of a mix-and-match design, or you can bring in a picture of what you want and they will create it. They have some really gorgeous cakes on display too. 

We took home a couple of mini pastries after our tasting and those were also wonderful. Will be back for more!
