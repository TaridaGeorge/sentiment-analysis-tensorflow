The food is delicious, and the staff was extremely polite. The interior is a really well-designed modern space. The prices at lunch are very affordable...$10 for most entrees, $7-9 for apps. I'm not sure how it gets listed at $$$?! The portions were kind of small, but understandable for the price. The only negative...I ordered my dish extra hot, and I was a little dissapointed that it didnt pack a lot of heat.
