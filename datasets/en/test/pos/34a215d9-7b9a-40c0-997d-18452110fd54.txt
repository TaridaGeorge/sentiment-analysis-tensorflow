I've been taking my cars to Tracy's since 2005.  Chip the owner/service advisor, provides excellent and honest advice.  He explains clearly what work needs to be done and lets you decide whether to proceed or not.  No pressure, just honest professional service.  I highly recommend Tracy's for any body work!
