I don't know what the other posts are talking about.? I love Gigi's cupcakes. Fridays are my favorites because they serve Miss Princess cupcakes which are my all time  favorite. Thank God those are only served on fridays. The peppermint patty and milk texas chocolate are tatsy also. I plan to buy so to serve at my christmas party this year. 
  The think I love most about the cupcakes are the frosting and there is a ton of it!  
I tried the cheecake cupcakes that they started serving, they taste pretty good also. I only wish they had coupons or  buy one get one deals sometimes.
