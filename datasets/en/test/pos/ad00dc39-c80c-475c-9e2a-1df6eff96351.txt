This Japanese restaurant is run by a Japanese family. The service is exceptional. I love the thin slices of lemon in the water. The sushi is incredibly fresh. I ordered the Chirashi bowl for $25 and it was incredibly filling. It was full of delicious slices of fish. You pay for what you get here and it is all incredibly tasty and high quality. The restaurant is cute and usually packed. Reservations are highly encouraged. They have a cute table in the back for larger parties as well.
