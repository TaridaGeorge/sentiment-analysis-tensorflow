Im really surprised at some of these negative reviews! Ive never had anything but terrific service/ food here. Whether its at the inside bar, restaurant, sushi bar, or outside bar and tables.

One of my fave things to do is sit at the back bar w/ friends and have just a drink on the way to another bar, or a full dinner. Its place I always check for seats 1st.
