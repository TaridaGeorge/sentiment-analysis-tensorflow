Don't miss the friends of the library bookstore on the first floor, the inventory turns quickly and there are endless bargains to be had.  Join the friends and gain early entry (and discounts!) to their incredible semi annual warehouse sales(warehouse is at another site near central Phoenix) where thousands more books await! Bargain basement pricing - many books are $3-5 OR LESS.  In a league with the annual VNSA booksale, but not yet as well known.  both the bookstore and warehouse are shelved in sections so it is easy to navigate through all of the book offerings (library discards, donations and various media).   Best of all, with these kinds of book bargains you can happily donate the books back to the library for resale, or pass them along to others after you've enjoyed them.
