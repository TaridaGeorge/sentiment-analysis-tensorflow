I love this place a lot!! even though I have to come early to try to get the table. The first time I was here was the Chinese New Year weekend and we had to wait for an hour for the table. However the food were so good until we forgot how long we have to wait for table.

Since then I came early around 11am to my favorite dishes. Some times we got lots of plates on our table but we still wanted more. Enjoy the food so much and I could not believe that the price is quite good too (not break my bank).
