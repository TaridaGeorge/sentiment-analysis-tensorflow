This place is great.  Their coffee is really good (not phenomenal, but really good), and they offer almond milk for lattes! (and soy, rice milk, organic milk) - low calories, not overly processed, almond milk is the way to go.  Food wise I've only tried the Turkey and Brie, and that was before their menu changed so it might be different now, but it was really good.

The best thing about this place is the atmosphere - its a cute coffee shop, and its perfect to put in long hours studying. Its not overly loud or distracting, there's always plenty of options for seating, and the wifi is strong.  The baristas are also really helpful and will take the time to talk with you about the various drinks to find you something you'll like.  

Keep it up Echo!
