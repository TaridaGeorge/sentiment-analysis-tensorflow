Excellent bar food.  The burgers are so totally greasy and flavorful!  The beer battered onion rings are worth waiting for.  The service rocks at this location and we are happy with both food and service every single time we go.  Can get very loud on the weekends, but HEY, it's a sports bar!

Nice flatscreen televisions located throughout.  Bathroom is always clean.  Yup, I'll be back!
