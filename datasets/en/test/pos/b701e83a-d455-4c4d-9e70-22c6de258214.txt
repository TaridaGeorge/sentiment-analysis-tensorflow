Zipps is a regular place of mine.  I most always get the Monaco Focaccia.  Marinated chicken breast grilled, melted mozzarella cheese, and ranch dressing. Served with a side of sweet jalapeno dressing for dipping.  You can get it with fresh cut fried, sweet potatoe chips, onion rings or a salad.  I have also had the hamburgers there.  they are very good as well.  I also love their mozzerella cheese sticks.  They are wrapped in an egg roll skin.  They do good take out also.
