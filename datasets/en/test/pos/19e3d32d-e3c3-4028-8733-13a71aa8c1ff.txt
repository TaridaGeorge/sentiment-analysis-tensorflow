This was the first time that I ate here and I too am glad that it opened up near me. I have not heard of this place but saw it while visiting San Tan Mall. I ate here for lunch and I tried the Texas Beef Brisket Sandwich and fries with baked beans. The Sandwich was great, the fries were cooked well, and the bean were flavorful. The beer was really cold and so was the glass and that was very important for me. The prices for lunch were great and the people were all very nice. 

Oh and another important thing is the bathrooms were clean! I don't have one reason not to give them anything but 5 stars. Yay.
