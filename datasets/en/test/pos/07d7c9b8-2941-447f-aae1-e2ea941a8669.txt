I just visited Kelly's  yesterday and to say that I was impressed is an understatement!  The place is very eclectic and would appeal to a broad range of clientele.  Definitely an adult themed restaurant, so please keep the kids at home.  The outdoor setting is the largest and perhaps the best in the area.  I am looking forward to having my birthday party there in November!
