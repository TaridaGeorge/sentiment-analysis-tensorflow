So fresh. So tasty. So interesting. So healthy. I enjoyed the chicken pita pizza and they had wonderful Greek salads. My husband had chicken ka-bobs and loved them. Can't wait to go again. My mom bought a jar of their salad dressing for $4 because it was so good. The dressing also makes a great marinade.
