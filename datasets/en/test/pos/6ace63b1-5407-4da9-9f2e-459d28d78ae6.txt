By far the best itallian food in the valley. When you get tired of Olive Garden and Carrabas come home to this place to find out what you have truly been missing. Come early cause you may have to wait as they are always packed, parking lot too... Me and my family have eaten in and out several times and cant find one single issue in the past three years. Their service and prices will make every second waited well worth your while.

Perfect date nite spot to take the little lady, ask for their wine menu and go to town with lots of imported favorites direct from Italy!
