This is a great place to get a cigar.  They've got a great selection, and the staff is knowledgeable.

The best part about Ford & Haig though is enjoying a cigar on premises.  They have comfortable chairs and there are always people wandering in and chatting.  The guys who work there are great at balancing conversation vs leaving you alone to chat with whoever you came with. 

A great place to relax for an hour with a cigar and shoot the shit.
