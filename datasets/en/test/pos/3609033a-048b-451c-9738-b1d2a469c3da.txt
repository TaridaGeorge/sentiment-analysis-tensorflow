I love this place. It's 2 legit 2 quit. No but I'm seriously you guys, you should really check this place out. It's in a prime spot, has great "bar food" (it's way better) and a good drink selection. Prices are good and the atmosphere is great. The owner is one cool mofo and seems like the kind of person who would gladly sit down and have a beer with you. Service is quick and very friendly. My drinks are always long and strong and down to get the friction on.

Yeah!
