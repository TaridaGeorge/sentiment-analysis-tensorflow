These guys were amazing.  Before they were going to charge me anything, Derek plugged into my car to see what was wrong.  Then tried to repair a leaky valve without charge.  When that didn't work, Derek ordered the parts and had it them delivered that same day and had my car fixed on time and below what they originally said it was going to cost.  I have a 2002 Audi S4 and they were so more helpful then a dealership.  I would recommend to anyone with any type of car!
