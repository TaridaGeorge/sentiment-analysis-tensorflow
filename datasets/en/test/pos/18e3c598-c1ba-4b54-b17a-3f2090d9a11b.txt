this pizza is excellent. the original recipes are tasty but the fact you can use any of the original and unique topping to make your own as well just takes the cake. I have had some great brick over pizza but this is some of the best ever. the place was packed but the modern, airy, spacious decor is not a rouse- there is a lot of room in this space to accommodate even large parties. it is clearly a popular place for a reason. there is a grocery attached with kitchy and typically over-priced girts and snacks but the selection of these nick-nacks is great. there is also a gelato place attached as well which looked busy as well.
