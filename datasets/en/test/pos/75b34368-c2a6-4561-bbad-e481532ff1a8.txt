I'm going to keep this short because I can write so much.

Gorgeous resort and grounds.
Exceptional service and staff.
Great food at T.Cooke's.
Wonderful spa services at Alvadora.

I just came back from Royal Palms this past weekend and we had one of the best trips. Very romantic place for couples and at this time, Phoenix has really great weather. We absolutely loved this place.
