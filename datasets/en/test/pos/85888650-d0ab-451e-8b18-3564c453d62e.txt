I adore this restaurant and the people who run it. The food is simply the icing on the cake. I always try to bring folks from out of town or have lunch meetings here.

Exceptional drinks. FEZ fries are to die for...but my favorites have to be the pesto caesar salad and the pomegranate chicken. And the FEZ burgers...OMG.

LOVE. Highly recommended.
