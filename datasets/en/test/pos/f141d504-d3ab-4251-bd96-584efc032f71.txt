Delicious food! Awesome service!  Great Price!  I am a vegetarian and it is difficult to find a restaurant with vegetarian options.  This place has an amazing veggie burger at a great price!  I also love the greek fries, they are the best I have had.  Overall this is a great place to dine and I love eating there!
