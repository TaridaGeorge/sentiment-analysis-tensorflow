If your cheap don't eat here!  Expensive is good when it comes to putting raw fish in your mouth in the middle of the desert.  The sushi here is quality to the point that if I had no clue where I was in the US, and was served what I ate here last night, I'd have to say Hawaii or NYC.  That's a huge compliment considering how hard it must be to source fresh fish in AZ.  The tempura was great, the sashimi was awesome, and washing it all down with some sake and beer, made the blow of a big bill palatable.  Sushi is alive and well in the desert, and Pure is a great example of how to do it right.
