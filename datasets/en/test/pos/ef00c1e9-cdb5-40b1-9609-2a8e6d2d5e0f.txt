So I'm the most picky eater and Jimmy Johns caters directly too me!!! I really hate lettuce and most other vegetables. Jimmy Johns lets me order my sandwich "slim" which means no veggies or sauce (they will give you mayo/mustard packets) and actually charge less!!! So, I don't have to worry about asking for my sandwich without_____(fill in veggie here) and having to pick it off! GENIUS!!! I don't live in their delivery area but if I did I would also be stocked because they deliver with a 1 sandwich minimum!  I hope they build more locations around town!
