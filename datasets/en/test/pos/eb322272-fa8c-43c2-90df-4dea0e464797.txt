Awesome selection and willing to negotiate prices.
Revolvers, semi-autos, rifles tactical and traditional, shotguns old and new. Lots of great used/trade in stuff that they buy at auction and pass on for cheap.
Not a huge Curios & Relics collection for my fellow 03s out there, but they have some stuff.

Friendly staff WITHOUT that "gun shop attitude", you know what I'm talking about.
They know their stuff and if they don't know, they won't pretend to know.
They don't make up laws and rules that don't exist (we've all heard the crap that comes out of some gun shops).
They're not condescending jerks if you don't know.

Straight forward, solid people.

I've dealt with the manager, the gunsmith/salesman with long hair, and both guys named Josh (one tall kid in the shop and one short guy with tattoos at the gun show).
They're all good people.
