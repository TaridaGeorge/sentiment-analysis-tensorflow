Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaah We went to the Winey last night AND they added WET FRIES to the menu! 

(well its not technically on the menu yet, but there are little signs telling you to try them) 

SUPER TASTY! The gravy was a little on the thin side for my liking, but it was realllly flavorful anyway. Totally a must order when we go back!
