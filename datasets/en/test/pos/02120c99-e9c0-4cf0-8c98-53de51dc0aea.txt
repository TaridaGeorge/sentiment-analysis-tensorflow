We have been eating at Wongs Place since Mrs Wong sat people and Mr Wong worked the kitchen.  We like the Wong Jo Chicken, Sizzling Pepper Steak Platter and Tom Yum Seafood soup.  The seaweed salad is great in the summer and as regulars we are always served "almond jello" for desert.  We always get what ever greens are fresh with garlic sauce and since we seem to aways be celebrating a birthday, we order noodles for long life right.  Anyway, we like the place as a local family joint where we can dine, visit and enjoy.
