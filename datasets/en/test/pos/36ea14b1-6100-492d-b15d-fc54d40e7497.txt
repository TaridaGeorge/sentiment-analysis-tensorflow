I have a huge sweet tooth. This place is like heaven for me. They always have coupons and if you get a stamp card you get a free 1/4 pound after you buy five. They have all the candies you used to love as a kid. They also have chocolate, PEZ, salt water taffy, and pretty much any other candy you could think of. This place is a guilty pleasure of mine, and I will continue going back when I'm strolling Mill Avenue.
