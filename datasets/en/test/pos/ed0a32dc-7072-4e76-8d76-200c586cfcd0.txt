I just tried this restaurant for the first time. It was delicious, I ordered the raw vegan sushi and a raw dessert. I thoroughly enjoyed my dish and I also tasted my dates dish which was the raw wrap and that too was yummy. Great service, nice clean atmosphere. I will be returning many more times! BTW I am a raw vegan and have been a vegan for 8 years so I have tried my fair share of vegan and raw vegan restaurants!
