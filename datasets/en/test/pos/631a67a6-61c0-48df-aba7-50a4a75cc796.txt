Great guys here (there were only guys when I got a piercing here about 2 years ago).  They definitely know their stuff, and like all other piercings I've ever had, it didn't get infected, so that's always good.

The interior seems pretty barren compared to other places I had checked out, but it's crazy clean as are the tools used.

Additionally, immediately after the piercing when I got up, I halfway fainted and my piercer sort of caught me and didn't even try to grope (easily done and I probably wouldn't have realized it until hours later), so major props to him.
