Love the TCA.

Of course the arcitecture is the 1st thing youll notice (it's literally modelled on the outside after a crumpled up piece of paper). The inside is beautiful as well. the bar is nice and well stocked. The patio is spacious and who doesnt love an infinity edge on a water feature?!

Ive seen shows on both the mainstage and the Studio stage. The Studio is my fave, but probably because Ive performed on it once or twice.

A great place to see a show.
