I try to avoid doing big chains, but occasionally I make exceptions. 

I've been to this location a few times and it's always been good. The burgers are a bit greasy but honestly, it's not like a bad greasy if that makes sense. The pot roast sandwich, burgers and custard are all really good. They're also fast and fresh, even when you're close to their closing time. It's a great spot for me to hit up late at night in a pinch.
