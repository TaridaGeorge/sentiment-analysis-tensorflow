Great sandwiches and soups. Very unique tasting stuff here. Their salads are also good. I usually do the wildflower pick two, and I'm never really disappointed. I'm usually not into these 'bread company' places, but I think this place is unique. I've really only been here for lunch and dinner so I can't comment on breakfast, but I know they serve it. 

The pick two combo is amazing for price, I'm not sure I'd go for any of the other stuff. The chai latte was also surprisingly good. Service is excellent, and food is always served promptly. NEVER had an issue when I went here. Great, consistent, good food. 

soup/bread boules (i think they spell it weird) are good too. this place is DEFINITELY worth a look.
