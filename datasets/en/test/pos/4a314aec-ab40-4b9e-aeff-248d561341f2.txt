This was my 3rd trip over the past year with my 4-yr-old grandson! He LOVES it...especially the new "Flying Bathtub"!!

It's fun for Gramma, too...once I figured out where the stairways were so I didn't need to crawl down the chutes!! LOL

He finds different areas of interest/ways to play with things on each visit and it's just an overall fun place to go!!

I do wish they had some kid-friendly lunch places in walking distance...got in the car to find lunch and didn't make it back to the museum!! :-(
