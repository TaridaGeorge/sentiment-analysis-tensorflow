Amazing, friendly, attentive--but not over-bearing--service on all levels.
Food was well-portioned and delicious --everyone raved about the chef's creations and no one took home doggie bags. We had the steak, ravioli, salmon and two salads at our table. Great drink list with specialty beers and wine available.
The atmosphere is a world unto itself - inside the renovated bungalow or outside in the lush patio - you cannot tell you're just steps off of busy Mill Avenue. It feels as though you have your own private party.

I am also a coffee snob and the bartender pulled a delectable, fresh decaf espresso (hard to do!)

Well worth the trip, whether you're celebrating a special occasion or just want to be spoiled by the staff and feel good as you walk away.
