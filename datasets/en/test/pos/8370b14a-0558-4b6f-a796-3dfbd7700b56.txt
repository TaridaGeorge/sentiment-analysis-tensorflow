This is a must try. My sandwich was perfect. Just as I requested on my bag. (If you look at TH's review, I got his sandwich and it was delish) Thanks Todd! We got some of their home made chips and they were meh. Brownie was good. Not too too.  No one was there to help new people so that was a little awkward.We will definitely go back.
