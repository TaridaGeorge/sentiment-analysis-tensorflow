I hesitate to give it such a high rating but I truly cannot find a reason not to.  I started visiting just to pick up the Tammie Coe coconut cupcakes (amazing), then would get espresso - very nice - huge cups for a little drink (fun). Finally I ordered a sandwich to go. The Turkey Stack. Wow, delish! The bread was wonderful, turkey great, perfect avocado, havarti and mayo/mustard was a great combo. I look forward to returning and trying breakfast. 
Parking is a nightmare.
My kids love the old fashioned Cupcake that looks like a hostess cupcake.
The gift store is very cool. 
Great wine store. 
Nice patio for pooches. 
I wish I lived in Arcadia.
