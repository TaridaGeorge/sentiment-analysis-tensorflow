I'm a huge fan of all the restaurants created by foxrc company... This is another amazing creation.  The atmosphere is cool, not a big fan of the interior design and the mirrored ceilings.
I tried their burger (medium rare) with truffle fries.  Very similar to ZinBurger, perfectly cooked.  I will try the steak next time and will update, see if they stand up to their name.
They don't have any beer on tap, all bottles.  Service was just good, nothing above and beyond.  I'll be looking forward to warmer staff next visit.
