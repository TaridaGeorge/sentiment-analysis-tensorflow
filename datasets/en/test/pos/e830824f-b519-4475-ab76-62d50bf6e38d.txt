I think everyone has said most everything that needs to be said about this place. But I'll highlight the reasons I frequent Switch...

free wi-fi
good drinks
$5 recession plate special - that is always as awesome as the rest of their menu
good happy hour specials
open til 11pm 7 days a week
good wine 
great/friendly wait staff

their salads are out of control - amazing.

i think i could happily support/invest in switch/fez/ticoz dynasty for all of eternity...if i had the means.
