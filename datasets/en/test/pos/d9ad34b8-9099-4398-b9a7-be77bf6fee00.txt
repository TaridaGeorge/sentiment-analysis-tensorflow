Stopped by this adorable little nook just off of Mill Ave. after lunch @ Restaurant Mexico.  The flavors were all so tempting...Pineapple with chile, blackberry with lavendar, Mexican chocolate with spices...I wanted to order several.  Comfortable seating outside with shade and ample napkins for meltage made it an all-around pleasant experience.  Extra star for plentiful bike racks along Mill Ave.!
