This place is phenomenal. The coffee, chai frappuccino, and iced black tea are delicious! I've never had black tea like this. 
Don't get me started on the milieu, it's wonderful. I don't know what station these guys play, but  with as much rotation as The Smiths, The Cure, Depeche Mode, New Order and Soft Cell get, I would be there every day if I could. 
The decor is great as well. Pretty and dark, to complement the music maybe.
