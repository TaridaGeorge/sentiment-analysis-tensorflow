Tons of fun! We thought it was well organized, gear check, changing tents, runs, etc.  Other than running out of TP in the porta-shitters, they were on it.  The T shirts are nice, hats are funny.  I would have liked to push it for time, but the lines at the climb and tight rope were about ten minutes, so we didn't care that much about our finish time.  It was all about having fun. I loved the costumes.  The bear naked granola people were fun and the guys on the mic durring the start and finish hyped us up.  Groupon hooked us up! Made it worth it!
