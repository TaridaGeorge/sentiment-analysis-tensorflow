Seriously sooo much fun! 
I went to the rock for the first time this past Saturday for a baccalaureate party. I had SUCH a blast! The drag queens looked amazing and were soooo funny! Loved how much they interacted with the audience. Be sure to bring some dollar bills with you to tip them ;) 
The wait staff was pretty quick and attentive even with a packed house. 
I cant wait to go back!
