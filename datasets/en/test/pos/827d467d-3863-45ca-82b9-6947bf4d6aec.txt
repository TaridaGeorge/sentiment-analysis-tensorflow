baker jeff and his team are true artisanal bakers.  ooh la la bread, challah, olive bread, you name it they've got it. the little retail store is great to stop by but has limited hours.  the selection is more varied (vs selection at aj's and whole foods) and often have something cooking and ready to come out of the oven.  the bread will cost you an arm and a leg but it's worth the splurge
