Great decor and service.  Nice to pull up curbside, walk in and always see a smiling face.  Wish I could buy a table for my home like the one inside, solid plank of wood.  Great coffee, cool environment.  If you are at the Biltmore Fashion Park, this is your coffee shop.  

Somewhat deceiving entrance just below Elizabeth Arden Red Door Spa and to right of the Ralph Lauren Store.  There is even Valet if you need it.  For coffee though?  Probably not.  Oh, and they now have outdoor seating.
