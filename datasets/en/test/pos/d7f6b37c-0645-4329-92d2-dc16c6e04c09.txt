Dr Wade and his team are amazing!  Very knowledgable and professional office staff! He helped me get back to 100 percent after a car accident that left my neck and shoulders in pain.  Dr. Wade laid out a treatment plan that fit my schedule and gave me exercises to do at home in between visits. I would highly recommend Axis Wellness Center for  your chiropractic needs!
