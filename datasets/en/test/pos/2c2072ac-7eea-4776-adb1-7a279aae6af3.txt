Reading all of these reviews makes me go batty. Let me say this: Maybe I was lucky but when I arrived there was plenty of parking. I never hiked a mountain before but decided being pretty athletic I would go for it with the Echo trail. It was tough. Bring tons of water I brought 2 liters and realized at the summit that I should have brought more. Then again it was 115 degrees when I hiked it so more my fault than anything. Its a mountain so expect rocks to move and there be wildlife present. I almost grabbed what looked like a chameleon on my way up. Take your time and don't rush as most of the people running up are locals who do it every day. I hope to get back here one day and do this again.
