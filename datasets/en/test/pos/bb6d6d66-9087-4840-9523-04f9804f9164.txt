This place rocks my socks off. They ALWAYS have the best prices on any alcoholic beverage you could desire. On weekends there are samples. Actually, you can sample anything in the store (With the exception of the thousand dollar bottles encased in glass) if you ask an employee. Didn't know that until a few days ago. 

I always go out of my way to shop here. You should too.
