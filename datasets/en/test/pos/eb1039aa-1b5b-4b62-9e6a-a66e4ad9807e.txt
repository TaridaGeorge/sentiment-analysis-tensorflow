I have been seeing Dr. Nelson at Desert Ridge FP for more than 2 years now. Their offices are so high tech and the staff is so nice. I adore LaCosta, Dr. Nelson's nurse. She is so friendly, and draws blood painlessly :) They instantly send your prescription to the pharmacy, so it's ready and waiting. All of the Doctors and nurses are so knowledgeable and I trust them completely. If you are looking for a new doctor, I highly recommend them.
