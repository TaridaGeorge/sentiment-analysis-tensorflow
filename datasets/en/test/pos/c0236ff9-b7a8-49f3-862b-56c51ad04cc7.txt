Came here on a Saturday night for a friend's birthday to see the Barbra Seville drag show. SO. MUCH. FUN. I had the time of my life getting sh*tfaced, shoving dollar bills down shirts, and singing along to all my favorite guilty pleasure pop songs. I even brought my boyfriend along and the queens provided some great comedic commentary on that. I will definitely be back. Again and again.

Cheap drinks & cheap cover ($3). Bring singles or you'll be sorry.
