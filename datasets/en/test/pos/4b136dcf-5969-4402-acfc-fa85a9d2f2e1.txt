Great food, great atmosphere, great service, reasonable prices and the powdered donuts with raspberry jam are to die for. This was our first time dining here, and it was a very refreshing change from traditional steakhouse dining atmospheres. I almost forgot to mention that the "Steaks" are way too tender!!! (LOL), the steaks really are the most tender I have ever ate.
