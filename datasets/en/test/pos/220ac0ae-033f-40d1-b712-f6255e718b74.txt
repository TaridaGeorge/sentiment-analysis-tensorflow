I always get my oil changed at this Brake Masters. As others have pointed out, no upsell, honest mechanics and a clean facility. 

The last time I went in for my oil change,  I needed a new cabin filter and the guys even told me that it would be way cheaper to go to autozone and do it myself, then proceeded to show me where it was so I could do it when I got home. Not very common in the repair industry.
