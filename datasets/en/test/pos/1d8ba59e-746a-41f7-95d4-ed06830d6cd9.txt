Attended Kyle's grand opening this past Thursday and it was spectacular. It's fascinating when you can actually talk about the art with the artists. Makes the experience more enjoyable.

Found out he has a new piece being shown in the new Peoria library AND that he's thinking about hosting small, invite-only shindigs here, which is great as he's got plenty of space and a pool table. Cool place to hang out!
