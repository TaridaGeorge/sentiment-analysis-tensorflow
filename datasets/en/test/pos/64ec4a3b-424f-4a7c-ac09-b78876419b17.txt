I absolutely love this place. I am addicted to wine and this is the perfect place for that. I had the bruschetta and chose the brie and apples with fig. . it was amazing! Perfect combo with the wine the waitress suggested. I was there on a Saturday night, it was pretty packed but definitely worth it. We sat outside, it was chilly but they had heaters out there. After a few sips of the wine I forgot about the cold anyway. I will definitely be back to Postino for more wine and bruschetta! Sooooooo gooooooood.
