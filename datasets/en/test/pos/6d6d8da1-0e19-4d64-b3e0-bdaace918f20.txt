I have been coming here about 2-3 times a month since they opened a few years ago. Their place is clean and their staff is great, many have been around since the beginning. My kids love the Scoopie Meals. They prefer to have a scoop of custard and a topping instead of a cheap toy. My husband and I usually get the Snack Pack, its a single patty but comes with a small drink and fry. The Snack Pack meals run less than $4. We can get out of there under $20 for 4 meals. There service and quality are always consistant, you can't ask for more.
