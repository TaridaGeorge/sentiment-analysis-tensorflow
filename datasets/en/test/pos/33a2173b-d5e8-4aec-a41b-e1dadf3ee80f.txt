Although I haven't had the opportunity to try out the famous Karaoke rooms I have definitely enjoyed happy hour here and I have to say that it is Amazing! Its definitely going to be a spot of mine for a while. I took my parents and hubby with me yesterday to check it out because Ive heard great things about their Happy Hour.

My husband and I had two martinis each along with sliders and fries, friend rice and chicken tempura. My parents had sushi and it was pretty awesome as well. Our bill for the two of us was only $30 and we were so full that we didn't need dinner. I cant wait to go back!
Im currently recruiting for a karaoke session!
