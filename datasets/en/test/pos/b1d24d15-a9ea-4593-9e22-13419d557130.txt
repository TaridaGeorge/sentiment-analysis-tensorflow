Finally tried Oregano's pizza. We ordered two thin-crusts, a plain cheese and the O-Riva. Both were good but the O-Riva was excellent. We also got a chef salad and pizookie, all to go. We were able to pick up our food in 45-minutes on a busy Friday night. The checkout process was extremely simple and fast, and the girl at the counter was friendly (as everyone usually is). A satisfied Oregano's customer once again.
