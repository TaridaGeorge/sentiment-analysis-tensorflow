The best burger in Phoenix.  Reminds me of how Five Guys Burgers and Fries used to be.  The smashburger and smashchicken (fried) are delicious.  Ever since ordering the haystack straws, I've never been able to muster up the motivation try the fries.  You'll have to wait for your burger or chicken because they make it to order.  That's a good thing, by the way.  And, in case the name of the restaurant did not tip you off, yes, I will confirm it in all sincerity, smashburger is not the place to go if you are on a diet.
