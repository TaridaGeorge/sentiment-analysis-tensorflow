Seriously THE BEST happy hour in old town...$4 sake carafes make my day that much better!  The drinks are great, the bartenders are hot and the don't miss out on the food.  Try the fried rice AMAZING!

And if you're looking for a great group place, reserve a private karaoke room. Get the one with the entertainment pole and you're almost guaranteed a good time.

Oh, and did I mention that they're open late?

Long story short.  Fabulous signature drinks/cocktails, good food and great times with friends.

GO....NOW :)
