My favorite part of KUPD is the morning show, The Morning Sickness with John Holmberg.  I love the crews jokes so much I actually get disappointed when they play music.  The downside is laughing so hard you pee your pants on the way to work, so my advice is to stop wearing pants in the car.  Trust me, it will be to your benefit, and it may get you out of a speeding ticket.  (Following statement is not legal advice, nor should it be construed as such, tickets and pants are the sole responsibility of the reader.)

The rest of the day is good, lots and lots of good hard rock, without a ton of repeated songs.  You can also listen online, which is great at work when I forget my iPod.
