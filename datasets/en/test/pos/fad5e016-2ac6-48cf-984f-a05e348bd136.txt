I love this place! I was so excited to find a market that had an entire aisle dedicated to Japanese groceries.  It is so much easier to find what you need, and the prices are decent.  

When I started expanding my cooking repertoire, I realized that Lee Lee was the place to go. Lumpia wrappers? Indian Spices? Poblano Chiles? Plantains? Fish Sauce? No matter what cuisine I am playing with, be it Japanese, Filipino, Indian, Mexican, Thai, Vietnamese or Caribbean, I can find what I need at Lee Lee's.  This place is AWESOME!!

I forgot to mention that they deduct 10% off at the register on every purchase.  Sweet!
