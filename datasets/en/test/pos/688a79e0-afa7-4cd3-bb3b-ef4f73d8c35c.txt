A cute, cozy spot, with perfectly attentive service and fabulous and inexpensive food. A Sunday morning mimosa pitcher was a delicious accompaniment to breakfast sandwiches and the most amazing sandwich I've had in a long time: a BLT with tempura shrimp and avocado aioli. First of all, the shrimp were jumbo-sized. And the whole thing put together was really interesting and good! The bacon was both thick and crispy. Can't wait to come back and try more things from the menu!
