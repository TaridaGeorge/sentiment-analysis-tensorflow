Kids love Disney, and so do I.  One of my favorite things at this location (as opposed to the AZ Mills location) is the magic princess mirror.  Grab any of the princess items (shoes, tiara, wand, etc) off the rack, and wave the package with the UPC symbol facing the jewels and mirror, and after a few seconds, that particular princess will appear in the mirror with a little story for the kids.
