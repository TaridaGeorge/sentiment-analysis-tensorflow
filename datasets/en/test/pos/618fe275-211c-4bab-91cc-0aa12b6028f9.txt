I'm stuffed!  No please, no more food!  Wait, it's free?  You just want to give me extra food because you feel like it?  Alright, I guess I could sacrifice and eat this delicious chocolate cake and free cookies you put in my valeted car!
I swear that is how it is every time I dine at Vincent's.  They love providing extra treats which is why this place exceeds five stars.  The food alone is divine!  I love every item on their menu!  The souffles are to die for as well.  But they always seem to go above and beyond every meal.  If only every restaurant had the same level of customer service!
