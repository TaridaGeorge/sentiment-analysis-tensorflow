The Beekeeper did a great job in getting rid of bees I had in my house.  After calling around, I found that they were the cheapest, and also came to find out that they had a rating of A+ by the BBB (while others had really low ratings!).  I called on a Saturday in the evening and they were at my door Sunday morning.  Thanks a lot! :)
