Every time I vist the Desert Botanical Gardens I am again amazed at how wonderful it is. Last night we attended on of their Jazz in the Garden series concerts. It was perfect!

Khani Cole performed for two hours in the Patio Cafe area with backdrop of Saguaro's, great food and drink. It was a wonderful evening under the stars.

The DBG has a lot to offer, you can learn about the desert and all the wonderful plants, they host events year-round and it's all in a very convenient location.

If you haven't been here you're missing out!
