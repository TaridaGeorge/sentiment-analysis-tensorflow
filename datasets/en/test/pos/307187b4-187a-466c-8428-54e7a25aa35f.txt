Amazing food, fantastic people. Brad and Kat have a true Arizona gem.

Take quality product (their food) with clear and consistent branding, and run your business with love and genuine smiles--that's the ticket to a successful business.

Not many do that well any more. Short Leash does and we love them for it.
