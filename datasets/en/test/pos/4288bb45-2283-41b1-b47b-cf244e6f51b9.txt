Every time I've ever eaten here it's been an extreme pleasure. I would come for the thin crust pizza alone, which is by far the best in the valley, even if it meant having to deal with average service. But that is not the case. Always sincere and friendly service from the bartenders, waitstaff and hostesses. I've never seen anyone in a bad mood, and I've eaten at almost every location.

The pizza, as always, was outstanding- no, orgasmic. Perfectly crispy crust throughout, complex flavor to the dough, ample zesty red sauce, and the sun-dried tomatoes are delicious. Great touch also with coming around with real, fresh grated Parmesan cheese. Bravo!

My only complaint is that you need to bring back Sierra Nevada on tap.
