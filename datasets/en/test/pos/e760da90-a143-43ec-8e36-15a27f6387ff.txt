Just ordered Ottos for the first time after finding it here on yelp. The pizza was cheap! and got here fast (under 30 minutes)! most importantly it was AMAZING! this is definitely my new favorite delivery place around campus. I thought it was awesome that they dont charge a delivery fee. i was able to tip $4 and know that the driver was going to get it all! plus $12 for an xlarge cheese pizza is a great deal!  Ottos has definitely found a repeat customer in me

i just moved to texas
and the one thing i havent been able to find is pizza as good as this places was!

i must have ordered from them at least 30 times after writing my 1st review before leaving the state!
