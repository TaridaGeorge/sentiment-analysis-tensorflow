The staff here is excellent!  I can't say a bad thing about this place.  They are so helpful and very informative.  With all the new changes in submitting claims and what your insurance will or will not take, it can get pretty frustrating.  I came in trying to get my claimed reimbursed with the perimeters my insurance has imposed on me...new rules 2012.  The tech took the time to help me get what I needed to submit, took the time to try to find alternatives for certain prescriptions to try to get reimbursed. If you subscribe to their monthly emails, they do run specials on a variety of supplements.   If you are looking for a top notch compound pharmacy...this is it.
