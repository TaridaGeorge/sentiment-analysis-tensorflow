I love Trader Vics!!!  We used to go to Trader Vics in Los Angeles and were so very excited to discover that they were opening a Scottsdale location.  

My first experience was entirely forgettable....because I had two Tiki Puka Pukas.  Watch out!!  Make white girl go freaky freaky!!!  My husband enjoyed that one.

I would recommend anything on the menu without reservation.  The fried rice is out of this world.  It's the one thing I will mention in particular.

This location at the Valley Ho has a great outdoor seating area.  Go early though as it tends to get packed!  And I'd be surprised if you snagged a table without a reservation and without waiting for a long time.
