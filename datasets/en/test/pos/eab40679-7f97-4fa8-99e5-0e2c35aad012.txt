Dairy Queen at Higley/Baseline has a Family,Friendly atmosphere and is always clean.
 Love the pictures they have of old Dairy Queens.  This  is the only Dairy Queen my Husband & I go to.  My Folks used to own Dairy Queen on Mill Ave/Southern. I was raised on Motto "Time to lean,Time to Clean".  Cleanliness & Great customer service is what makes this Dairy Queen so busy,yet we've never had to wait to get out treats.
