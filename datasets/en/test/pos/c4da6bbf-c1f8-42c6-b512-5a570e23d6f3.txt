if you want good customer service and don't mind paying just a little extra, this hotel is perfect. 
If you have a dog, this is THE BEST hotel to stay. Free treats, doggy bed, and bowls. 
I paid $159 for the stay which included $25 in food / drinks and $10 at the mini bar. No extra fees for dogs. AND I could take my dog anywhere. I took her to the bar. She was brought a water bowl. I took her to breakfast. Same thing. 
The drinks are pricey and so is the food but it's worth it for the customer service and quality.
