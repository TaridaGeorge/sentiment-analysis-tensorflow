My first taste of Torched Goodness was at Food Truck Friday today.  I got the Sea Salt Caramel and it was absolutely out of this world.  The portion was perfect, and the sea salt was in perfect counterpoint to the sweet custard.  It rivals the Butternut Squash crème brûlée at The Farm Kitchen, which was the best I've ever had until now.  I have to say, TG's is just a little creamier than The Farm's...theirs is a tad grainy, though that's probably the squash.   Anyway, get some Torched Goodness, it's friggin' delish!!
