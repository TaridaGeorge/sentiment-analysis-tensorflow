What a great place for lunch!! The pecan grove makes for a really nice setting for a picnic and/or a party and they do have them there!! The food is very good!! The Grilled Chicken BLTDA Sandwich, Curry Turkey Salad Sandwich and the Farm Fresh Seasonal Sandwich are all incredibly awesome sandwiches!!
