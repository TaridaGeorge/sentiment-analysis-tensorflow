Katrina was my instructor for about a year. I used to have lower back pain daily and after doing some research I decided to try pilates. When I contacted the studio they were very welcoming and offered a initial session free so I could try and see how I liked it. Katrina was very nice and very patient since the beginning. My flexibility was minimum before I started and it has greatly improved. Unfortunately I had to move out of state and had to quit but I can tell you I really miss my sessions with Katrina. I would recommend her to anyone that is looking for a serious pilates workout with a trainer that will always make you believe you can do it and will help you get there.
