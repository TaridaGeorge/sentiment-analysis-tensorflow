Went to lunch here today. Had the chicago dog with fries and a few bites of the steakburger (Not that I wouldnt have eaten more)

The fries are awesome here! I love the thin shoestring fries. The dog was good, it was on a great bun. No complaints at all!

I had a few bites of the steakburger from my girlfriend. She wouldnt let me eat it all! HAHA

So I was done eating and was like oh what the hell lets get the custard.... I tried the brownie delight= Delicious. Very smooth and probably the best frozen "ice cream" I've ever tried. 

I will be back and will make a special trip to try more stuff!!
