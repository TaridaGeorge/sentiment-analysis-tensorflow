First, there are not that many Maserati's!!!  

A visit to Va Bene is not complete unless you start at the bar.  Matt knows how to tend bar and take care of his regular customers.  The scallops are no longer a part of the 1/2 price appetizers during happy hour.....be a big boy, buck up and buy them anyway, worth every last penny. 

If you find your way in after happy hour - expect to find dancing and large crowds in the bar.  This is the place for adults to see and be seen in The Tuke!

On the restaurant side, dinners are terrific and the Chef's Specials should always be considered.  Great service and friendly staff.

Va Bene is a gem in the area.  Great food, staff and reasonable prices.  A great place for dinner - just watch out for the cougars!
