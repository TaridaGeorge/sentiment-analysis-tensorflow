Hell yeah, I love this place. It's like our very own local, neighborhood Anthropologie...but cooler. Super-friendly staff, smiley and helpful every time I go in. Beautiful, gorgeous, luxurious clothes - worth the higher price for sure. Funny and funky home decor and adorable kids stuff in the boutique. Unique jewelry and trinkets.

This is the perfect place to find a gift for your girlfriend, wife, mom, or apparently for a really gay guy (see Gary G.)
