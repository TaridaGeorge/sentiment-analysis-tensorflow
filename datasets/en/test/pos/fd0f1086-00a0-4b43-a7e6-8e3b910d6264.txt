A+ place for a quick breakfast.  I had pappa's breakfast burrito with a whole slew of stuff in it. Eggs, potatoes, bacon, salsa, sausage maybe?  It was very very good.  Eggs were cooked well and that flavor was great.  Thick cut bacon FTW (for the win).  
Also had a small cookies and cream monsoon (frozen drink) and it was good as well.  
Service was quick and polite with the food coming out quickly.  
Atmosphere wasn't anything amazing but it was clean and not too loud.  The small is a bit small and can probably get crowded if there at peak time. 

My only complaint.. the place is clean.. however, there were flies, 3 or 4, all over us while we ate.  Just buzzing around, irritating the crap out of me.
