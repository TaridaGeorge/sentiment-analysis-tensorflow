Want to keep this short, but ordered a pizza at the bar and it forever.  Turns out the ticket was lost and after 30 minutes they tell us.  This is the part where people usually lose their minds - especially when they're starving.

Enter five star moment:  Manager comes out and apologizes as soon as he finds out and the bar tender worked to get it out asap.  Then they comped the whole bill.

Went there this last Monday, so huge shout out to the bar tender working that night.
