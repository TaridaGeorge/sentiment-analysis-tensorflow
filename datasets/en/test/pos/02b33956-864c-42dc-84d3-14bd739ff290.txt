This place is yummy!  I was very impressed with this thai food eatery.  

I love the decor, very mod and chic, great date place.

The tom ka gai soup was excellent.  Salmon dish was great as well and crispy chicken, basil and green beans with chili was good.  Pricing was not bad at all and the presentation of the food was impressive.

I would recommend this place any time!
