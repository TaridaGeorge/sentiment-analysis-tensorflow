Really good food! The calamari was outstanding (it's white meat only served in fillets, not rings...seasoned perfectly). Their happy hour is the best time to go...cheap appetizers that are delicious. Drinks were strong. The service was a little slow. But the food is just amazing. I've been three times now, ordered something different each time, and loved it!
