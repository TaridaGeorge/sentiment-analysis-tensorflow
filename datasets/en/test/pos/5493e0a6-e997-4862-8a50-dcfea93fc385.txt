I died and went to heaven! I have not been able to find Wisconsin Cheese curds anywhere near home. The closest place was Wisconsin! Not anymore! I found my that this place is as good as the original. The food is cooked to order, and is absolutely amazing. I had the butter burger, the way I like it, and couldn't have been happier. They really need to get one out here in Las Vegas. Just saying!
