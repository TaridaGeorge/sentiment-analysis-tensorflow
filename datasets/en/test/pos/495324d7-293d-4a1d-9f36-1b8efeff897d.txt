Great food, great service all the way around at this location.  I feel like I'm on vacation when I eat here.  Leave early to get in, but the wait doesn't feel to bad.  The hosts make you feel welcome.  The only bad thing about this place would be the floors.  Super slippery.  Be prepared to fall on your booty.
