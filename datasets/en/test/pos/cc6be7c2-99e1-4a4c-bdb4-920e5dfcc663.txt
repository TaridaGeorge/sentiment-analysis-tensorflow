Went there for a first date, and now I look like a genius thanks to Yelp.  The wine was great, the food was prepared with care and creativity, and the service was impeccable.

Really like the Old World styling of the place.  This is a fantastic place for a date, or I would say just to stop by a classy place for a drink
