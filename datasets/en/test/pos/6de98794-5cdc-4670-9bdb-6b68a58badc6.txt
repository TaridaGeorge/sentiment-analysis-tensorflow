we live just a 4 minute bike ride from this place and now that it's so blazingly warm, are decidedly regulars now. all the flavors are tasty....even vanilla wafer! the worst part about this concept is having to choose at most 3 flavors when i want to eat them all. 

its so clean and modern and streamlined, even up to the cool spoons they give you. 30 cents/oz of yogurt and toppings...i'm partial to the tart options, then loading it down with fruit, coconut, and the mochi...whatever it is....some kind of tasty marshmallowy bit. my gal prefers the desert flavors with the appropro toppings. either way, you can't not love frozen yogurt from here.
