Ok, I'm not sure I ever had this pastry combination, but it was clearly a great item. It was the Chocolate almond croissant. Usually those two varieties of crossaints are separate, but some genuis stuffed these almond, powdeered sugared topped croissants with rich chocolate and it works very well. Coffee was decent, total price almost 6 bucks, but the croissant was definet;ly worth the 3 bucks. Soo tasty. Didn't even know the place was famous for macaroons, but try those next time.
