So I'm sitting here going through my Yelps and am dumbfounded that I have never wrote about Lolo's.. been coming here for a couple years now and when it comes to soul food, it aint much better than this! 

There isn't much I can add here but concur how amazing the fried chicken is.. the only sucky thing on the menu was the red velvet cake.. horrid but the cream cheese frosting was so great that you didn't notice that the cake sucked right away.
