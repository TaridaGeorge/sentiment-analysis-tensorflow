I was last year about 2 years ago with a friend who treated me, and it's probably one of the better treats I've ever received (tangible treats, anyway. "Being Awesome" is a great intangible treat I happen to be very blessed with. Har har.). 

The restaurant was a ghost town when we were there, and it sounds like a recurring issue. No clue how they stay open, but the food is out of this world. I remember going out on a limb and trying a bunch of things I wouldn't typically and making exciting new culinary discoveries. That said, Medizona does the exotic VERY well and remains the only place I will touch lamb and veal.

I'm treating the friend that took me the first time next week - I expect it will be as amazing as we remember.

Don't worry, you'll hear about it if it isn't.
