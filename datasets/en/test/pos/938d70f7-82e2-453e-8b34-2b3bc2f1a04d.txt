Who can resist the taste from childhood which sometimes calls to you at 9pm on a random week night? 

I like it simple: a chocolate or caramel dipped cone.  Yup, That's it.  Nothing fancy.

And how can you resist like 1 of the last horsey rides for 25 cents left on earth?  (Yes, it play High-Ho-Silver)  (I'm not sure who gets more joy, me or the child I put on it - or maybe i sorta try to sneak on it)
