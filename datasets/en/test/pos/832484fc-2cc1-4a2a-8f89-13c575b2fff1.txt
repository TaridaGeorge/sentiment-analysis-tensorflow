Reminds me of the donuts of my childhood, so good. The first time I went was this past Saturday and they had two trays left at 2pm and I thought that was limited but I got a glazed to try them out. Wow was all I could say.  OK so I went today 6/24/10 and they had only 1 tray left and it was mostly donut holes at 10am and this was it no more to be made today; I was bummed.  But I got a dozen of those little gems and left to eat and sulk about the whole matter at home.  So the moral of this story is get your butt to Rainbow Donuts early if you want a good selection. Otherwise don't say I did not warn you. They are open from 4am to 3pm 7 days a week.
