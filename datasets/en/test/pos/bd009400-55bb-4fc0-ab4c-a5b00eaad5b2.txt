Shady gets five stars from me. Mostly, I loved the service. I hear so many people complain about the sarcastic bartenders...but they were nothing but sweethearts to me. They made us all kinds of fruity drinks. We were the kind of customers who said, "I don't know what I want, surprise me" and they seemed to have fun with it, and the drinks were always delicious. My favorites were the Drink to Remember and the Vulcan Mind-F*ck. 

It's kind of a dark and dingy bar, but there's plenty of bar space, pool tables, and a nice patio to smoke on. Out of all the bars I went to while I was in Phoenix, this was the one I felt the most comfortable at. Maybe it's because I'm Alaskan, or maybe Shady's is just that awesome.
