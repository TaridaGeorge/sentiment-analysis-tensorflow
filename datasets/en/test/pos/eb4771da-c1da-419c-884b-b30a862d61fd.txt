I've been racking my brain to think of anything negative to say about Four Peaks Brewery.  My girlfriend and I hit this place up on our way out of town.  They have a bunch of their own beers and I honestly wish I had more time to try them all.  We had the peach ale which was absolutely fantastic.  We also had chicken fingers that were chicken thigh strips that they battered in their own been.  The fries were crazy good too.  We had the artichoke dip to start off and it was a meal in itself.  The service was great, pretty much all AZ State girls, so yeah.

I highly recommend Four Peaks and look forward to going back to this place next time I am around Tempe.
