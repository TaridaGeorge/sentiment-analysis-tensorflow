Ryan C told me they make a real burger here. Well I had to se for myself. 

The burger is a hand Pattied Sirloin burger cooked to order over a flame...yep a flame...chared beef, like a burger is supposed to be. 

It was perfect, the price was right, the building is great, I loved it. 

I cannot wait to try more food. 

FYI.. it is a chain ohhhhh.
