I wanted to give it 4 stars because of the parking, but well... I can't be cause it's not completely their fault. We tried going once before but were unsuccessful with the parking so we tried again on a more off time and managed to find parking! Wahoo...

Now with that out of the way--this place is stellar. Staff is so friendly, the vibe is cute beyond words and everything is just awesome.

I had a vegan "red" burger... the french fries are addicting (I warned you).

Got to try to secret bbq chicken sandwich (lesson learned, check Yelp/4sq before ordering).

Oh, and the Jones soda is top notch. Love this place. So glad I don't have to go to Tempe anymore for this vegan tastiness!
