Crab puffs...very good, spring roll...very good, mongolian beef dinner...great!  I was very skeptical of the reviews at first, so we tried the food.  It is deserving of 5 stars for the quality of the food and the price.  My wife's meal was great also, as I tried her dish.  The food was not overally greasy like most places.  The cook used all fresh vegetables and ingredients as I watched him cook everything fresh.  This seemed to be a family run business as well.  If Asian Island reads this...keep up the great food quality and prices.  People will find you if the food continues to be good and my wife and I thought it was great.  We recommend yelpers to do take out.  We did not eat inside, but did take out only.
