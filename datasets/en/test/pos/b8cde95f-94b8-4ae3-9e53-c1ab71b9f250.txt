Excellent, clean and friendly little place in a highly convenient location near my favorite bar, Casey Moore's.  Love their pizza and as others have mentioned the father-daughter (niece?) team is friendly and brings out your slices to you with a smile.   Wish they had longer hours, but I still have to toss them 5 stars for offering good pizza in a clean, quiet, and unpretentious family place within close walking distance to Mill Ave. They do need to improve their sandwiches a bit, but I am sure if you ask for what you really want, you'll get it.
