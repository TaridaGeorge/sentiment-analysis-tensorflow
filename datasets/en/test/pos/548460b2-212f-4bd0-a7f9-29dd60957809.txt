Another great time at Sanctuary.I had an outside bath looking up at the stars which was part of our room. Accompanied by a male friend *** from Canada .He is in the restaurant business and said it was a perfect hotel.He loved the room,the restaurant ,bar and great service.It was brave of me to bring an F& B expert to my favorite hotel.I greatly enjoyed Sanctuary for 2 nights and three days.Spectacular service continues.This time I flew from San Francisco to get the perfect cut and color from Michael.At the same time I was happy to see some of Michael's  new artwork which  was a great treat. I attended a fun Zumba class.I can't wait to go back to this special hotel again and again.Jo Ann ,back in Cali for a while.
