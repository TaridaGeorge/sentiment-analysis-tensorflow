I took my 2 1/2 year old to Pump It Up in Tempe for the first time today.  He had the best time! There are two large arenas full of bounce houses, slides, toys, etc.  Everything looked maintained and clean.  Besides the cool equipment, the friendly staff really pushed the experience over the top.  They didn't just stand there and watch like most places I've been to, they get involved.  They played with my son and all the other kids the entire time! It gave me a nice break! Thanks Pump it Up staff, you're boss is lucky to have so many friendly people like you all.
