This is a great spot for a leisurely weekend breakfast...just don't make it too leisurely if I'm waiting for a table, okay?  Every time we hit The Breakfast Club we end up waiting; but it's worth it.  You can always wait in their coffee bar...but good luck as that's always packed too.  I love their Eggs Benedict with the spicy sauce and smoked salmon (can't remember the name of it).  They also have  a board with daily "specials" and list some great breakfast burrito options...my husband has gotten pretty creative with his and he loves them every time.  I don't suggest going here if you are in a hurry or have somewhere you have to be in an hour...it's just unpredictable.  Enjoy!
