This place rocks!  Decked out wall to wall with authentic sports memorabilia and pictures of the celebs who have stopped by, it has a great cozy feel.  Their bartender, Shelly is world class.  Don, a managing partner, was nothing but gracious and hospitable and readily offered conversation.  The rest of the staff were all friendly and  worked well as a team. 
The food was outstanding.  I had the prime rib which was perfect and a jumbo twice baked potato that was spot on.

I will certainly be back!

THANKS DON!
