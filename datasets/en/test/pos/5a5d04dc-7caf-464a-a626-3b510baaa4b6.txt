Great service.
Friendly staff.

Pricy, but uses plant extracts, environmentally friendly, has no sulfate or paraffin, not tested on animals.
Gentle ingredients that don't irritate my sensitive skin.

Their unique graphic design and location appeal to me.

My fav is the Mango Evasion because of its scent and creative design.

I also like their repairing hand butters (not hand cremes), it really works.
