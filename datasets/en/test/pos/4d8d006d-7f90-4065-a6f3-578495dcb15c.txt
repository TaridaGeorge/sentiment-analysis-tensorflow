My parents flew in from the SF Bay Area, and I couldn't wait to take them here. It was the first time we brought our four year old along for the experience. We had a beautiful table outside - the plants around us were in full bloom, and the food was (as usual) perfect and magical. My step-mom has gone to culinery school, and is one of the best people I know at name-that-ingredient game. She also is the biggest stickler on good service - hates being overly tended to or ignored. She was so blown away by the food, service, and atmosphere that she actually weeped happy tears of joy - I have never seen this happen before, except when our daughter was born. This place is seriously the best!
