I come here every time I'm in town, which is every two weeks. I always get the same, after trying most of the sandwiches. I get the grilled pork sandwich and 3 egg rolls.

I don't recommend the white folks sandwiches though.

On occasion I have bought loafs of their freshly baked baguettes.
This place is cash only. They recently upped the prices on their sandwiches by $0.20, that won't stop me from coming.

Lee's also offer pastries and ice cream.

I'll be coming until my wife finally gets done with school. I won't miss Phoenix, but I will miss Lee's!
