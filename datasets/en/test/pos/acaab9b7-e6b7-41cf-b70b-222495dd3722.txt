This Hampton Inn has just undergone a renovation.  Thus, the pictures uploaded by Rose are slightly outdated.  The rooms are MUCH cuter now.  

I love Hampton Inn!  This chain has so much personality.  They must have hired interior decorators to design the renovations.  The variety of details, from the funky furniture, eclectic lighting fixtures, and patterned carpet go a long way to make you feel comfortable at your "home away from home." 

There is ample parking and the light rail is a quick 2 or 3 minute walk away.  I should note that this location is located right next to a big hospital.  I heard a medi-vac helicopter in the wee hours of the morning during my stay.  However, their insulation is really good so it was barely detectable.
