Hands down my favorite place in the Phoenix Metro area right now.

They have a really great happy hour, an extensive tap beer list, and a life changng veggie/vegan menu!

I am absolutely addicted to the Gardein Veggie Buffalo Wings. Beyond amazing. The tofu lettuce wraps are delish as well.

I'm really glad to see major restaurants catering to all sorts of dietary varieties versus leaving us veggies with the option of a side salad or plain pasta!

Chances are you will see me here at least once per week with a Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA and two orders of the Buffalo Veggie Wings ... sometimes twice... so if you have been waiting for that perfect moment to make contact with me, well, I suggest you hang around YH each night about 530.
