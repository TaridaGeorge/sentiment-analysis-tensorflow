I love this place so much that I was tempted to give them only 1 star so that hopefully people would read this and not go there so it would be easier for me to find a table!!  All joking aside, this is my favorite bar in Arizona.  Plus, I think it is the only place near Mill Avenue where you can get  Smithwicks on tap and not be in a club setting.  I love the fried Zucchini and Mushrooms too, you never see that anywhere!
