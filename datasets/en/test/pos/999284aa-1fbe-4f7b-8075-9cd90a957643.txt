A short and to the point review!

Awesome park for Hiking, photo taking, driving up the mountain, sight seeing, taking someone on a date, adventures, biking!
Always something new to see, and explore. It's a huge park, and every time you go you can see something new. 

Some days it can get crowded, but that's because it's a great park. You should go at 7pm and drive to the top of the mountain and check out the view. It's beautiful.
