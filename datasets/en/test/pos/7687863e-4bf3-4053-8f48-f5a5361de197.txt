El Chorro is my favorite spot for Sunday brunch!  I ordered the omelette of the day, served with potato cake/hash browns, roasted tomatoes and a giant english muffin, the best breakfast I've had in a long time!  Not to mention their complementary sticky buns.  As if that wasn't enough, the atmosphere is unbeatable!  Shade, misters, and an exquisite view!
