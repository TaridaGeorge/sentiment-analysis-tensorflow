I have been a customer since the grand opening day in 1998. I am from the NY city area and know what great sushi is.  This is the only place to get good sushi here in AZ.  There are a lot of sushi places, but this one has Toro (blue-fin tuna) when in season.  Most places out here wont buy it because they cant sell enough of it to make it worthwhile.  All those in the "sushi know" eat at Hiro.  Hiro is from Japan and has brought his local knowledge to our little corner of Scottsdale.

If you have to impress an out of towner, perhaps from California, take them here.  They'll realize you don't have to live on a coast to get fresh fish.  I have never had a bad meal.  Go be impressed, worth the wait.
