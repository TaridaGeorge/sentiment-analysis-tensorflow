I think this is the #1 PHO RESTAURANT IN PHOENIX in my opinion.  I come here at least 3 times a month (more if my coworker persuades me to go get some pho) and always leave satisfied.  

The price and portion is great!! A variety of pho ranging from $4.75 - $6/7.  If you're really hungry, you can ask for a large.  

My typical order is #1 with meatballs, spring rolls, and a thai tea.  That comes out to about $10.
