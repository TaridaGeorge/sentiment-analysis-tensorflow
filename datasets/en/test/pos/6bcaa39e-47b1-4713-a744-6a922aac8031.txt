Hands down the best pulled pork I've ever had.  What a find to stumble onto. Just mouthwatering and fresh. The bun was perfect before they toasted it but toasting it just made it better. Lightly sauced, but plenty of sauce dispensers if you want more. I thought I would, but I didn't. Didn't feel the need to mess with perfection.  

No atmosphere really, but we sat outside and it was really nice. The girl taking our order at the counter, which is how they do it like fast food, still came out with our food and even checked on us. She was awesome too. Pleasant experience on all fronts and worth going out of my way the next time to or from Sedona.
