Wow! I just returned home after eating at Milagro Grill and let me tell you-I don't want to eat anything else because I never want the taste in my mouth to go away! It was fantastic! I enjoyed the pollo tacos, and the person I was with had the al pastor-I snuck a taste, and the flavors were out of this world. 
The service was fantastic, from the moment we walked in, to the moment we were out the door. The chef has mad skills, and we will be back because I live close and the food is worth it. Just GO!
