We did the night lights tour a few weeks ago.  A perfect, casual "grown up" way to spend a Friday evening. Take the 7 o'clock tour to appreciate the quiet dramatic sunset and the soft lights of Scottsdale in the distance. 

The tour itself was interesting and after 2 hours you'll find yourself wanting to learn more about FLW and perhaps plan a visit to his summer home and school in Wisconsin. If you are local and often have visitors, I suggest buying the membership for $45 which includes unlimited tours for one year.
