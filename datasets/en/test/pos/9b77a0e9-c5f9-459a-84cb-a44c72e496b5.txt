We've been bringing our gorgeous Great Dane for several months now, and have been pretty impressed with the dog park.  The grass is still green and it's kept quite clean.  Thank you City of Chandler!

Plus, they have a clearly posted sign that children 12 and under are not allowed and I've seen the police actually enforce that law!  It's a great, much needed law since I've seen children under 8 come in and take off running through the park with their dog, only to have 5 other dogs chase after them too.  Come on parents - get a clue!!  I don't want to be held responsible if my Great Dane tramples a child that's running at high speed!
