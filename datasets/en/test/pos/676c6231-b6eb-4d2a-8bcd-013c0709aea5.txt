finally!  great vegan food in downtown phoenix.

not that i'm a vegan.  but still.

the owners here are really nice and will chat you up about your meal, especially if you order something vegetarian.  the portions are smaller than most people will probably like, but, hey, it's healthy, and i've never left not full just from ordering a plate.

the menu is also somewhat limited, but everything on it is tasty.  i say this with authority as a guilty omnivore who has plucked food off of friends' meat plates.  also, the menu changes a tiny bit from time to time.

if you go, you must try the avocado-plantain spring rolls.  seriously.
