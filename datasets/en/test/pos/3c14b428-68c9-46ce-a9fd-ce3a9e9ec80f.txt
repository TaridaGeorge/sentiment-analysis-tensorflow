I've been here a few times and the food is always tasty, I like the atmosphere, and the service is always above and beyond. The big problem I didn't even notice until my wife pointed it out. Every guest inside the restaurant on a Friday night at 7pm was over the age of 40 (besides my wife and I). If you want a trendy place to go this isn't it, but if you're interested in terrific food try Beckett's.
