I never have a bad meal at this place. A few of my friends and I went here last night and had yet another great experience. I got the Rama's Chicken, my girlfriend got the Tom Kha Noodle Soup and my friend got the Chicken Chow fun. Thai hot is the way to go for the Rama's but tends to be way spicier in other dishes. We were all satisfied with our food and were more than excited for the leftovers. I definitely recommend this place to all lovers of great thai food.
