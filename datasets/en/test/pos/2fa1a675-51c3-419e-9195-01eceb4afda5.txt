I loved this place! Tried pok belly for the first time, I could eat that til the day I die. The veal porterhouse was amazing. I had the pecan crusted venison....loved. However, our server was less than tolerant of my friend who was 84 years old. He normally tips 40 to 50 percent. He got 20 percent and was lucky.
