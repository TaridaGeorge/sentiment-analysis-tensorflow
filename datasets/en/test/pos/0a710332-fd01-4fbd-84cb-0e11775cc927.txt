If you don't like Rock-n-Roll Fingers, I don't like you.  Period.  The owner rocked, he used to hook us up with an extra finger all the time!!  For all the shitty food in arizona I had to endure with, this place was a shining star!  Living back in New York, if I am ever cravin some chicken fingers, I know my hunger will not be succesully taken care of b/c their is no Rock-n-Roll substitute.
