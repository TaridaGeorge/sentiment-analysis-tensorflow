I have been a customer of this NAPA shop for over 5 years.  Jack and his crew are head and shoulders above other shops in the area in regard to customer service.    They recommend needed repairs, but never have I felt any pressure to comply with their recommendations.  I have not been satisfied with completed repairs twice.  Both times I took the vehicle back to the shop and Jack made sure the repairs were done correctly and to my satisfaction with no additional charges.  If your looking for an honest repair facility for your vehicle, this is it.
