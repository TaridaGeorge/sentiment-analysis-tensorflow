I've come here a few times over the years.  My trips were always never planned.  The fields are beautiful and are well maintained.  

In Flanders fields the poppies blow
      Between the crosses, row on row,
   That mark our place; and in the sky
   The larks, still bravely singing, fly
Scarce heard amid the guns below.

We are the Dead. Short days ago
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,
   Loved and were loved, and now we lie
         In Flanders fields.

Take up our quarrel with the foe:
To you from failing hands we throw
   The torch; be yours to hold it high.
   If ye break faith with us who die
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow
         In Flanders fields.

-- From the first chapter of In Flanders Fields and Other Poems, a 1919 collection of Lieutenant Colonel John Alexander McCrae, MD published after his death.
