I get a lot of flack for it from my family from St. Louis, but this is my favorite spot for BBQ. I particularly like the spicy sauce. The corn bread is also quite good. I've been there a few times for dinner and go with my brother for lunch about once a month and have never had bad service.

The atmosphere and decor are great and you immediately smell the slow cooking meat as you enter the door. Highly recommended.
