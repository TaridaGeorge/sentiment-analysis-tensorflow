I can never get over what a wonderland this place is. Just like Top's this place is a turn off for the BevMo crowd - It is not a booze CostCo with employees wearing name tags and peppy polo shirts, it is a wonderful welcoming and friendly mom-and-pop business that nurtures beer nerds. 

Helpful staff. Good Eastern Euro beer selection ( Russian and Ukrainian selections are great for the Valley) and the wine selections make me a happy, frugal camper.
