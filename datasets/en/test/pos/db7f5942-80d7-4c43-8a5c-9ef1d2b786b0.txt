I've purchased shoes, leotards etc. from Barry's over the years and have always had a generally good experience. I heard they were sticklers about returns/exchanges etc. though.

Recently, there was a mix-up with two pair of shoes I tried on - I unknowingly left with the too-small pair instead of the bigger one I needed. Of, course I didn't find out until I stuck them on the night of the show...and Barry's was already closed!! I was so frantic that they wouldn't make the exchange after an awkward phone conversation with them, but I went in and they took care of it, no problem. Thanks, Barry's!
