I am going to have to ditto Kirin C. on this place.  I stopped by on her recommendation and was not one bit disappointed.

Market Street Toffee is owned by a mother and daughter team.  The space is light and airy and the unbelieveable aroma of their treats fills the air.  I am not a big sweets eater myself but I gift my clients with goodies on an almost daily basis.

The price may seem a bit high, but it is well worth every penny.  The packaging is adorable and they can even customize their gift boxes for you.  I ended up buying an assortment for one of my biggest clients and received rave reviews.
