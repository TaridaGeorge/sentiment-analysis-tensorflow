I. love. Copper. Star! 

Why?

Cool location (converted filling station with working drive thru...how cool is that?)
Unpretentious (cute!) staff 
Cool owners (they so "get it")
Fab coffee (never bitter, extra foamy when I ask!)
Yummy cupcakes (never dry and lots o' yummy frosting!)
Groovy music
Great customers

Just wish I lived closer....I'd be here all the time :).

I dare say this is my favorite coffee place...in Phx...ever :)
