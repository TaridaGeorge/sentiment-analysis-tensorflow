I never thought a gelato place would have good pizza. But The Gelato Spot totally have that!! We had marinara with extra cheese. The crust is thinner than i thought but it is crispy. It taste wonderful when it's hot. The focaccia chop salad is good, too. The focaccia itself is crispy and fluffy with a hint of flavor. The chop salad is fresh and each piece is cover with the dressing with the just right of amount. The salad is not soggy at all so the focaccia still taste good event they put the salad above it. The gelato is a little bit pricey. But it is good though. I can taste the real pineapple in it.
