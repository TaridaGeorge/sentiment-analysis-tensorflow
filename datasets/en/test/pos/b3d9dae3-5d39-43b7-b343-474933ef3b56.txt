We have been super happy with our service from Evergreen.  I moved from Ohio in June, and our "bug guy" has become one of my favorite people (even though I only see him every couple of months).  I hate bugs.  If I was the slightest bit unhappy with this service, I would have immediately hired another company.  Trust me.  However, SUPER pleased.  I would highly recommend to anyone.  In fact, my husband has added their service to his recommend resources page on his real estate website.  We will recommend to all of our clients.
