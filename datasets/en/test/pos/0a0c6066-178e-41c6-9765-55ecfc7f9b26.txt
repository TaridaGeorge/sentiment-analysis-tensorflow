I have been to a few car washes in the valley that provide a similar experience, but I must say that Dolphin Car wash does it the best! They do it right, the prices are pretty good for a drive through was and like George mentioned the end of the wash tunnel there are guys there to make sure your car is dry. I think that is the deal maker for this car wash.

It isn't a full service wash, you still have to clean and vacuum the inside of your own car but it is well worth it for just an exterior wash. I find these guys do a better job on just exterior versus the larger car washes.

Dolphin, you are my new favorite in east Mesa.
