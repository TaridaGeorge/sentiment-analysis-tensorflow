Love my haircut! I now have "good hair"  for the 1st time ever AND it looks good all day even after I've been exercising, and my head gets really sweaty when I work out. I know TMI right?  The color is incredible too.  My hair is really delicate so I love that she uses only organic products that make it feel stronger and look healthier as well as beautiful.  I have to drive pretty far to this salon but it is so worth it.
