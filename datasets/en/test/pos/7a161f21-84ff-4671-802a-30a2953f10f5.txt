I cannot explain how much I love D'Lish! I tell everyone about this place.  One day I just so happened to get my oil changed at a shop down the street. Starving for some breakfast goodies, I walked down the street and coincidentally ran into D'Lish. I ordered the California Club with a iced French Vanilla Latte. At first I was a little reluctant to try the California Club because anytime I have ever had anything "healthy" it turned out to be a let down. Thankfully when I ate the California Club I was  delightfully surprised. Ever since then I have continually come back to D'Lish. They have a drive thru as well which is extremely convenient for someone always on the run, like me!
