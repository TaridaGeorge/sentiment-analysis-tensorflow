"A" Mountain is a favorite of mine. My husband and I have been hiking it a couple of times every month for the last few years. I call it efficient! The steep walkways make the short trails a quick, but vigorous workout. The view at the top is a nice reward for the effort. We usually hike down toward the light rail station and cut back through Mill Avenue for an urban walk to finish our outing. Or, if we are more ambitious, we walk around Tempe Town Lake afterward.
