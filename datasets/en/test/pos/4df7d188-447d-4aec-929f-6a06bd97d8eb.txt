Great food.  Great service.  We went for our anniversary and got the tasting menu with the drink pairing.  Instead of just wine it had a whiskey theme (there was one wine pairing).  The food, especially the steak and egg dish, was well done, nicely presented, and most importantly delicious.  I strongly recommend reservations.  This place is not kid friendly.  It has a lovely wine list, and a great selection of whiskey.
