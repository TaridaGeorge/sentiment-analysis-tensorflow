I love the food here!  Best BBQ in the Valley.

The turkey is awesome, and the brisket, pulled pork and chopped BBQ are just great.  Don't forget the cream corn it is like desert.  Oh, I forgot the breakfast tacos, yum.  Okay, I like everything here!  Just writing this makes me hungry.

My highest recommendation!
