The best Mediterranean food my husband and I ever ate! It was fresh, flavorful and enormous portions! It is a family run operation which makes the restaurant even more charming! The service was great. My husband asked for fries for our 2 year old daughter and the server told us in a very motherly way "thats not healthy, she'll eat with you, theres rice and chicken" (we ordered one of the platters) and she did! I so appreciated that. I was going to tell him that, but she beat me to it. Everything was great from the Hummus, to the lamb kabob, chicken kabob and the gyro meat to the sweet rice and baklava... the baklava is divine!! 

Cannot wait to be back to see Noreen and taste her moms cooking yet again!
