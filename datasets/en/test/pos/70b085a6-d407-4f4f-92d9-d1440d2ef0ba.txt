Really great groceries---healthy and organic. I love the "kitchen counter" where they give out those delicious samples for shoppers. Recently we discovered lavash bread at Trader Joe's. Usually the bread is made in HUGE sheets, and it's not feasible to buy the whole thing. But TJ's stocks lavash in usable squares. We made lavash and smoked salmon pizza, and it was delicious! I love TJ's selection of cheeses too. The location in the strip mall with other cool hangout spots makes it a great place to stop by for groceries.
