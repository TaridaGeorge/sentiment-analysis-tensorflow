Best Vegan Restaurant. EVER. Hands down. When in doubt, try the special - you will be happy. Otherwise, wings, secret BBQ chicken sandwich, Singapore Tofu and any dessert or tSoynami rock my face off, forever. Love the casual American diner style flavor - just hip enough to be cute and comfy. Friendly to meat-eaters, pescas, ovo-lactos, you name it. Just come in, open your mind and your mouth and eat something amazing.
