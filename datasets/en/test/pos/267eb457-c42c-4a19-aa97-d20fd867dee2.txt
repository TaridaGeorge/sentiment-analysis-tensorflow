Love this place!  Pretzel fondue is a MUST.  Roasted Beet Salad is amazing.  You can't really go wrong with any of the entrees - though Turkey Pastrami is a favorite of ours.  And if you love dessert, warm peanut butter cup or salted caramel pudding!

The only thing I'd change about this place is to put it closer to my house.
