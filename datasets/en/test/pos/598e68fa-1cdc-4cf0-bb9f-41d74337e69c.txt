I originally found Work of Artists years ago when my East Coast sister in law wanted to bring back authentic souvenirs from her visit to Phoenix. I fell in love with the gallery and no longer wait to stop by only when I have out of towners in tow.
The selection of work runs from original furniture, jewelry, candles, wall-size paintings -- even one-of-a-kind kaleidoscopes.  You never know what you're going to find. I LOVE my sunflower birdbath and patio lights made from tin cans. Best of all most everything is made in Arizona--and prices are reasonable. And, unlike, most typical Scottsdale galleries there is no high-pressure at Work of Artists...just advice when you ask.
I'm moving to a new place in a few months. Work of Artists will be my "go-to" destination when it comes to making my new place "home."
