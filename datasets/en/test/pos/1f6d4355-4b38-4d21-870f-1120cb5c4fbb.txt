Ya, I have a problem, I know it. I went back and bought more. almost everything i bought was from Z Gallerie. Um, never shopping at Z again- I'll just head to homegoods. 

BTW- they get another shipment in today- i called and asked. you can laugh at me.  so pretty much you can find me there this weekend. my walls are still a bit bare. 

you might call me obsessed bc i have seriously been considering hitting up each location this weekend, as everyone carries different things. however, i am really sick and don't know if i have the strength. i will try. 

just a shout out to the people working here- thanks for helping load everything in my car, both times. let's make it a 3rd this weekend?
