I was looking for a unique setting to have a Holiday party for my staff of 17.  Heinrich was gracious and accommodated my request to have the function on the patio with heaters and surrounding the large fire pit.  It was great!  The wait staff, especially Kristen, did a great job making sure everyone had what they wished.  I'm looking forward to bringing my wife and this time I can enjoy the wine menu too!
