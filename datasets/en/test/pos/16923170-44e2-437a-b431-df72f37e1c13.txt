So I just have to say that this place is still freakin great!!!  Our lunch was SO DAMN GOOD the other day... I couldn't stop eating the baba ganoush mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.  Okay sorry... my mouth is watering as I type this.  I could seriously eat this every week, like more than once.  And the store on the other side rocks too... pick up some of those pickled cucumbers... so good with homemade pitas of any sort.  I'm freakin hungry now!
