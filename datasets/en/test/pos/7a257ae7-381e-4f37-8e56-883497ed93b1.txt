I was on a Jet Ski and needed to fill up my sister's and mine. The guy who met us there helped us out by working the fuel pump and helping us gas up so we could be on our way fast! lol I will go back here agian. Dillons is a whole other story. Food made me sick. not properly cooked or old. but this review is not for dillons though others have posted here.
