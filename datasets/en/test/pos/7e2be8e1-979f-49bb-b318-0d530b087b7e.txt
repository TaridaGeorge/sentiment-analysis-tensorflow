this is a great burger shop in central phoenix. the fries are excellent, the prices are cheap, the burgers are good (although sometimes they are better than others). and the corndogs taste like god made them, in heaven.

the decor is cool and retro, and not in that overdone, fake way. definitely worth going to if you're in the mood for some cheap burgers that aren't fast food in central phoenix.
