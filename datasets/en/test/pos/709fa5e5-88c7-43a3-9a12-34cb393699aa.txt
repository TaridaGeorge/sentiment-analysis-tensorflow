A  very nice find. Great menu with food to match. They boast that every meal is under 475 calories which usually means there is some sacrifice when it comes to flavor, not the case at Seasons 52. I had an Arugula salad and Ahi Tuna main course and the Rocky Road for dessert. The desserts are pretty darn neat I must say I wanted to try a couple of tem! Everything was very tasty and our waitress Natasha was on top of everything. Very refreshing. The atmosphere is very classy yet modern. You'll be very satisfied choosing Seasons 52.
