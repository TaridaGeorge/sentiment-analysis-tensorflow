This place has long been one of my favs, whether getting take out or dining at the restaurant.  The cedar planked salmon, pot roast and griddle corn cakes never fail to satisfy. 

Last night, however, made me fall in love all over again!  The croissant bread pudding with the Jack Daniels sauce and the pumpkin cheesecake completely stopped the normally frenzied conversation at our table.  My dining companions and I sheepishly looked at each other as if we had been caught doing something illegal or immoral!  It was almost embarrassing how good these two items were!!!

The luxurious textures, the perfectly balanced flavors, the butter infusions!  Trying to figure out how I can go back in tonight and just do the deserts...
