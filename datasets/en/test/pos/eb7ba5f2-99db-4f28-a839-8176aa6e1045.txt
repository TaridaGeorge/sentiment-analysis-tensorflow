My friend and I had been romping through the desert all afternoon in the jeep, and had worked up an appetite.  So we pull into Blu Burger and it was the best decison all day.  We started out with calimari which was great!  Then we moved to the main course.  I built a bison burger and it was as Jimmy Buffett would say: "Heaven in a Bun"  The atmoshpere was great, the service was friendly and quick, and the price for the taste was unbeatable.  I don't know what Fred F.'s deal is but this place deserves no worse than 4 stars unless you just had that one bad expierence.  Go to Blu Burger!
