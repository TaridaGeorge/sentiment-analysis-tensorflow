Teakwoods is awesome and awesome for a variety of reasons.  Aside from the fact that they are huge supporter of my work at Crisis Nursery, their food is so yummy.  I love the pretzels and if anything, you should go in there just for that.  With any entree you have option of getting tater tots.  Tater tots rock!  Be prepared for big portion sizes.  You will definitely be taking a doggy bag home with you.

Also their wait staff is very attentive and they work very quickly.  If you are looking for a place to kick back with friends and family.  This is a great establishment to do that.  Great food, great service, fun atmosphere and peanuts.  Who could ask for anything more?
