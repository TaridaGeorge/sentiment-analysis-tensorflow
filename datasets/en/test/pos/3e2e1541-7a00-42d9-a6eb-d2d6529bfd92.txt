I was excited when I heard Nimbus was coming to Scottsdale, their beer is yummy. Stopped in on the opening weekend and it's already a popular place. They have other local and craft brews as well as a nice wine list. I ordered the salmon salad and onion ale soup, both were delicious. A fun place to hang out with friends or family, I will definitely be a regular customer !
