Could not believe we were in a Best Western. This hotel is only 2 miles from Williams Gate Airport, Allegiant Air. It is literally only 5 minutes away. Great for getting there at 5am for a 7am flight. We loved the place! It isn't decorated like any other Best Western I have ever seen. Staff were lovely to work with, very helpful. THe owner's brother was cooking on Friday AM, he came out to offer us a bean cake. He chatted and was super friendly. We will stay here again. Family in Mesa will bring us here more often as their health is failing.
