Go here to buy musical stuff, whether it be for orchestral, rock and roll, Jazz, or Latin.

They have a great, diversified selection of stuff.

The drum department is great, they even get Constantinoples, and other high end cymbals in there.  They have a massive drum head selection, and decent amount of good drum kits in varying sizes.  

The place will factory order things that you need if they don't have them in stock and they will price lower than competitors.  All of this with a friendly educated staff, not clueless douche rockers like Guitar Center. 

It's a family business and has been in the valley for years... I remember my first music folder in band in 3rd grade being a Milano's music folder.  

I go here to rubberneck, cause Guitar Center is too softcore.

Go buy some shits here and jam out with your clam out.
