Umm, This place is off the hook like a telephone.
I went right before with Jayme, we got a charcuterie (spelling?), she got the porkwich with kale salad, I got the BLT crab cake sandwich with mac and cheese... I love my cheese, and this was from what I could taste, several 'spensive ones. I definitely will be back for Churn...  But just one question I forgot to ask the server. "Where do you get your bacon?"
