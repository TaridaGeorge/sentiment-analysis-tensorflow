The owner and his family are wonderful people.  They make you feel at home and strive to please the customer.

We have eaten here many times and are always pleased.  You can't beat the price for the dinner for 2 combo meal.  

The chicken and rice soup is really good and my daughter LOVES it.

I love the baba ganoush at Flaming Kabob the most! 

The fattoush salad is fantastic!
