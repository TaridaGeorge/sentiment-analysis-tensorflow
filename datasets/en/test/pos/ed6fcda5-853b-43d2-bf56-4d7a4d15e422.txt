Hold the phone! How have I not known about Sweet Republic until now?! This place is top notch when it comes to sweet treats! I pretty much sampled every ice cream when I dropped by here and every flavor was unique! I mean c'mon... Basil-lime? Jalapeno-avocado? Seriously, they were all delicious and I will be back to try more (I actually can't wait)!
