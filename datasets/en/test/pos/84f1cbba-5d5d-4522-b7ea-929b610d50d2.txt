I have had horrible luck with dentists in the past...no empathy for the fact that I have very sensitive teeth to long waits to horrible prices and zero bedside manner. Dr. Bader is the best medical practioner I have ever seen, period. She is timely, kind and reasonable priced. Her entire staff is just as kind an compassionate as she is. My husband and I both enjoy going. She could teach many other providers a thing or two about client care.
