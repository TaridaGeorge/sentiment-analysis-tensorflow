Genuinely friendly employees. Fast food that doesn't taste like fast food. What I really like, though, is that the kids meals come with books!  And they even have board books for kiddos under 3! If you have a smaller appetite, you could order the kid's meal for yourself and then give the book to your kid.  Win-win!
