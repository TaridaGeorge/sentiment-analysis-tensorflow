Although I haven't officially been a paying customer yet I am STILL giving this place 5 stars.  My wife and I were walking around the Scottsdale Quarter and ran into this new establishment.

It is basically the make your own pottery place "As You Wish" pumped up on some serious steroids.

You can make your own soap, candles, birthday cakes and, of course, pottery. 

They are in a wonderful space unlike the typically tight quarters of As You Wish.  The girl up front was very bubbly and helpful and promptly took us on a tour.

Here's the kicker...  They will soon be able to serve wine and beer!!!

Couldn't imagine a young kids birthday without buzzed chaperons!

Tons of neat stuff for young and old alike.

I'll be back.
