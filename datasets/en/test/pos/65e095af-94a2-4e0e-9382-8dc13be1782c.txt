After a morning hike, this place was an awesome refilling station. Their food was so delicious and the atmosphere reminded me of a neighborhood eatery with a modern twist.  Didn't feel out of place even though we weren't in our Sundays best.  Love the rosemary potatoes and jalapeno cornbread.  Thanks for the eats!
