Yummy, Yummy, Yummy! I've been coming to this place regularly for about 5 years, from the time that my wife and I were a couple, to having a newborn baby and now a toddler.

The food has without fail been good. The only bad experience I had was when I decided to be adventurous and try some unfamiliar authentic Vietnamese dishes. What can I say - some flavors don't translate across cultures...

The staff are nice, without being in your face friendly like at a American casual dining restaurant.
Top recommendations - The Shrimp and Pork Spring rolls for a starter
Either the Bun, or the lemon grass beef for a main dish. (As a fair warning to you, the lemon grass beef can have a high sodium content if you're sensitive to it)
