Don't have enough good things to say about this place.  We don't like Chinese buffets normally because many times food has set too long.  This place was amazing!  Everything was hot, fresh and tasty.  We've only been once and that was on a Friday night.  We pigged out on clams, crab legs and shrimp and so many other good items.  All I can say is FANTASTIC.  We'll be back!
