This reminds me of my favorite bar in the world, Edison's. I like houses turned into bars. I felt like I was at my own house party playing Dio and Townes Van Zandt on the jukebox. The people that complained about this place have no legitimacy in their claims. Of course the beer is expensive, it isn't garbage beer. The service was fine. It was empty which made it nice. I had no idea it was a British bar. The dorks on here complaining about it sound like cry babies. Every bar I have seen thus far in Phoenix has been generic as hell. It is probably a bunch of suckers reviewing this place so the rating data has been skewed. My 5 star rating should count as a 20 because these people sound like jokers.
