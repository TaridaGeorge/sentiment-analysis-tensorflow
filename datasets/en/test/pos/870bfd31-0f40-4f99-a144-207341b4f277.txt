YUM!  Just enjoyed a fabulous casual dinner at Grassroots and I am looking forward to my next visit.  Great neighborhood atmosphere, the food was fresh and prepared to perfection and the service was spot on.  The proprietor stopped by the table a couple of times to check on things.  For a restaurant that has been open only a month - the place nailed it!  Better get in now to enjoy dinner, before you're unable to get in without a wait.
