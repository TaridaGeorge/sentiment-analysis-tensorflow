This is another great place for Italian. Look hard because it's not easy to find tucked behind the Safeway store at FLW and Thompson Peak. It's well worth the trip. Dined there for the first time last night and absolutely loved it. The owner waited on us and the food and service was great. We had spaghetti with meatballs (the meatballs are the best) and Eggplant Parm (delicious) I can't wait to try their pizza!
