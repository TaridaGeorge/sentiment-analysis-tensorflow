My husband & I went there on a Saturday night after I left a bridal shower we were in town for.  I picked up my hubby @ the hoteI for a little bit of a romantic date & found Fleming's on YELP.  We arrived about 9pm & sat at the bar.  WHAT A DELIGHT!  They have an amazing wine list on ipads for you to peruse.  Very informative & includes numerous pairing possibilities for every item on the list.  The small plates are perfect for a late night bite & more than enough for me as an entree'. We paired the dessert with the reccommended port & all I can say is it was heavenly!  Our server was absolutely fantastic!  Attentive & personable.  Such an enjoyable evening we can't wait to go there again!
