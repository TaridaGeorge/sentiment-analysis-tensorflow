After dining in this ethnic restaurant, I seriously want to visit Cambodia. I read some information about this country in books which were on our dining table. 
We ordered their basil seed drink everyone is yelping about :), iced espresso w/condensed milk, Shrimp Ling, Che Kreung chicken/lemongrass stir fry, and tapioca pudding. Everything was freshmade with love. Will come to dine again to try their other dishes!
