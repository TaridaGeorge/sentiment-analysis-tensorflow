Stopped in my favorite city Barber Shop here in Phoenix to say hey to David.  The man was in the back doing who knows what..but , as soon as I got in one of his girls ran to get him... Wasn't 30 seconds and I was in the chair getting a first class cut.  David is always the professional, you can't beat the attention to detail this man brings to his craft. I've never left his shop disappointed. Bel View Barber Shop is old school personal service that I remember getting when service was in style. And it's back in style at Bel View. ~if your in central Phoenix near 24th Street and Indian School and looking a little shaggy,  go get yourself a First Class cut  at Bel View~
