Chompie's is an easy 5-bomb.  I would be embarrassed to tell you how many times I have been here, it's probably in the hundreds and I have tried just about everything I had any interest in eating. The Breakfast Chomp-adilla would probably be the favorite, just a glorious, gluttonous way to begin a morning (or early afternoon). Portions are huge and it seems like everything comes with a bagel and cream cheese on the side if you'd like it. The deli sandwiches are huge and high quality.

Also tough to beat the waiter named Mitch, who is just the prototype New York sarcastic wiseass, and who might be the funniest guy on the planet without even trying.
