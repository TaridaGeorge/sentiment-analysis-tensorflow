I'm so very happy with this place. It had around 10 selections to choose from, 2+ no added sugar options, and great toppings as are to be expected (fresh raspberries which i know that Yogurtland doesn't carry). Any place that has red velvet flavor wins immediate points from me :).

They have comfy leather couches inside and tables outside. Its a quaint and independent Hawaiian feel. The cashier cleaned the dispensers 3 times while we were there 20 minutes. Fruit toppings were fresh and my friend loved their Strawberry flavor. Price was great and I'm all about independent business. It gives me a new option since i feel like Yorgurtland carries the same flavors every location and there isn't much variation.
