One of the best sushi places I have gone to out in AZ. for what you get its the best bang for the buck. 

They take care of the customers and have a ton regulars that have their chopsticks behind the sushi bar.  I would recommend this place to all of my friends and when ever my family comes from out of town I take them there as well!
