Best brewery in AZ by far.  Original in house micro brews and delicious upscale bar food.  This place always has about 10 brew on tap including seasonals, pumpkin porter around Halloween is epic.  Other than that the Kilt is the best.  Location is in cool old factory building but wish there was A/C in the summer only drawback here.  Good place for an intellectual conversation with one of the ASU professors.
