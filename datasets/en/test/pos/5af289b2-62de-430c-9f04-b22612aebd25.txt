This was the first time I've been to Lo-Lo's and I will definitely come back.  The serve THE best waffles, the fried chicken was very flavorful, crispy and not greasy, YUM.
Also, I chuckled at first about the Kool Aid but let me tell you, I don't know how they make it but it was fantastic.  Go for the blue Kool Aid.  But besides the great food, the best thing about this restaurant is how friendly the entire staff was from the waitress to cook to the person busing the tables.  Outstanding service.  I came with my in-laws who are extremely difficult pain in the _ _ _ customers from the East Coast and the staff was so gracious the entire time.  Thank you everyone at Lo-Lo's.  We'll be back for sure, after the in-laws go home :)
