This is the best Thai place I've ever been to. I don't have a single complaint because the people who were there didn't leave room for error. I thought this was an experience i could share not only with my family and friends, but with complete strangers. If you want something different for tonight, try their curry or even an amazing stir-fry dish. I can't complement this place enough, the atmosphere, decor, authentic nature, and servers really pull the place together beautifully. 

Highly highly recommend it.
