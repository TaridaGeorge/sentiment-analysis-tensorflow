Amazing chicken parm. I was told by my Brother i need to try it. I was hesitant at first because its a Japanese rest. It is fantastic. I have ordered it 2-3 times a week for past month. I am as picky as they get with Italian food. Good Italian food. Was born and raised in NYC and found this to be some of the best chicken parm in AZ. Portion is filling especially for $12.
