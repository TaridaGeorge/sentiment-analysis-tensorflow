One of the Viet restaurants we hit up a lot.  The rice plates are very generous and taste good.  The spring rolls and egg rolls are also good.  Had a few different broken rice plates and had no complaints thus far.  Not too many dessert choices, but a pretty good spot if you have that rice craving.  Also, next to market and boba spots...that was a plus.
