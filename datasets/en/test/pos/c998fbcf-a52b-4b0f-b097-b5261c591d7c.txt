I live in Verrado so maybe I am biased, but I think this is a great place. I am vegan so I especially appreciate that they have a vegan (non-cheese) pizza on the menu. That being said, they will happily accommodate any other pizza on their menu, minus the cheese or meat. I also have had the insalata which is great as well, and also vegan. I like the atmosphere here a lot in the evenings -- nice comfortable, but energetic music...a very hip and modern place that is worth the drive (or walk!).
