There is thia cookie sandwich thing that is so good. The two outside "cookies" are made of different grains, but its the inside cream that is so good. The cookie is pretty sweet in general, but the tart creamy middle makes this very addictive. Okay enough about that awesome cookie. Their side salads are so good. You typically get 3 with your meal. And get the potato salad for sure. Overall Yummy!
