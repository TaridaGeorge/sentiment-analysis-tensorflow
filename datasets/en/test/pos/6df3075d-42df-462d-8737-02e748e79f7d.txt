Great food, great atmosphere, great drink menus and pricing.  I got to meet one of the owners which doesn't happen that often these days so that was pretty cool too.  The place SMELLS AMAZING!  The guests sitting at the bar next to me were raving about their food so that was good to hear too... I loved my chopped salad too.  I am excited to go back soon!  I was really glad that I chose that place for my lunch.
