Well this is my boyfriends yelp account. I don't have one, I'm pretty sure this is the salon I went to, and I believe they have 2 locations.. Anyways I just got my hair done bout 2 weeks ago by "Gigi" she is like an artist and I was her canvas.. she totally saved my disaster hair color job another stylist had done!! You can tell she really knows what she's doing and loves what she does. Loved this place, its so modern yet unique and has some really talented pesonable hair stylists so I HIGHLY RECOMEND this place. Gigi was great! but everyone seams just as great so no matter who you get your going to love the end result :D 
Thanks so much Gigi!!!
