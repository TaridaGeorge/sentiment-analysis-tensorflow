I have been going to Candy for 10 years and she is amazing! She listens to the changes that I want to make to my "usual" and is so great. Whenever my friends got a botched highlighting job or haircut, they always go back to Candy to fix it.

Vita Bella is clean & beautifully decorated with a warm atmosphere. It is bizarre how many people I know that go to Vita Bella! My sister-in-law goes to Lisa Stinelli to get her nails done, and they always look fantastic. Everyone I've come in contact with is so talented at this salon!
