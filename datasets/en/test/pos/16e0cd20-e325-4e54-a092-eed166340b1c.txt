I prefer this location over the one in the Arrowhead area.

I like that it's usually less busy than the Arrowhead location, it's usually more organized and tidy. Parking is usually not a problem either.

They also have unique or quirky gifts.  I can usually find something for anyone I need to find a gift for... Especially Myself!
