Lately, I've been very fortunate to visit little gems that Yelpers love!  This my friend's, is one of the gems.

Bar Bianco is quaint, cool, hip, suave, and authentic.  We had just left a charity event at Alice Cooperstown, it was Friday night, there was a Sun's game ending and we decided on Bianco to have 1 last drink.  Chuck was tending the small bar and accommodated our group of 6 perfectly.  Ordered a couple of cheese plates, a drink and proceeded to converse with our bar mates.

From what I've read on other reviews, people wait 3 hours for a table next door at Pizzeria Bianco, while sipping libations here.  Seriously?  Wait 3 hours for Pizza?  Yep.  Thankfully, the dinner crowd had dispersed and Bar Bianco was not packed and service was excellent.  I will definitely be back soon.
