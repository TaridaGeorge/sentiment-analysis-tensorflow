we walked in, it was a ghost town at 5pm, walked up- ordered our dishes and special priced beers ( Stella and Shock top ale super cheap) and like 30 seconds later it was called out ready to go!! My bf says he sees this place smoking all their stuff early in the morning and the result: DELICIOUS RIBS!!! literally fall off the bone hell- i could have EATEN the bone it was all slow cooked to perfection. Baked beans, potato salad all delicious. I made a point to compliment the owner and he treated me to their HOMEMADE ice cream (vanilla bean) to take home =-) we WILL be back and this time, I'm bringing more people. I tell as many people I can about this unknown treasure we have finally discovered.
