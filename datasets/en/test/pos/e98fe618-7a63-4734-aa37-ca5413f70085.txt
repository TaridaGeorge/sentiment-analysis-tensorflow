Started off with the skillet cornbread and the grilled artichokes for appetizers. Both were unbelievably good. The grilled artichokes were just short of a spiritual experience! I could almost hear an angelic choir hit the high notes after my first bite. 

For the main courses, we ordered the Kobe beef tips and the grilled salmon. The beef tips were the clear winner, tender, cooked to perfection, and with a nice wood-grilled flavor. The salmon was good, but the "green rice" that came along side of it was a little on the tangy side for me. The salmon had a sweet glaze over the top which was good, but I guess I was not in the mood for that flavor. 

The bottom line is, the Yelpers were right again. This place is a winner. You won't be disappointed.
