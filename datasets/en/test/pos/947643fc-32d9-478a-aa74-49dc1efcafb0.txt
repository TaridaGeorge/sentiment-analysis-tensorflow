Thank you Yelp, for another great find in the ASU West area!

Hand breaded onion rings, homemade chili, and a wall full of sodas--I hope I sold you already. If not, try cheap. Like ridiculously cheap for every menu option.

Not much ambiance, but for a great burger, who's complaining? I like the bare bones decor, and I'm sure the high school kids would destroy anything more than that. Speaking of high school kids, if you want to avoid those heathens try to make to Rocket Burger before 2:30pm!
