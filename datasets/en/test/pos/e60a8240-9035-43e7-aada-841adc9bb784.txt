I flipping love sub factory. I used to eat these subs every day and tonight I found their frequent punch card in my wallet. I've had it since high school. I totally plan on eating these subs again, I forgot all about it! 

My order: 
Turkey on white with onions and banana peppers and provolone. sometimes lettuce. 

The turkey is shaved very thin and it's piled on! the bread is so chewy and perfect. 

The onions are sliced very very thin as well and it makes them so easy to eat! 

Seriously, I LOVE sub factory. Definitely get an otis cookie while you're there, too. 

I always see cops and business men whenever I go in, the space is small but clean with quite a bit of sitting space.
