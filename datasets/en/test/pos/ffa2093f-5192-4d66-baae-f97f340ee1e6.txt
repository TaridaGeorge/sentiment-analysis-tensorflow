Like other users have stated you can get Cheese Curds here. Delicious, unicorn-like freshly-made cheese curds! 

I've had Wisconsin cheese curds, which are basically "young" (see: not aged) cheddar. They are supposedly the world's greatest and these are right up there with them. They also sell some cheap milk and many other goodies, considering the dairy factory is right behind this place. 

I hope everyone in Tempe can visit this location, as some of what they have here are things that require loads of special equipment to make. Not every city has it's own specialty dairy store, you know.
