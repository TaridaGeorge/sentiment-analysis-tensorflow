Postino Arcadia became a weekly event with friends on Monday nights.  We went for the $20 board of bruschetta and bottle deal. Because it's such a great deal, there was always a long wait.  But no worry, because wandering through the store at LGO is a perfect way to kill some time.

The bruschetta and bottle is usually enough for two, but we like to add in the Butcher's Block which is a selection of meats, cheeses, olives, and asparagus.  

I love Postino for providing a great place to be with friends, wine, and great food, at an excellent price on a Monday or Tuesday night.  I think it starts the week off right.
