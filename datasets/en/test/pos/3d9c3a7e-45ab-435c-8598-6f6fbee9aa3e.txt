Yea, I'm giving this Denny's 5 stars. 
It's just that you cannot beat them for what they do best. 
Late night food.  
I mean, I don't know anyone that goes to Denny's just to go to eat at Denny's.  It's usually a toss up between IHOP, Denny's, and Waffle House.  
However, Denny's food is realllllly good now! 
I did hear about them revamping their menu and really working on improving their food and believe me when I say they did a really good job.
Everything I've had recently was very tasty.  
Their nachos and cheese fries have this new cheese sauce that isn't the typical Sysco or US Food Service one.  Their fries are a cross between a waffle cut and steak fry, again, never before seen anywhere else.  

Give Denny's a chance and try out their new food!
