Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! This place has got it going on when it comes to healthy juices and food. We visited for the first time last Sunday and went again on Monday and brought our dog. We got him the doggie yogurt which he loved and we had the six on the beach and raw body shake. We took a veggie sandwich to go for lunch. If you are RAW or into juices this is the place to go!
