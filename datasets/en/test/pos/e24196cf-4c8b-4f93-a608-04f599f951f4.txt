I have had Vietnamese may times, and this place is easily one of the best. Pho is a bit overrated for my taste (plus soup is not something I go out for), so I wanted to try something with noodles.

I'm gluten-free so I can't eat anything wheat-based, but I can have rice, potatoes, and corn. Their rice vermicelli noodles are so good. I got the #32 which is a combo of a spring roll, marinated pork, and shrimp on a bed of room-temperature noodles (sounds weird, tastes amazing) on another bed of shredded cucumber, lettuce, mint, and basil. It comes with aside of what I believe is a fish sauce, but does not taste like fish. It's more of a sweet and savory sauce. I really liked this place, and cannot wait to go back.
