This was a great find when I came out for a Cardinals game from Las Vegas.  We stumbled upon here the first week they were open with friends that live in the area.  It is a cute place, designed for the local market with great food and service.  The Pizza, Chicken Parm and of course the sauce ... are awesome.   I cant wait to stop in again the next time I am in AZ.
