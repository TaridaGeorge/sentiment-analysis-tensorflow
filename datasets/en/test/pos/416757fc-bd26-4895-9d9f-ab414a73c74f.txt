Best patio in town.  Order the sangria pitcher and take a load off.  I won't bore you with a long review other than recommending those two items.  

Recap...

Step one, get a table on the patio.
Step two, order the sangria pitcher (by the glass is a rip)
Step three, "take a load off".  YES that's a step!

OK fine...  One more thing if you insist.  Order something to nibble on also.  Their food is wonderful.
