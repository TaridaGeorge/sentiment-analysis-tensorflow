I have been going to Dr. Longwill's office since I was in middle school...I am now in my 30s!  There is NO ONE ELSE I will go to, except Dr. Longwill and his staff, until he retires.  I've told Dr. Longwill that he better have a plan for me once he retires :).  Sara at the front desk is wonderful, Judy - one of the hygenists - is superb, and the other hygenests - who I know, but don't see as often - are amazing, as well.  Dr's assistant, Chris, is so gentle and sweet.  Dr. makes the experience of going to the dentist one that I actually do NOT dread, and I know he will take perfect care of me each and every time.  He's got great stories and will make you smile!
