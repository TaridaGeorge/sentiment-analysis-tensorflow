I agree with all of the other reviews... this boutique has a nice, casual atmosphere and some excellent finds. Carmen, the owner, travels to the Los Angeles "market" every other month or so and has such amazing taste. She will always uncover those diamonds in the rough, but yes she only buys a few pieces at a time so you have to drop in often.
