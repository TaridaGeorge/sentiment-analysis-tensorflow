I LOVE SWEET TOMATOES...nom nom nom nom NOM! Oh they have a theme that they change monthly and my month of weakness is when they have their tomato soup and grilled cheese bready goodness. I would be embarrased to say that during that month I ate here as much as possible, but I'm going to blame it on the prego hormones. I would drag anyone and everyone here just to stuff my face with its goodness! That month is over, I still go once or twice a month. My stomach can't hold as much food as it used to since the space is currently occupied. My family and friends got sick of it, too, so its harder for me to find people to go with me haha.
