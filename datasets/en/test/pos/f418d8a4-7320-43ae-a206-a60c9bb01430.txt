I had a really great experience here! 

I called on Wednesday and spoke to Trevor, told him my make, model and year and he looked up some tires for me and gave me a quote for an out the door price. 

I did call around and found that not only did Discount have the best prices but they had a really helpful and friendly staff, other places I called acted like it was a bother to give a quote over the phone. 

Friday after work Trevor was there to help me when I dropped off my car. I didn't want to wait around so he told me I could leave my car there and pick it up in the morning. Rad! 

So yeah, New tires, Very exciting!
