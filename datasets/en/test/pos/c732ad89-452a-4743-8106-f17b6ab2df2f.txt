i cant say anything less than glowing reviews of this cafe. it was a warm day, we were visiting from vegas and were sent here by an art gallery down the street. we sat on the patio in this adorable cottage type cafe under trees umbrellas and a lovely cool mist was so refreshing that cooled us off. little birds chirrping around the trees and a nice waitress. had a peach wine cocktail and the chicken quesidillia with guac for dipping. it was the most delicious lunch i have ever had in my life. i swear i would drive 5.5 hours from vegas just to eat HERE. deliciousssss.
