Excellent Italian Dinner~

I picked up Aiello's "to go" last week and it was fantastic.  For two people we shared the Eggplant Rolatini w/ fresh Ricatta cheese & the Gnocchi Pesto.  With the assorted bread it was a fantastic dinner for two, and of course Tirimisu for dessert.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  I look forward to going back again!~  I used my Groupon i received a few months ago and was able to get the full dinner for under $35.  Not bad!
