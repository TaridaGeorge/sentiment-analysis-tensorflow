Finally a grocery store in Scottsdale that isn't trying to rob me. Don't get me wrong, I like Safeway, Albertson's and Basha's, but come on, what's with the sky high prices? I like good food and variety, but I don't wanna go broke either shopping for it. Fresh & Easy was made for me. THANK YOU for the discount sections.
