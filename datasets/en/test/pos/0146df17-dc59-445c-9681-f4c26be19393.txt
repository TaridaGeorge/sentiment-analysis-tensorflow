Yum. Yum. Yum.

This place rocks the party.  I've been living in LA for about 6 years so you know that when I come home to visit my family I feel like I am short on vegetarian options.  This place delivers with the bombass veg food.  Everything I've tried is great.  I have brought some meat eaters here and even they were impressed by the wonders of this place.

I would recommend the artichoke dip to start and maybe the Texas po-boy.  The picnic salad is great too.  The large size is plenty for 2 to share.  I haven't had the pleasure of a Soynami, but one day, if I'm lucky, I will have the pleasure.

This place is great, but limited seating.  We went during a busy lunchtime and waited for a long time after ordering at the counter.
