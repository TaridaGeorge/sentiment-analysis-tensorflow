What a gem
Staff was amazing and skilled in the fine art of customer service. My wife and I are locals that wanted a staycation sans kids and to celebrate my wifes bday. I booked on Hotels.com and called the resort to confirm. Nina was awesome and asked if we were celebrating a special occasion. Some reviaewers mentioned the snooty attitudes of the valet staff and tcooksstaff. We had no such issues at all. They were all wonderful and if you tried to tip valet they reminded you about the resort fee an no tip policy. After a pleasant happy hour at t cooks with excellent service we retired to our room only to discover a clean room and chocolates for my wife. 
We will be coming back.
