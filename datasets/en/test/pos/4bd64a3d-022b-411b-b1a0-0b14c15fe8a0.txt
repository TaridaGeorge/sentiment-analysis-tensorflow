You can't really go wrong with Flemings. Very romantic, and dark inside. You get what you pay for, and here, you pay ALOT. Portions are small, but thats kind of a good thing if you ask me. Service is top notch and so is flavor. Came with my mom & we both had the Restaurant week specials. I went with the Chicken & Mom got the Steak.  Both were incredible. 
My only regret was not getting the Chocolate Lava cake. This is a must at Flemings- Deelish!
