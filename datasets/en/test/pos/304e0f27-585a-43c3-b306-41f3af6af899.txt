I've shopped at their store when it was located on Southern and at their new location, and every time has been an excellent experience.  Between locations, the staff hasn't changed much.  Seems like pretty much everyone that works there goes skiing or snowboarding and can offer good insight to the equipment they sell.

They offer a wide variety of snow gear and also some water sports gear.  Great store for the gear geek in all of us.

The rental department is friendly, courteous and knowledgeable in fitting first time skiers/snowboarders with the right ski/board and boots.

Overall, superb shopping experience.
