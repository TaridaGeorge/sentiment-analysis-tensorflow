I really love all the Sweet Tomatoes that i  have ever been to in the valley. This one even has a few extras. Incredibly clean like all the others. They kitchen is wide open behind glass so  you can see just how clean it is.  The food selection is wonderful and everything is always fresh! Plenty of parking in the giant parking lot. You can even sit outside if you can stand the heat. Well, for the extra added touch.... there is a pond outside filled with fish, turtles and ducks. You can bring some food with you(Bread has no nutritional value for animals), and feed the animals either before or after you feed yourself. Kids absolutely love it! So do i!  Also they always have coupons which save a lot of $$$ as well.
