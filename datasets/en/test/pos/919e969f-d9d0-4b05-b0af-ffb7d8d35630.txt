Oh my goodness, I love this coffee place.  I had it for the first time last week, and I wake up craving it every day now.  The white mocha was what I got (iced) and it was so good! Way better than Starbucks! I am excited to try the other drinks on the menu, it is a good thing they are far from where I live, otherwise I would be drinking it everday.
