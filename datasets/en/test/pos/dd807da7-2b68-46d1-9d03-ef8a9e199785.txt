Being a New Yorker for most of my life, I'd have to say that the pizza here is different, but ranks up there with some New York pizzas. I'd say the difference here is that the crust is thinner, but cooked to more of a crisp.

Tips:
-Get there early and put your name in, as you will likely be in for a long wait. You can call them to see where you are in the waiting list and get an estimated time.
-They have a bar next door you can chill at where they will come get you when it is your turn to eat.
-Try the marinara or margherita without toppings if you are looking for a pure pizza experience. I tried four pizzas, but my favorite was the marinara without any toppings.
