Smashburger being within walking distance from my work is pure temptation. Just this past week I met some friends here for a quick bite. 
I ended up ordering the 1/3 pound classic smashburger with haystack onions as an add-on. I had to go with the smash fries, and am really glad I did. The smashfries are tossed with olive oil, rosemary, garlic and "other herbs." Hmmm what are those other herbs? I would travel the world to find out what- that's how good they are. Almost as good as the fries at Fez :-)

To top it off, the manager checked in on our table multiple times to bring us back any condiments, ask us what we thought about the burgers, and to see if we needed anything else. Loved  the service!

Thanks for coming to the Valley Smashburger. We heart you!
