Mix great breakfast food with even better service and what do you end up with?  A visit to DJ's Bagel Cafe.

We snuck out for a quick breakfast bite and scanned the strip malls for places to eat.  I remember seeing "cafe" so we walked on over.  Turns out its a bagel place but heck we're here and well, its packed.

There was a special bagel sandwich, somebody's special bagel... with 2 scrambled eggs, bacon, thin sliced ham, sausage patty, and cheese on a lightly toasted bagel.  It puts McDonald's Egg McMuffin to shame.  And some fresh OJ to boot and you've got yourself a meal.

Service was wonderful, the gals were friendly and helpful.  An enjoyable dining experience.
