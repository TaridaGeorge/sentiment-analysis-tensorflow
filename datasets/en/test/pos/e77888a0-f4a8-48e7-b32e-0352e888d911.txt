Best Thai in Phoenix in my opinion.  I love their extensive menu and the service is great.  The Chef here cooks ALL the time, so the food is consistent and wonderful.  Try the Phat Thai is the best I've ever had (and I've had a lot of Phat Thai).  Always clean and has a fun and funky interior design.  Enjoy!
