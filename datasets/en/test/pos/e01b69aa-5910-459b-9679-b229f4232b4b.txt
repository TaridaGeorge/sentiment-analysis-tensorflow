Well, being from Chicago, I will have to admit that this place is pretty darn tasty.

Thin crust Chicago is the way to go here.  The sausage is perfect, reminds me from home, and the sauce is sweet, which I am a fan of.  Almost reminds me of Aurelio's.

The hod dog is decent, and the Italian beef was just OK.  Luke's is still the place to go for beef.  

Anyhoo, they are really nice people, and delivery was pretty quick.  5 stars for the pizza and friendliness.
