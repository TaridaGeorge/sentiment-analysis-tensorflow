My husband stumbled upon this spot while in old towne Scottsdale and said he had found a place I was going to love. He promptly made reservations and we went on a Thursday night. The atmosphere was low-key which was exactly what the doctor ordered and our meal did not disappoint. 
I am in the design field and let me say that though the food was the star attraction, the decor of the place was amazing too. The owner did the interior himself. Impressive. We are hooked.
