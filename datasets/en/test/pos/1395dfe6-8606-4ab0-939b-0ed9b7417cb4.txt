I have taken my automobiles to Richards for for more than 15 years. Their work has always been excellent. They never have tried to sell me a repair  I did not need, which I have experienced at other shops over the many years I have had my autos serviced.
If they find a problem needing repair while working on the car they call and give details and estimated cost. A few years ago I moved across town but still take my truck there because of the confidence I have in their work. 
   
--- And,yes they have had some really cool shop dogs. They are better than a 
    Walmart greeter.
