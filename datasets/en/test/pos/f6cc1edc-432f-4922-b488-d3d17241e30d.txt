I usually go to Takamatsu's just down the road for Korean BBQ, but decided to give QQ Grill a try after seeing a pic of the bibimbap on Yelp.  I was very happy that I did.  The portion was large and tasted delicious!  I eat lots of kimchi when I eat Korean food, so I was happy to see kimchi was self service....and it was fresh and tasty.  I'll definitely be back whenever I'm craving bibimbap!
