Enjoyed the egg rolls.  So glad that they were made out of fried rice paper because I have food allergies.  The entree of BBQ beef with rice noodles was also very good.  I will be going back this weekend with the hubby for sure.  Very clean and nicely decorated restaurant.  Very nice waitress. The restaurant smelled really good too: spices maybe?  A bit warmer than I would like inside.  Maybe they need to turn up the A/C.
