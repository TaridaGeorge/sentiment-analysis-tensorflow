You can't go wrong shopping at FoodWise.  The owners, Brent and Kristi, are knowledgeable and Kristi's informative cooking classes are free. (They feed you too!)  I've since learned to keep a proper food storage- as they believe you should buy what you use, and use what you buy, and I learned to cook with my storage.   They are affordable, and their products are top notch.  Their produce are organic, high in nutritional value, and my kids love it.  They even have Non-GMO TVP that is non-hydrogenated! Everything tastes great.  I bought their Blendtec Mix and Blend ll at a great price.  Definitely stop in!
