Just wanted to say that we had breakfast one morning (Dennys next to our hotel) a few weeks ago when in Scottsdale.  We had been eating at different places in Scottsdale since it was the first time in the city.   After trying another breakfast Restaurant down the street the day before we wanted to eat somewhere we knew.  The service was great they were friendly and helpful.  The food was great.  We both had the country fried steaks and that was the first time all week I eat everything on my place.  The coffee was good.  By the time I left  there I had a smile on my face.  Thanks Denny's staff you are awesome.  Thanks for making my day.....
