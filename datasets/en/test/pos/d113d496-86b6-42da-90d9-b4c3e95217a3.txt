Oh my gosh, this place is amazing! Like they say, come on Mondays or Tuesdays for the bruschetta and bottle of wine for $20. The brie and apple is your dessert one..the proscuitto is AMAzing!!

The special starts at 8 and it gets packed early so show up around 715....you can begin to enjoy your bottle of wine then also....yummy
