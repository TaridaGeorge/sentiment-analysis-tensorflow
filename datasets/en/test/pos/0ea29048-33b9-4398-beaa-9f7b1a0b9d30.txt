The boy, our friend Kat A, and I were hungry at midnight, so after yelping a bit, we found ourselves at The Hungry Monk. It was pretty late, so the only food they could make us was fried food, but we were okay with that! I think it was a Friday night, so $3 margaritas yayyy! My favorite haha (:

We had a great time! Kat loves those claw machines, so I think she spent about $5 on it, but didn't win anything. I forget the name of the guys who helped us, but they were really cool&helpful. I looooved their fried mushrooms oh my god get those. Seriously. Bomb dot com.

If I ever go back to AZ, I'd definitely stop by. Fried mushrooms&margaritas!
