Great wine selection and very friendly staff!

We've been coming here for months now and it's always a fun, laid back experience. It isn't like many wine bars that can sometimes be uptight so it's great for first dates or even a Sunday afternoon. People bring their dogs on the patio and instruments to jam on on Sunday so it makes it feel really local.

Often times they can be out of various food selections, but there's enough to choose from that it's never made us want to leave. We'll continue to go to Down Under whenever we're looking for a chill time out.
