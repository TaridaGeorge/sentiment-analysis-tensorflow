We went there for brunch(my fave meal of the day) and it was delicious!  We ordered the sweet cream pancakes and the monterey omelet.  I'm not an omelet person, more like a pancake person, but I loved the omelet.  Very tasty and worth the drive.  The pancake was good, but not out of this world.  Next time I am going to have to try the multi grain pancake....
The buscuit was delicious.  The service was great.  She split everything in 2 dishes for my sister and me, so it was really nice that she did that without us even asking to do so.  
Will def be back!
