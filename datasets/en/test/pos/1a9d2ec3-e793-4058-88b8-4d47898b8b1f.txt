I absolutely love this park!  It is huge!  

My daughter and I came here for the first time today.  She absolutely LOVED playing here.

We only spent about an hour here today due to the cold and my pressing schedule, but I was forced to promise we'd be back soon.  

There are so many cool parts to this park. 

My favorite is the Farm Land area, with the huge jungle gyms covered by shade.  I can see how this would be a great benefit in the Summer.  My daughter's favorite part was Critter Land, which featured a giant gila monster and some dinosaur bones that you can uncover.  

The rec center is ginormous and you can rent parts of it out for different events, including birthday parties.  I might be doing that next month when my kiddo turns 5!  

We will definitely be back to Tumbleweed soon!
