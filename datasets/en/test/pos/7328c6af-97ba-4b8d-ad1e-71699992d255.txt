I am a Perk fan! I have eaten here at least once a week for the past two months and have not been dissapointed. 

For Breakfast you can't go wrong with with pancakes, simply amazing. My fiance loved the Fancy Pants Scramble. For those that love Brie Cheese, this one is for you. 
For lunch, the best item is the grass fed beef burger with sweet potato fries. Great tasting burger and the fries are just awesome. I love the fact that they support local farmers and order grass fed beef. That is hard to find in this town, but I would gladly support any business that goes the extra mile for better ingredients. Add the always great service and this local joint a winner. If they started serving dinner, I would probably never leave.
