Although Roys are everywhere, I never had an opportunity to go until recently when we were vacationing in Arizona. 

I love this place!  When we arrived, we were early enough to catch the tail end of happy hour which means that for $5.00 each, I got to try the Hawaiian martini, lobster potstickers, and cucumber and cilantro martini.  Everything was so damn good!

Once we sat down, we received edamame, compliments of the chef.  I wasn't a huge fan of the seasoning on it.  I kind of prefer rock salt.

I ordered the surf and turf for dinner.  Again, it was amazing, although the lobster was lobster claws, not a tail, which was kind of disappointing.

For desert, we ordered the molten lava cake, which was phenomenal.  I would definitely go back!
