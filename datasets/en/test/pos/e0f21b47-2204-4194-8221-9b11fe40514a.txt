We live in Chandler but would rather drive here than to Scottsdale for a fabulous dinner.  We drove out here after several people told me how good it was.  The Deli did not disappoint. My family of 5 ordered everything from sandwiches to pork tenderloin.  The food is farm fresh and divine.  Great beer and wine selection  Very affordable gourmet food.  We will be back!
