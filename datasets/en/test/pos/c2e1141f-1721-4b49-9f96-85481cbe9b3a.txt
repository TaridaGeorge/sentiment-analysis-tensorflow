This is the place for Korean jjigae - spicy tofu soup in a little black cauldron.  Unlimited side dishes - I like the dried and pickled seaweed, the soy sauce Mung bean sprouts, the vinegar skinny radish kimchi, and the spicy regular kimchi (not the best, but one of the spiciest).  Most tofu soups here are around $10, and you're eating it to the sound of some 90's tunes.  But the hot tofu soup is the best.  I like the mushroom kind.  Not sure about the other dishes, but Chodang is a great place to go if you're near the 202 south or anywhere near Chandler Mall.
