I was excited to try these cupcakes after hearing that they won Cupcake Wars.This is a small shop that I have passed by numerous times, but now I will make a point of visiting whenever the cupcake urge presents itself!  I have had Sprinkles and Yummies cupcakes in LA and I think these are better, very moist and flavorful. We took 4 cupcakes home to sample they were delicious and I wish we had bought more.  I hear they are going to have a gluten free line soon.  We had the vegan, and three others that were wonderful!  The service was friendly and fun.  These will be great gifts as well.
