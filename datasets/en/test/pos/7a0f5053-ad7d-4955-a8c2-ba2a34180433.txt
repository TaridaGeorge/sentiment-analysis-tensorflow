This is a world class comedy club.  Every time I go here I end up smashed and laughing my ass off.  2 drink minimum of course, but that is expected.

They bring in the creme de la creme of comedy in here.  I saw Joe Rogan and was rolling on the floor almost.  

The food is pretty deez, but this is a comedy club and anyone with half a brain would hook up dinner before the show.  Drinks aren't too pricey, and actually cheap in respects to being sold in a venue.  

Check out their website and roll in one night when a performer you dig is there, you won't be disappointed.
