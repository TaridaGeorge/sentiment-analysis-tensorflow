I just had to move out of state and was pleasantly surprised each time I went here. My service was quick and, though the lines could sometimes be long, it is because individual attention is given, which I appreciated when it came to be my turn. Chris, specifically, went above and beyond to help me on two different visits. Overall, I wish that this uhaul was in my new town so that I could continue to go there!
