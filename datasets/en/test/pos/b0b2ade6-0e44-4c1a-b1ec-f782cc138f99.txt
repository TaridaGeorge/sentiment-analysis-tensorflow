This place is a little expensive but its worth it for the wide and inventive selection of ice creams and sorbets. Everything here tastes so fresh with the flavors just jumping out! I love going back just to try their new flavors. Their ice-cream sandwiches are also excellent! Their serving sizes are a little small for the money but its worth it just for the experience. I like that you can hang out here with friends or family playing board games. They also have free wi-fi and electrical outlets for laptops. I have a feeling I will be going here more often once it gets warmer!
