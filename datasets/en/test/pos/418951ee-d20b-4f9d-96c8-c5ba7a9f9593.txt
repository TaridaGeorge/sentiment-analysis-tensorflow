I LOVE BURRITO EXPRESS. My fiance has been going with his friends since they were in high school and he finally took me to try the only thing his group ever orders: a steak, potato and cheese burrito. EPIC. This burrito was so awesome that they have never tried anything else on the menu and I feel the exact same way. The tortilla is huge and fresh and the burrito itself is gigantic. I can never finish mine but the boys seem to eat it right up! Don't leave this place without trying the horchata either, it's so good. I've been to other Mexican places like this and the horchata tasted like gross water. Burrito Express however does it right and I will always go back to this place whenever I'm up for the BEST BURRITO EVER.
