Ya know... since going back I have to update this real fast:

I ordered the Spicy Mexican Chicken one with the corn, beans, cheeses, and green chili. DELICIOUS. It's so crazy how they can take several different types of ethnic foods in a buttery pocket of love, and it always tastes awesome.

Tips:

- Each pasty is $7.50 - $9.50 in price
- You can call and place an order for pick-up
- You can go in and place an order for take-out (total wait approx 20 minutes)
- You can order pasty's un-cooked so that you can bake them at home (humm I wonder if they freeze well...)
- The crust is light and buttery. Reminds me of a croissant. 
- They make each pasty to your liking. If you don't want onions, just ask.
