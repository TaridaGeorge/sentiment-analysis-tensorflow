So I've eaten at Flo's three times this week and had to review it. I've been coming to Flo's for about three years now and have enjoyed the experience every time. I will say this though, its loud. It can make it difficult to hear and carry on a conversation especially if you have a big group.

Nonetheless, the food is yummy and always comes out quick. I usually get the same thing, garlic chicken and I ask them to spice it up. I've gotten some friends hooked on it as well. The owner/manager is always walking around, not sure if her name is Ms Flo, but she is always asking patrons if everything is ok. My answer is always yes. Btw, you can order to go as well. 

There are several other Flo's around town but this one is by far my favorite. Oh its way cheap too.
