The stars say it all. Over a hundred reviews and it has 4.5 stars. You can't go wrong! I prefer this location over tempe, it seems to be less packed at busy times. I love sitting with strangers in the pews! Honestly, I wish i worked here, it has a great vibe! I see this company expanding across the valley!

Food: You can't go wrong! Almost everything comes with its unique sauce to dip in. The desert menu, i feel needs some work. The one with the bananas, yes its good, but anyone could make it at home.

BEST THING ON THE MENU!!! Sounds weird...but the baked broccoli and cauliflower appetizer. Its hot, cheesy...and healthy all at the same time!
