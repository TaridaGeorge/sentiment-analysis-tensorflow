The right vegan food for non-vegans! Most vegan and veg places simply preach to the choir and just don't do a good enough job of attracting omnivores. That is where this joint stands out. 

The mock chicken dishes were just great with the right amount of spice and flavor . The decor is decidedly hippiesh but not overbearing . We went on a Thursday evening and it was CROWDED! there was a virtual nonstop line but totally worth the wait. Ask them to make the entrees a little spicy and then enjoy them with their homemade lemonade.

Dont forget to try the incredible vegan chocolate cake! Their specialty ice-cream is great too.
