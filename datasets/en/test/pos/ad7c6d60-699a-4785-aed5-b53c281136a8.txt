I truly feel that this theatre is a gem! Ticket prices are cheaper than Harkins and AMC and it's a really nice theatre. They just re-modeled the parking lot and the complex around there so it's really nice to visit. The theatre itself is clean, nice AC and doesn't have as many people as Harkins. I've never had a problem here and come here often to avoid the crazy crowds at Tempe Marketplace. Plus, I live across the street so it's very close. It's definitely worth checking out!
