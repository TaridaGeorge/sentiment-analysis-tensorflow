I'm a big fan. I was here last Saturday and had the best Bloody Mary I've had in a long time. I always forget about this place since it's kind of out of the way and not part of a large corner or strip mall area.  It's a nice, well put together sports bar that is clean, and not over the top.  The bartender (I think it was Kesha) and servers have always been friendly and on top of things. The fried pickles are super yummy and the salads are HUGE.  Our food has always come out timely without any issues.  Decor matches which is always nice since most places are hodgepodged together.  I haven't found anything wrong with this place really. Turkey cheese steak is awesome and so is the Pit Boss.  I recommend it as a nice neighborhood sports bar.
