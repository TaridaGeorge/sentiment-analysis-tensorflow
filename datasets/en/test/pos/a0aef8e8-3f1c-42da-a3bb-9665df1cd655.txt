I'm write this update because I think its crappy that Duners has the same rating as many of the pizza places down central between baseline and broadway. Duners is better that any pizza hut, dominoes, papa johns or little Cesars. Look you might not think duners is awesome, heck i don't But its better than these big box pizza joints and the rating should reflect as such.
