I needed some supplements for my Basenji and called all over town looking for it. NO ONE had it-no one except for Ray's! It was only $13.00 super helpful, super friendly, can't wait to come back and browse. Going to buy my shots here too instead of paying outrageous prices at the vet. Can't say enough good things about these guys.
