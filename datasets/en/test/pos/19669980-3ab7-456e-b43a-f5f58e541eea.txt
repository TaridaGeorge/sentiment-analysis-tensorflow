Bank of A has eaten me alive with fees. but I am so happy there is a couple drive throughs near my crib and I think the guy working at Bank of A on thomas and 44th is real nice, it takes like 2-3 weeks it seems like to get a new debit card in the mail...(so always go in and get that generic temporary one to use while you wait for eternity for your real one to finally arrive) but he's so nice and gave me his card if I didnt receive it in another week to call him directly. I just think most employees at any branch i have been to are always so friendly, but yes they have fee'd me to DEATH. but im still there since i have direct deposit and ive never had a bank error with this bank.
