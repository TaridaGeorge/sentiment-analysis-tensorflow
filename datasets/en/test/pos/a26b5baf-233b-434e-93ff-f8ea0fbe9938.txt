Eggs Benedict Lovers Rejoice!!

I come to Indulge all the time for lunch and LOVE it.  When I was told they have Breakfast, I had to investigate.  

They only serve breakfast on the weekends, and let me tell you it's amazing!!  Word hasn't gotten yet out on the breakfast thing, which selfishly is great b/c you get a seat right away (compared to waiting for ages down the road at other places).

I'm definitely an eggs benedict snob, and theirs is top notch!  The hollandaise is spot on and delicious.  They are a little on the pricey side ($9+ for Eggs benny without hashbrown), but totally worth it.  This is a must try for Eggs Benedict fans!
