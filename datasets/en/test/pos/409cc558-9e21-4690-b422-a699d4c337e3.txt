So I cracked my iPhone 4 and called Verizon (who I pay an insurance fee to each month) and they told me to try Apple first.  I did and after a short wait the young guy asked me how it broke, how high up it was when it fell (in my hand or off of a building?) and I said it was in my hand.  He clicked around on his device a bit and said "normally we'd charge you $165 but i'll help you out today" and gave me a free brand new iPhone 4.  Plus Grant Hill (Suns player) was in there at the same time. good service!!!
