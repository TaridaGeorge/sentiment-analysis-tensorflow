I was very fortunate to be brought along as a plus one to the opening night of Giselle. It was a beautiful performance. Very professional, beautiful choreography, excellent story telling. The female leads stole the show. They both did an amazing job and are excellent dancers. I had never been to the ballet before and will now return wanting more!
