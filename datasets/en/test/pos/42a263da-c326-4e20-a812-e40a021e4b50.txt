I would support this local ice cream joint all the time if I lived in the area. 
What better way to enjoy some creamy ice cream laced with alcohol!

Lee's does it the best to say the least. 
The ice cream to alcohol ratio is great. Just creamy enough with a rush of alcohol fused in. 

Lee herself assisted us and she was greatly friendly and patient.
Though we were given more than enough samples, it was hard to pick. 
The Carrot Cake Irish Whiskey and the Chocolate Jack Daniel are outstanding. And even the waffle is delishhh. 
 
The decor is simple, modern and clean. A handful of tables, but not at all clustery.
