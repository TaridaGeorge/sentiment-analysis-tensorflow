It officially feels like Christmas after seeing the Nutcracker last night! We were very lucky to start the night with a chat with the Director of Production, Michael Panvinni. You could see how much he enjoys his job and ballet in his enthusiasm talking to us. He started by telling us the story of the nutcracker and then answered questions about the cast, back stage, and technical matters. It made the production even better knowing some of the background. We then got to watch the nutcracker!!! It was of course a fantastic production with excellent professional dancers and the orchestra was amazing. I really enjoyed the couple of moments added that made you laugh. Especially the rats! They were very funny. Thank you Lindsey, Yelp, and AZ Ballet for arranging this for us! It made a fan of the ballet out of me!
