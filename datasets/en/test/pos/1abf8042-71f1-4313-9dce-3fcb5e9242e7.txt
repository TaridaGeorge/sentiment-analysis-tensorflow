As one who came to this place several times a week, I was horrified to see this place shut down. This restaurant was the landlord's greatest asset (much more so than the lease), what a moron upping the lease price like they did, assuming that's what happened.

I'd love to learn of it if Anthony opens another restaurant in Scottsdale. I'd be there in a heartbeat. Great food!! 

Meanwhile, does anyone have any recommendations for alternative restaurants for healthy food? I've been regularly going to Coffee Plantation, they have a delicious breakfast wrap, a great chicken waldorf salad sandwich, and some amazing lettuce/spinach salads. But if there are other healthy places to eat in this area of Scottsdale that are worth recommending, please share! I'm hungry!
