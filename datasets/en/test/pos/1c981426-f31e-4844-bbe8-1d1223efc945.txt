Love this place. A very friendly staff is a must for us and we have always been treated very well.
No cover charge live entertainment and the best Saturday night Prime Rib Special in town at any price and it's only $12.95. 
It comes with a wonderfully crispy fresh salad and the ranch dressing is very good
The nachos are killer too and very generous portions as is all the dishes they serve
