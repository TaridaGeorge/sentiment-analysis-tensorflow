This is the newest Zipps in the valley and my favorite. The food is the most consistently delicious and I still stand by my previous statement that Zipps has the best bar food in the state!  Best wings, great burgers, awesome Monaco Facaccia. Great happy hour, reverse happy hour, and weekend specials. Fun atmosphere, bar games, and lots of TVs. I just named nine reasons why this place is great. I could go on.  Fantastic chicken strips, onion rings, and fries. They even have the best dipping sauces, like the ranch or the blue cheese or the jalapeno sauce. We're at twelve now. Want 15? Ok. The Zipparita, 32oz domestics on HH, and John Dalys. I like to give three examples at a time.  For example: Nice staff, reliable take out, convenient shuttle to games. 18. To be continued...
