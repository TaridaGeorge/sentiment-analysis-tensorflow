Been to location in North Austin .... this is just as good.

Great drinks, helpful waiter and phenomenal chicken flat bread.  Reasonable cost for the environment and treatment.  Food is outstanding and employees seem to care about what they do.

Rest room is a long jaunt but nothing is perfect.  Well worth the trip and your money.
