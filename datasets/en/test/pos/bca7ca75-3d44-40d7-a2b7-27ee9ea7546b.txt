The ultimate play place for little kids.  I took my granddaughter (almost 2) and I must admit I as an "older" person had as much fun as she did.  Yes, it does cost but you can't put a price on the sheer fun the little ones have.  Kids over 10 should steer clear -- unless they want to revert to their childhood and have a rip roaring time.  Also, every room is supervised by a kindly docent, who make sure everyone is safe and having fun.  They take time to show the little ones how everything works.  I would avoid the "free" day, as I would think it would be too crowded and diminish the play opportunities.  I look forward to bring my granddaughter again and again as she grows up.
