I reserved for a birthday date and the staff were very accommodating to my request and friendly. I love the staff, wish every restaurant was as professional and courteous as Tarbell's. I will certainly use this place for special occasions and a dinner night out. 

One thing I almost forgot to mention, I ordered a special they had that day and there was an issue with the food that I wont say but again the manager came out personally and apologized for the mistake after I reordered  and actually took that item out of our dinner bill. And I have to say that was a very expensive meal and I was really impressed with the service. Thank you Tarbell
