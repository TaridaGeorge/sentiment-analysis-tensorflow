I'm a cook, not a yuppie decorator.  That's why I prefer Sur la Table over Williams-Sonoma a hundred times.  This particular store has very friendly and never pushy staff.  Like a hardware store, most people who go in actually do need help.  They carry several of everything.  They stand behind everything.  Prices are about the same as W-S, but the variety and depth is far greater.  Furthermore, you can get just about anything found at a W-S at Sur la Tabe, while the opposite is not true.  For the joy of cooking, check it out.
