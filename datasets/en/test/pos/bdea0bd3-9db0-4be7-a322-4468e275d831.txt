UnPhoGettable is as good as it gets for flavor, authenticity, friendly service and reasonable prices. My family and I have been back more times than I can count now and we have never been disappointed. The consistency continually amazes us. We've also ordered takeout and the food is always packaged with great care - cold and hot ingredients are in separate containers and fresh as can be. As first time customers, we were given a condensed history of Pho - coupled with traditional eating instructions when the actual food arrived. For those afraid of soup not filling them up, thing again! The portion sizes are HUGE and the amount of ingredients is beyond substantial. I would give this place 10 stars if I could. Outstanding!
