Took advantage of their Groupon offer last month & sent my hubby in for a massage for his birthday.

He absolutely loved it.  Very clean, comfortable and relaxing environment.  He was extremely relaxed and was told that his back had a few knots that needed to be worked out.  Their deep tissue massage is top notch.  

If they're having a deal-- Take your mother, sister or sweetheart here, for sure.
