Toyama has two wonderful Sushi chefs (Mo & Giro) who remember you by name and offer great "off the menu" selections if you request chefs choice. I highly recommend Toyama for their great rolls and sushi. They have the freshest sushi around and their wait staff is very attentive...so much better than the "other guys".
