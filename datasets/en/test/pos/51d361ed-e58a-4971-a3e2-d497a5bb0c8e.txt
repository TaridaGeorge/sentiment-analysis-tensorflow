I dont' like to go to banks.

I prefer direct deposit and getting cash when I checkout at the grocery or at Circle K or the like.

I've had to go inside this location a couple times.  

Both times, I was approached by an employee who asked what I needed to do, who then sat me at a "banker's desk", where they took care of my transactions, without standing in line.

Nice!
