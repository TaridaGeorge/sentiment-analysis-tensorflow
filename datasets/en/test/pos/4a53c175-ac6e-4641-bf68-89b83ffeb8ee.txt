Another location is in North PHX on the north side of Bell Road just east of Cave Creek Road.

The most delicious Sonoran dogs in Phoenix! I love how they load 'em up--bacon, beans, mayonesa, onions, cotija cheese, yellow cheese, guac, salsa, (canned) mushrooms, jalape√±os--all on a soft, buttery bun. The service is ALWAYS super friendly and their tables are clean. You really can't beat the price... 2 dogs and 2 Mexican Cokes for under $10?! YES PLEASE.
