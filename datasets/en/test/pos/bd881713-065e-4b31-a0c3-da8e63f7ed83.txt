Love this location! I agree with reviewer Chris V. that the parking lot access is weird. But, the one on Indian School and 7th Ave also has weird access so maybe it's something with all F&E parking lots. This F&E is on my way to and from the gym. I wish there was one in north Tempe. The people who work here are really nice and always help you bag your groceries.
