I was closing in a few days on a house and I was in California and needed a repair on the a/c asap so I contacted On Time. They were fantastic, the customer service was wonderful. From the appointment to the technician constantly keeping me informed to the follow up call to let me know the a/c was working and even the final cost was lower than I thought. I would easily recommend them!
