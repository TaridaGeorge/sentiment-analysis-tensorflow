I had my wedding at The Castle in june and it was so perfect! They helped from start to Finnish and when I needed help and was confused they were right there for me! I definitely felt like a fairy tale princess! Oh and my ceremony was so wonderful! Everything was picture perfect! And my Dj was wonderful they recommend him for you so it's a one stop shop for all of what your looking for! I would tell anyone and everyone to have your event here!! 5+ stars for sure!!!!
