I remember when this place use to be located on Dobson and Southern (NW corner) and then it grew up to an adult and here it is, busy than ever! I love coming here when i need to. You can practically get anything "asian" at this place and GOYA! Their competition is Mekong down the street, but I think Lee Lee is holding its own with its loyal customers and wide variety of sale items. 

I would definitely recommend coming here even if you need meats and vegetables - cheap! Like most Asian markets I've been to, it does have that stintch of weird odor expelling from the walls. But after awhile, you get use to it. :) 

They have a Filipino section - LOVE IT - get some Datu Puti and Silver Swan!! :)
