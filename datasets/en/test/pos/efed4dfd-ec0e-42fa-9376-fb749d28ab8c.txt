I live near this restaurant but had never been in - its in a little building that's not much to look at from the outside but inside its a very cute little dinner. The real star is the food which was Awsome we had breakfast and the bacon was perfect the hash browns where delicious and them made the best sunny side up eggs I've ever see (whites done perfect, not runny) - the staff was very friendly and I met one of the cooks an she was very sweet. We definitely will go back.
