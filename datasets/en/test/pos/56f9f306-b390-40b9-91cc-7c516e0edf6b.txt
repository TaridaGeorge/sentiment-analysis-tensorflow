I luh dis place. I came here for the first time over Thanksgiving Break and it is probably my new go to sushi place when I'm visiting the Chandler/Gilbert area. Pricing? Great! Sushi? Great! The uniqueness of the belt sets it apart from other Sushi restaurants as well and I honestly feel like it is faster than ordering off a card. All in all I am extremely excited to visit again.
