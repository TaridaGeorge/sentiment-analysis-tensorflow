Chloe's is an excellent place for a quick and casual lunch in North Scottsdale. Located in Kierland Commons, it has an old style counter behind which the magical grilled sandwiches are prepared. The tuna sandwich and the tuna melt are both very good. The best thing about Chloe's is that it's simply good, clean and has 50 cent coffee - with free refills. Tough to beat - one of the best, clean, tasty and easy in-and-out lunch places around.
