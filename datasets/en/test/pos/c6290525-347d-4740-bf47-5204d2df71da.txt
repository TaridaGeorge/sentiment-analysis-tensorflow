This has to be one of the very best sandwich places to hit up for lunch in downtown Phoenix! If you havent tried this place you have got to give yourself some time and come on down! 

There was a group of us the other day for lunch. A few of us had the Super Sicilian, including myself. The bread is just just barely toasted, light and easy to eat with bubbling melted cheese a top of bed of lettuce and tomatos and a light italian dressing. Each sandwich is made with high quality ingrediants. The meats are just incredible with strong flavours and compliment each other very well and the result is excellent!  

The only disappointment here was that some got a half sandwich instead of a full! 4$ for a half, and 7$ for a full, you just cant beat the flavours and quality for that price!
