GREAT!  Have been coming here for years, since they opened, and the quality and service has never changed. (thats a good thing!)  Our favorite thing to get is the Spring Mix Salad and the creamy mushroom, sundried tomatoe, and assparagus pasta.  Very Good!  no matter what you go with, you will not be dissapointed!
