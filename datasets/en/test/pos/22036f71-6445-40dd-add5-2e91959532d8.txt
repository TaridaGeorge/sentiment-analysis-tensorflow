The Melting Pot is soooo goooood.  And it's such a great place to go with friends.  I've been several times and would recommend it for birthdays, New Years, special meals, whatever!

I love the Wisconsin Trio for the cheese fondue and the Lobster Indulgence for dinner.  For dessert, I like Yin and Yang.  

Be prepared to spend well over $100 for a couple though.  It ain't cheap.  That and you'll want to be sure you have a reservation as this place is always packed.
