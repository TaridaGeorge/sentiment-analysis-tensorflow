Ãœber cool and pleasantly surprised! We arrived at 5:30 to check out the bar for happy hour. They offer incredible old fashioned infused cocktails and unique appetizers! For dinner we started with the chop salad that is a must!!!!!!!! I had the seared scallop dish! It was perfect! My husband had short ribs that were excellent! The bartender, Thomas, was extremely personable and educated us on the entire experience of this place! We enjoyed him so much that we passed on taking a table we had reserved! We love to try a little bit of everything when dinning someplace new. Unfortunately, we couldn't check out the mixology bar upstairs because we did not have a DD! Next time for sure! It's a little hidden secret in Old Town Scottsdale! We recommend to go early so you can enjoy everything!
