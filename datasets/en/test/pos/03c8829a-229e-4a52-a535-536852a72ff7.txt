Went to the Brat Haus with my family (all adults) and loved it! My favorite were the fresh, right out of the oven pretzels for sure however the brat I ordered was delicious, especially with the root beer onions on top. My daughter had the apricot onion chutney on top of her brat and that was excellent too. The fries were great and we all tried different drinks (beers and yummy concoctions that were fun). The service was great too. It is tricky to get a parking spot but I lucked out and parked on the street right in front of the place....that earned this place five stars in my book. I will be back.
