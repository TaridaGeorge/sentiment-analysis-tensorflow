I continue to love this place after all these years and continue to come here because of the Azteca Soup.

We finally tried brunch here and it was absolutely delicious!  The dishes were creative and sounded so interesting we had a hard time choosing.  Everything was flavorful and had a good spice.  I had breakfast enchiladas - egg, carne asada, chorizo, red chile sauce and hubby had a dish of root vegetables, sausage and green chile sauce.   Needless to say, we cleaned our plates.

The service was great too.  Also, one of things I love here, they let you substitute your side for anything - including a cup of Azteca soup!
