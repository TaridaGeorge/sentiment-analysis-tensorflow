Lola is my go-to for morning perks and for a place to do my weekend work. From the incredibly helpful staff who are as gracious as they come, to the eclectic music mix, the rotation of art on the walls, and the mixed clientele, Lola is the coffee space of my dreams. Even when traveling to cities such as San Francisco, Austin, And the best of the Midwest and East Coast, Lola sets the standard for me about everything a coffee shop should be. You can tell there is definite pride in ownership, and Daniel's impeccable taste is evident in every detail.
