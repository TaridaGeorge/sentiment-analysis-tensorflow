Joe - wherever/whoever you are... you sir, are a genius. 

LOVE LOVE LOVE the Joe's line of restaurants. 
Went here because I love Joe's Real Farm Grill and wanted to see if his 3rd restaurant in Gilbert would hold up.
Yup! It did! 
The bathrooms are just as fun (and borderline creepy) as all the other :)
Food = AMAZING! 
The chicken pasta is to die for. Twice. 
The sloppy joes are even good - and I don't like retaurant sloppy joes :)
All in all - go here. It's delicious.
