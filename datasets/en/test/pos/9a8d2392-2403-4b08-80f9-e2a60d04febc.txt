Great customer service & prices!  
I was looking for a particular post lamp to match an exterior light I purchased at Costco.  They gave me the best price around, ordered the light for me and were very plesant and helpful. 
I spoke with Sean & Ashley on seperate occasions.  Both get an A+ for customer service in my book!
