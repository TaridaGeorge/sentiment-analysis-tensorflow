I had the BEST experience at Nello's this past weekend.  I have been coming to this location for a while, and finally got around to writing a review.  The menu has some similar  items to the sister restaurant "The Parlor" which is a good thing.  the staff is on top of things and we got a great wine recommendation from Cody.  This is my go-to place when I have guests in town for an all around great dining experience.  Don't forget to try the chopped chicken salad, it is amazing!
