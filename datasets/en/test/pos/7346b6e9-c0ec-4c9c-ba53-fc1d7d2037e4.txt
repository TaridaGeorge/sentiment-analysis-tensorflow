I loved this place. The food, beer, service, and overall ambiance all worked for me. Both me and my friend had the salmon BLT and I got the Kiltlifter. The sandwich and the beer were absolutely delicious. There is nothing quite like enjoying a cold brewski outside with good friends and good food, and Four Peaks delivers that. Its worth driving around looking for parking, don't let that stop you. I will definitely be going back here in the future to try their seasonal beers (they were in between seasons when I went), buy fresh-brewed beer to take home, and try some more of their delectable menu. One of my favorite spots in Tempe by far.
