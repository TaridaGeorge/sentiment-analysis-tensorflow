I got a thing for out of this world coffee and "earthy" chicks with a tattoo here and there; therefore, I love the Cartel Coffee Lab. The baristas are phenomenal as well as the vibe and music. The food is surprisingly fresh, yummy and fair priced. There is also a good selection of draft imports. It's a perfect hideaway from the pretentious neighborhood. Wi Fi has never been a problem. It's a 5 star coffee house in my world.
