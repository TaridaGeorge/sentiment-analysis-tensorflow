Out of all the frozen yogurt places I've tried [Ocean Blue, Mojo's, et cetera], Yogurtland is probably the best I've had!

While some places have really runny and melty yogurt [Ocean Blue] or over-priced standard yogurt [Mojo's], I really do enjoy Yogurtland the best! 

With their vast amount of flavors, although they limit their flavors and only release certain ones on different days, and wide selection of toppings, what's not to love?  My personal favorite flavors are probably the pistachio and taro.

...and I rock my Yogurtland shirt whenever I can.  /nerd
