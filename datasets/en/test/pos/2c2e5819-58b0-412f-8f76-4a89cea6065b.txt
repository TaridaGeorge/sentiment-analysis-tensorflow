I LOVE Dragon Palace. I have been going here for about 16 years.  It is your average looking neighborhood, family owned chinese restaurant. They have crazy lanterns and blue walls inside.  The staff is always very friendly and helpful.  They will make recomendations and help you out with ordering.  Lunch is awesome...you can order from a list of about 15 dishes and it comes with rice, wantons, and an eggroll all for about 9 bucks.  Dinner is great too...portions are large and perfect for sharing.  I would definetly recommend this place.
