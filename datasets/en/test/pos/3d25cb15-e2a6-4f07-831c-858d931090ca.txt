First time here. In short-
1. Soft pretzel with provolone fondue- excellent. 
2. 32 hour ribs- salty but yum!
3. Salted caramel custard- nothing like I've ever had but I would definitely do it again. 
Bottom line- I should have tried this place earlier, because it'd probably be a place I would go often
