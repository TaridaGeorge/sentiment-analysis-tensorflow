I drop by BF here so he can run in and do his ebay shipping or whatever he is doing, dont know, dont care but BF always out in 30 seconds...I give it 5 stars when I am burning the gas and A/C cranked up at 120 degree daytimes and BF flies in, flies out. Perfect, my kind of service, efficient and gets the job done.
