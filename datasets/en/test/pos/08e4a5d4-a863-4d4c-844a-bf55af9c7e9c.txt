Wow. I was so happy to see this on Yelp! I was a volunteer here for 4 years, till working 7 days a week became too much. 
What a wonderful group of people, doing an admirable job caring for God's sick and injured creatures. I will never forget the amazing work they do, the amazing experience I had working here, being able to work with and handle the hawks, vultures, song birds, and my favorites...the owls. God will reward you all for caring for his creatures!
