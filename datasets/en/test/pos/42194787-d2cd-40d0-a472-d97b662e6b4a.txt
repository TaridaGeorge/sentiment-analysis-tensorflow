Was at Zinc again last night and have to say the place keeps getting better still.  Started with the crepes again, perfect again.  Then shared the scallops and lamb shank for dinner.  I'm not usually a huge fan of lamb OR scallops but they were recommended and I was feeling adventurous.  The lamb -  AMAZING.  Melt in your mouth wonderful.  More like a stew than anything with classic fall off the bone tender meat over creamy cheesy polenta.  Their bread is perfect French bread too.  This time of year (winter) there is a festive, buzzy energy with a good crowd but not TOO long of a wait.  Make reservations though for sure.  Oh, and Bobby's across the way in Kierland is a nice spot for a pre-dinner drink (400s Hollywood glamour meets The Jetsons with cool live jazz your parents or grandparents would have enjoyed back in the day).
