Sunflower is my new local grocery store. After deciding to go vegan, Fry's food was no longer good enough for our needs (not enough vegan options).

Sunflower to the rescue! Tons of faux products for vegans! meats, cheese, veganaise, sour cream, soy yogurt, etc.

Tons of fresh produce too. Sunflower is great for anyone looking for some more healthy grocery options. They rock!
