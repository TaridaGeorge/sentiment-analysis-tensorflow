Here is another fine example of Phoenix splendid public works.This building is a vibrant hub of human interaction and learning. There is free Wifi throughout the building with plenty of well lit desks complete with a place to plug in your power supply. There are also public computers for anyone who has a library card and a little patience as there is a time limit
and a place for users to line up when all the 30 - 40+ computers are all in use. See for yourself. It's free fun for everyone. Our Tax Dollars the way they should be spent!!!
