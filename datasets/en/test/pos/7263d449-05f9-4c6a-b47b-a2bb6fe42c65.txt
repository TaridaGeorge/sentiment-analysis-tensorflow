Wow! So good!

We've been here three times now and have left super satisfied each time.

We love that it's an independent restaurant and we are supporting a local business.

The service is great. The owner/his wife are always there. Joe (the owner) makes a point of coming around to each and every table to make sure his customers are satisfied. Last night, we were talking to him and mentioned that we are getting married next month and he gave us each a free glass of champagne. How thoughtful! All the staff wants you to leave satisfied.

The food is by far the best Italian food in Phoenix, possibly anywhere. It has tons of flavor, tastes fresh, and homemade. Get the minestrone soup to start- best anywhere. The pastas never disappoint.

Cute setting and great atmosphere! Go tonight!
