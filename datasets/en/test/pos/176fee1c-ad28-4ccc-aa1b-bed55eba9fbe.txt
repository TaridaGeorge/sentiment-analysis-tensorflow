THE best sandwich. I've tried all of the few options, but the mozza is the best. Don't even worry about anything else. Fresh mozzarella made on the premises -- and some of the best damn bread.

Absolutely fresh ingredients -- and many are locally grown!

At $8 a sandwich, it's a little expensive, but you can share . . . and totally worth it. Best. Sandwich. In Phoenix.

Go for take-away or just walk across the street to Steele Indian School Park for an impromptu picnic.
