Loved this place! I had the egg noodle soup with Shrimp and Crab. It was delicious and I ordered a side of cold bean sprouts which I thought was interesting since all the Vietnamese restaurants I have been to have just brought it with the soup. I have been to a ton of Pho restaurants in Utah, Los Angeles and Phoenix and this one is a very good one indeed! I will come again for sure!
