Amazing food, and usually it's amazingly crowded to go along with it. Might be better since they opened their new location on Shea Blvd.  The food is really good and cheap, too- it's great to go with a group of friends. Share cheesy bread, pizza and pizzuki (i can't spell it, but its a warm chocolate chip cookie thing with ice cream!)
