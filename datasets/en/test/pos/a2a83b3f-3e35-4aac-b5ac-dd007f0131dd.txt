Another find via Local First AZ Independence Week, the place gets an extra star for being a co-op style boutique... this has got to guarantee variety and uniqueness (so I hope, I'm often in Glendale visiting family...bonus the 60/Grand Ave entrance is right around the corner).

The place did make me wish I was a decade younger, as they trend twds punky chic to gothy (cute) skulls.  I'm not so cool to pull off that look, but there are some good finds here.  Some of the clothes definitely reminded me of the items you find in the cheap Hong Kong street markets as well, cute but disposable.
