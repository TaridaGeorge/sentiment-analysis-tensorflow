Small business owners: Take note of this place. Mike and Vivian know how to run a local business.

I go here 2-3 times a week. Mike and Vivian are the nicest people ever. You'll end up standing in the store 5 minutes longer than the 60 seconds you originally intended because you're having an awesome conversation with one of them.

Every time I pull up in my car, you can see one of them running to the back to grab my clothes, so they have them ready before I even walk in. Now that's service.

My clothes are always ready on time, they get things done fast if you are pressed for time (no pun intended), and their prices are low. On top of that they do an exceptional job.
