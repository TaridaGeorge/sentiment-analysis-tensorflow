Okay the first time I ever went i had a dinner entree and it wasn't that great. Second time I had the Bernaise sliders and I fell in love. Can't seem to order anything but them, since. However I did try the Ahi Steak sandwich once and that was amazing as well..Not a big beer drinker so really can't comment on that.. But the music ...if you like classic rock and/or 80's rock.. this is the place to be!!!There's just something about hearing Boston being played....
