What they said! And the Hawg Dawg ROCKS! It was a slow weekday afternoon--well after lunch rush. Dave and Karyn are great people, and the folks working for them seem to have their heads on also; comparing them to other young food service workers I've run in to. And they have Moose Drool Beer. That's some good stuff!
