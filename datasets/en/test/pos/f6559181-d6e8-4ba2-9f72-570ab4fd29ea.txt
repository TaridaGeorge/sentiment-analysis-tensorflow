AZ Humane Society Thrift Store is a place to find some really great things at some really low prices. 

They have a lot of things, in my opinion even more of a variety then other thrift stores. From books to tv's to dog food to clothes to furniture and much more.

Most of all, I love that when I shop there my money is going to someplace where its really needed.
