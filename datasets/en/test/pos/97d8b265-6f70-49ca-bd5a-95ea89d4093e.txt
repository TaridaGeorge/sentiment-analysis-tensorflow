I never really had sweet tooth.  Given the choice between a piece of cake or a pickle, the pickle wins every time.  Urban Cookies has changed me.

I've sampled just about every cupcake that's offered, and here are a few highlights:

The orange blossom cupcake is a delightful surprise, with subtle flavors and great texture.  My personal favorite.

The chocolate cupcake is the best chocolate thing I've ever eaten.  Think about that for just a second.  The BEST chocolate thing I've ever had.

The carrot cake cupcake reminds me of my childhood.  In a really good way.

The strawberry cupcake actually tastes like strawberries!

To sum up, Urban Cookies has made me appreciate the sweeter things in life.  Thank you.
