I am so happy to have found Arcadia Tavern! We have a 3 year old and a 5 month old and don't get to get out much due to the kid factor. Arcadia Tavern is a restaraunt/tavern we can enjoy and not feel as though we are inconveniencing others because we have children with us! The atmosphere is great, the food is wonderful! Met a couple of the owners on our trips there and they seem like quality people who work hard to make the place succeed! LOVE IT!
