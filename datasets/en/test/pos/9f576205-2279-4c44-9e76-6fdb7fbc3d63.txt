I love Italian restaurants, and this one did not disappoint. The atmosphere was outstanding - quiet, quaint and relaxing. The service was great as well. Our server was friendly, knowledgeable and right there when we needed her. And the food was delicious. Our appetizers, entrees and desserts were just to die for. I honestly can't wait to go back.
