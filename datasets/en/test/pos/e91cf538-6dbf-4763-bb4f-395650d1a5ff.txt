Their pizza is fantastic. My sister and I make a habit of going there every Friday for pizza and beer - but they stopped stocking Peroni!!! I like the fact that you can sit outdoors on the patio and smoke and have your beer and pizza.

There's a new server at the Glendale location that thinks she is working at the Four Seasons Resort. A laid back beer and pizza day with family turned into a big production with her constant coming to the table and then went on some long drawn out "dessert list" (?!) at a pizza joint? Give me a break. We just wanted to sit down and enjoy our beers. 

On the BIG plus side, they now have online ordering!! The site FAILS to mention how late they deliver.
