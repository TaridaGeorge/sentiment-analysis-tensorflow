Teakwoods was my go to place when I lived in Biltmore. They have such a diverse menu that those of you that hang with picky eaters would appreciate. They have the usual assortment of yummy burgers and wings. They serve up a ginormous Triple Decker Tavern Club, which is very tasty and you can easily get 2 meals out of it. Last time I went I got French Toast at dinner time, how cool is that. I had left overs for breakfast the next morning. Their meatloaf is delicious as well. And they serve the best Strawberry Lemondade in all of Phoenix which my wife just loves. 

Teakwoods actually get 6 yelp stars from me for serving Diet Dr Pepper. Teakwoods you rock and I miss you; But I'll be back to visit this weekend.
