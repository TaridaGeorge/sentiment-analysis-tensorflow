The best sandwich I've ever had.  

Now, you shouldn't come here expecting a burst of assorted flavors upon every bite.  Instead, expect the natural, delicate, and fresh flavors gently serenade your palate.  The focus here is a few simple, incredibly fresh ingredients that compliments each other completely.  While many say that pizzeria bianco (the other place by the owner) is overrated, no such statement can be made here.

I am unaware of any other sandwich place in town that puts as much effort into finding such incredibly fresh ingredients. 

This is a place that demonstrates the Alice Waters mentality, that a dish is only as good as the ingredients.  And here it is amazing.
