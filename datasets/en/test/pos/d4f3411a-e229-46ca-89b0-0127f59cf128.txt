For pure delight, I have to give this place 5 stars. 

YOU MUST TRY: Very Berry Turkey Sandwich, Thai Braised Beef Tacos, Apricot BBQ Chicken Skewers, and the Red Sangria! 

I also highly recommend the Sunday Brunch Drink Specials; the mimosas and bloody Mary drinks are $3. They fill one glass up and bring you the rest of your drink in a carafe. They're strong and after just one you'll be pretty happy :D 

Other items worth noting: Margarita Sunrise, Blueberry Cosmo, Drunk Italian Soda
