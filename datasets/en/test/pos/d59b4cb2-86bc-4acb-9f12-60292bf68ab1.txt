I have to register for an account so I can show some support for MAXIM (the Chinese name of this restaurant translates into "Beautiful Heart")
As a visitor from San Francisco CA, Maxim is definitely a good find. 
I had: Thai Iced Tea, Shrimp Rolls and the mushroom duck leg egg noodle soup, and they are YUMMY!!!! Five star taste and not pricey at all, and I am definitely a very satisfied first time customer.
Speaking of the decor of the restaurant.. it is just very typical asian neighborhood moms and pops type of place, a few flies flew across my face AND boy those pink shiny chopsticks are tacky!!! But as soon as the food came, the taste just made me forget about everything.
Absolutely two thumbs up!
