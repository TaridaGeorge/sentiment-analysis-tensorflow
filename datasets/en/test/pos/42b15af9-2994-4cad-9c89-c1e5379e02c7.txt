This business has new owners, but service is still excellent. . I usually get my new ink on Ebay, but needed replacement right away. I like to support small businesses, so I  get them replaced at Cartridge World.  My savings on a cartridge for a Dell printer was about 30% over what the cartridge sells for in Staples. . Also I did not have to wait for them to be filled because they had them in stock.
