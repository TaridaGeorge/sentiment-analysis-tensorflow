I came down since I heard about them being voted best sports bar downtown. I got a great pasta for $10. Very impressed! Cajun Jambalaya was amazing! My buddy had a BBQ chicken pizza which I was worried about (BBQ on a Pizza?) but was really good.

It was really busy but food came out quick. We'll be back for a Suns game
