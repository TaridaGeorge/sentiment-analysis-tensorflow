This is one of our favorite places. First, Everything on the menu is to die for. I get my usual, chicken gumbo with a side of brocolli, we have recently been getting our son the catfish sticks, I am not a catfish person, but wow! I help him eat them, if he lets me. ;) I could go on and on about the other fantastic favorites, 
We get treated so special there which is really nice. It feels like home. And our sons favorite thing is Dino, the music man. He isn't always there, but you can catch him at lunch or in the evenings starting around 6. That's a nice deal considering most place don't start music till 8, that's our kids bedtime.
I highly recommend this place to anyone!!
