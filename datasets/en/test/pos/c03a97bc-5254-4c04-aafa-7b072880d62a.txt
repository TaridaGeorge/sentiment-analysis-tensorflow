This is one of the best vet establishments we have ever used. 

Our 10 mo old Chuggle was sick, not eating, vomiting, and severely dehydrated. Dr Zinn took time with us to review symptoms and diagnose when parvo and fecal samples were negative. We had to return almost daily for a week to give her fluids and run more tests. While this is costly anywhere you go, I felt Dr Zinn worked hard to prioritize treatments and even gave us  a couple of breaks. I felt that he really cared about our dog, took extra time with us, and talked and answered our questions until we felt we were making informed decisions. Our pup is finally starting to feel better. We still don't know what was/is wrong with her, but we are confident we will do what's best with Dr Zinn's help.
