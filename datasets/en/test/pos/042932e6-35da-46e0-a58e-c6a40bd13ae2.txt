Came here with the fam here for the first time from my bro's recommendation.  It was great.  The Ahi Tuna Sandwich was super delicious.  My bro had the Fontina Burger and said that was great too.  I order the BBQ pulled pork and that was OK...probably can get the same at any BBQ joint (probably won't order that again...nothing special). The regular fries were just regular...if you come might as well upgrade to garlic or sweet potato fries.  We also got the salmon salad and that was good.  Set up was nice, always a line, but moves quicker than I thought.  There's seating inside and outside...luckily it was cloudy today so it wasn't too bad.  Probably would only come here in the evening or not come during the summer.  Service was great and nice.  Will come again for sure!!!
