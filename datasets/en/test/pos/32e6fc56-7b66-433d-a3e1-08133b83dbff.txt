Had an outstanding meal here with the elk steak.  The meat was cooked to perfection.  The beet salad is out of this world ( my gf, who split the salad with me and doesn't like beets, loved it).  Everything here was top notch from the bread on the table to the mixed drinks.  This a world class steak/seafood restaurant.
