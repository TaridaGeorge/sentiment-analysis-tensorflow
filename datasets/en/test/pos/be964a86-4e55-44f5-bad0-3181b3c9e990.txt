Market Bistro is one of my favorite places! Not just in Phoenix, but anywhere. I had to move to CA but whenever I come back to Phoenix I make a point to come to Market Bistro (usually it's the first thing I do!). Their turkey BLT is my favorite thing on the menu, it is absolutely delicious. The paprika mayonnaise is what does it for me! 
The restaurant itself is nice, good atmosphere and the service has always been good.
I love this place for the turkey BLT alone and I miss it a lot!
