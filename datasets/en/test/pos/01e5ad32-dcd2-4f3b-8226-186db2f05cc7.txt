Well, being from Buffalo, NY where they have hands down the best pizza, wings, and chicken fingers on the planet, which is prob why Western NY is also the highest cardiac and heart related issues in the nation...I'd have to say my expectations were so so for any pizza out here. However, I was proven wrong. Streets of NY in Scottsdale is around the corner from us and they def have amazing pizza and killer good chicken parm sandwiches! Pizza is more like NYC vs BUF. Either way very good food and I've ordered many times since.
