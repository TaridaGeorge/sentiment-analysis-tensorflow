Definitely the new "spot" for my friends and I. 

This place is so cool. The flavors here totally blow away anything that Mojo could ever offer. PLUS - it isn't even as expensive. So, better flavors, cheap frozen delicacies, what's not to love? Furthermore, I throughly enjoy that they're open until 11 PM. That means that at 10 I can call up my gurls and mosey on down to YB to stuff my face with the low calorie dessert that keeps me coming back for more. 

PS - I like the employees here. They're nice and complimented my credit card for having a cool design. :)

Love love love this place.
