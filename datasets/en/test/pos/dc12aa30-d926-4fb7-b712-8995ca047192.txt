Because someone yelled at me for doling out stars like candy, I now feel guilty when I give out five stars for a restaurant I've only visited once.  Do they deserve the fifth star?  Was it an aberration? Will I look douchey to someone else who, based on more visits, has deemed this place mediocre?

But if you had the grilled spek sandwich (proscuitto, tomatoes, cheese) that I just had on the sublimely amazing bread they have at cibo, you would indeed feel it obligatory to give them all five stars.  The fruit that is served w/ the meal was whatever but I don't care, because it has been a long time since I had a sandwich that good.
