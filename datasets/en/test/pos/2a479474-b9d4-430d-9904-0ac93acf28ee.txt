Amanda did an INCREDIBLE job with our wedding flowers. She has a beautiful and creative touch and created everything we asked for and more. We can't say enough good things about Butterfly Petals.

Wedding flowers can get insanely expensive but we were able to stay within our budget and keep things reasonable. We even had a custom wish tree made to use in place of a guest book.
