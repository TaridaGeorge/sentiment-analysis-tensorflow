If I wanted to feed my dogs the stuff they sell at Petsmart or Petco then I might as well get them a cheeseburger from McDonalds.  I look at the first few items in the ingredients on the list on the bag - mostly fillers & byproducts.  Gross!  What the hell is poulrty by-product & preseved animal fat? If I won't eat it, then I ain't feeding it to my dogs.

I'll stick with wellness.  Its human grade, the dogs don't have to eat as much which means less poop in the yard.  It is also cheaper at Pet Food Depot than any place else.    

BONUS:  They have a shot clinic every Saturday which is great.
