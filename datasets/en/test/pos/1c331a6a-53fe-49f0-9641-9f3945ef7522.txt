Hands down the best specialty toy shop in the Phoenix area! 

I have been a loyal customer of Toy Anxiety since they were Empire of Toys on 12th street. Each time I walk in, I'm instantly transported back to my childhood and amazed at the variety and selection of new/vintage action figures,prop replicas and many other items I could only dream of as a kid. 

The staff is friendly and knowledgeable of the products available in the shop and I have often been stuck in many nerd conversations while visiting. 

If you're a serious or beginning collector, want some toys for your kids (the dollar bins are always ravaged by happy kids), or just want a blast from the past, Toy Anxiety is a place you want to check out if you haven't already.
