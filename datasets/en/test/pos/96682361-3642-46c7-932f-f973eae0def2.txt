The Mill Avenue District Community Arts Project (MADCAP) has taken over a once empty building and created an arts and music venue that is affordable and in one of the best locations in the Valley!  Local favorites, Captain Squeegee, The Dorsets, Dry River Yacht Club, and more have been performing there and have raved about the venue!  Recently, the Midnite Movie Mamacita was brought in to program films like The Room, Rocky Horror Picture Show, International Sci-Fi & Horror Film Festival, and so much more!  This is a great addition to Downtown Tempe and perfect for the Mill Avenue area to expand on it's urban and eclectic roots in the music and arts industry!
