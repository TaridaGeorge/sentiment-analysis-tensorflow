Without a doubt one of the top Espresso stops in all of Phoenix. Tucked away off the main drag, Cartel serves some serious brew and my espresso shots are always like beautiful works of multi-crema art.

The atmosphere is also mellow and open, and a bit less pretentious compared with my other fave LUX on Central.

Take a bag of beans home - The owners tour the world to hand select their beans and then roast them in-house, and the delicious result can be tasted in every sip.
