This was by far the best find for a long time. We went today Sunday at about 10:30 had a 5 minute wait. Really good for a Sunday. We ordered and got our food in a good timely manner. The food was excellent and the portions sizes also very good sized. I would recommend this location to anyone. We each ordered something different and all was good. Drinks a little expensive but still for a first time going there I was really impressed.
