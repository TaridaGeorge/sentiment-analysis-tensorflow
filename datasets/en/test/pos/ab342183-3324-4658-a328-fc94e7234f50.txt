Where have you been all my life?!  Will you please open a place in Phoenix metro area!?  Better yet, a Pasty stand outside in downtown Phoenix would be awesome!

Yelpers, this place is delicious, has A+ service, all in a wonderful, chilled atmosphere.   They have a pasty for any taste!  Dessert was off the charts!  Go try it.
