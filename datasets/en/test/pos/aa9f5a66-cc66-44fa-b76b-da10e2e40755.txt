This review is for a reservation block for a wedding in November. Our contact person, Katharine, was awesome. I went in for a tour, and the front desk was very friendly.  Rooms have recently been renovated, and it was close to our wedding venue.  Katharine did a fabulous job responding to all emails promptly and courteously. I can not recommend her enough! There's also free hot breakfast sandwiches, free parking, and free wifi. :)
