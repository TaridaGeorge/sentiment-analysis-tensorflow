Thank you 5th and Wine, you are always there to satisfy my every craving! And yesterday I had a yearning, yearning, yearning for a delish Grilled Chicken Sandwich unlike no other.  This is one special sandwich, hearty enough to satisfy, but healthy enough to walk away from the table feeling good about yourself (especially if you skip the fries and do the side salad).  I digress, what makes it so special you ask? How about caramelized onions, grilled chicken and roasted red peppers covered with provolone and nestled on a bed of arugula and radiccio on a toasted Brioche bun.
