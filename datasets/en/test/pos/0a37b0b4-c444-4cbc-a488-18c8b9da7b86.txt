Quite possibly the most exquisite gastronomical delight you will ever partake in.   My wife and I went here for our anniversary, and it was our best.  

I highly recommend you call ahead and be very clear if you are planning on dining to celebrate a special occassion (particularly one that has to do with romance).  I did, and I'm glad of it.

This place is the cat's meow.  

I highly recommend the duck.

The staff actually took it upon themselves to wish us a happy anniversary (and actually wrote it on our dessert plates!), and even took (and gave us) a souvenir picture to remember the evening.  

Ambience and service is amazing.
