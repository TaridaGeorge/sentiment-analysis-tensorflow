Nobody likes going to the auto body shop..period! 

These guys took a negative situation and absolutely turned it around. They immediately made me feel at home from the moment I approached the front desk; all the way up to the ownership of the shop. It was a professional experience with a family friendly approach. The work they completed on the rear bumper of my car was excellent. I HIGHLY recommend Impact AB for your AB repair needs.

Tom Butka was a pleasure to work with. Thanks Impact AB for everything!
