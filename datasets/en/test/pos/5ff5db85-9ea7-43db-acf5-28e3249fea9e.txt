I donate here all of the time, but this time I actually dropped off something I was not supposed to drop off. Yikes! A week has passed, but I thought I'd give it a shot and see if I could get it back. Josh, one of the guys in the unloading dept., was very helpful. He even talked to the manager for me. Thank you so much Josh!
