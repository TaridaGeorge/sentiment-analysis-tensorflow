Bought the Groupon for Malee's a few months ago and had my first ever Thai food experience! This place seriously blew my mind, I could not stop talking about it for days. Specifically the Thai Toast and CRISPY BASIL CHICKEN. Thinking about it right now is actually making me hungry. I hate myself for not trying Thai food earlier. I'm not sure how close to traditional Thai fare my meal was, but as far as I'm concerned it was an excellent intro.
