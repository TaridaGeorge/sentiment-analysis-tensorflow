These guys are very friendly and trustworthy.  I've been going here since I was a teenage girl with my first car.  They don't talk down to me, they don't try to rip me off, and if I need something stupid and quick like a head lamp changed, they will do it for free and send me on my way.  I'd never consider going anywhere else.
