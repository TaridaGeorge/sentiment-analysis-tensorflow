As long as I've lived in or around Tempe, I can't believe it has taken me until today to try this place out! They are definitely my new favorite spot for breakfast, and I can't wait to have lunch there sometime. The food is all local, which is really important to me, and doesn't receive enough attention. It is a big deal to invest in our community, and this place does it. They also recycle and compost!!! Awesome! The food was delicious and unique in flavor. My only complaint would be that their coffee wasn't exactly up to par. Although, I am a bit of a snob when it comes to coffee. And do note that this place is wildly popular, so if you go on a weekend morning, be prepared to wait a little. Sit outside and enjoy yourself on their cute little patio!
