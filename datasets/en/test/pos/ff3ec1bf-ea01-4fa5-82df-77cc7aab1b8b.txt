I have been taking my dry-cleaning to Paris for years - but today they went above and beyond my expectations.  I showed up just after 5pm with a formal gown that desperately needed to be steamed for an event tomorrow night.  At first the woman at the counter told me they couldn't do it, but then another staffer recognized me and told me she would check.  Sure enough, she found the manager and got permission to get it steamed - while I waited.  I am so thankful and will never take my dry-cleaning or laundry anywhere else!  Thank you Paris!
