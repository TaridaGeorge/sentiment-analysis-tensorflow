During our trip to Scottsdale we decided to stop at Tapino's after reading about it here on Yelp.  It was a great decision to make.  From the moment we pulled up to the front of the restaurant we were impressed with its patio seating area.  Once inside the staff was welcoming and professional.  Happy Hour has to be one of the better ones I have been to over the years, the $5 Tapas, Martinis, and Wine cannot be beat.  As for the food, it was flavorful and there was enough to satisfy my hunger.  When in the Scottsdale area I will always make it a point to stop at Tapino Wine Bar.
