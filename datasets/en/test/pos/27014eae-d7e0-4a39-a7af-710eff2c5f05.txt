Pros: Great Donuts and hot chocolate, Great Service,  Friendly most of the time, Open early, Convenient location, great prices, cleanliness - for the most part, OK Customer service.

Cons: in the past I have seen flies - buzzing around the donuts, and they close to early in the day, when I'm out in the afternoon or late at night i am forced to take my business elsewhere - usually a convenient store with suckish donuts.

when I start achin' for a donut, this establishment is usually my first choice.
