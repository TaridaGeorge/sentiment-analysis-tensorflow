We saw the Artist here the other day...what a great location to watch it! I love how this theater is totally taken out of my childhood memory.....no stadium like seating, but still a good view from every seat. They keep this place super clean and they have yummy snacks like cinnamon and sugar roasted nuts, so good! (awesome for us who don't do the butter popcorn thing). The staff are super friendly, overall it was a great expierence! Look forward to coming here again!
