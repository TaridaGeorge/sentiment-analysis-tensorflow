We had the dinner for two plus side of naan.  Soups were very tasty and good portions (not the teeny cup of soup you usually get in restaurants).  The curries were very good, service good, a very pleasant experience.    I disagree somewhat with the reviewer who says place wasn't good for kids, yes it is fine dining but we went pretty much when the doors opened for dinner, few other diners at that time and we snagged a corner table relatively out of the way where we could keep our infant in her stroller.  Overall great experience, will definitely return.
