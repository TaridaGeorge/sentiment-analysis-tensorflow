Simply amazing. Thanks to chef Al for great conversation, food and suggestions. We felt right at home from the beginning here. The atmosphere is sheik and intimate. 
The tempura was perfectly crisp and light, the fish all incredibly fresh (shrimp was killed/prepared right in front of us fresh), rolls were truly an explosion of flavor in every bite and the dessert (Japanese crepes) were heavenly. 
We can't wait until next time!
