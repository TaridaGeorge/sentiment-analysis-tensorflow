There is Italian American food all over the valley but this real Italian, as if you had just stepped off the plane. It's not enough that they make a rotini with ricotta dish. They make the ricotta too! The sausage and pepper panini is again with sausage and bread made right at the store. As someone with parents from Italy, I am very fussy when it comes to Italian food. This place exceeds my expectations time and time again. Sure its few bucks more than eating at most places but its worth every penny.
