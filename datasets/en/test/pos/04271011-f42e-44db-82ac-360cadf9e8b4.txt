Holy bear scat Smokey, what an incredible place THIS is!!!  Someone told me this outfit might have the humble item I was out to purchase today, so I drove over here, totally unprepared for what I would find.

First of all, the building is the size of a small town.  Then you enter, & it really is as if you were dreaming it...  just way beyond any store I have ever been in before, EVER, ANYWHERE, CARRYING ANYTHING!  We're talking a sports enthusiast's total Disneyland here!!

Beyond this place being breathtaking inside, they DID have the rather hard to find item I was after, & at a low, below "list" price.  On top of all this, the staff was super friendly, too!  Can you imagine?

A big "Woohoo" for Bass Pro Shops, Mesa!!     :-))
