Other vegetarians seem to appreciate it when I highlight particularly good meat-free options on meat-laden menus.  At Athenian Express, I order the vegetarian pita without green peppers (clearly a personal preference there) and with extra hummus (on the sandwich, not on the side -- sometimes there is confusion on that point).  The extra hummus is key, because even with extra there still isn't much, and if you're a protein-counter, every little bit helps.  It's extra messy and extra good!
