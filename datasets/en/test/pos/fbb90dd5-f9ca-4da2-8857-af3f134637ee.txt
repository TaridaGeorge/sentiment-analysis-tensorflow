Love this place!!! On Monday and Tuesday nights after 8 p.m. they have bruschetta and any bottle of wine for $20.  Expect to wait though it gets crowded.  The bruschetta is great, some many flavor combinations (I would never have thought to put them together).  A relaxing atmosphere with outdoor seating.  Parking can be a pain but they do have valet.
