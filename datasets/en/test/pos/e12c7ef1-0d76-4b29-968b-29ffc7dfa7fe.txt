The "Jade,' is a place my buddies and I  often meet for lunch and a place where I take my family for dinner.  It is an oasis in the valley with a friendly  and attentive staff. This is a family endeavor and they welcome you by name and always provide an excellent and  consistant product.  I recommend the sizzling rice soup, lettuce wraps, Kung Pao Chicken or Chicken Fruit Salad.  The experience will keep you coming back.  Eat well!
