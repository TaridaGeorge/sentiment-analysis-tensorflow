FANTASTIC! The sommelier Chris is so wonderful! The service was impeccable! The food...fantastic! We had the the tomato watermelon salad, the duck confit, the flat iron steak, and the BBQ short ribs...all outstanding! You can't go wrong with this place! Make sure you get to the bar before hand and get the fire martini with the jalape√±o!
