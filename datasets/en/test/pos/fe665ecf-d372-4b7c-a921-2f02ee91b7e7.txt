F&E rocks! It's right-sized. Once you get a feel for it, you will begin to wonder why other grocery stores are so huge, when you can find 98% of what you need at this cute little market. Their pre-made lunches are typically the main part of my weekday diet, as is their oatmeal and containers of pineapple. 

My other favorite things include their flowers, which last so much longer then flowers you pick up at other grocery florists, and the chocolate covered almonds. Do not try them unless you are fully prepared to be addicted.

The staff is super friendly without being completely in your face. I appreciate that they aren't scarce like in big box stores.

Love you F&E. Love you!
