I've been to Hula's on three occassions for brunch, and I have to say they have never fail to impress me.  The drinks are delish (especially the one in the tiki-head cup.  Only wish I could remember the name!), and the eggs benedict was my favorite.

The last time I went, a friend and I sat for two hours catching up.  After we finished our breakfast and two drinks, our waitress kept our water glasses full and continued to check-in on us.  I appreciated that.  I didn't feel rushed despite the fact that I wasn't eating/drinking anything any longer.

Will definitely be back. :)
