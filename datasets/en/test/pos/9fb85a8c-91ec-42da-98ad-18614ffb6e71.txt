I have been coming here for 20 years and I have never had a bad meal. This place is incredible. The prices have hardly changed in all these years. The food is super fresh and very authentic. They also have a grocery store located in the same building with everything you could want and imagine from middle eastern food, beverages and spices. They're big gyros sandwiches are around 3 dollars.
