Stumbled across this place earlier this week--I can't believe I had never heard of it before!  Reminds me of a Kirkland's and Bed Bath & Beyond all rolled into one--With much better prices!  I think I spent over an hour in there and picked up picture frames, bedding, fun stuff for the yard and also found some artwork and chairs that I want the husband to go back and "approve" (ok--pick up, load into the car and carry into the house).  

The only down-side is that there were some items that I couldn't find price tags for--Not a huge deal because this happens everywhere, but there were not too many employees in the store, and check-out is all the way in the front and kind of around a corner?  Makes it hard to do a price-check, but overall, a great place that I will definitely be heading back to!!
