When I came to Phoenix from NJ,  one of the things that shocked me the most was the complete lack of South American and Caribbean cuisine.
Until now! 
I'm Colombian, so when I looked over the menu and found such familiar foods as patacones and bandeja paisa, Colombianas, and batidas de guanabana, I felt like I was home.
Dont expect fast service. There is one waiter. It really is a mom & pop run establishment. no small talk while we were there..he took our order and off he went.
The prices were reasonable and they had a lot of fun soda-inca cola and Colombiana which are pretty hard to find here.
Patacones (fried plantain) were deeeeelisssshhh! Just like you can find at any latin restaurant back east.
All in all fantastic food, great menu items, and no nonsense service.
Tasty, and we'll be back!
