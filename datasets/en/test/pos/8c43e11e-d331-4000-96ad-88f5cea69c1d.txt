Sam Fox hits the mark again! I had dinner with some friends and we were all impressed. Presentation was well executed and flavor was just as excellent. I had the Parmesan risotto as my entree. I liked the roasted cloves of garlic that gave bursts of flavor. The shrimp was cooked just right, not rubbery. Drinks were not watered down, and were very well priced for dining in and around Old Town and the Waterfront. The atmosphere/decor is spot on as well and the staff was very attentive. Can't wait to go back!
