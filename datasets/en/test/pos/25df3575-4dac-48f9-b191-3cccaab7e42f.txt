This is a BEAUTIFUL hotel!!! I love my hotel room since I had a view of the golf course. In addition, the beds are awesome!!! They are so comfy!! I wanted to take the bed home with me. 

The pool area is nice. I went down the slide several times, and the lazy pool is relaxing. 

I had a conference at this hotel, and the food was decent. We were catered food for lunch and dinner during my stay. 

The hotel is expensive, but the environment is WORTH the price!
