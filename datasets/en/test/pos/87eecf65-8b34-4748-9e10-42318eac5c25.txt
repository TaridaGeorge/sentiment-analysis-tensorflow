Fantastic!!!!!! Ia couple of weeks ago I ran into their name again and realized that they were at the Ahwatukee Farmers market (Sunday's).  I  had seen them in central Phoenix but did not try them that day.   I tried Short Leash dogs that Day (fantastic also). 

So... I gambled and told my wife and son that I had a surprise for them. Took them the the farmers market. Grabbed a great cup of coffee at the market an then walked around the corner and found trucking!   AWESOME was the words out of the three of us.   Today is Saturday and also planning on getting up early to great another crepe tomorrow!  

Local entrepenuers, great food... You must support!  You will not regret it!
