There is honestly not a single, solitary thing I can think of that I dislike about Palatte so Instead I will list what I adore:

I love the story of the building and the Cavness House itself.
I love the passion & vision of the owners.
I love that it can let you feel carefree and a little self-indulgent for a couple hours.
I love the outdoor seating and the billowy curtains.
I really love the bathrooms--a lot.
I love that they have switched to waiter service.
I love the big picnic table for groups or stragglers. 
I crave the sweet potato pancakes & I would bathe in the banana porridge.

I have pretty much had it all.. and like I said... wonderful, delicious & blissful every bite.
