I give this place a 5-star review because of the Jokester Room. Every Thursday night they have a free bues concert by Hans Olson, who is an amazing musician. He can play any song you can throw out at him. I really wanted to hear Me and Bobby McGee, and he did a beautiful job. 

The beer is cheap, good specials, and the pineapple bacon pizza looked very tasty. I'd recommend checking this place out if you're in the area. If I lived in Phoenix, I'd be a regular.
