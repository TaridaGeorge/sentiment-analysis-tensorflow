This is by far my favorite restaurant! It is trendy and fun and simply has the best tasting food.  The menu offers great choices at all price ranges. Whether you order an entree, kisra, or sandwich...it is sure to be delicious!  The hummus is THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD!  The restaurant also offers great specials and drinks.  This is a must in the city of Phoenix!
