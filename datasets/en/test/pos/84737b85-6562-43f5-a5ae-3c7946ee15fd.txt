Excellent!!!! The cleanest place I have ever been in. the owner cleans about every five minutes. You feel so good being at Elite Nails. It is spotless and everybody is so friendly. I love it there!!!! I go there for manicures and pedicures a couple of times a month. AND they have the BEST pedicures with Hot Stone Massages!!!!
