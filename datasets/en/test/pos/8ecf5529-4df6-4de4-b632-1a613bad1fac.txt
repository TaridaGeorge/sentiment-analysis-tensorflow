The employees at this location are AWESOME!

My husband and I have been going here for several years now and there are several employees that have been there as long. They know us by face and preference and always have an upbeat attitude. I have never enjoyed going to a grocery store before going to this one! They always put a smile on my face, even after a long day at work. We will be moving soon, and I am sad that this store will not be nearby anymore! I will have to stop by every once in a while to say hi to Sandy, Russel and Chris!

The produce is always fresh and maintained, and the store is neat and tidy. Great wine prices!
