Finally ate here for the first time! Loved it. Great service, cool vibe. They change up the music which is nice for a sushi bar. Sometimes the quiet typical sushi music makes me sleepy.
Our waiter talked us into the special and boy am I glad we accepted! 
Rise N Turf!!!! Seriously melted in my mouth, the best piece of sushi I have ever tasted. Yumm and Yum. We will be back here. Don't pass this place up, if you love sushi, you'll love Moira.
