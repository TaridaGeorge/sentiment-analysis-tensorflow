Great classes offered along with plants you can purchase for your garden or trees for your orchard. Greg offers classes about gardening in the urban environment, I have been on tours of his urban garden home on 13st and Glendale and he has been going green WAY before it was popular.  This location is next to the Tree Line Design nursery & landscape company and since he only deals with edibles there is no apparent conflict.  They are only open on the weekends right now and I purchased (7) 5 gallon grape vines to cover our ugly garden wall that keeps the animals away.  Greg also told me that they are putting in a coffee shop and restaurant in that same little area, WOW!  This will be a cool little area to hang out in soon....cant wait.
