This specific Pei Wei is the best in 3 states I've been to. Ordered spicy salad w/shrimp to go. They have a gluten free menu (who knew!) and the salad and shrimp were perfect. Unlike Paradise (3 doors down) who gives 3 peices of lettuce and a tomato, PW does it right - large salad, right amt. of shrimp. 

Plus, since I can't have soy sauce, one of the girls actually caught my mistake last time - spring rolls are made with a SS mixture. Saved me a trip to ER! 

Thanks to the ladies at the counter - you are fast, effecient, and knowledgeable about what you serve, really don't find that much anymore. Kudos to your staff and food Ocotillo Pei Wei - best salad and staff by far!
