A great LOCAL-OWNED coffee bistro in the northeast valley. 

Conveniently located near the northwest corner of 32nd Street and Shea Boulevard, 32 Shea has indoor and outdoor seating, a drive-thru window and a wonderful breakfast and sandwich menu. 

The owner/operators are engaging and friendly and the barrista is a true coffee artist!  

Definitely worth a visit.
