I've only taken my dogs here to wash once (plus once at the Colorado location) but it was great.  They are super user-friendly, i love the different options for packages, and though my dogs HATE taking baths, this at least provides the space for it to get DONE :)

We more frequently visit the store for the merchandise side of things.  They have a totally adorable and reasonably priced doggy bakery (both my pups get treats on their birthday), and a great selection of toys.

My only gripe is that while they are very healthy/green/eco friendly, they don't have more for things to keep your pups healthy (other than some treats for joint-health).

Overall, though, this place is great.  Love it.
