Phenomenal! If you ever went to that's Italiano (location's prior restaurant) you'll be amazed by the difference. I had the bass which changes daily but mine was inventive and flavorful. 

Start with a beet pur√©e, add braised bok choy, roasted cauliflower and baked garbanzos. Other dishes at the table- short ribs, burger, and beef bourguignon shepherd's pie. Everyone was stoked!

Handcrafted cocktails, hearty farm-to-table dishes. Go! If you don't have plans after go for the fig pecan pie and let me know how it is.
