I really like this McDonald's location. All of the workers, whether it be early morning, late night are really nice. Heck, I'll admit it, I've been through this drive thru a few too many times and most of the workers recognize my face and we'll get chatting (if there are no cars behind me). 

Why review a McDonald's you ask? Plain and simple, the workers here are phenomenal and shoot, I know I'm a pain when I ask for a 'fresh batch of fries' each time I visit. The fact that they  take the effort to throw some fresh tatters in the frier for me is extra nice!
