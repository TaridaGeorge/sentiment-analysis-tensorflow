Everyone here is very helpful and friendly.  No matter who I come in contact with I can tell they love animals and care about me and my pet.  The vet calls me himself to discuss my cat's test results.  They also made sure to give me a lot of information regarding the medications they are putting her on.  I feel that my family gets good care from this vet.  We ended up moving about 15 minutes away, but still make the trip to see this vet.
