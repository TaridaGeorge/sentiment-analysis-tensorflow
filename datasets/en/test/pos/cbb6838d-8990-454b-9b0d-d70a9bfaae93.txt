Great happy hour specials offered in the bar and out on the patio.  Finding a table on the patio can be dicey and it's first come, first serve out there.  The fish tacos were delicious (two for $10), the green chile pork burrito was mouth watering.  Perhaps their signature item on the happy hour menu is the Big A$$ Burger for $9.  And boy is it big and tasty!  My wife and I found the Roaring Fork on Yelp and enjoyed it so much that we went back for a second night in a row.
