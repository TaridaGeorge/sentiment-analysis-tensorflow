This place is amazing, I love Hawaiian food. Everything is authenitc, fresh, and very tasty. The portions are good and always filled me up, and don't let my size fool you. I will bet money that I can eat more than you.
You order at the counter and then they will bring it to your table, or you get it to go. Next to the counter is a little case of exotic beverages, unfortunately I have never tried any of them.

My favorite things to get there were the teriyaki chicken with rice which is beyond delicious, and the manapua (I think that's how you spell it). The manapua is this strange, sweet-ish roll filled with pork and it is possibly one of the most amazing foods I have ever tried, and that's saying something!
