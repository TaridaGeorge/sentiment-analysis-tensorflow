When I had mentioned to my girlfriend I had never been to Postino's she said, REALLY???  Well then you are in for a treat.  She wasn't kidding!  Who said a wine bar won't get crowded in late June during 109 degree temperature???  And this was at their new location on Central (just north of Camelback). The four of us shared the Bruschetta SELECTION OF 4, so we all got to pick and share...  We enjoyed the Brie & Apple w/Fig Spread, Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil, Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios, and Warm Artichoke Spread.  Their portions are very generous and each bruschetta is cut in 4 so you don't have to struggle with it yourself.  Anyone who knows me well, knows I ALWAYS slice my sandwiches in 4...easier to eat :-)  Wine by the glass 11am-5pm 7 days a week...yay!!!
