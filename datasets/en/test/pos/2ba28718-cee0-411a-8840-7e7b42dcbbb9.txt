I so far have been to the Phoenix Market off 721 N. central That market has a lot to choose from.But this time i went to check out the central famers market off 7901 N.Central.I very much enjoyed this market it seems to not be as hectic.That have an excellent selection of vegetables.That are in side and out side fresh eggs baked goods and food trucks.For myself it is a lot easer to go this that location.Note i am driving from Peoria.
