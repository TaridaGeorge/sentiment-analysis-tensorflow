Since my life revolves around food - this is one of few places that serves shoestring fries, as far as I know, so I'll continue coming here until hell freezes over.  

I've been here multiple times with massive groups of people.  Everytime, the staff has been extremely helpful and pleasant to be around, even when I'm sure it's a pain doing the check at the end.  Ambience is very relaxed in the outdoor patio/lounge.  Get some friends, some great drinks (awesome selection), and relax on the comfy furniture outside.  

Oh, sometimes there's also a cat (owner's?) that hangs about outside on the weekdays.. some people are bothered by it but I thought it was kind of funny that it just ignores everybody and does a full-body layout on one of the ottomans.
