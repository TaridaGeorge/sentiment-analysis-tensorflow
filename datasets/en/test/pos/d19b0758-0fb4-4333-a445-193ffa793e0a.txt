115 reviews! You have got to be kidding me? A small restaurant in a strip mall? Next to a cheap theater? Limited parking? 

Worth every minute you have to wait to be seated. Although the wonderful aromas while you are waiting might just be the last of your heart's desire.My tummy starts rumbling and I get hungry all over again just thinking about it. I doubt there is anything on this menu that isn't extraordinarily good. 

If you like authentic Thai food, this is the place. Go, but go early.
