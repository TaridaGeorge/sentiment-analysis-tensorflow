I was shopping for a new laptop, and decided to give the Microsoft store a visit. Ive been in there before, and thought it was nice. The staff is VERY up on their products, helpfull, and friendly. The computers come with only the software you want, and none of the trial, manufacture, or other bloatware that comes on computers from Best Buy, Walmart, etc. I bought a new laptop, and they set it up, and transfered all the stuff from my old one, and when I got home, it was ready to go! Ive been there 2 times since with questions, and they have been happy to answer all of them each time! Very friendly people! I cant see buying a Windows based PC anyplace else.
