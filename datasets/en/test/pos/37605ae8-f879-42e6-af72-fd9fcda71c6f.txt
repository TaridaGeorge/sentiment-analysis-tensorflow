Love this place.  Only ever eaten breakfast here, but the atmosphere is great -- the owners are very nice and the staff is efficient but caring.  The food is GREAT.  The breakfast items are REALLY fresh and makes me think they get them locally.  I saw a lot of "organic" on the menu, so I know the actual ingredients are very good.

Highly recommend this place!!
