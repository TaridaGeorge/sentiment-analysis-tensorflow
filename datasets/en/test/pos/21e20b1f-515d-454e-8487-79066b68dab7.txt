I love this place and maybe I am over hyping it but the mayo/mustard mixture they make is like crack to me.  I need it, I want it, I love it on my number nine!  I get the small peppered pastrami on wheat with no cheese with lettuce, tomato, onion, jalapenos and yes....my crack.  The sandwich was my go-to sandwich when I was losing weight because it only adds up to 360 calories and it filled me up for 3-4hours.  I have stuck to it ever since, so if you like fresh ingredients, tasty tasty ingredients then make your next stop any of the port a sub locations.  I love them all!
