I went to Andy's after I backed into a pole and popped the passenger side mirror out. Everything was hanging out so I taped it together. I took it to Maaco first and they looked at it and told me it had to be replaced for almost 200 bucks. I went to Andy's and Tim the manager was very thorough. He took the tape off and looked into everything. He was great and explained what had actually happened. Turns out, a lot of the pieces just popped back into place and they fixed it! Even fixed some paint I didn't ask them too for a very reasonable price. These guys are awesome, very highly recommended.
