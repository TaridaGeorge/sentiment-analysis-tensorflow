Stop in for lunch on a quiet Saturday.  Initially, we hesitated to do so b/c Yelp reviews for this place was slim.  We ordered the Greek salad, Tostada Pizza, and Penne with red sauce.  Greek Salad and thin crust pizza were both very good and flavorful.  We enjoyed the generous portion of mozzarella in the penne.  With flavorful food and generous portions, Sano was definitely a great find for us.  It was also a pleasant surprise to receive a 25% discount on our total bill.  With the on-going 25% discount, this is a great time to viva Sano a try.
