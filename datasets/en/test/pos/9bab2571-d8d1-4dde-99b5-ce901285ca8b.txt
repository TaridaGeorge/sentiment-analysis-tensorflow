I trully cant say anything bad just i wish this place were bigger in tempe! It does get pretty packed but so worth it. We come here for lunch very often because of the service which has been always great even though they are packed in but thats what makes it nostalgic. It reminds me of back east. I love it, major kudo's Spinato's!
