This is my favorite Mastro's. I've been going for 3 years now and I LOVE IT!

The service is great and so is the atmosphere but i'd eat in a cardboard box if i had to just to eat the food!

The drinks are amazing any which one you get, I usually go for something with Vodka

I love the filet its amazing. Steak sashimi is delish and a must. Spinach is delish anyway you get it. The Tuna tartare is also something I must have. 

BUT YOU HAVE TO SAVE ROOM FOR THE WARM BUTTER CAKE. I eat the center and the whipcream...SOOOO GOOD!
