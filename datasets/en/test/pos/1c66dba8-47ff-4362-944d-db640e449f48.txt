so i'm waiting to get my taxes done and it was either the noodle house or lo-lo's. since we constantly eat nothing fried, no salt, no fat, pretty much all veggie, i needed to splurge. stepped inside and MY insides started to growl!

had the cod plate with grits and a waffle. why does the sweet waffle go so well with the salty fish? for whatever reason, it does and i left stuffed and satiated. good think i have the hospital on speed dial because i needed an immediate coronary artery bypass graft afterwards!
