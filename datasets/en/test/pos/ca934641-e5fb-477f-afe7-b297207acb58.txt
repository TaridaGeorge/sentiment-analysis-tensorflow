I love Kaz!

It is sexy.  It is cool.  It is dimly lit.  It is perfect for conversation with friends or a lover.
It is a perfect date spot.  It is a perfect pick up spot.  It is everything you want it to be... and more.

The fondue is delicious.  The cheese plate is great.  The wine flights are fun.  They have a pretty good selection of champagne and wine.  

Did I mention it is sexy?

The only negative is you will probably need reservations MOST weekend nights in order to get a table right away.  Otherwise, expect a wait.
