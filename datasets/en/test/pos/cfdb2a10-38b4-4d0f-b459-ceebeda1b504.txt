I would never stay here due to the enormous number of children.  That aside, nearly every time we are in Scottsdale, we come one night for the bagpipes at sundown on the back patio.  Grab a drink at the bar (impeccable service!) and enjoy a romantic thirty minutes of bagpipe serenade and the most beautiful sunset in the U.S.  this occurs on the edge of the golf course.  Westin Kierland grounds and facilities are beautiful and immaculate.
