Let me tell you why Einstein inside the Hyatt is awesome.

During this years Phoenix Comicon we've been looking for places for breakfast and had no idea this was even inside the hotel.  We usually opted for Starbucks across the street.  

Einsteins really stepped up to the plate though.  During the day they usually closed at 2 or 3PM, but with comicon being in town they extended their hours til 8PM.  That's customer service for ya!

I complimented them for doing that and the staff couldn't have been more nice and excited to be a part of the event that weekend.

I give them 5 stars because their food is always awesome and their staff was just as great!
