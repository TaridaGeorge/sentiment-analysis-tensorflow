I love everything about this place! The water was very friendly, all the food was of high quality and amazing taste, and the restaurant itself is just awesome! Very trendy and chic. The interior decor is very nicely done and the outdoor terrace is absolutely gorgeous. I highly recommend any of their flatbreads, pastas, or salads. All are great. Same goes to desserts! This place is definitely worth checking out if you're in the Scottsdale area.
