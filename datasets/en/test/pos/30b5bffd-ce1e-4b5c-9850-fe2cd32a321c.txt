My Sister and I ordered take out, the grilled chicken and the BBQ pork Banh Mi, I also ordered a carrot smoothie and she ordered a Thai tea.  The sandwiches were soooooooooooooooooooooo good and the carrot smoothie was awesome.  Three sandwiches and two drinks under $17!! Great deal!!! I was full and happy under 500 calories for a few bucks!! Seems almost too good to be true :) If only it wasn't so far from my own house :(
