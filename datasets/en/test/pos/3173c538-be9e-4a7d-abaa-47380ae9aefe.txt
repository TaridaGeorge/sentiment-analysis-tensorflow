Visitors from out of state, my husband and I came across this little pizza place while walking downtown.  We were more than pleased.  The pizza was EXCELLENT! we ate an entire large pizza and were very satisfied but not overly full.  The staff was friendly and the place was very clean, including the bathrooms.  You can't go wrong eating here.
