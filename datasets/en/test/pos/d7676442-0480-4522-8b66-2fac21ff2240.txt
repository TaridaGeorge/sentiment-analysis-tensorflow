I love this place.  In fact, I was surprised that I had not Yelped about it before now, since this is probably the place I have frequented the most since moving here.  I have had both average service and terrific service, but the salads?  Awesome.  Sandwiches?  Awesome.  And I love the patio.  It is my "go to" bar/restaurant when I just do not want to risk a bad meal.
