This place is super cool.  

I found it "by accident"  while driving by at night.  Is was so bright inside that it caught my attention & I couldn't help but stop in & take a quick look around.  (FYI: it's located right next to Yucca Tap Room)

Stormy & the "young man" (Shayman, i think?:) were extremely genuinely friendly, warm & helpful too.

I most def. will return here to shop!  They have a great selection of cool jeans, shoes & purses at very affordable prices. Eclectic yet, dare I say... refined. ;-D

Can't wait to see this place become a TEMPE STAPLE in fashion, art, music & all things awesomely local! 

Forget Buffalo Exchange,  Brand Name has too much attitude (for no reason!!!haha!)...Shop here at Resale Rocket & have a chill, relaxed, yet fun time in the process!
