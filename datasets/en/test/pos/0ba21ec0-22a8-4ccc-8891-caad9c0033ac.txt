Wow. What a beautiful store. There really is no comparison when it comes to cigar shops in the Valley. Ambassador excels in just about every aspect. 

The best part of the experience is the personalized attention from Mr. Seferian, the stores owner. Mr. Seferian obviously cares deeply about his customers, and knows a great deal about cigars. Highly recommended.
