I'm not sure if I have ever had such a delicious frozen treat in my mouth. Everything I've tried has been a hit, but the banana with rum was utterly dreamy, bursting with sweet flavor and more creamy than I thought it could be. The interior is very simple but hey, go in the evening and take your dessert to the outdoor seats and people watch while you drift into a delicious diabetic coma... totally worth it. Bottom line, while somewhat pricey you can genuinely taste the quality of the ingredients, and I'm going to have a hard time ever walking around on Mill Avenue again without stopping in for a frozen snack. I'm addicted.
