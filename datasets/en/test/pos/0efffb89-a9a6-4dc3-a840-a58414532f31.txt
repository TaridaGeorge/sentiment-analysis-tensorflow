I took my mom out to the Olive Mill for a visit when she visited from Montana.  We really enjoyed our time.  We took the tour, had lunch and took some goodies home.  I'm pretty sure that I can't live without their garlic flavored olive oil from now on.  It is so fresh and yummy.  I'll definitely be going back or ordering online.  My visit felt reminiscent of my visits to wineries in Sonoma/Napa.  It was neat to have that feeling in Arizona.  I love supporting local businesses just like this one.
