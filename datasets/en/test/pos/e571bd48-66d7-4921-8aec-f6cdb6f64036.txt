The raves are true-Sprinkles rocks! The decadent butter cream frosting is ample and the customer service is great. The employees there are friendly and know how to be patient when you're not quite sure what you want. My personal fave is the Coconut cupcake but I also adore the Strawberry one. The Strawberry cupcake is particularly moist and fresh!
