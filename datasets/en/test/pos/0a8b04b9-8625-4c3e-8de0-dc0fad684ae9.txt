I have gone to this store for their.handbags...i have gotten a few from here...the women in the louis vuitton area were awesome and so friendly...i have come in and bought nothing and had just worked out and they were still so friendly...i have bought three items from louis vuitton area and they were so helpful and not over the top...the women in the fendi area were very nice too...i love the nice cards they send! I wish i could shop here all the time but i cannot afford it...one day...until then this place will be my special treat every now and then...
