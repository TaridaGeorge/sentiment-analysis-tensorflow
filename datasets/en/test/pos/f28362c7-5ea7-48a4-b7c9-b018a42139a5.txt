Let's keep this short and sweet. 
Bernadette is wonderful at fingers and toes! 
She is very reasonably priced. 
Appointment only- but she will work with you to get you in. 
She is fun to talk with and that makes the appointment a pleasure as well.

Really,  the best nails I've had done in a LONG time!
