Terrific frozen yogurt without High Fructose Corn Syrup! The employee was so helpful since this was my first visit. You pick a container size and then mix and match frozen yogurt from a dozen choices and then pick toppings from a couple of dozen choices. At only $.39/ounce, I got a mix of Irish Mint and Chocolate and my entire container was a little over $2.00. Mmmmm! 
The orange plastic chairs are a hoot. The place is very clean. I will be back.
