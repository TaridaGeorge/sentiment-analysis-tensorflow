Dr. Agarwal is amazing.  Simply amazing.  He listens to concerns, never appears to be rushed, and when he's with you, you have his full attention.  He's not one to meddle or nag outside, respects the wishes of the family, and is willing to recognize that everyone comes from different circumstances.  He's also incredibly thorough and willing to help you spot health risks.

They're ready in emergencies.  When my daughter had rotavirus, they were already set up for an outpatient IV, bypassing any need to go to a hospital.

The office staff is always wonderful and patient.  The decorations are fun and colorful, highlighted by a giant fake tree in the middle of the waiting room.  It's like walking into a wonderland.
