I brought my wife here for our anniversary and we came as a family for my birthday.  Both times it was an enjoyable evening with great views, great service, and great food.  I like to "wow" my family from out of town on what a great place the Phoenix/Scottsdale areas are.  This is one of the true bright spots.  I will be coming back again and hopefully for the bar/lounge scene.
