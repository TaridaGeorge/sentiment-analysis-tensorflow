Great food and great service!!!!  As I walked in their establishment, I was received with a smile and warm greeting.  Now THAT'S a PLUS!! Secondly, the place was relaxing and quiet. Coming from "LOUD" New York, this was a real treat that it was quiet!  The food presentation was beautiful, and the food was quite tasty with fresh herbs you can taste and smell! Mmmm!  NOT greasy or oily or everything but the kitchen sink in your dish.  I highly recommend this place! The decor and seating arrangements are quite comfortable as well. I also received 10% off on my first bill with Yelp.  Definitely will come back when I'm back in Phoenix!!
