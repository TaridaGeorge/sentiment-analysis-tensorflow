This place is AWESOME!  I could there everyday no problem.  It's super inexpensive and they bring you a huge bowl, enough to feed 2, but you'll find that you continually keep eating no matter how full you are because it's so good.  The ramen has so much flavor and it's delicious with all the fresh veggies.  AND they offer Boba tea which is another bonus.  Check this place out if you're looking for something tasty and cheap.
