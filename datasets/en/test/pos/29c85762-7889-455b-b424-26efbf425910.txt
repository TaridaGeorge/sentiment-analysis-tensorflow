I love this place ! Dirt cheap and delicious, their menu prices could easily double and I wouldn't blink an eye. I have tried them all and like them all. Try the fresh spring rolls. The kids will like the ice cream and the view of the baking in progress. The place is very clean and service is quick and efficient. Not your average sandwich shop.
