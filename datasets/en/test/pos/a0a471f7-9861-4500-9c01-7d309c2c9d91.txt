Why yes, I *did* go here because I saw it on Cupcake Wars. And I see why they won.

I purchase 4 cupcakes for $12.00 and boy were they worth it. I got a coconut and a german chocolate one for my husband, which he throughly enjoyed. Myself, I went for a lemon and an orange blossom. They were oh so tasty.

If youre in the area, stop by. Then email me to thank me. ;)
