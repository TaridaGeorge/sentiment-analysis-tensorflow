These guys were extremely friendly and professional. I needed to ship my laptop for repair and the gentleman there measured and remeasured to be sure he was using the smallest box (giving me the best price). After it was all ready to go I remembered my debit card was cancelled a few days ago due to fraud...I profusely apologized and said I'd come back later with cash. The man helping me said he would pack it up for me and take my husband's card payment over the phone so I didn't have to make another trip. So nice. I've also used the store on 7th St. and McDowell and a store in Tucson and had similar experiences of above and beyond service and friendly staff. Couple this with below average FedEx service on a few occasions I won't use anyone else for shipping services.
