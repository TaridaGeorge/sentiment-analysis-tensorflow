Tori is excellent at her work and highly skilled. As someone who used to pluck, then wax I am completely hooked with threading. Using retinol creams on the face make waxing too harsh on the skin.  With Tori and her threading method I have NO skin irritation after. There are no chemicals used on the skin.  My mom is hooked also and has not only her brows done but her full face.  She is thrilled and prefers threading to waxing.
