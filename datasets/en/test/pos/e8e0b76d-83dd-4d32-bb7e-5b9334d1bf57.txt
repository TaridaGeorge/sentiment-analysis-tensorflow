Exquisitely crafted meals that won't leave you disappointed, nor hungry afterwards!  I tried the squash blossom appetizer, which was cooked perfectly, had great flavor, with a nice crispy, crunchy breadcrumb batter.  The fish of the day was grouper, which was crusted with hazelnuts.  Again, cooked perfectly, with great crunch to the crust.  The meals themselves, while pricey, will definitely leave you full, and the presentation of the dishes is very nice.

The one thing that is weird (And not part of the Groupon agreement I thought) is that they will automatically add 18% tip to your bill if you are a Groupon user.
