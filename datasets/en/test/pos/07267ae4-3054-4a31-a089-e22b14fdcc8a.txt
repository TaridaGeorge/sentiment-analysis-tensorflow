after several bad grooming experiences in Scottsdale, my poodle is happy to have found a loving, competent at Hug n Pups. Cindy gave him a great cut exactly to my detailed instructions and loved on him like crazy. They use top tier grooming products so my baby is soft and yummy smelling. reasonable prices and cheerful service- it's a happy place to be.
