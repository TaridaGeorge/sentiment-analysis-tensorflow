We were planning on going to Dave's Electric Brewpub but it was packed out and I remembered this place. It was deserted. We started out with a decent peach ale (although it tasted more like apricot) and then we started ordering shots. We were looking up random shots online and the bartender knew all of them. We got blowjobs, oatmeal cookies, and a pineapple upside down cake. The oatmeal cookies were awesomely delicious and we wound up sitting on some really comfy couches. The only problem is the "side table" was actually a table top placed off center on a keg. $4 beers and $5 shots makes this my new Tempe bar.
