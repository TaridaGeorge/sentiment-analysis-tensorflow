I've been going to this location for two years, and other locations for ten years. I have price matched from both Sears and Costco for two different sets of tires, and they're happy to match. I always make appointments for tire rotations, and I'm usually in and out in 30 minutes. The employees are friendly, professional and fast.

It's best to go when it's not busiest; busy times are Fridays and Saturdays. I wish they had wifi, but that's not a reason to take a star away. Tip: if you can, just wait until they have a promotion because you can frequently get $50-$100 off a set of four tires.
