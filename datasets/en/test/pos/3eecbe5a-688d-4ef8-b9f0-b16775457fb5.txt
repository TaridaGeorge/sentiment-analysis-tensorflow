I saw Josh for a reading. And let me say he was excellent. I have never been to one of these places before but new life issues drew me in. 

After my tarot card reading (which I was satisfied with); we went into a medium session hoping to communicate with my father. He blew my mind away with so many spot on things. I really felt like I was talking with my dad. 

I totally recommend this shop. I will be going back for further readings. 

A great and insightful shop!
