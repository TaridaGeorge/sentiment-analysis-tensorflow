this place is fully stocked with Asian goodies.  Has a very nice produce section, although I'd prefer my Assi in good old Illinois.  But hey...this is one of the very few places to buy Asian groceries out in Arizona...

Nice selection of meats and canned items.  They have an asian condiment selection galore...every plum sauce, soy sauce and hosien you can think of in multipel brands!!!!

Also has a bakery and bubble tea counter
