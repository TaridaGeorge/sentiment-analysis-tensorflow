I've been here many many times and always have a great experience. The food is high quality and fresh. I always get a pressed sandwich of some sort. The pizza is great too. And we always have to get a bread pudding with fresh whipped cream. Delicious!

And you absolutely must get an espresso drink here. Joe Johnston (the owner) brought the espresso machine over from Italy and OMG the espresso is fantastic! The cortadito is my personal favorite.

I've always had great service here as well. My only gripe is how you have to wait in line cafeteria style to place your order. Expect to wait a really long time if you go during lunch rush.
