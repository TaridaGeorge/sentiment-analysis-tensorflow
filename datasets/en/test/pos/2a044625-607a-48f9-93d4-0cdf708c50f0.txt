British Airways flies from Phoenix Sky Harbor to London Heathrow every evening except on Wednesdays. Very convenient for we Phoenician's who love to travel to England.

We have never had a delay leaving Phoenix but on occasion are held up in London due to weather. If one travels coach expect it to be rather cramped and for a ten hour flight that can be a bit trying. The flight attendants without fail try to make your trip comfortable no matter what cabin you choose. When we are feeling cheap and do not want to fly business class we go for the World Traveler Plus. This is in between coach and business and it gives you just that bit more room for personal space. The food has been good each time we have flown. They give you enough of it too.
