No kids under 16 allowed (without parent) after 6 PM on Fridays and Saturdays.  I give 5 stars just for that.   

Other than that Desert Ridge is a cool outdoor mall.  There is a wide variety of places to eat, and a good chunk of departments stores to choose from.  So if you aren't finding what you are looking for, you just aren't looking hard enough!  There's also plenty of misters for those hot summer days...
