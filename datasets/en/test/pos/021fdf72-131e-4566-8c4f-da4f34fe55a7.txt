The 3 Redneck Tenors....yeah, I wrote you it and read it and yes, it does say, The 3 Redneck Tenors. The name says it all, 3 male opera singers, who treat opera in a ridiculously irreverent way!  An amazing production that was just $35 a ticket. I sat 6 rows from the stage and had the absolute time of my life. Take a minute, buy some tickets at Phoenix Theater for them in June, kick yourself for getting them at the Chandler Center and next time join me! This was an incredibly entertaining time! Thank you CCA!
