YA BABY!!
How have I missed this place?  It's just 2 miles from my shop and right next to my bank.
I stopped in for lunch buffet and it was excellent!!  Everything.  
I think it's a great deal for $11. 
I'll be a regular.
The only draw back is the garlic and spices coming out during a good sweat at the gym.  I hope they get over it.
