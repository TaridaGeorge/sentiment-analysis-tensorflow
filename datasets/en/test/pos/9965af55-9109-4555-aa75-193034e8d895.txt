We took a chance on this place based on Yelp and it was awesome. Small place located in a strip mall. Don't bother bringing your own wine - there is an AMAZING wine shop next door with great prices. We showed up with 2 bottles we had just brought from a trip to Napa 2 days prior and ended up buying two others - favorites of ours that are pretty rare finds. Service was great too. Great find if you are looking for great food at a great value and like your wine.
