This place just opened two weeks ago and I have already been there twice.  Great pizza, great bread sticks, and a great price.  I am a pizza addict so I have tried a ton of different pizza places in Scottsdale, and Phoenix.  I think this is the best so far.  Great topping selection, great crust, and it all tastes good too!

I got the pizza to go both times, and they have been nice and warm each time.  No complaints.  Will definitely be going there again!  Maybe this weekend!
