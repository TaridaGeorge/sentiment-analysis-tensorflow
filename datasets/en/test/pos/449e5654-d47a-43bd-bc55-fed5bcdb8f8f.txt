This place was awesome!  Free parking and seats as cheap as $10.  Good food options and you can actually get DODGER DOGS here!!!  The souvenir stand prices are outrageous though!  Sixty dollars for a woman's t-shirt??? Are you fucking kidding me?!?  Nice facility though, with decent access to coaches and players down on the practice fields.  I highly recommend it!
