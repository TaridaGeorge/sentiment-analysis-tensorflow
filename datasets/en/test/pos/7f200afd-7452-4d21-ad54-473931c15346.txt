I love the Rose and Crown. The people who work there are always friendly, even though we tend to be an obnoxious group. Kristin is pretty funny and always stops to chat. Since I'm a wuss and don't like regular beer, I was really excited when I found out they serve Strongbow. In the morning, they have $3 mimosas. And who can turn down $3 mimosas?
