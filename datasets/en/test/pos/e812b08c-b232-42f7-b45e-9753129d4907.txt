My experience with all mechanics/brake shops/dealer service centers has always been that you go in for 1 thing and by the end of the day you've practically upgraded the whole car! 

That is not the case with this Brake Masters. I went in for what I thought would be a simple fix and it was. I was pleased to get the phone call that everything looked great except the thing I came in for. 

They fixed the brakes properly, quickly and didn't try to upsell me anything! It was a great experience and I will return in the future.
