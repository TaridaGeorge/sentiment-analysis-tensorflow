A treasure trove of visual treats. Candles locally made, furnishings you don't see around town.

One of the finest handmade candle companies. Visiting with Kim today and talking about how much I have enjoyed over the years coming here shopping for candles. The aromatherapy alone is worth the visit.

Today I bought a scented 6x6 for 39.9, a 5x6 for 29.9, a stone plate to serve a candle with style 29.9. 

The candles have 3 wicks and will not drip. My scents are African Amber and Desert Mist. The stone plate is an authentic kitchen implement from Kazakhstan for rolling dough on. The plate is used and beautiful.

You will find hundreds of candles in many styles like tapers. Many one of a kind wood carvings, furnishings and art. There are bronze statues of the Dalai Lama Buddha of Compassion.

My go-to place for a few amazing holiday gifts.
