I've only had the good fortune to dine here once with a friend, and I can't say much about it other than it was glorious. 

It is everything you'd expect from a premier steakhouse: excellent high caliber beef, amazing service, great drinks, tasty desserts. 

It isn't cheap but neither is the food they serve. In many respects, I prefer it to Houston's because it feels like less of a scene to me and much more about eating a drinking really high quality things. 

Paul Fleming (of PF Chang's fame) does steakhouses even better than he does panasian, in my estimation, and the next big payday or birthday (hint, hint) I may opt to celebrate here.
