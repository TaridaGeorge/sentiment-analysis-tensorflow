While I generally shy away from "pretend meats and dairy," I have to hand it to Green for doing both exceptionally well.  Everything tastes fresh, flavorful, and generally amazing, and every non-vegetarian I have taken to this restaurant has been blown away!  I especially love the "moo-shroom po-boy," which is a vegan version of a pulled-pork sandwich, made with an espresso barbecue sauce and bell peppers.  It's extraordinarily messy, but even more delicious.  Their artichoke dip is also great, and does very well in the fridge; I think it might have been better the next day.  Just keep in mind that the place is usually crowded, so if you are going with a group, avoid peak hours!
