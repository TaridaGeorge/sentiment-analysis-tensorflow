i could see myself spending major amounts of money at this place if i lived here.

it's a well organized bookstore.  the sections are well defined and in a logical order.  they have a bunch of knick knack items and new books as well as used books.

you can trade in your old books.  they have stamp cards, for every $100 you get $10 off your next purchase.
