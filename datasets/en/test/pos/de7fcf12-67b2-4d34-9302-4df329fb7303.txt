Wow! what a fun place! I love coming here once in awhile. You get two! That's right Two features, just like the old days! Place is very large, have plenty of room. Now on family nights it can get crowded, also remember! This is a good place to bring your family! Please drive slowly! You also have to remember, this is a drive-in. It's not going to be like watching a movie at a theater. Sound is only as good as your system. But it's a great experience!
