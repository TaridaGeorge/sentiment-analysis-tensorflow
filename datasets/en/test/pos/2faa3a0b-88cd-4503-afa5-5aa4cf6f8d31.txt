The hell with ice cream - Gelato all the way!! 

The dessert lounge is really chic with it's stylish interior, WiFi , case full of 10+ Gelato flavors, Gelato cakes and other tasty treats. 

With so many flavors if it was tough to pick and then I stumbled across the case with the chocolate/hazelnut combo. Who doesn't like chocolate and hazelnut? My eyes lite up and I knew exactly what I was going to try...the Bacio or heaven as it should be named!  Just writing this review is making me salivate. 

Hmmm, I wonder what time they open tomorrow? :p
