Best lunch spot in the area. The sandwiches are fresh and delicious. The staff has always been friendly and never messed up an order. I wish I had bought into this business, because they are going to be very successful.

I've done eat-in and pick-up lunches several times. It can get a little busy on weekdays around noon, but I've never had to wait long for my meal.

On my first visit, I ordered the grilled veggie sandwich with a side of fruit. It was so good that I have ordered it every other visit, plus I bought my own panini grill for home so I can have the Urban Picnic-style sandwich for dinner once in a while. (Unfortunately, they're open only for breakfast and lunch, six days a week.)

I highly recommend Urban Picnic and hope to try it for breakfast soon.
