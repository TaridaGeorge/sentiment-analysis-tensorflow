Though I don't mind Starbucks, I will never go back. Sunsational Coffee not only does it right, they get to know you in the process. I have started ordering decaf drinks lately due to my anxiety levels and Lloyd (the owner) every time reminds me, knowing I am prone to forget my new commitment.

Anyway, as a coffee-lover from Seattle, the city of caffeine, Sunsational really makes me miss home, and is the perfect solution for my fix. Lloyd is from Washington state himself, and takes great care over your beverage, so if you aren't satisfied, he'll be sure to get it just right for you! (And remember your drink the next time too most likely.)
