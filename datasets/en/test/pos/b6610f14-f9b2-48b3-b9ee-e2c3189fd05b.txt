This place is always delicious!!!! I love everything on the menu but my fave has to be the jalapeno cheeseburger, add extra pickles and no onions. It's great. Now they have a large drink for $.69! Can't go wrong! It walking distance from my work so I am happy as can be. All the employees treat you like you are treated at an Applebee's. They certainly take the time to train employees to achieve excellent customer service!
