I love this place. It's a great cause and the stuff is good. I always find something here in the way of household items and women's clothing. Half-price Saturdays are wonderful. They also have low cost pet food items (limited supply)

Go early, they close promptly at 4pm and start calling for closing at about 3:30pm-3:45pm.
