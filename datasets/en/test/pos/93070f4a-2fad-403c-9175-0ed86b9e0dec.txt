This place was fantastic.  He held our organization's Holiday Party and Silent Auction here.  What a great place for kids.  My twins had a blast and the space lend itself so perfectly for our party.  The staff was very helpful and accommodating.  We moved furniture around since we had to use several tables from other rooms for our Silent Auction items.  The event was fantastic, unfortunately, I was so busy running around making sure everything went well with the silent auction that I didn't get to enjoy the space with my twins.  Good thing I had a sitter help my hubby.  I guess I'll have to come back soon.
