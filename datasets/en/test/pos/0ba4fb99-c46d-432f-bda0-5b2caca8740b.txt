I love this place...it's like going to dinner with family only better. It's a great neighborhood place---just wish it was in MY neighborhood!!! The very best rack of lamb and Walleye Pike! But eat in the bar --it's always a fun, fun place and the bar menu is great! Try the pork chop, the hamburger steak, scallops---whatever! It's all great and everyone who works there has been there forever!! They recently remodeled and it looks great!!!
