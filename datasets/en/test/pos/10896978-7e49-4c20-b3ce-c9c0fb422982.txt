Where do I begin? I've been to other eye doctors in the valley but I would have to say that this one was by far is the best place to go. I honestly didn't know where to go and after searching on Yelp, I'm glad I picked this one. The staff was really friendly, Dr. Lindsey Clyde was awesome AND she really listened to my needs. Everything was explained thoroughly, their equipment was very neat and like one of my fellow reviewers stated they "used the latest technology to provide the highest level of care."
