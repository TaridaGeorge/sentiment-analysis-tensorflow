Open a new restaurant and serve wonderful food? What a concept! It's true, how many restaurants have opened in Scottsdale over the past, say 3 years? And how many dissapoiting meals? too many to count. This place is not only uber-cool, the food is phenomenal. There were 4 of us for dinner on Wednesday, and each one of us ordered something diffrent. The skewers amazing, the s'mores-- memorable. Mr. Owner came over and asked how were doing, the whole 9 yards. Definitely coming back multiple times.
