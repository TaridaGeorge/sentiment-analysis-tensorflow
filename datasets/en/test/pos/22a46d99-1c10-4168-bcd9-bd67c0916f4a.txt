The two locations I'm near happen to be right next to my two of my favorite restaurants - Pita Jungle and Delux - so I rarely make it to the Gelato Spot only becuase I'm always so stuffed. But the times I have gone have been pure heaven. I'm a girl, after all. I like my sweets.

I'll just get a small cup and it's so packed with flavor and rich and creamy that's all you really need, and it's so satisfying. My favorite is the almond snickers, but I've tried many others as they offer free tastes of anything you like. They put effort into presentation too, so each tub has a chocolate bar, a piece of fruit, etc. to signify what the flavor is and it also looks pretty :)
