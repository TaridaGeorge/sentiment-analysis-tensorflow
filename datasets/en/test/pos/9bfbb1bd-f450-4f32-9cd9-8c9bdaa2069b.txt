I love Joes Farm Grill. It's definately worth the drive! I have never had anything from here that wasn't absolutely delicious! They have great pumpkin milkshakes too :D It's very cute and great for families or even a cute place to go for a date. Except if you hate kids (like me). These little shits are everywhere, running around screaming and being gross with food all over their faces. Wtf, for real. But the plus is that it's right next door to Cosmo Dog Park, so there are always a few cute dogs hanging out with their owners. Oh, and the food is kickass.
