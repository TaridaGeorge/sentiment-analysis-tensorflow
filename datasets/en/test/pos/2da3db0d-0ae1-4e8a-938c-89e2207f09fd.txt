Celebrating our personal endeavors at the Royal Palms Resort & Spa was the PERFECT choice!  

Our recent stay experience at this historical setting proved the spirit lives on. We felt like a celebrity from the amazing food at T. Cook's restaurant to the housekeeper's turndown service because every staff member really took ownership to enhance our experience. It's authenticity, come rain or shine (see the rainbow photo), confirms why this resort wins so many awards. 
 
If you want the royal treatment with an intimate atmosphere that blends into the base of the famous Camelback Mountain, we highly recommend this elegant resort. It's a dream come true!
