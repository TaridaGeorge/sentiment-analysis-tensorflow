I have been to RnR a few times since it has opened.  I have read people have had slow service.  I feel that it has improved 110%.  We had an awesome server the last time I was in on Friday night.  The chicken lollipops are to die for!  The Stigmata (sp?) Vodka drink with berries is also fantastic.  
They brought in a DJ that night after happy hour.  My friends and I sang and danced in our seats all night.  Great place!!
