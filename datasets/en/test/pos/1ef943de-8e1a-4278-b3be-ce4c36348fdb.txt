Saw it on TV and had to check it out while in town. Had the waffle with bacon, all great. Wife had the salami scramble with sourdough toast. Some of the best toast I have ever had. Everything I saw looked great and the owners were both there, always a good sign. There was a wait and parking can be hard, but if you want a good breakfast in Phoenix this is the spot. Next time I am in Phoenix I will be going back.
