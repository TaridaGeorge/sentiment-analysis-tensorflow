OK, so I am a small town girl, and everytime I come to Phoenix I always HAVE to come to this mall. I am originally from Phoenix and wow is this place GREAT. Very high-end shopping but there are afforable stores here as well. You could spend an entire day in here and not have shopped everywhere. Not that I could afford it though- bring your credit cards or sugar daddy because you will need it in this tempting place. What can I say, the place is fab. The people are hotties, the stores are amazing, and the atmosphere is exhilarating. GO HERE!!
