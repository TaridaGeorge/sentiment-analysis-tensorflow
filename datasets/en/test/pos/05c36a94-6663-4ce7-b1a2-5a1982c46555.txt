Called on a Monday morning after a storm and they came out same day.  Took a quick look at the unit and told me by ear what was wrong and it was the same problem I had suspected, so I didn't feel there were any antics.  He gave an estimate that was very reasonable and actually complete the work for less than the estimated price.  Nice, friendly, professional.  Couldn't ask for better.
