I'm a big fan of smaller grocery chains that aren't looking to make huge profits and offer great quality food, so I enjoy shopping here.  

The wine sales are awesome and they have quite a variety that is well organized.  I love buying orchids here and other cut flowers.  They are great quality, fresh, healthy, and they last longer then others I've bought from different stores. 

I also love the heirloom tomatoes, TJ vegetable juice, goat milk, Jo jo's (like Oreos but without any trans fat and real vanilla bean cream), lady fingers for tiramisu, challah for french toast, and so much more.  There's always new products to try and the have tons of great frozen items as well.  The staff is always friendly and the store is clean.  It's a great place to shop!
