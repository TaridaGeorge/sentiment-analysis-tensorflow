We were staying at the attached Kimpton Firesky Hotel, and wanted something close and convenient...and tasty! We are by no means foodies or gourmands, but  recognize food that has been prepared with care and intent. 

Taggia fit the bill - and we gave it an extra star for both service and the fact that it was a hotel restaurant (exceeding the typical mediocrity found in hotels). Our waiter, Will was great, and the Manager stopped by to check in. 

We ordered the delicious Buratta to start, a somewhat heavily dressed Bibb salad (which they graciously split between the two of us with Pancetta on the side), as well as a chicken and Bucatini pasta. The roasted root vegetables were perfect, though the Rapini was extremely salty. 

Overall, we had a lovely evening, and would not hesitate to return.
