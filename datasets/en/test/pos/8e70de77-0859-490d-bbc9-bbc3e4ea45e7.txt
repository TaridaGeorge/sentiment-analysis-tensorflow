My favorite coffee shop in dwn twn phx. Their coffee isn't bitter nor burnt. For those that are a little hungry, the cookies cannot be beat. The sandwhiches are also AHMAZING. For those of you that are not coffee drinkers, I highly recommend the Raspberry Italian Soda = addicted! With all the goodness that comes from this coffee shop, I do have to say, the customer service by far is the best from any coffee shop I frequent. They are friendly and really try to get to know their customers.
