Yes, there's a wait...but it's part of the experience!  I adore everything about this place...the pizzas (I've never had anything like the Biancoverde), the beer (it takes pizza and beer to soaring heights) and of course...Bar Bianco (who doesn't love wine/beer and appetizers as they anticipate their pizza??)  Chris and his incredible staff are always so welcoming, and I always leave a very happy girl!
