The concierge at the Hotel Valley Ho told us that this was one of the finer and better Italian restaurants in Town - she was right.

Having dined around the world, this is by far in my top 5 of all time Italian restaurants.

1. Atmosphere - cozy, intimate and great Italian music
2. Fresh made pasta - do I need to say more
3. A wine list that rivals any 5 star hotel selection
4. Service, Service, Service - Phenomenal wait staff
5. The Chef - Marcellino knows his stuff, great character.

Tips - Ink infused fettuccine with Lobster is probably the best dish I have had in years. Order the rare but 100 point Barollo - It is worth the $ 200.00 a bottle.

But again - service, service, service.

Finally a restaurant that does everything right.
