Yum!! Best chopped salad ever. Great small plate options, that change pretty frequently. Large plates are great as well, however lots of meat options. The scallop and risotto small plate was my favorite. The scallops were huge and fresh. Ambiance was nice, dimly lit. Seems to be pretty busy every time I have dined there...which is always a good sign. Super cool drink options, definitely enjoyed taste testing that menu.
