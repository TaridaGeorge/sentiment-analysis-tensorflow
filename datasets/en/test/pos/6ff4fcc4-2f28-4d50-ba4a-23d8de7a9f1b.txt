Stoners really make amazing food. The BEST sandwiches I have ever had. I can eat a footlong and a half at subway but here i can't eat much more than a nug, the 4 inch. The atmosphere is cool whether you are a pot-head or not, and it goes without saying that the employees are always very friendly. The food is always fresh and delicious, my favorite sanwich is the Thai stick and an egg salad one that i forgot the name of. But don't forget desert. The fruit rice krispies and normal rice krispies are delicious, and so are the gooey balls.
