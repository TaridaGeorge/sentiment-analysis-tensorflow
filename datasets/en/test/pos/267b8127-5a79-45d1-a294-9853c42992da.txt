I'm pretty sure Tonto Bar & Grill is my favorite place to eat in AZ.  We've been coming here for special occasion dinners for close to 10 years and I've never been disappointed.  If the weather's nice, definitely get a seat on the patio - amazing views with occasional javelina sightings!  I always order the schnitzel and it's AMAZING - though the burgers, pastas and salads are incredible as well.
