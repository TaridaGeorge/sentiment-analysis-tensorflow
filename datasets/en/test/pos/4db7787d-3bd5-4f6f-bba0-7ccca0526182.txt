I entered the restaurant and went to the counter to order and the owner was really friendly and wanted to get me the best deal... I ordered the Regular Box (Three chicken fingers, larger waffle fries, Texas toast, and a sauce I bought an extra sauce and they tossed in an extra finger...  I got the Special sauce and the Thai sweet chili sauce the owner told me to dip in both and it was really good... This was one hell of a good meal best chicken fingers I have had in Arizona and real deal waffle fries the whole meal was so good... I spoke with the owner for a bit and he was a down to earth guy running a family owned business so go support the a local business  owner and get a great meal well doing so.
