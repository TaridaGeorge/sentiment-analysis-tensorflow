We've eaten here twice in the last 4 days and I look forward to coming back again soon.  This little place is a treasure.  Every menu item we've tried has been terrific.  John, part of the husband-wife ownership, will make you feel welcome and will cater to your every need.  The service is attentive and prompt.  We've been all over the country trying to find good cannolis.  Everywhere we go, they are either gritty or soggy.  We've found great cannolis in the Bronx, Long Island and Mesa.  Yes, that's right...at Alessia's.  We just moved to AZ from the SF Bay Area and have quickly found our favorite restaurant.
