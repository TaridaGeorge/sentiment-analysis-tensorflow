Gotta take this opportunity to thank Nick A.  He's been there since the shop opened and this is the second time I've dealt with him.  Both times have been a pleasure, as he is just very pleasant and not interested in the typical high-pressure sales style that I've come to expect from chain auto shops.  I hate to say it, but I'm sure I'll be back again for new tires.....
