Love this park!  Always great events going on here, especially during the Fall months.  The ~5 mile path around the lake is great for jogging or bicycling.  This is my dog's favorite place to run!  The new pedestrian bridge is now open adding a new crossing point at the Tempe Center for the Arts (Which is an awesome looking building and a great part of the park).  The lake is stocked with trout during the cold months but the fishing permit for them is kinda pricey (you can get it at local sporting stores like Dick's).
