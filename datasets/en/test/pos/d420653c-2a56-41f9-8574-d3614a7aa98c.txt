This is a great casual location to enjoy pizza, calzones, pasta, and sandwiches. The walls are full of NYC memorabilia like pictures of Broadway shows and signs from the subway. 

Service is friendly and attentive. Our waitress kept gladly bringing paper plates for the four year old to draw on and brought out the kid's spaghetti with the meatballs and the sauce on the side per our request. 

The food is great and the prices are just right. Their claim to fame is that they make their pizza dough with filtered water imported from NYC.
