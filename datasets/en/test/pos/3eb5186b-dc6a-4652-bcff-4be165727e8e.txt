For a great family dining experience, Joe's is the place to go.  Awesome homemade food including my favorites, cheesy potatoes, macaroni and cheese, and apple crisp.  Did I mention homemade root beer, red cream soda, and fresh lemonade?  The moist, and tender pulled pork sandwich is to die for.   Joe's offers a delicious, clean, fun, family friendly dining experience.  Plus, if it's your birthday, you get a free meal!
