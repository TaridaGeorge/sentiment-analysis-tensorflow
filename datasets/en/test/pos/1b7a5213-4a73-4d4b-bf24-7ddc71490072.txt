After writing my first review, the manager reached out to me and sent me a gift certificate for the poor quality burgers we received. He also asked when the food was purchased. This showed me the manager cares about the quality of their food and wants to ensure it doesn't happen again. I have been back several times since and the quality was spectacular, their usual norm. 

Don't forget, you get a free meal on your birthday.

I love Joe's Farm Grill.
