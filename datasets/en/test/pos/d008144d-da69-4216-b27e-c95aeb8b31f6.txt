I loved the Merc Bar during my first visit, last week.  It had just the right amount of everything to feel like you're out for a night on the town, but not over the top.  I loved the music selection and was surprised that such a chic lounge could pull out the soul and 80's classics that I love!  They had a decent wine selection which is what I stuck to all night.  It was also a cozy place to get a table with friends and still chat under the dim lights and awesome decor.
All that being said, I'm sorry that I missed out on this place all of my years in downtown Phoenix.  Perfect location from all over the valley and a great experience.
