Cafe Bink is just perfect.  Of course, given the history, we knew it would be.  My husband and I made the trek to Carefree just to try it and we loved everything we ate - seriously.  The fresh orange juice was heavenly, the home made ice cream - to die for!  They have a great wine list and inviting bar.  We will definitely make it back.  This would be a great place for a romantic date.
