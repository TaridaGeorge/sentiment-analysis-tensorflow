Such nice, nice people.  I can't say enough about the excellent service.

We had breakfast and the flat iron steak benny was outstanding.  The breakfast burrito was huge and flavorful.  An order of the fluffiest pancakes I've ever eaten served as our dessert.  

I had a heads up about the place being behind the Home Depot and had no trouble finding it.
