I was really impressed with Sports Authority this weekend, I don't normally like this place except for their large inventory.  It used to be hard to find someone to help you, but this weekend the service was top notch.  Everyone came up and offered to help and one guy was very helpful with our questions.  We bought a few camping chairs since the last ones we bought broke because they were cheap.  He advised us on which would last the longest and he also helped us pick out a pop-up.  We bought a few other things and everyone offered help which is a big deal for me since I would only go to Sports Chalet for this kind of service.  Good to hear the Corporate has gotten involved.
