This place is definetly a diamond in the rough. It is absolutely fabulous! The first impression is a great one and the last impression is just as great. I have yet to eat anything bad at this place. Everything is made to perfection each time. I love the brisket, pulled pork, and smokehouse burger. Also, you can't forget the potato salad and mac and cheese! Took my parents here while they were visiting and they absolutely loved it!
