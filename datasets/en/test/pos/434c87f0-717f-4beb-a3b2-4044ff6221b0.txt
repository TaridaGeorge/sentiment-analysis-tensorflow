Yummy shaved ice! It's nice and soft just like in HI. Lots of flavors. My favorite is the white coconut. I believe it's one of the sugar free flavors, too. I can never finish anything bigger than the baby size. 

Price is very reasonable. $2 something for the baby size which is like a 12 oz, I believe. They stay open late, til like 11pm & they have a drive thru also. Super convienent. 

I have a feeling Bahama Bucks and I are going to be great friends this summer. Especially since I now work in Mesa :)
