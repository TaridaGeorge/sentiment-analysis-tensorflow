I volunteer here, and it's a really amazing facility. There are lots of dogs and cats up for adoption in this no-kill shelter, and there are also exotic animals, as well as classes and summer camps. The staff really care about animals and are very knowledgeable--they'll definitely help you pick your perfect pet!
