When my husband and I first came across Pork on a Fork's listing we giggled at the name and vowed to try it if only for the name. We found the perfect opportunity to try POAF when LivingSocial featured them as the local daily deal. After leaving Texas 2+ years ago I thought I would never find good bbq again. Thank you, Pork on a Fork for restoring my faith that you don't have to go to a BBQ-infused state to get great BBQ! 

We will return time and time again for their amazing sandwiches and the "f this diet" waffle fries. It is a bit out of the way for me to drive but I would be a liar if I said it wasn't worth it. I would go so far as to say this has got to be the best BBQ joint in Phoenix.
