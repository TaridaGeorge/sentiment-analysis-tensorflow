The tire pressure light came on a day or so ago, so I had my husband fill the tire with more air. Took it down to Discount Tire this morning, and apparently I ran over a hunk of metal a few days ago. Although it was pretty busy in there, they fit me in and had my tire repaired in about 30-35 minutes. Cost = $0. Totally awesome. And they didn't try to sell me new tires! Love that. 

Plus one of the technicians in the garage was singing so loudly to Lady Gaga that he could be heard in the waiting area. Very entertaining. :)
