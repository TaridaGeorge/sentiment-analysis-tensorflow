I love this place!  I've been to many frozen yogurt shops (in California, Hawaii and Arizona) and this one is my favorite.

There are tons of toppings and "bottomings" to choose from, although they could offer more fruit choices.  The quality/texture of the frozen yogurt is very good.  I love their salted caramel flavor, especially when swirled with the sour apple (those two flavors need to be offered all the time!).  

They have a frequent buyer program and I like that you don't have to carry around a card but simply have to tell them your name upon check out.

The girls working there seem friendly and are very good about providing samples, cleaning off the tables, and emptying the trash.
