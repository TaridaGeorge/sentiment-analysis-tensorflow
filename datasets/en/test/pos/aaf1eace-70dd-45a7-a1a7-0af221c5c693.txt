One of the best Philly cheesesteaks I have had west of Independence Hall.
A big 12 inch sub for 9 bucks was more than enough to fill me up. The bread was  very fresh and the proper consistency for a cheesesteak (or any decent sub for that matter-which any sandwich aficionado will tell you is CRUCIAL). Clean, quick and friendly-hard to stand out in the glut of dining options in Dana Park, but they do it right, and I will be back.
