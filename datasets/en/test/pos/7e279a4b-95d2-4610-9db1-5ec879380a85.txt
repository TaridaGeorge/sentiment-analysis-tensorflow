Beautiful desert garden
This is a must see if you've never been to Phoenix. Beautiful examples of Desert wildlife and fauna. I saw rabbits, dove and wild quail scurring around, seemingly oblivious to park visitors. It takes a couple of hours to see it all, so wear comfortable shoes. Beautiful examples of several types of cactus and desert wild flowers. Go in Late March, Early April, when the desert is in bloom. You can litterally smell the sage in the air. 

If you go during the Summer, go as early as possible, Phoenix gets very hot. Late March, early April is good time to go, when the desert blooms.
