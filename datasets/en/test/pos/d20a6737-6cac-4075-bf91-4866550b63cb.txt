This is our preferred theater! Relatively close. Many movies showing. Not overcrowded (we avoid the weekends). Friendly staff. Big comfy theater seats. And clean bathrooms!! 

My spouse and I LOVE the $5 matinees. I noticed this deal wasn't offered this summer though. I also have a Stubs card. This gets me $10 off of concessions every time I spend $100 in tickets or food. This works great for us - a family of five. We spend $100 easy at the movies, especially since we almost always buy snacks.

My spouse and I enjoyed Monday's matinee of the Dark Night. Only a handful of people were in the theater. Nice!
