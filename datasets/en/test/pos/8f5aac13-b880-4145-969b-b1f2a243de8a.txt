I always take my out-of-town guests to the DBG. Everyone is always impressed by the wide array of desert flora, and it's a good brush up on the native plants/wildlife/ethnobotany for me as well. Lots of drinking fountains throughout the trails which make exploring in 100-degree weather bearable. If you have a student ID, you save half off of general admission (15.00 down to 7.50).
