I was visiting from Seattle and, naturally, ran out of business cards 2 days before a conference. I usually work with a local, professional printing company but I took a chance and called them as they were just a block away from my hotel. They took my order Wednesday afternoon, called at 8am Thursday to confirm the proof and pricing (which was $3 more than what I had paid for my last order of 250 in Seattle), and had my order that day. I am no longer a printing company snob.
