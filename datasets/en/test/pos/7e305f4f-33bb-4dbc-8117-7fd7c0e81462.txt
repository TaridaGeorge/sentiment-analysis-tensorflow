LOVE LOVE LOVE Oregano's!!! One of my favs! Great food, wonderful service,  fun environment....and did I mention the infamous pazookie?!?AmAzIng!! 

Everything  I have tried is great! It's so hard for me to venture because I'm OBSESSED with the Pablo Picasso salad! I love going with friends so I can sneak bites of their food...oregano's favorite salad, bistro classic pizza, guacatony...it's all good!
