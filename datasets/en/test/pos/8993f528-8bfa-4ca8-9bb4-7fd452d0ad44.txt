5 and 5 and 5 and again 5

I am celiac, so please let me tell you how painful it is to get a pizza or pasta or anything Italian.
At Picazzo you get everything you want.
I got the Alfredo seafood pizza and it was just delicious.

My poor BF got a pasta dish which was very light taste wise and was disappointed.

But we shared a beautiful apple turnover which was amazing.

Will go back for sure !!!! Just wish they were expending to Canada now.....
