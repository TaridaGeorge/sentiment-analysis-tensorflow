When I arrived last night, I thought they were closed. There was only one car in the parking lot, and I assumed it was the owner's.

Once inside, I found it was worth the drive. I had the miso ramen with chicken, and I loved it. It was a gigantic bowl of flavorful broth, tender noodles, cabbage and chicken. It also came with two pieces of inari sushi. It was my first time having inari, and I liked it.

An awesome, incredibly filling dinner for about 9 dollars. I may go back tonight.
