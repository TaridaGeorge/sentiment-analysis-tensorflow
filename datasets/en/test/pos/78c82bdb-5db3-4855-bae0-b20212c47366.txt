Out in the middle of no where, but such a fantastic find!

Went here for a few drinks with some sorority sisters before heading out to a festival in Queen Creek. Did a little research on the place and knew I was going to love the overall dog theme. 

They have outstanding happy hour special everyday of the week. Wish I loved closer so I could bring my dog to the very dog-friendly patio and enjoy a game on the many flat screens. Inside, there's tons of booth and the walls are simply lined with framed photos of dogs. It's hilarious. What's even better is they let you throw peanut shells all over the floor and the peanuts are hed in dog bowls. Love it.

Didn't order food but they had an outstanding selection of drinks. I would def go back to this place.
