I love this hike - it's a little under 4 miles roundtrip going up and down and back and forth the whole time. If you take it at a decent pace (or take it twice), you'll get a great workout and wonderful views of North Scottsdale. I've never seen it "crowded" but parking gets busy and at times and you may have to pass (or be passed). All the other hikers are very friendly though!
