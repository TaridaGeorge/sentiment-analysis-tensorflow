This gym is awesome.  It has everything you need and the classes will kick your butt.  The kickboxing is intense but the boxing workout class (not boxing training class, which also rocks) will absolutely kick your butt.  It has all the cardio equipment you need (bikes, treadmills, ellipticals, rowing machines, stairmaster, etc) weight machines, free weights, basketball court, punching bags, boxing ring.  

Also - its only $75 a year - thats it.  Unless you are a non-Scottsdale resident, then you pay $105 FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR.  Plus the people that work there are great - they remember you after your first visit.
