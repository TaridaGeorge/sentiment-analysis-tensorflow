This place is always friendly and my big group of friends and I always have a good meal. I've yet to have a sub par experience. I love the grilled chicken breast with veggies, moist and flavorful. Desserts are always good and some come in half portions which is helpful. The outdoor area is great to sit by, especially when it's cold and the fireplace is roaring.
