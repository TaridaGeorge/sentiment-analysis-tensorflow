This is the way of the future.  Love the easy part... easy to park - easy to navigate through the store.  Your not overwhelmed with giant stores, walking miles to shop, signs blinking in your face.  Fresh - is the best - everything is great.  They have a 50% aisle, which is where I always head when I walk in.  The  problem is a lot of people have figure out the 50% aisle also :(  It is eco-friendly, low-maintence store, low impact on our world, little waste.  Great for a couple who wants great quality food without the price.  Easy to pack up for lunch and off you go - Fresh and Easy!

Things I love there are:

Hummus
Organic chips
Artichoke tapanade.
50% Aisle 

Safeway and Fry's - sorry you lost my dollars to Fresh and Easy!
P.S. - How about some Non-Gluten Breads?
