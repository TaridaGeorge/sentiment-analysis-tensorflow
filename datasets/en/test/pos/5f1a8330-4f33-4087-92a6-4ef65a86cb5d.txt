Love this place!  

Wildflower is my go-to place for lunch in the area.  They have a huge selection of great sandwiches and salads and the portions are huge.  My favorite salad is the chopped salad, rivals all others that I've had.  The only thing that would make it better is if the salads had the option to have sliced avocado on it (you can add avocado, but it's the avocado that's already mashed up and used as a sandwich spread.) 

They have great breakfast too!  

The Scottsdale location is great - big, lots of booths, and a large outdoor seating area.  It is much more relaxed than some of the other locations and they have great service.  Every time I have been there, there is a good amount of seating available.
