Great service, fast, friendly, reliable, and honest. I took my fianc√©'s bike in for tune up (flat tires, lube, gears, derailleur, etc.) and was quoted a price and time to pick it up. They asked if I needed it sooner, and since it had sat forever I said whenever would be fine. They called at the time they said it would finished...it was. The bike was cleaned up, tires fixed, and they said it was a great bike in great shape! The price was that of the quote and not a penny more. I would highly recommend Cactus Bike for service.
