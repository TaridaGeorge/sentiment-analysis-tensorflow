I couldn't believe how great this location was.  Having been to a few of the Cartel locations in other places in the city as well as having their espresso as guest coffees at other cafes around the country, I never imagined I would get a great shot at an airport, no matter what the brand name on the sign. But boy oh boy was I wrong.  This place had great service, an innovative customer service set up, and fantastic baristas that performed as well as their other locations.  I couldn't have been more surprised.  This was an absolutely fantastic thing to have in an airport, and it makes me want to connect through Phoenix on Southwest (they are in the southwest terminal) if i absolutely HAVE to connect.

A hidden gem.
