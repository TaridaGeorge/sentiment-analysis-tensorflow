Eastwind is a hidden, or unknown gem, even though it has been here for 18 years.     The food is excellent: very fresh and very authentic Japanese.   Although it has a reputation for being a more or less fast food restaurant, don't let that fool you.  It has a  very good with a very interesting menu.  Have a little patience and give Eastwind a try; you won't be disappointed.
