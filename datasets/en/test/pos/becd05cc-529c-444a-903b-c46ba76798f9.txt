I've always loved this theater. Big enough and still be intimate. There are no bad seats on the main floor. I love the feeling of grandeur once you enter this theater. I always feel like whatever I'm watching is going to be good otherwise it wouldn't be performing at the Herberger. I also love their location, 5 min walking distance from the Arizona Center so we can have a great dinner before a show at a nice restaurant without having to stress out about driving and the need to find parking twice!
