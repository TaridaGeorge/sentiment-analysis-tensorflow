BEAUTIFUL salon!  The receptionists were really nice and I chatted with them while waiting for Jayme, my aesthetician, to come up front.
It's not too big, not too small.  The decor is sleek and "clean."  It wasn't really loud, which, as a beauty consultant, I find overwhelming if the music is too loud.
Jayme was great with my "caterpillars" and even did a different shape, based on my face/eye shape.
Super professional!
Brow wax was $15.  I gave a $5 tip, too.
