I grew up on this place as well as worked there in high school the Owners are personal friends of ours and I LOVE THIS PLACE hand breaded onion rings, shrimp and all the other breaded food done fresh everyday. I am not really a seafood person but I will eat pete's and this place is legendary to Phx  fast food seafood plus the many other items they have.. I really surprised at all the negative reviews When I worked at this locations in High school I remember famous people coming through the drive thru all the time Alice Cooper loved this place.
