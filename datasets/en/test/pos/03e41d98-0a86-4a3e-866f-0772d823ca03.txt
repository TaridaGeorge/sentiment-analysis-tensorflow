My hidden sushi gem :)  I've been recommending this place for years and they have never been disappointed.  

Robert is great!  Behind the sushi bar, he welcomes everyone as they should be, a guest in his home.  If you take the time to introduce yourself, he will remember you on your subsequent visits.

The best experiences we have ever had at Dozo is to leave our dining experience in his hands.  Often times we are able to try new things we would not have previously thought of.

Give yourself some time here, plates come out as they are prepared as Robert and crew put a lot of love into each dish that is prepared.  This is what a sushi dining experience is about!

Dozo is a must!!
