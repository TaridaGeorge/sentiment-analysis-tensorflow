Well I have to give a shout out to my fellow yelper "Daren C."! Good lookin out on the Culver's. I had an opportunity to make this journey over the weekend and was not disappointed! 

The butter burger is far superior to Freddy's Steakburger. I love the crinkle cut fries as well. This joint was packed on Saturday! I like that I can get grilled onions on my burger yum. 

Culver's is A+ I would definitely recommend it!
