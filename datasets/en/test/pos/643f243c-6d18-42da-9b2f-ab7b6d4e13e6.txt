Been here for lunch twice now. Small little place tucked into a larger center. Menu was different both times that I went here. That said, all the items that I had were delicious! Grilled veggie wrap, lavosh, spiced fruit salad with chicken, and spinach salad were all pretty darn tasty. Prices were reasonable and the service was top notch.

N*Joy...
