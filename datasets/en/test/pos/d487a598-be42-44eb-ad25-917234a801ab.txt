Just wanted to let everybody know that Royal at the Market is closed for the summer!  In the meantime, be sure to check out the other location at the Biltmore Fashion Park -  Royal at the Biltmore!

(Also, since it's summer - I thought I should mention that the iced coffee is so smooth and amazing that you don't even have to add anything to it!! Don't believe me?  Ask for a sample next time you are here and I guarantee you will be astounded!)
