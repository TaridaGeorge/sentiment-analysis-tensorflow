I've stopped here twice when I was out that way for  DODGERS spring training.  

Both times I went through the drive through and ordered frap Java Chip.  Frab Java Chip has 2 road bumps, 1 all the ice has to be ground up well enough to get through the straw.  2 all the java chips haveto be ground  up well enough to get through the straw.

This location is 2 for 2 and  that is better then  I can say for any other starbucks I've been too.

It's much appreciated when they do things right.
