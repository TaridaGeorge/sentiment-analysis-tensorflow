My husband and I used our restaurant.com coupon at this place, we had 3 specialty rolls and a tempura cheesecake. All of the food was delicious. It also came out really quick, the sushi was fresh and beautifully plated.

The price is typical of other sushi restaurants, but here you are paying for the sushi, not the bar scene.

Give it a try, perfect place to go before a movie. Our favorite roll was the Arizona Roll.
