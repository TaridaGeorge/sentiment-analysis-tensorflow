There are so many good things to say about this place. The food is awesome!!! You really can't go wrong with anything you order. Try their Kobe beef.....sinfully delicious and your eyes will roll to the back of your head!! Melt in your mouth yum yum yummy!!! Warm butter cake is off the hook and so are their chocolate souffles. Wait staff is great...they will always be there when you need them!! As will the bathroom attendants!!! LOL
