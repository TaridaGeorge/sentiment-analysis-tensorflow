I found this place to be a gem for a Casual Drinker such as myself. I Love The #1! Calmer on a Wednesday after work. And a Joy on Sunday FunDay with the boys. 

Brought My Partner's Parents here for a little southern delight and they enjoyed the POTATOES! WooHoo

I totally forgot the CrabCake Sandwich had a kick to it... It was a little too much of a kick for "Moms In Law"... But the wonderful staff was quick to correct with a light sampler of the other items on the menu for her to feel comfortable with. It was a Wonderful Night! Thank You Windsor Staff!

Only one thing I would recommend. More samples of the SWEETS from Churn... Haha the BANANA ice cream was oh so good. The late night run over to just have a scoop are so fun.
