This place is great. We went because we are a fan of Joe's BBQ and Joe's Farm Grill. We were not disappointed with the food or atmosphere.  I had the grilled cheese sandwich with bacon and tomatos and the potato salad. The potato salad was the best I have ever had and the grilled cheese was the best I ever had, and I have had MANY versions of both meaning that I have a little bit of a weight problem. But anyways Liberty Market is worth a try and Im sure you will want to go back. It kinda reminds me of a cooler version of La Grande Orange.
