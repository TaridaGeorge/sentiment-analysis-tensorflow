Not much to say about FEZ except they have excellent food and drinks. I usually go with the sirloin and potatoes, and its always good perfectly. They also have a good selection of spirits, in addition to a few special made cocktails. Atmosphere is perfect; modern and trendy without any holier than thou feelings. Happy hour is every day as well, go!
