I absolutely love Yasu! I took my manfriend here and we are sushi and sashimi lovers. We have been to many sushi places all over the valley, out of the state and country too. 

Yasu has great quality fish (specially for AZ being inland it is always hard to find fresh fish). We let Yasu pick out our food! We had the albacore (they only get it twice a year it was superb!), jalepeno sushi roll, dates wrapped in bacon, and the Yasu beans (two orders; it was that good!). Btw, do not use soy sauce! Everything is perfect and does not need it!

Everything was excellent and my favorite part was the aesthetically pleasing display of the food. Everything was in harmony, which is rare in most affordable restaurants. We will return to Yasu!
