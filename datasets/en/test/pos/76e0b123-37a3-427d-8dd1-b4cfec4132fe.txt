Carmel's is my new favorite coffee/breakfast spot. If I didn't work during the day, I would enjoy their lunch too! The baristas are friendly and always smiling (HUGE in my book, especially early in the morning), and you can taste the love that the bakers put in their food. :) The crepes and brown butter scones are my go to as of now, I still need to work my way thru the menu. I love that it lacks the annoying crowds that i dread facing at other restaurant/cafes, although I know it's just a matter of time before word gets out that this place is the real deal.
