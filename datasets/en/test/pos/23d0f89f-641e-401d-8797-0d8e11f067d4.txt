This is a great place.  The food is tasty and inexpensive.  The place is campy and take a moment to figure out the order sheets.  Did I say the food was inexpensive and tasty?  The food comes in a tin, very simple.  The enviroment is basic and a bit worn.  We want to give the Chandler location a try.
