Shout it from the Roof Tops of the West Valley! Don Rafia's is the best Mexican Food out here in the land of commercialized chain restaurants. If you are sick of conveyor belt Mexican food then please please please check this place out! It is off of Dysart Road in the Home Depot/Furniture Stores/ and Sam's Club parking lot. The only thing this place is lacking is a good location! The food is awesome, the service is spectacular, and did I mention the food was awesome! Every chance we get we eat here since during these economically challenging times mom and pop restaurants fall by the wayside like skinny girls in a all you can eat race.
