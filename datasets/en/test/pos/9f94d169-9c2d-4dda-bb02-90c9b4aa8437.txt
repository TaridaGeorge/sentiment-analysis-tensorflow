Zest was definitely spirited dining.  I went there with a large group from a conference and there is so much that can go wrong in that situation.  Andrew, Michael and Don rushed around to ensure that all of our needs were attended to.  The food was terrific, especially the eggplant cheesecake.  My steak was wonderful and prepared just right.  The atmosphere was cool and the staff friendly - highly recommended.
