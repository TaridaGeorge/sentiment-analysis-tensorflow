Some of the best hotdogs I' ve ever had!   The buns are heated on the griddle and come out buttery and crispy.  The hotdogs themselves are toasty on the outside and a whole lot of divine goodness on the inside.  My only complaint is that it takes a while to get your order, since the store is always packed.  Actually I would also like to see some indoor seating as well, but I doubt that it is possible due to the facilities.
