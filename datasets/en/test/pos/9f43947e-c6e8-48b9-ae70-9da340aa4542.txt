this place is SHOCK and AWE!
once you walk in it has the WOW affect. too steep for my wallet but enjoyed the property. very clean, great river, pool is considered cold and kiddie pool is tucked in the corner for loud noises not to be hear by adults, lol! great happy hour for both on property restaurants. fitness room is small for this grand resort, but it will do. parking and wifi is NOT free. there is a starbucks on property but $$$$.
