One of my fav places that I would recommend to anyone! The atmosphere is intimate and trendy. They have a good wine selection and delicious food. I would recommend the bruschetta which comes in 12 different flavors. The Brie & Apple and the Prosciutto & Figs are the best in my book. The staff is also friendly and helpful. They provided me with some great suggestions on wine after asking a few questions. Overall, it's just a great place to go for any occasion.
