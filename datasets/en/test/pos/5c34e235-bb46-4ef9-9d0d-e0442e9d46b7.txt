I've been to the DMV in CA, ND, and NC and this was by far the most friendly, efficient, and painless. When you come from another state, you don't have to take a written test, and I didn't even have to take an eye test. Registering my 2008 vehicle, tags, and driver's license was $145, the cheapest I have ever paid. The people are calm, friendly, patient and helpful, and the place is clean and well-organized. Kudos to them. I went on a Tuesday at noon and spent about 40 minutes there; it was not packed but it was busy with customers.
