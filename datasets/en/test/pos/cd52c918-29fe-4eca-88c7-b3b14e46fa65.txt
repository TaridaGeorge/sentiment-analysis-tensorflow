I was able to get right in and I had an incredible experience with Angeleta.  When I thought my haircut was done she brought out the shaving supplies to clean up some some areas and also gave me a warm towel and a massage.  I have been cutting my own hair for a couple years and I am kicking myself for doing so after this.  I bet the place fills up during peak hours so make sure you plan ahead.
