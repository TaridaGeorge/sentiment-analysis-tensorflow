Eating in is a decent experience, but for delivery, I have yet to meet their match.  When I order delivery I always get a 16" chicken pizza with alfredo sauce on top, and for the last 6 years I have received it in 30 minutes or less all but 2 times.  Its always tasty, fresh, and is my preeminent food for delivery, ever, period.
