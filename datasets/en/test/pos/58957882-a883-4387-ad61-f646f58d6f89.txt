I'm not a seafood lover so something has to be amazing for me to even eat it.  The sea bass at Ocean Club is the most phenomenal thing EVER!  It's shocking to hear that come out of my mouth so you know there must be something special about this sea bass.  The steaks are pretty fantastic too.  And the bread sticks are down-right addictive!  It has great ambiance as well and the piano music is a treat.  I highly recommend it.
