D.I. is what the kids are calling it these days. D.I. is the best thrift store around. The place looks nicer than a Sears. Everything is clean and organized. They have tons of everything in all of their sections. The place doesn't smell as bad as a Goodwill. They even have new bed sets that are very affordable. I always go to hit up the neck tie rack. They have lots of good Polyester ties, which is the only kind I wear. Silk is for losers.
