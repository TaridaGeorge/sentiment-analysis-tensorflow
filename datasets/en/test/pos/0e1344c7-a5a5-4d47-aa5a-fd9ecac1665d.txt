I was looking for a smaller scale family vet and met with Dr Adkins.  Nice quirky kinda guy.  Straight shooter and down to earth.  He answered all my questions without me feeling like I was a bother.  (I liked that!)  In my opionion some Doctors treat the general public like morons or aids patients.  I didn't get ther weirdo vibe from Dr Adkins.  As for my last vet, I couldn't say the same.  Vet tech was REALLY nice.  Front of house lady seemed kinda fake, but was nice enough.  I had a bit of a wait due to two pet emergencies.  The doc even appologized for the wait.  I like the humility.  I totally understand, if my dog was severly sick or hit by a car, I would hope for the same treatment.  I'm very happy to have found a new vet.
