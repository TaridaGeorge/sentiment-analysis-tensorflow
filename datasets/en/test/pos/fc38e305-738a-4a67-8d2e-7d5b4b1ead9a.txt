I had a complete roof done by them and they were so expertly professional that I was completely satisfied. I am used to dealing with contractors and have been "had" by a few. This company was soooo up front, clean, and did an incredible job. They never tried to upsell me, but when I asked about better attic ventillation, they offered an esthetically pleasing yet effective solution at minimal additional cost. I can't say enough good about them! My roof looks fabulous!
