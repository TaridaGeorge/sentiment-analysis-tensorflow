Especially in Phoenix where everything is so spread out, it's fantastic that you can find great food within walking distance of your hotel. Both the service and food at Fuegos is "tip top" in the words of a former mentor of the Stache. Both the manager Matt and the bartender Maureen were excellent and couldn't have been nicer. The tacos were excellent and I would recommend the ground beef, pernil and chicken as 3 solid choices. Overall, great food, even better service and extremely reasonable prices.
