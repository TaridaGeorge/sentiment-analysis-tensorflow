In 20 words or less: Hamachi with grapefruit, avocado, and white truffle ponzu oil. Just do it. You won't regret it.

Great location, cozy ambiance, eclectic wine and spirits menu, and absolutely stellar food. Standouts were the aforementioned hamachi, and eggplant with bacon and red miso. Foie gras with apples and a red wine reduction was a decadent indulgence, and pork belly buns were a filling, comfort food complement to more composed dishes. 

Service was great; the staff was very knowledgeable and accommodating. A fabulous night out, I can't wait for a repeat visit. Hamachi hamachi hamachi hamachi hamachi!
