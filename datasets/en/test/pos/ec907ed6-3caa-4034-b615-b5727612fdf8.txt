This was my second year running Pat's run. Love this event, the volunteers do a great job on cheering you on and helping you out. Love the atmosphere and watching thousands of people gathering for a great cause!

I do agree that there are a few narrow areas that should be worked on and the walkers should stay with the walkers! It is very hard to try to improve your time when there are a lot of walkers in your way.
