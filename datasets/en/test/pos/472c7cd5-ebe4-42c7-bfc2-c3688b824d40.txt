For some reason, I am always shocked when I find a great Barbecue restaurant in the Western United States. This is your typical smoked meat in a plastic basket type place. The food was well cooked and very tasty. The portions are large and they even offered me another refill for the road. I thought that was pretty classy. If you're passing through Wickenburg, try this place out.
