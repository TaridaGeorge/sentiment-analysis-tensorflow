Great new addition to downtown Chandler.  This is an upscale Thai restaurant with a hip, cool interior.  The food is Thai and Thai Fusion and very good.  Try the awesome Halibut dish.  The owner and his mother really contribute to a friendly,fun atmosphere.  FY I- it's south of the wedding dress shop and the entrance is actually located on Arizona.  We will be back!
