I stopped by yesterday for a Zumba class with my friend. What an incredible facility! Nice jogging trail, state of the art machines, two large courts for basketball. AND they had Dance Dance Revolution! I only wish I lived closer so I could visit more often! For those without a pass, it only costs $4 for a day pass. Well worth it!
