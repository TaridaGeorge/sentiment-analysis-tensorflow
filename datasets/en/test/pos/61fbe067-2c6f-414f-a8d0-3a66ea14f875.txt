Sprouts is a store you walk into because you think you want to eat healthy.  When you get inside and see the prices and the quality that you are getting you realize YOU ARE EATING HEALTHY.  They have double Wednesday ad day, so you get two weeks worth of ads in one day.  They have a huge health and wellness section.  I love the fact I can get things in bulk- so you can just buy 1/2 cup of Almonds if that is all you need.

They do have a few samples out.  (My boys are all about the samples.)  The bakery section does lack a little in my opinion.  I love the meat section though.  I also LOVE the produce section.  I do not buy produce at any other store.  Not only does it look great, but it tastes great as well!
