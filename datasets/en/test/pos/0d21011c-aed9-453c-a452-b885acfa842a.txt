Macy's, Nordstrom's, The Apple Store, and Sephora! I love this mall. Clean, pretty, gigantic, and all my favorite stores. Let me tell you, I HATE mall shopping... But this one is my favorite if I have to go. There is a movie theater, valet parking (I thought this was such a crazy thing at a mall, lol), and restaurants galore. I love the fountains and outdoor seating.
