Hands down the best yogurt shop in the valley. I've tried several, and this one is awesome. They have the freshest toppings, and their tart flavor is delicious. My husband swears that both their chocolate and their vanilla are better than any of the competition. One question though: Why the tip jar? Do you tip at Baskin Robbins (where they actually scoop your ice cream for you) or at any other place where all they do is take your money?? I don't get it, but I love the yogurt!
Oh yeah, one more thing: Beware their giant bowls. It's really easy to get carried away, and with the weight of toppings and all, (at 39 cents per ounce) we generally end up spending about $8 for two.
