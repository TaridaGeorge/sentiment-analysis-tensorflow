Wow. I've been reading the other reviews and I'm honestly shocked.  I've been coming here since it first opened and no one knew anything about it.  I liked it better when it was small and unknown, but that's because I could enjoy it at my leisure.  The owner would often come out and chat up the customers and the business in a house was a fairly new phenomenon.

The food has been consistently tasty and fairly priced. The only thing to change over the years is the architecture and decor.  I've taken all sorts of people here to eat and no one has ever disagreed that it was the best Chinese food.

I have always had at least adequate service on First Fridays.  The rest of the time, the service is as wonderful as the food.
