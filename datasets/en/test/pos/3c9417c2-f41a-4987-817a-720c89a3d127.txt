Ulta is the lesser stocked more mainstream version of Sephora with more access to drugstore cosmetics and high end cosmetics as well. If you find your bathroom running low on what ever makes you look oh so pretty get one stop shopping for sure at Ulta. One reason I really like going to Ulta is they offer more variety of products than grocery stores, and sometimes drugstores as well. It's hard to leave the store with out spending a ton of money because I tend to go crazy for everything I find in there. The salon at this location is really nice as well, but it's a bit to high from my price-range.
