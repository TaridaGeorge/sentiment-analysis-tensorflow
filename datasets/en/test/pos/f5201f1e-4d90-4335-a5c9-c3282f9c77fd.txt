It is definatley time for an update!  after a few dozen ++ visits since last rvw!  

Loved the cooking class last week in thier intimate executive room.  Sam Fox was available throughout the evening to give updates on FRC, to answer questions, and serve food.  Was very informative, and alot of fun.

Right now, there is a drop-dead special: 3 courses for $20 - yes, you heard me right: THREE course meal for less than the cost of an entree !!  O.M.G.  can't wait to go back - again, and again, and again.

Oh, HH is now 7 days/wk !   Whoooooooooooooo :-)
