What you (might) want/need to know first:

HTCs staff is friendly, professional and extremely knowledgeable. Unless you're a jerk you will have a great time getting a hole through your body.

HTC is an APP (Association of Professional Piercers) member. One of three shops in the greater Phoenix metro area. Visit - www.safepiercing.org for more info

Now with that said I have had several piercings done at HTC on Ash with nothing but wonderful results. I also have had several friends receive piercings here, same results.

Their aftercare cards are well laid out and informative. The aftercare products they sell are highly recommended for smooth and quick healing (Satin, H2Ocean, etc).

I do not have a negative thing to say. They are great and I will continue to take friends/family and recommend them to random people.
