I had tried several times to patronize Lux but the decibel level always exceeded my tolerance.  I had written it off for just being too loud, until I had a meeting there the other day.  The new, improved, Lux on Steroids is wonderful, with enough nooks, crannies, and side rooms to allow you to adjust the volume to your eardrums' delight.

I am definitely returning, and since this last time was way too early for an adult beverage, am scheduling my visit so that I can try an adult beverage using those homemade sweet preserved lemons the bartender was telling me about...and that will be very soon!
