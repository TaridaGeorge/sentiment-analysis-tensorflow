Wow! I almost don't want to give Circle 6 Studios such a great review....then I'll have to share the space whenever I want to go to a class! It was so much fun and the guys running the place are great to work with. They helped me to make some really colorful and pretty flowers in the "Mother's Day class" (which isn't just for Mother's Day). It really was just a unique way to spend an evening and I'm looking forward to signing up for many more classes. If you like trying fun art experiences, this is a reasonably affordable place to go. But beware, if you do like it, you're going to want to go again and again!
