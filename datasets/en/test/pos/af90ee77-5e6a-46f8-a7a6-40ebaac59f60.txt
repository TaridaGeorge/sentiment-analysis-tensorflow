I have to add another star. We were just there again last night and the food and service were once again the very best. There is nothing pretentious about this place. It's like sitting down in a relative's kitchen to have dinner. it's just comfortable, right down to the mounted jigsaw puzzle of the Alps on the wall. It's friendly and about real people having great food and a great time. There is no attitude here, just a friendly welcome, great servers, fantastic German food and great music by Duane and Elmer. I can't wait to go back!
