Had an awsome late lunch at this bbq restaurant this afternoon.  I have a gluten alergy so it was a relief to be able to talk to the owner and make sure what i could eat since everything is homemade.  I had the corn souffle, the ranch beans  & the sliced brisket which was really really really good.  The owner came over and talked to us and was really nice. The best part of the it was the smell you can smell the bbq cooking out in the parking lot and it is wonderful.
