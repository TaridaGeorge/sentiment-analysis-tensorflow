I love HomeGoods and was super excited that they were opening up in my backyard. This store is a lot cleaner and more organized than the one in Desert Ridge. It could be because they just opened up, but I hope they're able to keep it this way. Every time I go they always have new merchandise. 

HomeGoods is a great place to go if you're looking for cheap home decor or unique gifts like Lilly Pulitzer stationary.
