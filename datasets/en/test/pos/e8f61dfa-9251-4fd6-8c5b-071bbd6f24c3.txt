This is the best authentic thai place in arizona.  Hands down.

try the papaya salad w/ crab. pad see eww is good too.  one thing that isn't on the menu that you can order is the beef jerky, the name doesn't do it justice but if you know about thai food you'll thank me later.  it's really one of those hole in the wall places and everyone knows that's where teh good food really are.  because of the location it really doesn't get as much traffic as it should.
