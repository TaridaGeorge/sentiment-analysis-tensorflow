The service level of Nordstrom's never ceases to amaze me. On a recent visit to ladies clothes I found a really cute dress that I didn't notice until I got home had a flaw in it- brought it back...the Assistant Manager, Alex Bixler was nothing short of amazing.  She called 7 different stores while I waited to find one that was not flawed.  I would highly recommend this person to assist anyone looking for clothes.  I heard her helping others too.  She is professional, knows the lines and is honest.  I will be making sure I shop when she works and would recommend her for anyone looking for someone to assist them to ask for Alex.
