I had breakfast at The Place over the weekend. The portions are HUGE and affordable. I am not lying when I say that I had the best sausage patty I have ever tasted that morning. Delicious! I have no complaints and I plan on returning. The wait staff are friendly and Trinity Gondella (hostess) is the sweetest of them all.
