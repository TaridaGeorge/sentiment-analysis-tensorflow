I hesitate as I write this because I really don't want all of you to know how good MJ's bread really is. There is a limited supply of it and if you knew how good his bread was, there would be none of it left for me.

If you want to know how bread is supposed to taste, try MJ's multi grain loaf. Or the bran. Or the levain. You could walk in, ask for a loaf of bread and take what they give you and you would be happy. 

I've tried as many others as I can find and I continue to look for the competition, but I have to tell you that he is in a cl\ass by himself.
