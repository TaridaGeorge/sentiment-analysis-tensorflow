The BEST Thai food ever... And I have been to Thailand! Authentic food, friendly staff, AND they deliver! They just opened Sundays too! Crab Rangoon is my fave... Order extra sweet and sour sauce because that's dessert in and of itself! Pad Thai and Pad see ew are the BEST around!  I have been to about 10 other Thai restaurants in the valley... THIS one is by far THE BEST!!!
