LOVE this place.  What I love most is how versatile it is.  It's one of my favorite places for lunch because its so close to the office.  Great lunch pricing because the half salads are enough to fill me up and there just $7. Can't beat that!

Then after work the lounge-feel really pops and the drink menu is super fun.  

One thing to warn, it's a "open" establishment with a colorful splash!  I totally enjoy it, but if you an in the box type of person, you may not so much!
