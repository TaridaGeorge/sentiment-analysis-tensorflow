I love this place! The food here is so good and it's great because the menu is really diverse.  You'll definitely find something on the menu here that you're in the mood for, but you don't have to worry that the chef can't handle such a varied amount of ethnic dishes.

I had the penne fettucine and it was amazing. My friend had the orange chicken and loved it.  They also have really great desserts, including this chocolate fudge brownie type thing that comes out warm with ice cream.  It's wonderous.

You can also watch sports games here because they have a pretty cool bar area in addition to the restaurant.
