This restaurant was the first one I tried when I moved to Tempe. I had spent 6 weeks in the Bahamas and though the regions are not the same there is some similarity--and I was craving Bahamian food. I was hoping there might be some crossover that would satisfy my craving.

I have since been the restaurant many times and every time it's fantastic. The baked goods are amazing--they melt in your mouth! The family that runs the store is so friendly and every time I go in I have a conversation with someone.

I highly recommend the lunch fish sandwich and the plantains. My friends love the Ox Tail and the smells this place emits is almost as good as the food.

Totally worth trying!
