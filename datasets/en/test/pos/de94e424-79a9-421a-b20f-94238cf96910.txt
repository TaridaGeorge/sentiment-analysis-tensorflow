Just awesome. My not quite two year old daughter had her first dentist appointemnt and the staff here was great. They were friendly to my wife and I in the waiting room and my daughter had a blast on the toys. The Dr. was very friendly and made my daughter feel very comfortable prior to doing any work in her mouth. Very helpful for us to know how to better care for her teeth at home. Awesome experience for something that both my wife and I were very worried about.
