Just wanted to update- I had said it was slightly pricey. I must have been smoking crack that day because I went there again today after going to Fry's and Safeway. Not only is the meat here FAR better than a supermarket's meat, but the prices are actually BETTER as well. Also, they make their own sausage and brats here. GO HERE NOW!!!
