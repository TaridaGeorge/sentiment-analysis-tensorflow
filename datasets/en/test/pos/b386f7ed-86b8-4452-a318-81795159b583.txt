Had dinner at Caffe Boa last night with the girls.  It had been a while so I thought it was time for an update to the review.  Not surprisingly, it is still a solid 5 stars.  Of the six ladies at the table, every single one of us commented on how good our food was.  I had the spicy rigatoni which I have to say is now my new favorite dish.  The bruschetta was very tasty as always and I was pleased to see they now have a crostini made with brie that was amazing.  Everyone found a wine that was to their liking and that plus the food plus the good weather made for a very relaxing evening on the patio.  I of course had the Strawberry Basil martini and it was delicious as always.
