they. have. Ting. regular AND pink. i think i just died and went to Jamaican food heaven!

my brother brought me here for lunch one day as we are jamaican food fanatics. the Oxtail? oh man. i think i just died a little, it was so good. SO GOOOOOOD. it may be the best oxtail i've ever had! i only wish that the portions were a wee bit larger, meat-wise. Yum. I literally scraped my dish clean. I would have licked it, but licking styrofoam makes you look desperate. 

brother had the goat curry, which was delicious as well. 

My only request - more side options, please! Rice and peas is considered a side.

we will be back!
