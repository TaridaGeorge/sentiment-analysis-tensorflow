I don't even know what the hell I had because it was soooo dang good that I ate it all and went into a food-itis coma instantly.  Nah just kidding about the memory but totally serious about the food coma.  We checked this place out on an off day and it was still pretty populated.  Breakfast anytime CAN NOT BEAT THAT!!!  My bro and I got the the same platter which was the special of the day.  Linguisa with sourdough toast, hash browns, home fries, eggs, homemade preserves!!!  Everything was SPECTACULAR!  Like seriously!!!  It was a very homey and neighborhood feel to the restaurant with super excellent service.  Ninja water and coffee refills, great timing and check ups!  I think that it was part of our server as well but she was magnificent as well.  The overall experience was really enjoyable and I'll definately be back!
