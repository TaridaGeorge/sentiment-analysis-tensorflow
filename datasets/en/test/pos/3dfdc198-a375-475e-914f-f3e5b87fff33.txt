I moved to be close to this park and Talking Stick.  I can walk here in three minutes and I do, often.  My dog loves coming here and so do I.  Somehow, the Scottsdale park workers keep this place pristine despite, the tremendous amount of use the park gets

Great combination of walkers, bikers, fishermen, kids, and dogs.  If you do have a dog, please be sure to clean up his poop, ok?  There are plenty of bags and trash cans.  Lets keep it nice for everyone.
