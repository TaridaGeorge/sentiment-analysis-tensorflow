Yes. Yes, yes, yes. 

So fresh and flavorful and delicious and modern and healthy (mostly) and varied and spicy, sweet, crunchy... Seriously. So good. 

We sat at the bar. Always sit at the bar. 

It's not on the menu, but one of the bartenders (I wish I remembered his name!) makes a damn good spicy Bloody Mary. And it's not Sunday Brunch without a Bloody Mary. 

I had the Spicy Shrimp noodle something or other. It was awesome. The broth was spicy, there were a lot of shrimp and vegetables and the noodles were the perfect texture. 

I had the hardest time picking what I wanted because everything on the menu sounds and looks awesome. I can't wait to go back!
