WOW! I went to this place for breakfast with my boyfriend. He got the cinnamon french toast and I got the California Egg Benny. WOW! (Again). It was a biscuit, open face, with 2 poached eggs, avocado, bacon, spinach and tomato covered with hollandaise sauce. It came with potatoes on the side. I had to move my plate away from my boyfriend as he tried to eat his food and mine. Very scrumptious!! I would say it was by far one of the best breakfasts I have had. The french toast was sweet and soft and also very scrumptious.

The service was a delight, and the environment was very welcoming and comforting. I plan on going back there for lunch and of course breakfast.
