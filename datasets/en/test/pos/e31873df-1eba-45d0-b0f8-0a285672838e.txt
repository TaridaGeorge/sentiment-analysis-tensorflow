In general, all of Sakana's sushi are very fresh, and are well prepared. Especially the daily specials. If you do visit any of the 4 locations in town, try at least one of their specials. 

Now for the Superstition's location, there are only two chefs here, and are both very experienced and fun to talk to. it is VERY laid back compared to other locations, and is well suitable for just yourself at the bar. So if you've been to other Sakanas, then think of the same food, but much much laid back environment. 

If you are in this side of the town for any reason, visit them and say hi to Dai and Jun with one of their daily specials in front of you.
