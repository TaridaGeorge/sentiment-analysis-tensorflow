This place is the best lunch spot I have been to in a long time. The asparagus sandwich is legendary and the bread is always fresh and tasty. Only been there a few times but everything I have had was worth commenting about ( even the P.B. & J).

Just moved to a new location that is a bit out of the way but worth the journey

One of the finds close to the Arcadia area that is a good Friday work lunch and a place to introduce your friends to. Lots more to try and place worth doing a second review about.
