Very good customer service. I came in with a brake light out and asked for some help finding out which bulb I would need to replace it, and not only did the employee show me which one I would need, he came out and showed me how to replace it because I didn't know how to do it myself. This means a lot to me because I would have gone to the dealership otherwise and spent a fortune! Got this repair done for less than 10 dollars. Thanks pep boys! :)
