So ... Sekong By Night - Cambodian Cuisine. Located just east of 12th street on the north side of Indian School is just wonderful. We started with a Spring Roll and the flavor was fresh and complicated and made truly special by the powdered roasted rice. My entree, Bai Saikroko was by far the most uniquely delicious  sausage I've ever tasted. HOWEVER the Banana Tapioca was magical. While I was eating it I tried to figure more ways to use it. We also had Grilled Corn which I'm sure will cause cravings. Our server Yut is amazing. He's like an old friend. Eat at this restaurant - You won't be disappointed.
