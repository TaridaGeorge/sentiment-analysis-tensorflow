My wife and I have been to Orange Leaf a few times already and we love it. It's clean and all of their product is fresh. The owner is always there with a smile on his face and the kids he has working there are respectful and courteous. We like the variety of flavors and all of the toppings. The prices are really good too. We like to support our neighborhood businesses and plan on going back. Great place for kids parties too!
