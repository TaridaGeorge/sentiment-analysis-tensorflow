First visit was during Happy Hour on a Friday at the Scottsdale Quarter.  

Let me just say, best damn happy hour around and not just cause of the drink specials.  The sushi specials cannot be beat, dragon roll or las vegas roll for $6...that's just insanely good. 

The service is top notch, we did not go without anything.  I took a sip of my ice tea, she was there to replenish.  The whole experience was amazing.

The sushi cannot be beat.  Fresh and top quality and I know my Sushi.
