We had heard about them through a friend, and after diner out Thursday night we drove by B&L Pool Supplies and they were closed. The gentleman i spoke to was walking around inside and waived, pointed to his watch, shrugged his shoulders and walked into the dark of the back of the store. With that we called NorthWest Pool Supplies the next day and woman who answered the phone answered all my questions pleasantly and discovered that there prices were LOWER and bad a better selection with many choices.
Very knowledgeable on all types of pools and pool needs. Puts the Hillbillies at B&L pools to shame. we have seen the light and will drive 5 miles when B&L is less than 200 yards across 43rd Ave.
