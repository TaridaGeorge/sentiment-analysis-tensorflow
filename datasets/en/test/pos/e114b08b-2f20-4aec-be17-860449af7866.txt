This is my favorite steak house of all.  They have their parking lot in the back and you can enter the restaurant through the back door that leads you through the kitchen.  The cooks all stop to greet you before you are escorted in to the seating area which is covered in glass, mirrors and red velour.  The food here is just amazing.  The seafood is fresh and incredible.  Hard to imagine in a land locked state but I guess they fly it in on a regular basis.  This is *must* on any meat lover's list of destinations to visit if you are in Phoenix.
