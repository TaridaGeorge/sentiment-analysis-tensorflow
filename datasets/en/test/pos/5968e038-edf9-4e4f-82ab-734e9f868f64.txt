Amazing... a gluten-free bakery that's not 25miles from my house! I was so stoked when Ii heard GFC was opening a second location in the East Valley (notice it wasn't in the West Valley? That's because the west-side of Phoenix sucks and is gross), even more excited when I found out it's also a sandwich place. They serve an entire menu of amazing sandwiches and now they even serve breakfast and brunch! Awesome!!
