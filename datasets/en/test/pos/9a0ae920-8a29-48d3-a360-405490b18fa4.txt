1st time here last night (finally).

...and I like it - a mellow vibe, nice decor, friendly staff, nice patio, great drinks, chill music, and a stellar location (SW of Don and Charlie's - just look for the blue-light-pillars on the patio). Best to get here before 9pm on the weekends (if you want to sit down).

A friend brought me here, and I am thankful to discover another chill place to hang and drink in Old Town. It does however get real busy on the weekends.
 
***UPDATE*** FYI - This place is always slammed on Monday nights!!!
