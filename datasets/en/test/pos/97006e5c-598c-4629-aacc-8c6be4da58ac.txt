My husband and I go to Sakana at least 2 times per month and we LOVE IT!!!  This is our favorite place for a date night. The sushi is amazing. We love every single roll in the menu, and you cannot beat their prices!  We always order from their "Customer Appreciation Menu", which offers their most popular rolls, but with 5 pieces instead of 8...which is perfect because it gives us the opportunity to try different things.  Their drink specials are also good.  Our bill is usually about $40 and that includes 5-6 rolls, a small appetizer and DRINKS!  You simply cannot beat it.
The staff is nice and personable.  The service can be slow at times, but we love the atmosphere, so we don't mind waiting.
