I died and went to heaven the first day I ate there!  Please, be adventurous and try something different!  This place should be in every city in every state- in my opinion!  The menu is diverse as heck in regards to everything you can do with peanut butter!  I like how they specialize meals for kids and how they serve animal crackers as a side (whereas another place would give you fries or potato chips).  My heart seriously skips a beat when I see this place on the horizon!
