Perfect hotel for my conference travel needs.  Clean, new, great bars, close to other food options across the street, super friendly staff.  Great business traveler property.  The bed was SOOO comfortable.  Sometimes, Starwood beds can be too soft, but this was just right.  

Access to the convention center is so convenient.  Just out the door and down a block and a half.  Can't beat that in the heat!
