Eat at Joes! This place, owned by Joe from Joe's Barbecue and Joe's Farm Grill lives up to the hype. I'm very picky where I choose to eat (never a TGIFriday's, Applebee's, etc) so I got this recommendation a few months back from Yelp. Boy is this different for Gilbert. Imagine, food that is delivered in a modern eclectic manner, served fast and at a very reasonable price. That's what you'll get at Liberty Market. I've eaten there 5 or 6 times now as we live just down the street. I can say for certain 2 things: 1. You can't out dress Joe... he's always the most fashionable in the room. 2. You will not be disappointed if you appreciate great tasting food served in a vibrant atmosphere. Joe: Kudos for bringing somethig different to the EV!
