Outside of NYC street cart pita, this is the next best thing. Loaded with meat, free refills, and an excellent environment. Staff friendly - though i wish they would start a loyalty card - this is the ONLY place i have pita in AZ. 

Sub the fries for their rice in the combo meal. A little more expensive than other places, but you pay the premium for the better food.

PLUS, when you are done, you can walk it off at Lowes, across the street.
