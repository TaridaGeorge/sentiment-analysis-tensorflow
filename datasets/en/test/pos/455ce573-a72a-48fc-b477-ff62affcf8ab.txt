Hanny's is my new favorite restaurant/bar in Arizona.    Why it doesn't get five stars across the board is beyond me.   Great ambience, superbly designed, great pizzas, well made drinks, friendly bar-staff, open late, unique cocktail choices, and it's not that expensive!   I wish they had some better appetizers, but that will not stop me from dropping five stars on this place.    Pimm's Cup! Yes.
