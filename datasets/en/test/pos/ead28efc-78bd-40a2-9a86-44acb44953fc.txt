Every Saturday morning I head over to Brambly Hedge and spend time helping take care of the bunnies.  BH is an amazing rescue dedicated to the well being of over 100 domestic house rabbits.

As Jack said, rabbits make wonderful pets.  They are warm, soft, clever and full of love!  Of course, I have a few favorites, but every bunny here has their own unique character and would love to go home with you!

If you are interested in adopting, check out www.bhrabbitrescue.org/ and drop by one of their adoption events.  You'll get to meet a hand-picked group of lovable buns and talk to professionals about any questions you my have.
