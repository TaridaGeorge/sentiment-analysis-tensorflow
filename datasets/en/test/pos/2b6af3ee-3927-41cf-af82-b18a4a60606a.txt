What a great place! We were looking for a Dunkin Donuts, but I'm really glad we didn't find it. The two working behind the counter were super nice and welcoming to us. We came in for coffee, but as soon as we tried one of the samples up on the counter, we knew donuts were in our future. 

We tried the buttermilk stick, which was old school amazing, and the sour cream old fashioned, which we were given a sample of when the woman heard us talking about it. It was really nice of her to do that.

Our coffees were delicious as well. I will definitely be back when in Phoenix next time!
