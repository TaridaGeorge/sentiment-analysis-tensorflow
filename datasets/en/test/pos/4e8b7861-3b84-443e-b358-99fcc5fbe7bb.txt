So great to see soft serve cones with a choice of dip flavors in a mobile truck. The chocolate dip has a nice slight coffee/mocha flavor. 

And the gentleman operating the truck provided wonderful service. Truly a great addition to the valley's growing cadre of fine food cart trucks.

Kudos, Mister Softee!
