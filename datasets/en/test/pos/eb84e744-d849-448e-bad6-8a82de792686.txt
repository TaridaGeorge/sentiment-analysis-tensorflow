Our entire family has been going to Dr. Cohen for over 15 years and wouldn't think of trusting our eyes to anyone else. In addition to being a phenomenally gifted optometrist, Dr. Cohen is one of our favorite people. We continue to be impressed with his genuine interest in our kids and the way he relaxes everyone with his sense of humor and relaxed approach. Our kids love going to see him--what more can I say? He's just the best.
