This is the kind of Vegetarian food that makes me think I could never eat meat again.  Its delicious, flavorful and healthy.  I had the Balsamic Picnic Salad, a tasty combination of fresh dark greens, figs, strawberries and tart green apples.  We also had the Green Hummus and Artichoke Gratine.  Yum!  I can't wait to go back!  I think next time I will definitely have to try the Tsoynami...
