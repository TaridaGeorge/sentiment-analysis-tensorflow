I may be alone in this, but I think the above ratings, more than anything else, are about the way a restaurant makes you feel. Postino makes me feel like I've enjoyed an evening out, like I've gotten full on yummy food made from quality ingredients, and *almost* like I don't miss New York (my home for the past 6 years). The atmosphere is lively and the service has always been friendly and attentive. The pub board and bruschetta (esp prosciutto & fig) are delicious and cut into portions perfect for sharing. Go with friends, enjoy the wine list, don't over-order on the food, and Postino will make you feel good, too.
