Second visit to this place and I love it. I love wine bars. The environment of this place alone deserves 5 stars. The service gets better each time you go. The food is "Oh so tasty." Wine is spectacular and I love me some Pomegranate Martinis. If you haven't been to The Living Room, you better make a trip out there soon. The 27th of this month is their 1 Yr Anniversary and they are planning an all day Happy Hour. Relax and enjoy what this place has to offer.
