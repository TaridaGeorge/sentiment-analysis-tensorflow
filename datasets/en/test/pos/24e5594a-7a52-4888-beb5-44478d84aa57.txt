Finally got to try this place for lunch and had a great experience. It felt like we were at Chef Chris's house with the dining tables right next to the open kitchen. He was very welcoming and friendly. I think it's amazing he does everything! We had a large group of 8 which can be overwhelming for a small place, but he was very gracious and managed to accommodate us and we had the dishes served family style which worked out well. Definitely recommended. As the other reviews state, this place is a one man show, so be prepared to wait. But when you have great friends, great food, and a beautiful day, it's time well spent to slow down and savor the experience.
