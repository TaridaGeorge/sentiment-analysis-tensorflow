If I ever need a place to have a great coffee and work somewhere other than the hotel (I visit Phoenix often) or the office, this is a great place that is fun with good coffee, free wi-fi, and surrounded by a pleasant crowd which is a great cross-section.

Prices are reasonable, coffee and snacks are fabulous, and the staff seems generally happy to help you out, happy to be there, and enjoy what they're going it.  Even though the music is a bit loud to be "background" music, it's quite relaxing just when that's what's needed....especially on a sunny afternoon.

PS...if you ever want to smell what heaven smells like, walk down the back hallway.  The baked goods smell is AMAZING.
