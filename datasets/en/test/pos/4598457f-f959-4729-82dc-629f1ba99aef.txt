Not all Filibertos in Phx were created equal.  This review is for the Filibertos on SW corner of Williams Field & Val Vista (near Kohls).

Beans here are always cooked right (not overcooked & burnt tasting or under cooked like I've had at other locations).  

This location is leaps and bounds better than the other locations around the valley.
