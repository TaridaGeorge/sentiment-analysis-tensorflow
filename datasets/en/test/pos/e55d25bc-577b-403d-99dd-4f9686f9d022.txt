Love my newTRADER JOE's! Moved to Scottsdale late last year and one of the best amenities is that Trader Joe's is practically across the street!!!! Shop here every week, love the people, the store and the products. I have gotten back to cooking and loving planning my meals with the wonderful offerings at Trader Joes. Strolling around sipping a cup of the coffee sampler of the day, tasting new ideas and products and recipe ideas is my idea of a relaxing grocery shopping experience. My little guy loves it too! The check out staff are so friendly and helpful. Love u Trader Joe's, Scottsdale/PV!
