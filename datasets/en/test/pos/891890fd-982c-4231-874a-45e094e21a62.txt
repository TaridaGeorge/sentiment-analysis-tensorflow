A classic old brick building, within a stone's throw of the basketball game, and a home run away from Chase Field. Filled with rock memorabilia, sports memorabilia, HD TVs and five giant projection screens! Top this off with giant portions of good old fashioned man food. Parking, albeit pay, in the back.
