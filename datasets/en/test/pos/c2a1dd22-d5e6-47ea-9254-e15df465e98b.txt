It's always nice, but rare, for your money to actually go to a worthy cause when you're shopping. The Arizona Humane Society Thrift store is one of the exceptions.  Here, you can spend your hard-earned dollars and feel great about it because it's all going to help homeless animals in one way or another.

Plus, it's a pretty good thrift store filled with books, clothes, furniture, knick-knacks and tons of other items.  And the prices are very low, so you'll end up spending way less than you would if you were to shop somewhere else. 

Next time you feel like shopping, add this thrift store to your list and help out the animals of AZ!
