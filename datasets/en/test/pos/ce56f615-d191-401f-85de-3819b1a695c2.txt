I was leery of trying a Peruvian restaurant in Arizona.  I still remember how much I enjoyed the food when traveling down there a couple of years ago and did not want to be disappointed.  Believe me, we were impressed.  

We had an appetizer and then a couple of dishes, which we shared to a certain extent.  My ceviche mixto was terrific.  

The service was extremely helpful.  I will definitely go back.
