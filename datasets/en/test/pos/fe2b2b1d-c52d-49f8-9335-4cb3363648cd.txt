Part of my romantic Valentines Day getaway with my girlfriend was a stop here.  A nice lesiurely stroll, watching the koi fish swim in the pond for a good 45 minutes.  Taking in the quiet and just relaxing.

The only thing that spoiled it was incessant noise from the people at the public park next door.  Without that, it would have been completely tranquil.

I can't blame the park for the noise from its neighbors, so it still gets 5 stars from me.

A traditional rock garden will be installed soon as well, I can't wait to see how it turns out!
