Never met a cupcake I didn't like.  And sadly that's the truth.  I can find something positive in even the worst cupcake.  Take Hostess for instance.  I like to eat my icing last.  Hostess is great for that since it's easy to just peel it off the top, even if you then want to throw it away.

Now finding the Mr. Right of cupcakes is a little more difficult.  But then I met Butter & Me.  And the "Me" is referring to me.  After having the opportunity to taste these fine confections at many a Yelp event I was enamored.  But after having a full-sized model at Old Town Farmer's Market (chocolate with tangerine buttercream), I can say "DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO GET ONE OF THESE BAD BOYS."
