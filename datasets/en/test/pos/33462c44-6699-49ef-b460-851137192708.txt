Since it's the middle of the month I payed only $4 for this month for the unlimited car wash package. With all the stuff you get like Scented Soaps, Soft Foam Scrubs, Spot Free Rinse, Rim & Tire Scrub, Clear Coat Protection, Triple Foam Polish, Undercarriage Power Wash, Turtle Ice Wax/ Paint Protectant, Rime & Tire Cleaner, Choice of Air Freshner, Tire Shine for $20 it's well worth it.
