This is just about a weekly stop for me now, and I can't see any good reason not to give them 5 stars.
The food is always fresh, always a generous portion, and always made quickly.  I'm always pleased with the HUGE pieces of meat they have in their dishes and the freshness of their vegetables.  Aside from that one disappointing sweet and sour pork order, I've gotten nothing but gems from Siu Wok.  Best in the area.
