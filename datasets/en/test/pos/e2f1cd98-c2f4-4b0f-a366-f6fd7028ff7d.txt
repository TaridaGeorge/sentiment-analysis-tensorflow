If you didn't give Red Devil 5 stars, something must be wrong! Red Devil is by far the best pizza and wings hands down! Gotta love it, i live in California now and I wish there was a spot close to my house with wings and pizza like Red Devil. 

Just ate here this week since I was visiting Arizona, I came home a happy camper! :D
