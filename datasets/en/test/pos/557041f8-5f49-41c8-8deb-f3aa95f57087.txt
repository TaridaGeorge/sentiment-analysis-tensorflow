I've been here a couple of times and just haven't had the chance to review it.

I always thought the food was great. I normally get the carne asada burrito and it is definitely good. My girlfriend gets two carne asada tacos and she loves it! Everything comes out nice and hot. The beef is seasoned well and the dish itself, at least for the burrito, looks very appetizing (the tacos come out wrapped in foil). The service is decent and not great because they are usually very crowded. The margarita is apparently very strong. I only took a sip of my girlfriend's just to try it and thought $5 was well worth the price. She was buzzing by the end of the night even though she ate.

I have yet to try their other dishes and drinks but I will be back, that's for sure!
