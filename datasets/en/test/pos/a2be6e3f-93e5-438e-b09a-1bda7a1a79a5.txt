This place is a breath of fresh air. I was initially nervous, because the concept looked way too healthy to have a chance of tasting good. Boy was I wrong. I've been back three times now, and each time the food has been excellent.

My favorites include the cucumber water, spicy mango salad, sweet potatoe fries, and seared ahi.

The staff is very friendly, and service is right on. Look for me there because I'm sure to be a frequent patron!
