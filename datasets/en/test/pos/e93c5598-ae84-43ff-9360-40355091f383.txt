If you don't like spice or fantastic flavors or high quality food then don't go here. ;)

This is not the standard Thai food, it is far better. One of my favorite places to eat for dinner.

All the dishes are very good to superb. Many are traditional family recipes of the owner's mom and you will not find them ANYWHERE ELSE.

The wine list is nice (ask about wines not on the list) and the prices are very reasonable.

Favorite items...

Steamed Muscles appetizer
- the broth has more flavor and aroma then you will find in 99% of the food you'll ever eat anywhere

Musman Shortrib entree
- SAVORY, you'll want to lick the plate!

Coconut ice cream dessert
- home made creaminess... I cannot get enough!
