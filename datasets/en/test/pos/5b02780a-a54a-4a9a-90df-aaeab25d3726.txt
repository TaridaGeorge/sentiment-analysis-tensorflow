Love this place I have been coming here for years and the food has always been fantastic!!  It is small and kinda tucked away in the Scottsdale Civic Center next to a wig shop and The Jewel of the Crown Indian cuisine. They do get crowded for breakfast, and lunch as any good restaurant does.They have great coffee drinks, cocktails, and craft beers. Personal Favs: green chili cheddar burger nom nom nom, garlic mushroom omelet, and the prosciutto melt. Salivating just thinking about it!
