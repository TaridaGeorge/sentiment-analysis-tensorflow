I have been to Pretty Nails several times and have always had a great experience. All the staff I have encountered are friendly and professional, but most importantly, this salon is clean!! They use disposable pedicure liners and open a clean set of tools for me every time. I have never had a bad manicure or pedicure here. For those of you who are gel polish lovers like I am.... I recently found out they have a product called Perfect Match... gel nail polish with a matching laquer polish for your pedicure.
