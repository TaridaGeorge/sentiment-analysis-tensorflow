OMG! So excited there is a Total Wine at Scottsdale and Shea! You can't beat their prices...anywhere! Bev Who? 
The staff here actually know what they are talking about/selling and everyone I encountered was so friendly. The selection of booze, beer, and wine is outstanding. Wine tastings, multiple cashiers open, and a cigar section (but don't smoke, I don't want to see you on my floor as a patient)! So excited for it to be around the corner!!!!!!!
