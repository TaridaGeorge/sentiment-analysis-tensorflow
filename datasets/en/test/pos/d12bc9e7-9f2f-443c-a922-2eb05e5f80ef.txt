Sassy Glasses rocks- seriously! Stopped by about a week ago to check out their selection of frames and was totally blown away! They have a very large collection of frames and styles that you will not find elsewhere. I found an absolutely gorgeous pair of glasses and they were ready in about a week, which was sooner than expected! The staff is totally friendly and I have a feeling that this will be the only place where I purchase my eyewear from now on. I don't think that they take insurance but hey, if you want originality you're going to pay a little.
