My husband & I went to Ocean Club on Saturday to celebrate my new job (yay!). If only we could afford to celebrate more at such an elaborate restaurant!

I love a good bread basket & this one did not disappoint. We started with oysters which were fabulous (you get 6). For my entree I ordered the sea bass & Ryan ordered the scallops as well as a side of garlic mashed potatoes. The portions were more than generous & everything was cooked perfectly. It was so much food that we didn't have room for dessert, so the warm butter cake will have to wait til next time.

Between the topnotch service & fabulous food, you have to expect a hefty bill. We'll probably only be so lucky to go once in a blue moon, so it was worth every penny!
