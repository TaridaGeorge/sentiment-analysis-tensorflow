This is my go to Thai place so far on the west side. Cute little place inside, people are always friendly, and the food is delicious!

Please don't go here looking for Chinese food... There have been a couple times I've overheard people asking them for items you'd see at a Chinese food place - I'm sure they get it all the time and surprisingly they were nice about recommending dishes. 

The food is super authentic and so far I've liked everything I ordered. The pork fried rice never disappoints and the larb gai was really good too. Even better is that the bill never hurts my wallet and I usually walk out with my extras I couldn't finish.
