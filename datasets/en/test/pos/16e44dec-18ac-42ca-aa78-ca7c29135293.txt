I can't help but love this place. I've been going here since, quite literally, the day the opened. I move further away and I keep coming back.

The staff is friendly, the food is delicious, the beer selection constantly rotates to new and interesting beers... and this is basically the de-facto hangout for climbers and cyclists! Really can't go wrong with this place.
