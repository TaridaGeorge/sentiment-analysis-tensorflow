5 ENTHUSIASTIC STARS

This is a large, well maintained botanical garden, teeming with birdlife and abundant in blooming cacti, succulents & other flowers.

Even though it can be HOT, it is very easy to spend half a day here, as we did, wandering the trails. If you need a break, there is a patio cafe where you can get a cool one.

This place is a true delight and a great asset for Phoenix.
