Superb service. Great value. Wonderful sandwiches! 

We bought the most expensive sandwich on the menu and my wife and I had to split it because it was so big. I think the whole dinner including drinks was like $12.00 or something. 

We loved the food. The French bread is so good it reminded me of my time in Louisiana. 

Everybody was friendly and helpful. 

LOVE LOVE LOVE!
