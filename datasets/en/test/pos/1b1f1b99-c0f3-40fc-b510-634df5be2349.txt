This is the best ice cream shop in the Western United States. This is one of those you are an idiot if you don't go there. For all lactose intolerant people (including myself) they have fantastic sorbets available like Basil Lime. Fav ice cream: roquefort blue cheese and dates (ok, I took some tums for it and it was worth it).

Do note that they change their flavors around often so it may be different when you go. 

Another note, this is the same place that was featured recently in Bon Appetit.
