"tanked fish is now closed due to economic recession."

my excitement for cheap delicious sushi and guppy bowl goodness was deflated into a shriveling sack of sadness on this tuesday evening.

so in honor of tanked's unbeatable happy hour, sweet atmosphere, and splendid sushi, i shall say my final words and wave goodbye solemnly as yet another incredible phoenix restaurant goes under the table due to poor economic conditions caused by politicians running amuck and unchecked in washington. i've had enough guppy bowls from you to fill an aquarium. not to mention fish to fill it with.

may you and your delicious bowls of blue alcoholic wonderousness (i never knew quite what was in them) rest in peace.
