I love the brushes and many of the eyeshadows. The makeup dries too hard and emphasizes facial lines but the other products very nice. I just wish they could do the makeover quickers so you dont have to sit there and get a sales pitch. I like to pop in, get some ideas for new eyeshadow combo's and get out to another store, I dont want to pitch a tent and camp out in there for an hour. I love the blonde guy who works at FS location, he is awesome with color choices. He is quick too but he is usually pretty busy and popular.
