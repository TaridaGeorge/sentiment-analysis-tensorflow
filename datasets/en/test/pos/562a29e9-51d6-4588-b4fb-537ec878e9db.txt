Real fruit in mango boba, not just powders - simply cannot be beaten.

The reason that I am updating is that they expanded the kitchen, remodeled, tripled the size of their menu and now include Vietnamese favorites like pho, bun and broken rice dishes in addition to the excellent bahn mi (sandwiches) and the best boba drinks in town.

Pho was excellent today - the broth was full of flavor before my thai basil, culantro, jalapeno, sriracha and lime juice assault and good to the last slurp.

Menu is not quite a full Vietnamese restaurant menu - but there's clearly enough for several trips a month. Place is clean, food is good, service is great, women are beautiful. I know what heaven is like now.

Did I mention how much I love their mango boba?
