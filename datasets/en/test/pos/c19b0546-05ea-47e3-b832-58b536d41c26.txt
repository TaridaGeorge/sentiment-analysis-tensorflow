I have fantasized about the idea of chicken and waffles for quite some time now, and Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles was all that I hoped for and more!  The chicken and waffles, cornbread, sweet potatoes, mac 'n cheese, grits and kool-aid were amazing! The restaurant itself is really cute too.  Very creative decor.  Such a fun, delicious dinner experience!
