BYOB and great food. sweet combo even if the wait is sometimes/often 40 plus min. the noodle dishes while okay, the sushi never disappoints and the Agadashi Tofu, Gyoza, Ika Kara Age and Hana salad are reliable favorites. Hana An Mitsu dessert- Aloe vera accompanied by mandarin oranges, blueberries & red bean paste w/a cherry on top, rocks my world! outstanding! a healthy and guilt-free pleasure. just go.
