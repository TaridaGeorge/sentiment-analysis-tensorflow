Being a vegetarian, I am always on the lookout for a good place and Abdeen has some of the freshest, best falafels near my school. They are divine. Combine that with super friendly service and affordable, graduate school friendly rates, you know that you've got yourself a deal. 

The falafel with potatoes sandwich is my fav!!
