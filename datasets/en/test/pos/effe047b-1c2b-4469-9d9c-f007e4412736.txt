OK I live in Hawaii and ever other restaurant is a Japanese restaurant but it came to coming to Litch Frickin Field Park to find Takamatsu. Great lunch specials, great service and great AC. I had the bulgogi lunch special for a whopping $7 that included salad, soup and a huge portion of bulgogi on rice. My brother had the tempura lunch special which was HUGE for about $7. I don't know how they make any money here. The waitresses are the best and not hard on the eyes.
