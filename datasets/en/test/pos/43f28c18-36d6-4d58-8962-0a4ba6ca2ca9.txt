Joey's is Da Bomb! 

I was in Cave Creek earlier this week for a Yoga Class and noticed Joey's of Chicago in the same plaza. Having liked the food at their Happy Valley location we had to give this one a try too!

We ordered hot dogs with everything, fries and onion rings. Everything was great and satisfied that craving we get once in a while for a good Chicago-style hot dog. 

So if you're from Chicago or like Chicago-style dogs Joey's is the place.
