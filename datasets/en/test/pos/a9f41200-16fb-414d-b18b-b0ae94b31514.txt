What a nice Dairy Queen!  The service was very friendly, and the employees genuinely smiled and offered to help immediately as we entered the store.  The walls are lined with posters of special deals at that location, and it appears that this store is very active in the local community by the posted awards and certificates of appreciation.

As for the ice cream, the menu was extensive and our orders were ready almost immediately.  Very yummy treats...we got a strawberry chocolate blizzard, a butterfinger blizzard, and a chocolate mint oreo blizzard.

The only complaint that I have is that the music was a bit loud, but that's just a matter of taste.  Everything else was wonderful, and I definitely will be back.
