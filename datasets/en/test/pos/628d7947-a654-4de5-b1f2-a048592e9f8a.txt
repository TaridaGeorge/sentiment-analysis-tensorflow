After reading the reviews I had to check this place out. The first hour and a half was spent half expecting a massive bar tab as the place seemed too good to be true.  Half dressed young ladies, pool, darts, pinball, golden tee, big game hunter and the WII.  Place is clean and people are friendly...oh and the drinks are cheap.  Will repeat.
