Fixed menu this month featured Indian food. Food was innovative and excellent. 4 courses for $35, this is a great deal. My wife and I decided we should come once a month on Sunday evenings. Rather quiet, but it has nice decor. Nice change from other restaurants that felt like too much same-same for food.
