The facility is incredibly clean, the staff is friendly...and I am referring to everyone I came across. A quick hello and a smile is the norm at the Wigwam. The Room was large and comfortable. The bed is incredible....big and fluffy....I slept like a baby!

The only negative thing was that they charge for everything. Like WiFi access and the use of computers in the Business Center. That became annoying. 

The food was impeccable and the wait staff was very attentive. Check out the pool and especially the Water Slide. Great location for a Business Meeting and very Family oriented.
