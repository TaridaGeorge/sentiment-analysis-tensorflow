SO SO SO MUCH FUN! I've started going to this location with a couple of girls from work starting around the holidays and now i cant imagine not sharing this experience with everyone I know. . I wouldn't recommend biting off more than you can chew on your first experience just for the sake of time and frustration level, start with something small and easy, you'll be hooked after that and can start more advanced projected! A+++ Recommended! !
