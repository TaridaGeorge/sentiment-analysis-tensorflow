Love the atmosphere of this place! Spectacular interior designs! Great concept to combine a movie theater, bowling alley, snack bars and restaurant. It's like a gigantic party in here! Great choice in music as well. Offers free wifi! 

Upstairs is 21+, love how there's security to keep things under control. The staff are super friendly and attentive to your needs.
