I have always been in love with Chick-Fil-A and still am. I was first hooked on them in the shopping malls, then they appeared on campus at ASU. Seems to now found my home in Avondale! 

My fave is the combo #1 with no pickle. I am not sure what spices they put in recipe, but it is addicting. All the employees are so happy to work there.  Love you Chick-Fil-A!
