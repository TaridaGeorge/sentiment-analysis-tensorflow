This is hands down the very best pizza place in Phoenix. As a former Chicagoan, I know Chicago style pizza, and Spinato's is CHICAGO STYLE. They offer excellent service, fast and friendly waiters and waitresses (can you still say that or are they really just waitpeople now?) The food is great -- all of their offerings. The atmosphere is homey, and family oriented. Their location on Bell and 16th is small -- so big parties plan ahead (they will put tables together for you). They do have a nice outdoor area, but it gets hot in the summer, and sometimes smoke drifts in from patrons at neighboring businesses. Overall, excellent food, good prices, and real Chicago Style pizza. Two thumbs up!
