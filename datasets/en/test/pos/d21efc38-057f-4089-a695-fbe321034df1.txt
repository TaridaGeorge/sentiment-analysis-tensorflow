Stopped in here tonight at the recommendation of fellow Yelpers. This place did not disappoint. It was very clean, unlike some Vietnamese spots I have been to, and the staff was prompt, attentive and friendly. My friend and I both ordered Pho. I had the #9 and it was awesome. The broth was full of flavor and delicious. We also shared an order of the fried rice. Which was wonderful as well. It was non-greasy and full of goodies. I am definitely a fan and will be returning.
