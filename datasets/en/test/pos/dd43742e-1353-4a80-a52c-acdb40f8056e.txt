As good as it gets in the Valley. Has to be the best and freshest sushi I have had here. Three of us went in after 9pm on a Friday night. The best part about rolling in late was the reverse happy hour. Nice list of rolls, appetizers and beverages at happy hour prices. 
We picked up an app and a couple rolls off the menu. We also ordered a small sashimi sampler and a plate of yellow fin tataki with chile. I am still daydreaming about the freshness and the clean flavors of the sashimi and tataki. 

The restaurant is in a shopping center but it offered ample parking. The place was packed when we arrived but we didn't wait long to get a table (about 5 minutes).
