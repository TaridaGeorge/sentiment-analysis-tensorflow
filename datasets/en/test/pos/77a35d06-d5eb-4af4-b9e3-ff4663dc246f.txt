The tableside guacamole is delicious but pricey at 15 dollars. The salads are crisp and good. The 'tickled pink' (or something like that) cosmopolitan is delicious. The outdoor patio area is beautiful and comfortable. I would have happily sat back and had a few more drinks enjoying the beautiful day on the patio. We will return for chips and guacamole and pink cosmos! I love the Camelback Inn ambiance so I might be sort of biased.
