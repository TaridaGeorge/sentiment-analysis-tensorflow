This is my go to place for groceries and toiletries. I'll check Safeway to see if they got any WOW SALES but usually Safeway is just riDICulous. I walk into Fry's and every aisle I walk down I have an employee asking how I am doing and If i need help. Sometimes the customers get a little to friendly too...yesterday some dude thought he knew me from some rehab center. I congratulated him and went on my way.  Not something you wanna hear while your looking through Rib-eyes in a crowded supermarket. The Sushi chefs are unappreciated, a lot of people cringe when i tell them i eat fry's sushi. They are really nice, I always buy sushi when they are there because they make my special order of Inari and spicy tuna rolls. Plus the speedy checkout is a plus.
