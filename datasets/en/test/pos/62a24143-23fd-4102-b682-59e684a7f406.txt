This place is awesome. 

For the guy who said you should go to Safeway instead for a sandwich, well, I'm guessing he probably thinks a steak at Applebees rivals a steak at City Hall. 

If you like turkey with mayo and mustard, you can't get that here. If you like to try new things with fresh ingredients, you might want to give this a try. Yes during the summer it is hot and they only have outdoor seating, but how about taking it to go and eating in your car? I've done in many times. 

As I say in my Pizzeria Bianco review, I now live in NYC but will take extended layovers in Phoenix gladly to stop at these two places. I have also scheduled meetings around these places being open! It's THAT good!
