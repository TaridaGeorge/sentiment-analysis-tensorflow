I went to this place for lunch, and it was great.

I had the pork belly buns. If you have ever had Asian style pork buns before, they use that same bun dough and make a little pancake out of it and put a piece of luscious pork belly in it with just a touch of a tangy Asian style sauce and a thinly sliced, homemade pickle. Soo good. I want these again. For every meal. =P

I also had the panko crusted soft shell crab sandwich. It was good. They obviously bake their own bread, which is nice. Maybe ask for a little extra sauce next time I order it, but yes, yummy.

I am looking forward to going for dinner. The dinner menu looks awesome as well.
