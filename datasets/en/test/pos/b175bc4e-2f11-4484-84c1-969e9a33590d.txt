I have been eating at khai hoan restaurant for over 3 years and it is by far the best pho in the Tempe area. Sonny, the head man over there, makes you feel more than welcome and comfortable.  Every bowl of pho is always consistently amazing in taste and delivered to your table in less than 5 minutes 9 times out of 10. Top notch crab rangoons! Enjoyable lunch cafe style dining. Don't forget to sauce it up baby! (m-swiss style)
