Delux rocks!! I always get the grilled cheese and it is delicous!! sooo good. I order take out pretty much every week from Delux, and my bf always gets the 'delux burger' it is soo good too. The mixed fries are so tasty. Also they don't close at 9 pm like most other restaurants! So if you are feeling like a late night snack definitly try this place...
