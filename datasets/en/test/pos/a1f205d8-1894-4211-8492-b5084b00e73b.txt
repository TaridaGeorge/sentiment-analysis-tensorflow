Sweet Pea is quite the find!  Danielle, the chef/owner, couldn't be nicer, often throwing in little extra goodies to try in my frequent visits.  You can tell how much she loves what she does and the care she puts into her creations.  Her PB&J cookies are very unique, the apricot-walnut cookies are great, and her macaroons are to-die-for!  Some of the cupcakes are better than others, but I especially enjoy the carrot-cake/olive oil ones.  Also, both her lemon and Margarita tarts are terrific!  Her cakes look beautiful - I plan on getting one made for my birthday.  This is an wonderful business in an adorable shop Downtown that the community should be very pleased and proud to have!
