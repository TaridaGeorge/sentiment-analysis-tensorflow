Better than Roscoe's House of Chicken and Waffles. #8 The Betty Boop which comes with a waffle and a breast of chicken is my absolute favorite. How can you go wrong?

Savory waffle, sweet syrup and even more moist chicken. Yum Yum Yum! Great service and delicious mac n' cheese... my new sinful pleasure. 

I take all my favorites to this place for breakfast, what a treat, a down-home good food get down in the heart of Scottsdale
