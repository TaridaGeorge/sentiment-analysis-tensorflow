Every Saturday my father would take me here when I was a kid and I would always order the same meal, cheeseburger, side of cheese fries, and a medium coke. As an adult this order has never changed. I highly recomend this place to anyone who wants to indulge in a good burger. My one regret so far is I still have yet to try a slider from here. Also the cheese fries are amazing! Enjoy.
