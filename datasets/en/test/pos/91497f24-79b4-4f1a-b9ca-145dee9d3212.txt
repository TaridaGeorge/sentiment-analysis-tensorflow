I am all about supporting great local businesses and Lo-Fi didn't disappoint!!! Love when the owner is working and you see him everytime, Sam is a great guy and easy to talk to. Serves I think the best coffee in town. Very cool decor, very relaxing. We love stopping in when we are in the downtown Mesa area and even when we are heading in a  different direction. I am telling you, the Coffee is worth it. Good quality stuff!!!! The prices are very reasonable, I was surprised for such a great cup of coffee.  Keep up the GREAT WORK SAM!!!!
