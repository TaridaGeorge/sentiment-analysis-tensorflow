I really enjoyed this movie Theater and would defiantly recommend this for Couples if you have kids keep them at home lol............. This will defiantly be Me and my husbands favorite date night spot. this was our first time at this AMC and I really enjoyed it. the seats were comfortable the server was very polite and prompt on getting our order and refills also the crab dip is very tasty. and I would recommend the fried shrimp it was also very tasty. Great date night would highly recommend this movie Theater to anyone.
