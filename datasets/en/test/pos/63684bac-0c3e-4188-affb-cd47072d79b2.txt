Great little neighborhood bistro.

Food.  People.  Prices.  Location.  Service.

The only thing I can grade it down for is the concrete floor -- makes it a little LOUD at times.  But, the place is terrific!

UPDATE:  Still loud AND still *terrific*.

I don't know what toni f.'s problem is with Maizie's -- too bad she(?) was disappointed.  I do know what some of mark f.'s problem is -- he writes ungrammatically, & in my view  judgmentally and pretentiously.  Too bad he was disappointed.  

I can only speak for myself -- when I'm in Beverly Hills, I sometimes eat at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel looking out the window and down/up rodeo Blvd.  You can read my other reviews here.  I know good food.  I know good service.  IMHO, Maizie's has both.
