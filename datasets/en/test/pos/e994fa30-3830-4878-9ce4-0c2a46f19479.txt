We went here for dinner last night (Saturday). Awesome experience all around!

Everything from the valet parking ($3), to the inside decor and bar, and the incredible outdoor patio (where we ate) was perfect. The outdoor patio has an awesome fireplace and a boccie court! Great seating arrangements for dining or drinking.

The menu is very low key and affordable, mostly consisting of salads and sandwiches. We started with the hummus plate for an appetizer - it was served with two kinds of hummus and chopped cucumber and tomato. My Pastrami on Pumpernickel with coleslaw was yummy, and her chopped chicken salad / wrap combo hit the spot.

The cocktails looked great and the crowd is amazing.
