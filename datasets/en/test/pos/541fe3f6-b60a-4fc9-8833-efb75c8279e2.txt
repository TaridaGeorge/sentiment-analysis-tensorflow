I recently relocated and finding a local coffee shop was a priority for me.  Over the last several months, Steve has suggested variations on my standard drink - all of which have been amazing!  Its refreshing to be in a place that really knows coffee and how to bring out its best qualities.

I just got back from vacation and couldn't wait to get my cup of coffee this morning - none of the coffee shops during vacation held a candle to the flavor of the coffee at Steve's Espresso.
