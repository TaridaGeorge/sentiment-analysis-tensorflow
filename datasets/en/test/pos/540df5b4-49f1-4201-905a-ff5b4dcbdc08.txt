Their Crispy Pla-aka Fish Candy was delicious. Just the right Crispiness and every bite was heaven.  Fresh summer rolls and Thai ice tea just made the meal escalate to beyond any Thai food I've had.  Service was busy but tried hard to stay on point with our table.  Would come here for the fish over and over again.
