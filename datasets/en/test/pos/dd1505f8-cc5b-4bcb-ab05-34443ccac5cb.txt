Oh my heavens!!! I'm a FAN of this place and here's the reasons why.

1. Simply DELICIOUS (Pancit Bihon)
2. Super, Super and more SUPER Friendly staff (Karen and her precious mom, I love her already)
3. Exceptionally clean eating environment.

I will most definitely come back here, I feel like family.  Love it.....
Congratulations in the Grand Opening of Karey's Kitchen!!! Yay!
