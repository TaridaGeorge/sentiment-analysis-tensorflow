I have been receiving my dental work from Dr. Woods since I was a wee teenager. I used to go to office on 19th and Northern before he moved to his new location. I lived in Oregon for about 5 years and just now have been able to come back to my home dentist.

3 things:
1-Great chair side manners
2-Experienced
3-Wonderful front house.

I have been very busy with certain priorities that requires a flexible schedule . I rescheduled several times and Jill was very kind in every way. It was nice.

I strongly recommend them.
