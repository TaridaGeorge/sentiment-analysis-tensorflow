I would trust the team at SAA with any car and have trusted them with our cars - both old and new - since I moved to Arizona in 1998 as a single mom and someone recommended them to me. Moon, Nick and the entire team of mechanics are great at explaining to non-mechanical me what is a safety issue and what is a keep-an-eye-on-it issue.  I've since remarried, added kids, cars and SAA is still there - quick, honest and helpful.
