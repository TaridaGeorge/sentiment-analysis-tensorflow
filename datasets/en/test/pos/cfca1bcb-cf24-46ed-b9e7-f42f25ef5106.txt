LOVE Bliss- from the products to the treatments, I love it all!!  The fabulous facial with the microderm add-on is my favorite but everything is pretty amazing to be honest.  The Triple Oxygen + C mask is a great thing to have at home for treating your skin when you can't get in for the real thing.  Also, who could not love throwing brownies back while you wait? :) YUM!
