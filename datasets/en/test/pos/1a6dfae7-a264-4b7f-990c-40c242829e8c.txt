Bring on the hype, because this place lives up to it all! What a fun, casual, delicious place. I had a double scoop of Salted Butter Caramel and Almond Buttercrunch. What amazing fresh flavors! I couldn't get enough. My wife had the Maple Pecan and she enjoyed the fresh made ice cream as well. Sweet Republic certainly has done their homework. They have created a frozen goodness in enough flavors to make everyone smile.
