Since I only have written one review thus far (it was negative) figured a little YIN & YANG was in order.   Well.....I can not say enough of how fond I am of this little salon off Dysart.  I have thick coarse dark hair and normally when I would go to a new salon and ask for highlights there would be a big SHRIEKKKK of NOOOOOO....."your hair is too dry and it will break," not understanding that I have really STRONG hair!!!  I've been a very happy customer for over 4 years, with perfectly "bright" highlights, because brassy is not SASSY!!! These girls do a good job of listening to their clients!!! Can't go wrong w/ Helia or Ally!! Prices are reasonable, but more importantly the staff is professional and very friendly.  Looooooove Vega Salon!!!!
