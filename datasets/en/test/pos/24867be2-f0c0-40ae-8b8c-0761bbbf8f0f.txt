I have not been much of a Dillards shopper until lately.
 I have to say so far I am very happy here. Came in again the other day while we were at Chandler Mall. It was a crazy busy day inside the mall.
The staff was still helpful and friendly.  One girl in housewares even got us a special box and held it for us until we were ready to leave the mall. That is really above and beyond.
The store is clean ,well lit, and bathrooms are also clean and well matained.
The selection in the strore is very nice, very high end these days.
Parking was a bit outragous, but it is the month of Christmas.
