We went to LGO with my inlaws & husband for our anniversary dinner. 
We had 3 pizzas- corn, veggie, and a veggie with chillies on it. All 3 were great, we actually had a discussion to determine which one was better. 
All of us are looking forward to going soon, my inlaws live in Glendale & want to come and pick up pizza from LGO now!
