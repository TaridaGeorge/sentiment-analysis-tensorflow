How have I not reviewed this place yet?!  

The Cornish Pasty Co. is incredible.  

I am from So Cal and it has become my tradition that I visit it twice every time I am in Phoenix - when I first arrive and then again when I am on my way to the airport.

The pastys are so good the boyfriend and I have devised a way for me to transport the partially cooked pasties by plane to Southern California so I will have extra stock when I get home :-)

The is hands down my favorite place I have ever eaten at.  EVER.  That says a lot.
