I went tonight alone for dinner.  I stayed next door at the Hilton and waled over.  I had a Salad with a good italian dressing.  They brought Garlic Bread.  I  had a Soda and water.  Each beverage was filled as needed.  My main course was Eggplant and Pasta. It was very good.  Owner came over and said hello.  They brought me a shot of Sambuca after dinner.  All for $18 dollars...a great value.
