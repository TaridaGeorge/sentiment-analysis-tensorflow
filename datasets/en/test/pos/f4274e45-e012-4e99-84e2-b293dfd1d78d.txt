Have been to Hana a handful of times and continue to be impressed. It is the freshest sushi I have had in Phoenix. It tends to fall on the pricier side, but the quality is absolutely worth it. It's also a BYOB, which is great. The servers are attentive and efficient, and can provide lots of information and suggestions. Don't forget to check out the specials board behind the sushi bar for some interesting choices. 

The menu seems a bit more traditional, but exquisitely executed. The pickled wasabi is fantastic. I recommend using it with any sashimi. This is not a venue where you need to drench anything in soy sauce and wasabi. The noodle dishes are delicious as well. 

And don't miss out on dessert. They have selections from Sweet Republic in Scottsdale that are brilliant.
