Love this place - one of my favorite places to run, a great place to walk the dog, check out nature with the kids, a walk at dusk with the wife.  We have seen some amazing wildlife from brightly colored love birds to coyotes.  The rentable camp sights are clean and and designed in a way that gives you a real desert camping experience, only a quarter mile from the nearest Walgreens :-). Great date place, family fun place, and a retreat from city life right in the middle of the city.
