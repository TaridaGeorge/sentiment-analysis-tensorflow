after dealing with Southern California Edison in Los Angeles, i'm completely in super platonic love with SRP. not only are the bills ridiculously easy to understand, their online services kick ass. its so easy to pay your bill online, keep track of your usage, and see how you compare with other people with similar square footage. they also are great about sending coupons for really useful things like insulating windows and sunshades. 

SRP is alright with me. i hope i never have to switch to another provider as long as i'm here.
