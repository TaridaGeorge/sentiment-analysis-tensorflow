When I first moved downtown a few years ago I'd regularly drive by and glance with curiosity at this decrepit old building on Van Buren. One day I heard it had gone through some "renovations," so my ghetto curiosity got the better of me and I made my way past a couple of bums standing around to walk inside. 

I couldn't believe my eyes. The beautiful, stained cement flooring grabbed my attention right off the bat. I asked the staff for a tour of the facility and I was instantly sold. Goodbye, LA Fitness, hello, YMCA. 

It's nice running into my downtown neighbors here now and then. Since ASU moved downtown the crowd has also transformed into a nice mix of young and old, everyone from college students to cranky old federal judges.
