This place is freaking delicious. They serve breakfast all day, for those of you who love breakfast. They have combos that give you the best of two worlds. You can get a sandwich/panini with soup/salad or pasta with a salad. Everything there is to die for, but I'd recommend the panini/soup combo of the chicken pomodori with the broccoli and cheddar soup. On a side note, it gets SUPER busy during lunch time on weekdays, so keep that in mind.
