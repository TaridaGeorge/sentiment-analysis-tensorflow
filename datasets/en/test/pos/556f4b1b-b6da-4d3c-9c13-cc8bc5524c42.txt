I've been there twice, once with the girlfriend and both times I was blown away, not to mention ordering a take home pizza last night. It starts with the small family style setup with some of the staff talking to each other in Italian. Then add in some of the most amazing Italian food and you have a place worth adding to your favorites. My gf who's eaten at the little Italian family places in Pennsylvania says this place is every bit as good; I know the food's awesome. All I have to do is try the desserts to round off the experience.
