Oh. My. Goodness.  I never eat donuts, because I feel like they're a dessert that you should eat at breakfast and I don't ever feel like desserts at breakfast.  That makes sense, right?!

Well, my husband had just gotten a PR at the Fiesta Bowl Half Marathon and I'm pregnant, so that clearly justifies desserts at breakfast!  Hence, our first trip to Bosa.  

I could smell that donut-y smell from outside the building - yummmmm!  A spell came over us and we bought a dozen donuts for the two of us.  They were delicious - my favorite was the Bavarian cream filled chocolate one.  

These are definitely a special treat for me - but I'll be back!
