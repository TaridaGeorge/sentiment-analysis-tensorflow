I will forever be a regular here! Ice cold beer, great margaritas and EXCELLENT chips and salsa. Request the hot sauce if you want a lil more spicy salsa, order inferno sauce if you are really brave! The prok green chili burros are very good, the steak fajitas are my fave and the tacos, hard or soft shell, shredded beef or chicken are YUMMO! Hit them up on Taco Tues!
