Not sure about the other review (9/2/07), New Vision moved to this location on 12/24/09.   I was looking for a place of spirituality that didn't have judgement or have guilt.

This is a very welcoming group with great music and love.    If you are looking for a new spiritual home, try New Vision Center.
