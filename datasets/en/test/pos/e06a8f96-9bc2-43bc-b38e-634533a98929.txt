Any time I plan to go to the movies, I try to find a time at Picture Show that works for me.  Even though, it's located at PV Mall, it is far less crowded than the bigger theatres.  Also, because it is at the mall, there are plenty of places in the area to grab a quick bite to eat before or after the movie.  Ticket prices are less expensive.  Concession prices are more reasonable (still up there, but more doable).  I especially like all the room that I get in the actual theater.  The seats are comfy and I don't feel cramped.  Since there is less foot traffic, the staff is always friendly and I often strike up a brief conversation with them before going into the theater.

So, next time you want to go to the movies, give this one a go.  You will not regret it.
