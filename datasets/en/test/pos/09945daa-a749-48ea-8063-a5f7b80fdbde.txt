Their nigiri salmon is delicious, fresh and has no fishy taste.  I love that they add wasabi under the fish. I have eaten the Sea Bass, that is flaky warm and tasty, some of the best I've had.  I've never eaten anything I didn't love.  Their tempura udon is also awesome.  The servers here are wonderful, and love to make conversation.  The best time to go is Happy Hour, they have great sushi and appetizer deals.  I "heart" Pure Sushi.
