I highly recommend Ultra Collision!  They were extremely helpful throughout the entire process (repairs after an accident where the other person wanted to avoid going though insurance companies) and always looking out for my best interest. I felt like they were fair and honest with the estimate and came highly recommended from the auto mechanic who works on all our vehicles (and is also awesome).  They did an great job on my repairs and my truck was spotless inside and out when we picked it up. (That felt like a huge luxury considering I have two young kids and my truck is rarely ever spotless!).
