Although I'm no tea connoiseur, I loved their gunpowder green tea.  Correct me on the name if I'm wrong.  

I've tried their coffee, their gyro's their bagels and my favorite, the lemon-poppyseed muffin (which is such a good pick me up).  I frequent this place when I have money, because they are rather on the pricey side, but delicious and certainly a very GREAT option when you've got the munchies when you're stuck in the library.  They also always have a variety of foods, varying from sandwiches, Indian cuisine and Greek.

I love Caf√© Biblioteca!
