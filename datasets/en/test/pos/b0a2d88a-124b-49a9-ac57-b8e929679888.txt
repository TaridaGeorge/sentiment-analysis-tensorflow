This place is not only the best bang for my buck, but consistently good when it comes to food quality (it's not low fat if that's what you're looking for) & outstanding service. 

The portions are huge, so if you're a guy you won't need to eat off other peoples plates when you're done with yours (you know you do it!). The food itself is diner food, yes, but it's OUTSTANDING diner food. As far as service, no one is going to kiss your behind here, but you're treated with respect & courtesy & your coffee cup is never empty.

This last visit I had the 1/2 order of ham, eggs over easy, skillet potatoes & wheat toast. I of course washed it all down with their delicious coffee, which to this date is still the best I've had in a restaurant.
