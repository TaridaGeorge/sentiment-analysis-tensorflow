so we had an online coupon for breakfast here, and since just coming home from a trip, we had no food in fridge and came to RnR. 

at 9am, very quiet, which was nice. our server was super pleasant and timely and we had no issues with service. 

the food was very good. i had the protein pancakes which were light, crunchy, and sweet without the syrup. the apple butter was a nice, sweet touch. 
my girl had the sundried tomatoe and goat cheese scramble. her portion was too big for her, so i finished it and it was very even and tasty. her homefries were a mix of soft and crunchy which is always a plus. 

great meal for us and great service.
