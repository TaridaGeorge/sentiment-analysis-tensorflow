Stumbled onto Cave & Ives while looking for a place with outdoor patio/fireplace. Ended up being an excellent choice. 

Atmosphere is really cool - nice enough that it'd make a fun special date night spot, but casual enough that you could cruise by for happy hour. 

Food was fantastic - the Tuscan pie was bursting with unique flavors (proscuitto, gorgonzola, apples, fig/balsamic marmalade, arugula and mozzarella), and pizzas out of a wood-fired oven always have that amazing smokiness and terrific crust. Mixed Greek green salad was a hit as well, particularly the yogurt dressing. Beer/wine list was solid and reasonably priced. 

Plus, our order got messed up slightly, and while we really thought nothing of it, the manager brought us over an extra pizza they'd made and sent us home with it. 

Really just a great experience and definitely planning on going back soon.
