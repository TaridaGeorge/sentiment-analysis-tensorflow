It's an All American BBQ joint... with an adjunct, weekend Latino dance club.... Yeop.

What you MUST order:

Appetizer: Q- Roll
Side: Mac n Cheese
Main Dish: Anything

Alcoholic Beverage: Shipwrecked.... only need one for the WHOLE table

Try to sit outside, really nice atmosphere.

Fish Fry Fridays during Lent (comes with Two sides for $10.99)! And don't forget to tell the waiter about the Yelp 10% off Discount! AND you don't even need to order dessert because they give you FREE Cinnamon and Sugar Donut Holes!

Unusual thing is that on Friday and Saturday nights there's another side of the bar that opens into a club. Does NOT affect the dining experience.  Our Cabbie told us it was SUPER GHETTO, we'd probably be mauled immediately upon entrance, and possibly beat up by thugs- not the case. Very safe.
