Katana has typical Japanese hospitality and excellent service.  I felt as I was part of the family with the type of service we received.  In addition, there were a wide array of interesting rolls.  I forgot the exact name of the roll, but it was a spicy crab roll with avocado and a tangy type sauce.  It tasted absolutely perfect with the right balance of spice and tangy/sweet flavors.  

This location is very close to the actual large fountain in Fountain Hills.  Next time I take some visitors on a tour, I will definitely make a stop at Katana!
