A friend and I went to have a couple of ear piercings done last week.  Kevin was our piercer.  We had an incredible experience, from the time we walked in until the time that we walked out!  The guys at the front counter were friendly and totally approachable, and Kevin was amazing!  The aftercare instructions were precise and totally understandable.  I will definitely be back for any future piercings!
