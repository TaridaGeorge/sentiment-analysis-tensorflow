show me better mexican food in this town! there are a few places but this ranks as top 10 easily. 

you all are haters... it's GOOD food. so what if the service isn't remarkable? food is cheap too. if you don't like your food, send it back.

AND it's so local, they have a copper dome on their building for the great state of ARIZONA.

a tip --- when you go, don't be so uptight, just be chill... no there isn't a "hello, welcome to la canasta, how are you doing today? may i take your order" so don't get your panties in a twist when youre not greeted in that typical (usually insincere) way.
