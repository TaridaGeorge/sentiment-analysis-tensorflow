We have been to Chelsea's a few times for lunch and have not been disappointed.  The Howie Burger and the Santa Fe burger were excellent...not a cheap burger but they are super tasty( Fries were awesome also)

The last time we went, we ordered just the Chicken Nachos and the Tuna Tartar....that was too much food for both of us.

We really liked the decor and are hoping to go again when the weather gets a little cool.  Tha patio looks like a nice place to hang out...

Haven't had a bad service experience. It was pretty busy each time we went...
