Great Coffee, Great service. Was in town for the Holidays (Christmas 2012) and stopped in each morning for coffee to watch the sun come up over the mountains. The owners were very friendly and dedicated to remembering repeat customers. The  Mocha was perfect every time. Can't wait until the next trip out!
