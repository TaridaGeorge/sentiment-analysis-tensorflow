A little piece of Buffalo heaven in the desert.  Love Ted's Hot Dogs, I grew up with them.  Well the owner Spiro retired and moved to Arizona and opened one out there.  And it's just as great as all of the Buffalo locations.  There is no drop off in quality and they use all the same ingredients.  They even have logenberry for crying out loud!  If you're a Western New Yorker and live in the desert and are a little homesick, then get over to Teds.  I go every time I'm in town.  It's always good, and even when theres a crowd it's always quick.
