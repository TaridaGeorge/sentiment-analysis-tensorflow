Blah, blah, blah scrumptious bruschetta sampler. Blah, blah, blah delectable strawberry chicken salad. Blah, blah, blah fabulous atmosphere. 

O.K., so I don't have much to say that's very different from the accolades of many others. But every time I come here, whether for lunch or dinner, the experience is magical. Great food, great ambiance, great people to watch. 

And I don't even drink wine.
