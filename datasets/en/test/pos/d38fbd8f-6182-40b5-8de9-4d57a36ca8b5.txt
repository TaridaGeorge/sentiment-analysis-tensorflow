I have been using Pat's for over a year now, and they are wonderful!  Their work is thorough, reliable and very reasonably priced.  I really love the fact that they are so honest.  They never up sell me on unnecessary work, yet give it to me straight about the work my car might need.

I felt compelled to take a minute to write this review because I do so highly recommend these guys.  They have 5 stars for a reason!
