I am from out of town, and I found this place via Yelp.  The reviews don't lie.  Great service. I was super happy with how it turned out!  Plus, they offer you beer or wine! who can pass that up?  They also offer a whole bunch of other services including shaves.  If you don't mind paying a little extra this place is totally worth it.  I spent $30, but would you really rather get your hair cut at Great Clips?
