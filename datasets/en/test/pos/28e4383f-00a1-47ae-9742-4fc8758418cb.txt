Friday at the Waste(d) Management Phoenix Open...

16th Hole Terrace Skybox

74 degrees and sunny

Tasty food provided by M Catering by Michael - especially liked the roast beef sandwiches

Bar stations practically every 20 feet*

Great people watching - you really never know just what you will see at these things!  That could have a lot to do with the bar stations...

* For maximum enjoyment of the event, bring a friend skilled at chatting up the female bartenders - he consistently returned with generously poured beverages... 

See you next year!
