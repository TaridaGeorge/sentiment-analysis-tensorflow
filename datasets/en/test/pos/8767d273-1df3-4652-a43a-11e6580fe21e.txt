Bought a groupon and went in for laser hair reduction in prep for a tattoo later this year and was really pleased with their work. I've gotten laser treatment prior to other tattoos with another shop and expected a certain level of sharp pain but Evolve uses the cold tip lasers and I was stunned that I didn't feel a thing. I didn't even know there were different types of lasers in use, but I'm definitely a fan of this one. It's also a cozy shop in a nice plaza and the staff there is friendly and helpful.
