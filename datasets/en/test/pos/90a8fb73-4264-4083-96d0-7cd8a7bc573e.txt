Alright...nothing exciting about a garage door replacement review.  We've used them before.  It took them 3 days to respond, estimate and replace our garage door.  It took Frank only 3 hours to dismantle the old and replace it with all new.  

We bought a lifetime warranty.  That says a lot about how much we appreciate good business!
