I sent over my friend to see Kerrie Droban for a divorce and she took wonderful care of him. She counseled my friend and that turned out to be very helpful and my friend worked it out with his spouse after speaking to Kerrie. How cool is that, bet you never heard of an attorney that has done that before! She is a great attorney that does all aspects of law and is building a relationship with her clients that last forever....owe and she is an author also!
