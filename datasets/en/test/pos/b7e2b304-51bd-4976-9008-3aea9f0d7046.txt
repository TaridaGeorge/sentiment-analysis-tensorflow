I am thrilled to have found such a wonderful animal clinic. I have three PUGS with three very different personalities. Luckily we don't have to go to see Dr. Bracken too often. But when we do, it is always a good experience. Dr Bracken and his wonderful staff are extremely professional and attentive. I live closer to downtown and will gladly bypass the many animal clinics closer to me to visit Arcadia Animal Clinic. I do end up waiting sometimes, but I do not mind. I know that Dr. Bracken gives a lot of thought and attention to the animals he is taking care of. I recommend Arcadia Animal Clinic to everyone I meet that have a pet or pets in their life. *******Plus its right by LGO, so you can stop and grab a bite or a latte on your way home!
