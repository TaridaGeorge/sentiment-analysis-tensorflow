Probably the best salsa I've ever had has been right here. Consistent, hearty and very flavorful. 

Love the mariachi when he's there...and Tammy is the best server EVER. The food here is authentic and robustly flavored. Most dishes, I've noticed, are notably spicier than other Mexican places I've been to. The spinach enchiladas with fundido sauce are incredible....the Margaritas, super yummy and never watered down.

This place is a MUST when we're in town. Love it, love it, love it.
