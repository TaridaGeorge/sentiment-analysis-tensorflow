I absolutely love big lots.  They have most of anything you are looking for.  All of it for way cheaper than what you would find elsewhere.  You want christmas decorations, body wash, cereal, a couch, picture frames, dvd's?  They have it.  It's never crowded.  The only possible downside could be that they often only have one checkout open, so there might be several people in front of you.  Other than that, this place ROCKS!!!
