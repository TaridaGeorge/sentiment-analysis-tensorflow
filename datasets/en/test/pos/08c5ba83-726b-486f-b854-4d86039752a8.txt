Delicious pizza. No, like really delicious. And there is a lunch special: 2 good sized pieces of pizza and a drink for $3.50. Sort of like Pizza Heaven in terms of the straighforwardness but even more casual and easy going. Don't expect anything exotic in terms of toppings  but what they do, they do really well. Word.
