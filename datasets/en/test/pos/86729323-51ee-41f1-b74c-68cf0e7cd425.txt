Maryvale Ballpark is the best spring training facility to catch a game.  It's cozy, comfortable and has charm.

Tickets are probably the cheapest in all of spring training. If you want to see all the MLB stars up close and personal than Maryvale ballpark is the place for you.

Home plate tickets are $22.

Plenty of concession stands and restrooms probably more than is needed for the size of the ballpark but they definitely have more than most spring training ball parks.

Maryvale Ballpark does spring training right and is the valley's best kept secret when it comes to baseball.
