Love, Love Pita Jungle! I was first turned on by them from a client- Christina. She told me about her experience at the downtown location that usually would scare me off. She said she ordered her hummus for an appetizer and the pesto pizza for lunch. Some time later she asked the server if her lunch was coming and the server realized she forgot her order. The server got it for her to go. Christina continued on to tell me that next time she goes, she give herself more time in case they forget again. 
(????) Wow, I figured I had to try this place....The Hummus and pesto pizza are my Favorites. 
Their charming crew is always friendly and on the ball...Service is always Top notch even when its busy!
