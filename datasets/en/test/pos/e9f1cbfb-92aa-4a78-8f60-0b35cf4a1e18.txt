Is somewhat of a 'fairy tale' coffee joint - out of a movie/magazine type atmosphere. Kept getting cooler and cooler as I asked more questions about their store, walked around, etc. 

Great coffee experience and they were roasting while I was there which added to the vibe. 

Only downer is that Biff's (think back to the future with me) run amuck in this place  - I was wearing business attire and you would have thought I was yelling racist remarks with the looks I was getting. Sorda funny to me, just see that getting to me if I was a local.
