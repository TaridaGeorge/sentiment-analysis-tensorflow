So Rob M and I went here after an intensely spicy Jamaican lunch. You know, to cool the burn. Razi (I think that's his name and how to spell it) remembered me and said he read the review. Cool!!

As Tracy H noted, the credit card machine is up and running. Wouldn't you know it, this time I had cash on hand. Oh, bother...

So, I'm still lovin' this place. Rob ordered the hazelnut and I got the coconut. Both were wonderfully delicious.

Thank you, Chill Out, for a wonderful experience!!
