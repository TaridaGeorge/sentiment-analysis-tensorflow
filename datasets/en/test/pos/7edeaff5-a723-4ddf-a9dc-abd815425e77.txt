This small restaurant doesn't have beer, but the food is fantastic and the service is friendly. Located in a shopping center on North Central, there should be signs and arrows pointing to this memorable restaurant. The Pad Thai and Pad See Ew were outstanding!  You don't want to miss this if you like Thai food.
