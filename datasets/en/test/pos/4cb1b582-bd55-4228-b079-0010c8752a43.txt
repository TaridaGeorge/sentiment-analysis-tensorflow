A hidden gem in south Scottsdale, Lo Cascio serves up some of the yummiest Italian food around. Their bread is always fresh and their sauces are delicious. They have some of the best fettucini alfredo I've ever had. And the portions are very large, I always have leftovers.

Their caesar salad is really good but they can go a little heavy on the dressing in my opinion. If you like it light, let them know.

Lo Cascio also has really good dessert, some they do seasonally. 
And you can't beat Mama Cascio wearing her big Martin Scorcese glasses. Love her!

Get ready for some heavy duty and delicious Italian food if you go here.
