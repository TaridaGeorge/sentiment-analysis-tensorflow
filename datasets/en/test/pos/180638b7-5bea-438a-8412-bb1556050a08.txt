I had been reading about the best places to get pizza around town and this spot was on my list. Entered the restaurant at dinner time it was pretty empty... The staff really friendly and helpful I ordered a beer off a list of beer I have never had before I went with a Karlovacko it's the house lager I really enjoyed it had to order another. When it came time to order started with the Asparagus & Prosciutto (Asparagus wrapped in prosciutto and baked in our brick oven). A+ really good Italian Sausage (Homemade pork sausage, wood roasted mushrooms, onions, green peppers, fresh mozzarella and tomato sauce). A++ You know something is good when each bit you say out loud wow this is good pizza. I will be back to this spot for sure lots I want to order still.
