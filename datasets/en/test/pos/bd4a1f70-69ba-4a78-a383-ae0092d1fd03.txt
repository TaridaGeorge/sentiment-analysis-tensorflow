I feel lucky to have an AA here in the Valley.  My current favorite piece of clothing is this heather blue tee that I'm rockin from there.  Its casual, classic style that I love and no other company produces quality knits like AA does.  I wish they would expand further to more stores in the Valley (Hey!  Downtown has PLENTY of boutique space for rent all over!)  and in other cities that I consider 'home' (re: Austin).
