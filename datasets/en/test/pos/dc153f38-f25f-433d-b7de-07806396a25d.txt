This is probably one of the best fast food Gyro's around. When I'm really hungry I hit the Mediterranean Plate that is sure to fill you up and the lunch special is also very filling and at a great price. This place is always busy but the service is always fast and spot on. I would say you should try it yourself you'll eat the often
