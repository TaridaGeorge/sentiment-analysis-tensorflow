Was in town visiting family and had to see what the hype was about from my friend. This place is very clean. Nice and quiet. Friendly staff. Pauline is the owner, does really good on eyebrows, and excellent on manicures. Took my mom to get permanent tattoo on her eyebrows and they came out fantastic. Prices are very affordable. The staff is also very reliable.
