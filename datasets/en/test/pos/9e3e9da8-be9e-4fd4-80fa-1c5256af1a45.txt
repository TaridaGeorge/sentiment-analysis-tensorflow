Tried this place out on a friends recommendation, and all I can say is WOW!  The food is amazing! (I'm still eating as I write this!)  Everything is perfectly seasoned, fresh, and cooked to the peak of flavor.  I ordered the Orange Chicken, Beef Fried Rice, Mongolian Tofu, Crab Puffs, and Spring Rolls.  I am in Love and will never settle.  The delivery time was great, and the driver was really nice.  Will definitely be ordering from them again.  My Belly is happy!

The only draw back was that I had to guess at the menu, as they have no website, or Facebook where I can look over and choose my dinner items. My friend told me they have anything a normal Chinese Restaurant would have.  So I winged it, and am still happy.
