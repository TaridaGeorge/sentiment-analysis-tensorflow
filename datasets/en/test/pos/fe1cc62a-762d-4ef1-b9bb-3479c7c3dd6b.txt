I love the Superstition Mountains! It is the most convenient place to get away from it all. The last time I was there I hiked Siphon Draw up to the Flat Iron. There were a lot of people on the trail but I still felt like I was in the wilderness.  Camping sites fill up fast here, so I would recommend checking out the Canyon Lake area as it is close and a pretty drive.
