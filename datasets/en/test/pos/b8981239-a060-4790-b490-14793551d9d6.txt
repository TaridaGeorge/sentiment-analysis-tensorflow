The perfect place for out of town guests. If the weather is nice their outside seating is great. Really nice scenery and excellent food. I have tried different omelettes and enjoyed every one of them. The best part is that they give free baskets of their stick buns, which are amazing, to each table. I have never been to El Chorro for dinner, only brunch. 

The price is definitely high, but if you dont mind paying you won't regret it.
