This review is for lunch.  I've been here for dinner twice and though food / service / ambiance is excellent - I'm not hip enough for it.  Recently, thanks to Yelp, I was looking for a sushi place, for lunch with the girl's and came upon Roka Akor.   I saw that they served lunch and that they had a special.  And special it is! Soup, salad and THREE hand rolls.  For such a high end place the price was hugely reasonable.  Everything was fresh and delicious.  Think I'm gonna have to go back tomorrow now.
