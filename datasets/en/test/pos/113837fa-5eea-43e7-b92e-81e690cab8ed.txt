I am a regular at this fry's market place went I enter I make a bee line to the clearance table near the back I have found some killer deals on cooking utensils top brands kitchen aid, oxo you name it I have seen it on these tables just need to look. If you watch the ads as well the meat seems to go on sale in rotations I food save a lot so there is money to be saved. Staff is really friendly and always there to help this is the best fry's market place I have been to.
