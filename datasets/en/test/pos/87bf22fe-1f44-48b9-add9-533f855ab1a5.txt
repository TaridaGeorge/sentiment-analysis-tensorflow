I've been coming to Ray's for well over 20 years, back when it was located on Mill & University.  The manager Charles (Ray's son), along with Lloyd, Barb, and others... take the time to get to know you, especially if you become a regular.  Usually some good barbershop convo, especially if Charles is around.  Never had a bad haircut from Charles, Lloyd or Barb.  Worth checking out especially if you're an ASU student, or live in the area.
