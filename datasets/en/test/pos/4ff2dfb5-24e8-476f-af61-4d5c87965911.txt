I'm obsessed with Oregano's. I've had their pizza a bunch of times but on my recent visit I had the Oregano's Favorite Salad which has sundried tomatoes, feta, roasted red peppers, pine nuts and red onions in it. LOVE it.  The Bistro Classic pizza is my favorite -- it's a white pizza with tomatoes, basil, and four cheeses on a super thin crust. YUM. I had to finish my meal off with the much talked about pizza cookie. It was RIDICULOUS. Don't leave without trying it. Trust me.
