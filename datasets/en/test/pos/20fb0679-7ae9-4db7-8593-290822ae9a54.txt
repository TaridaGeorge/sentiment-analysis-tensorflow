Whenever I have a cold I always head to Los Taquitos!  They are spice, but spice with flavor and Purpose.  I caught them on a late night showing of "Diner's, Drive in's, and Dives" and could't wait to try it out.  I have been going ever since then. I love their soft shell taco's with chicken and their green sauce!
