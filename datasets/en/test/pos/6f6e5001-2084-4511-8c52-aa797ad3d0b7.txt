Scramble is a really great place to have breakfast exactly the way you want it. I love the modern atmosphere and the do-it-yourself coffee and drink bar in the center of the restaurant. My only complaint was that it was fairly busy when we ate there (fairly busy, not overly packed or even busy enough to cause stress to the staff) and the man taking our order at the register was rushing us and behaved in a very unprofessional and impolite way. The rest of the staff was friendly and polite, however, and the food was terrific.
