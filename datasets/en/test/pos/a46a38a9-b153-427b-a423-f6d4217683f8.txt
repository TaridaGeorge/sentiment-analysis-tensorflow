This is a nice cafe with a diverse menu. There's indoor or outdoor dining with a view of the famous fountain! I ate here with my friend Connie who also posted! 

I ordered the Philly cheesesteak which was great! They also gave me a sample of the smokes salmon soup which was very much like it sounds. The service was excellent i was impressed. Will definitely recommend and go again myself.
