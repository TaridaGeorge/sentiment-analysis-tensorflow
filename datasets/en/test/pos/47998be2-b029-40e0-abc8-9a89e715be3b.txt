This place is great... I have tried numerous things on their menu and have never been disappointed.  Their Greek salad is excellent... lots of feta and vegetables.  Their subs and pitas are very good too.  I have only had the steak sub and the chicken picato pita.  Watch out for the jalapenos can be very spicy.  Their hummus with pita is also very tasty.
