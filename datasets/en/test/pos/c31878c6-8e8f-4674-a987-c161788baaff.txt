I like this place..its simple if you want to watch football and have a good salad.  I don't actually eat dressing for the most part and usually have salsa.  They offered a tomato brushetta and it did the trick.  Great place for a healthy lunch as long as you as you ask for something a bit more like salsa vs dressing....don't get more accommodating than that!
