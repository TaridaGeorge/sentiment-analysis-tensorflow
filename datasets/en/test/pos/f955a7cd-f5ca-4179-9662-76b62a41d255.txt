I work right next to Hava Java, and thank the lord for that. I cry on my days off when I can't have my delicious special order mocha that Lance the barista always gets spot on. 

the crew is always friendly and super fast (one of my pet peeves is super slow coffee service... ) and even if I stray from my usual and get something new or seasonal, I am never left unhappy. Megan, Season and Jake are on the regular crew and make the experience stellar. 

The customers also make this spot cool... it's nice to see everyone slow down and relax with a yummy cup o' joe. My heart belongs to Hava Java!
