Awesome awesome awesome.

My Fiance and I went to Tommy V's on Monday (4/16). We were presented with tasty bread with an oil and vinegar dip when we were seated. We were pleasantly surprised by the prices on their happy hour menu. We shared the Risotto Carbonara, Kobe Sliders and Kobe Stacks. 

The sliders and the stacks were both surprisingly inexpensive for Kobe Beef. They were melt-in-your-mouth delicious, and very similar but I liked the stacks better personally. The Rizzoto was creamy and delicious, served piping hot. They also have a great selection of $5 wine by the glass, and they let you try a sip to ensure you like it before they pour your glass.

Overall I was very impressed and I'm sure we'll be coming back!
