I have not stayed here but dined here for brunch once. Quite honestly, I am really not a breakfast gal, so I DEVOURED their deliciously fresh sushi and ceviche salad. (But if you do love breakfast THIS is the place to be! I couldn't believe the selctions and all of the stations...it was seriously a bit overwhelming!) The service was phenomenal while equally appealing were the amazing views. Although expensive it is well worth the money as the experience you won't soon forget!
