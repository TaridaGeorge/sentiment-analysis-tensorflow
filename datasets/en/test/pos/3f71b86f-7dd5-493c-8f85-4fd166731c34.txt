Our group enjoyed the stay at the hotel very much. Those rooms are the real Wow experience (not Windows Vista). The rooms (at least the suite we were in) were spacious and looked just great.  
The idea using art paintings as sliding curtains fascinated everyone. The staff was always friendly and helpful. We actually had a quick chat with the owner who explained his further plans and pointed out that this hotel is still work in progress.
We all felt that we got a very good deal and will surely come again, if staying in Phoenix.
