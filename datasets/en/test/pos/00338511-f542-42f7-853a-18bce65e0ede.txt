Jersey Mike's when they first opened this location they gave the company I work for a bunch of free sub coupons... I ordered the #56 Big Kahuna Cheese Steak on wheat bread (Grilled onions and peppers plus mushrooms, jalapenos and extra cheese)...  I have not looked back this is one of the best cheese steaks I have ever had in Arizona it's a must try for cheese steak lovers.
