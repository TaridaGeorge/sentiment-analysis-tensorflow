How in the world did I not know about this place until a few weekends ago? I never realized just how deprived my life had been until my very first trip to Crackers & Co Cafe.  The breakfast skillet I tried was the closest thing I've had to a religious experience in a long, long time. And the service was AH-MAAAA-ZING!!!! The atmosphere was very pleasant and family-oriented.

Finally.... a reason to get up early on a Saturday morning!!!!! And for the ridiculous amount of food you are served, you'll have breakfast on Sunday morning as well.  :)
