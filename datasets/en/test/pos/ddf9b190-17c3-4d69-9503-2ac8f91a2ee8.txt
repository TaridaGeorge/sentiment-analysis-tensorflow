My favorite Thai restaurant since my coworker introduced it to me as her favorite. My favorite is pad sew iu. The lunch menu price is great, even after they raised it once. The Thai ice tea is awesome. I also love their panang. I've taken so many of my friends there and they all loved it. The service is great too. Highly recommended.
