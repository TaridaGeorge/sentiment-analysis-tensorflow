One giant YUM! While venturing out for lunch I stopped by See's because really, who doesn't love chocolate? The allure of free samples speaks to me! Holy moley! The truffles are magnificent! If I lived anywhere other than the hot desert of Phoenix and assuming I had someone to share truffles with, I would have picked up several. But alas, I settled for two...however the experience was great and I will definitely be back to gather more bait for women...what's the shelf life on a truffle??
