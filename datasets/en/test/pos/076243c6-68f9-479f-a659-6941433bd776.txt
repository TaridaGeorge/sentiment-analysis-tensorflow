Delux has the best burger and fries in Phoenix. The meat is tender, juicy, and flavorful; the fries are divine; you can't go wrong ordering regular, sweet potato, or a mix of both kinds of fries. As much as I would love to try the other dishes, the delux burger and fries are too good not to order time and again. 

If you don't do the delux, get the standard classic burger. Order it on the demi-baguette, as the regular bun gets soggy from the meat juice. Be sure to try the aioli; it's excellent.

This place is popular, so be prepared to wait, especially on the weekends. My average wait has been 45 minutes.
