Best sushi in town!  It is my favorite lunch spot because their lunch specials are incredibly cheap and their sushi is always so fresh.  I've been coming here over 10 years and the atmosphere is the same.  We take friends that are from out of town here for sushi and teppanyaki (in the evenings).  Best place ever!
