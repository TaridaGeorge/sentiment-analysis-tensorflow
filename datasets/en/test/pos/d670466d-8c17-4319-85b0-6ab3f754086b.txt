Loved the location for First Fridays! I loved the older crowd and more of a family atmosphere. The exhibits were absolutely wonderful. Coming from NYC and Chicago, I was not expecting too much having been spoiled with the likes of the Met, Moma, Art institute of Chicago, and museum of contemporary art in Chicago, but I was wrong! There was a special under water theme area with adorable DIY crafts and nibbbles (similar to first friday in Chicago). The fashion section was also great as was the modern exhibits with heavy hitters like my favorite Rothko. I grew a lot of appreciation for some new artists. The museum is a great size in that it is actually accomplishable in a night and similar in size to the Guggeheim. Some areas leave something to be desired but I have no regrets leaving. It was a fabulous time.
