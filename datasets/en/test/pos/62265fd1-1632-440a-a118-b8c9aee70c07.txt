I don't know anything about Viet Namese food, this is the only place I've ever eaten it, but I do know a good restaurant when I see one. The food is fast and fresh, the service is awesome, and the decor is cute. The prices are more than reasonable, cheap even for the quality of food. The selection is huge and helpfully translated into what the items actually are and the staff can answer any questions about it. It's a little far for me to visit often but it's always worth the drive.
