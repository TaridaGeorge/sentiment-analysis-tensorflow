The wine list is a good 40 + pages.  They even had wines from the boyfriend's homeland.  (Trust me, it's not easy to find Uruguayan wine.) The sommelier knew his shit, without making me (the total wine novice) feel like a total wine novice.

The cheese plate was great.  And the olives.  Oh, the olives.

The Spanish guitarists and flamenco show were enjoyable and unpretentious (aka non-Scottsdale-y) on the Sunday night we were there.  

Big ups to Omer for introducing us to this place.
