We just moved to the neighborhood.  We received a "free large pizza with one topping" coupon.  So we tried it.  We are hooked and will be back for more!  The pizza was cooked perfect.  The cheese just the right temper. The side of bone in hot wings we ordered rocked! Perfectly prepared and tons of sauce.  Our takeout experience was so good, I even called the manager Ryan and let him know.  [I rarely ever do that.]
