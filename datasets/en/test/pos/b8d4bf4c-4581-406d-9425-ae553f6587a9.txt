alright let's be real for a second....if you live in north phoenix, this is the go to spot for sushi.  Granted the ambience isn't the best, but for take out fantastic sushi this is the only spot you need to know about.  I've been to every spot in north phoenix and this place completely trumps J and K sushi over on 7th street and bell.  I have got take out from both places numerous times and let's just put it this way, I won't be going anywhere else than HANA from now on.

All you need to get here is the spicy scallop roll or the rainbow roll and you'll be in sushi heaven.
