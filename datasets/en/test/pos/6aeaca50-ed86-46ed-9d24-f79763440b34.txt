I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!! We had gone for our wedding anniversary, and I had booked the room through one of those travel websites, and if you do that regularly you now that your room is going to be just a room nothing special.  So as we are checking in to the hotel, the front desk clerk informs us that our room isn't ready, and that we had been upgraded to casita. I knew from our last stay here those rooms aren't cheap, but when he said that I was jumping for joy inside!

The room was sooooo wonderful we didn't want to leave the next day!
