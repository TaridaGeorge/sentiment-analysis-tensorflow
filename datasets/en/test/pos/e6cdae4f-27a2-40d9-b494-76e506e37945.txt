Ok, I admit, I'm not a huge natural foods person, but its hard to deny Whole Foods goodness.  For starters, they have a great fresh fish selection, especially the smoked whitefish, my absolute favorite.  They also have a great prepared foods counter, where I buy latkes. (those are potato pancakes.)

They have a wide variety of food to choose from, and you dont have to be a health nut/vegetarian to shop here.  Everything seems fresh, and the store is huge, clean and well organized.

What I don't like, is how expensive they are.  Pricey
