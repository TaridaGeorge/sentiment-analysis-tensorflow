Can you say yummmmy!!! Ocean Club might be slightly more pricey than many establishments.... but it is for definitely a good reason- it rocks! Who knew you could get such wonderful seafood in the desert, I realize that they have other locations, but being that it is Arizona, tasty seafood comes few and far between. Not only is the food amazing, but the entire package. Chic low-key dinning, a tasteful bar, and terrific service.
