We tried this place out with two of our best of friends for dinner one night.  Terrific service, delicious Thai food...some of the best I've ever had!  The yellow curry and pineapple fried rice are a-maz-ing!!  My only complaint, the restaurant is kind of small, they need to expand...it gets busy in there!
