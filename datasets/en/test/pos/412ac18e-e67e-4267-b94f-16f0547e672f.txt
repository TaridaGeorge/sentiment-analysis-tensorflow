Wonderful staff....  I had to return something and needed it replaced quick because I was going to the Grand Canyon on a big weekend hike.  The store didn't have to help me.  My return was out of the 90 Return policies.  The Store Manager Marc Scott went above being helpful.  He exchanged my return and sent me on my way to hike  the Grand Canyon .  I'm very thankful.  This is how you do business people!~~~  Marc Scott you "Get it".  Thank you!
