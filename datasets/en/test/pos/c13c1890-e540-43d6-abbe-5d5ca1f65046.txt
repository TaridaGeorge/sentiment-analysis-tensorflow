Updating my 18 month old post. So yes they have the best cupcakes in Chandler for sure. Probably be best in the whole Phoenix metro area. They are that good.  My kids love their cupcakes for their birthdays.

But now you need to add their chicken salad sandwich. Knowing how good that is, it takes it from a 4 star to a 5 star. I am fan!
