Went  to Beaver Choice for the first time today and it was simply outstanding. I had the Chicken with Cardamom sauce. This dish was excellent. The thyme potatoes were solid as a side dish, but the true standout of the salads was the Tomato-basil salad. Make sure you try the tomato-basil salad as one of your salads if you get one of the dishes that comes with the three salads. I'll be getting at least a double of those next time I go. This is not a place to go if you are in a hurry, but the food is well worth the wait.
