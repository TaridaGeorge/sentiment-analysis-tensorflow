This place is Great!  The food is freshly cooked to order and the portions are big enough that 2 people could share a meal.  The crab ran-goon is amazing.  The atmosphere is pleasant enough that it suites as an any type occasion restaurant.  It is also family friendly and any dress code will work.  They have a very large menu to select from along with foreign beer and wines.  If you enjoy wine their plum wine is a winner.  This is by far my favorite Chinese/Asian restaurant in the area.  The prices are also as friendly as the staff.
