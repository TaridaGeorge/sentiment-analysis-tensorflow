This is my favorite sushi restaurant in Arizona so far. And believe me, I have been searching...

The prices are reasonable and the fish is high-quality. The sashimi is really good. The menu has pictures of all the different roles, so it's great for a visual person like me. 

It's a small restaurant next to a cell phone store and across the street from a Fascinations adult gift shop. The atmosphere inside is pretty hip though. 

Check this place out!
