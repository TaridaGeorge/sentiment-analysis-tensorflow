I had never heard about Jimmy John's before coming to Arizona, but now I'm seriously wondering why. 

For lack of a better explanation, there's something magical about Jimmy John's. The concoctions they come up with are so painfully simple you'll slap yourself in the head and wonder why you can't make it at home. Roast beef, lettuce, provolone and mayo on their french bread. Period. 

I've been three times and each time I've literally sat and marveled at the sandwiches. That being said, JJ's is not something I'd pass up.
