Gilbert is shaping up to be quite a hip little downtown and Liberty Market is the reason. It will be nice to have Postino there when it finally opens too. You have to thank Joe Johnson for bringing us this authentic little gem. It's nice to know that this part of town can indulge in a nice little f&b experience too. Thank you JOE! Now bring it to Chandler, we are dying for something in the neighborhood. Hint...hint. Ocotillo/price area overlooking the farm land and Indian Reservation....sunset, etc. 

Oh, and the food is fresh, amazing and creative. Whoot!
