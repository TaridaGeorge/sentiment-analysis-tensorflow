I live close to this place. Used to come several times every week. Shared a dish with my husband and still very filling. Their owner changed about 2 month ago. Kitchen staff remain the same, 10 year old carpet is replaced with tile and the decor looks fresher.  I was and still am a fan of this place. Their authentic food deserve applause.
