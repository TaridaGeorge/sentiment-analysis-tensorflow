I wanted to go to Oreganos but my bf suggested we go here instead. Place was dead, so our server was really annoying asking us if we ready to order every 2 minutes. Ordered a small pizza with red bell peppers, italian sausage, and pepperoni. Crust was really soggy first couple bites but as you eat towards the end it is so crispy and delightful. Ingredients tasted very fresh and flavorful.
