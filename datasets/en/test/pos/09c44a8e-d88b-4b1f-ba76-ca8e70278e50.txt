There is no finer dining in Scottsdale. Razz is an artist. You can tell from his paintings which adorn the walls, but even more from his signature dishes. I hate cole slaw, but tried some of his and it was mouth watering. Every touch, every garnish has soul. And Razz is hugely entertaining. Sit at the bar and let him serve you. An experience like no other.
