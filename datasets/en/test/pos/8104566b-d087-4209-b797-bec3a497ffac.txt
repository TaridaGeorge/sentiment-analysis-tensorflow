great place.  Some advice

1. bring cash - they don't take credit cards.   They do this to save money, the credit card company takes a big cut.   To those people who don't want to bring 4 dollar cash, I know its a lot of money maybe bring an armored car?   

2. The bagette sandwich bread is crusty some call it "hard".   Some people (me) like it that way.  If you like soft bread stay away or get croissante sandwiche.

3. Some of the baked goods are good. 

4. The sandwiches are inexpensive but don't have a huge amount of meat.   Again I like this - just telling you.
