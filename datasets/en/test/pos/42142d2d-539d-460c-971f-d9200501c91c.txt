Hot dog, hot dog, hot digggity dog this place is tasty...

Had the Lava Dog Shaggy style and the Island Dog with hot sauce. So, so good. Who knew that coconut and bacon would taste good on a hot dog, but it sure does!

Two dogs (big) plus fries and a drink end up costing me about $12. Well worth it.
