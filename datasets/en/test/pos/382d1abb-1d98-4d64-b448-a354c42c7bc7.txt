My friend's husband bought ticket for the three of us to go see Romantasy's Halloween show. It was my first-ever burlesque show... and now I'm hooked! It was funny, sassy, sexy, unexpectedly creative and, in keeping with the macabre theme, even at times a wee bit creepy (deliciously so! Clowns, man, clowns are just creepy!) Belly dancers, magician, fan dances, comedy, camp, tease... It really had it all for a wildly fun evening of adult fun. Now, a hugely devoted fan of Romantasy!!
