What we have here is a fantastic uber chic coffee shop ripped right out a SoHo corner and slapped in a contemporary farm setting. The Coffee Shop offers a rapture of stupendous desserts and a massive menu of blissful coffee/ espresso drinks. The atmosphere and decor is smart and happening yet still keeping to its roots with exposed articles of the previous structure. I love love the ultra glamorous Jessica, all of that Chanel!
