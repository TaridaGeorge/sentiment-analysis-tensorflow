Super clean, super cute little restaurant.  Went on a Sunday night and had a great waitress.  I ordered the BLT which was absolutely LOADED with applewood smoked bacon that was very thick.  There was so much bacon I had to remove some of it and eat it separately later.  Hubbie ordered the fish tacos and we shared a bunch of french fries then went to see Lincoln at the theatre.  A great date nite and a very nice location for a tucked away little neighborhood place to grab a quiet bite.  Also, the prices were extremely reasonable.  In fact, we joked that for the same price we could have paid for 2 hot dogs and a coke at the theatre concession stand, we had a full meal instead. A great little gem.
