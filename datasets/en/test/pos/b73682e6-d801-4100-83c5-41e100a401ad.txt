my boyfriend and i have eaten this menu up and down multiple times- we can't get enough.

first of all: BEST HUMMUS I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. i always get it, i cant help myself it so good its like a compulsion.

service is spotty. can take a long time. some servers are better than others. but the food itself is worth it so we go back time and again.

all salads= fabulous. pastas= fabulous. every single kind of burger= amazing. all fries = better than you can imagine!

this place is my favorite lunch place in phoenix to date!
