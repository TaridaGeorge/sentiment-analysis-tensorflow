I give it a five because they are smart enough here to have a very limited (maybe ten sandwiches, five salads, and some other goodies) and to do them all right. We tried the roast beef sandwich (A+++), turkey (like the day after thanksgiving), and the cheese quesadilla. All were excellent. Great breads, great ingredients. Their blue cheese cole slaw and macaroni salad were good enough that I would like them as a meal. The specialty lemonades were a bit sweet but we just watered em down a bit. There's like NO room to sit here, so come on the edges of meal time rush or you'll be stabding or sitting n the sun. Great service, NO COMPLAINTS!!!
