Good people, great service. Been going there for a while now, and always going to Andrea. She's super cool and funny. Although busy on weekends, strip mall parking is aplenty, and if you happen to have a long wait, you can just hit Fry's next door to do some grocery shopping while you wait. Target and many other stores close by in this convenient location.
