Finally! A cousins subs right in my area!! I've always loved their subs... they're so much better than subways subs! The lettuce is always crisp and the bread always tastes delicious, and this location is no exception from those standards! While I didn't go in myself, my mother did, and they were packed with a lot of people ordering and eating (which is good because I want this location to stay forever!) As Amanda said, the place is tucked away, but if you see the UPS store it's diagonal from there and on the same section of buildings that the 'Beads' store is on.
Definitely should go check the place out! It's clean, new, and the staff was awesome!
