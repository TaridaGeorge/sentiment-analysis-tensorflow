My home internet was recently down so in order to get online I packed up my laptop and headed to this coffee shop just down the street from my house. Not being a coffee drinker I can only say that the hot chocolate was very good. As others have mentioned, the work space is great. Fast internet connection, large table in the center with power strips and individual tables with great power hookups all around the room. I think I even recognized some fellow Yelpers.
