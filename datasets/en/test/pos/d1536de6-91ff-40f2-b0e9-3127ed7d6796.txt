This was my first meal in Phoenix, and it was pretty damn good. At first I was skeptical about the limited menu and how good bruschetta can be - i mean its bread with some cheese and toppings. Well they Postino proved me wrong. The variety of the Bruschetta was fantastic! My favorite was the smoked salmon with pesto - it had these delicious capers in there! So Tasty!

The atmosphere was great! We had outdoor seating and it was very comfortable. 

Highly Recommend!
