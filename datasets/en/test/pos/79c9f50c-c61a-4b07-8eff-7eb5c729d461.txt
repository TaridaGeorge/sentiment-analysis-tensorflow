I lost 60 lbs. this year and decided that my reward was to go to Brazil. You'd think as a waxing noobie I'd have chosen something more tame, like legs or eyebrows, but no. Nine months of being a low-fat raw vegan had made me strangely fearless. 

My aesthetician, Rachael, was the best. She made me feel very comfortable, telling me all about the procedure and answered my every question. I can't say it was completely painless, but she said that successive treatments get a lot easier. Since there were no bite marks on the ceiling, I had to believe this was true.

If there was anything to improve, I'd say throw some pictures up on the walls or cover the fluorescent lights with those pretty cloud covers. We need something to look at during this special time of hair yanking. Otherwise, great service, great price. See you again!
