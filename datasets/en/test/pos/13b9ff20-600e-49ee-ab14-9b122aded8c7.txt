BREAKFAST REVIEW.

What a gem!  This could be our go-to place for breakfast when we are in PHX.  We found this place on Yelp and tried it out for breakfast about two weeks ago on an overnighter to PHX.  

The CA Eggs Beni was fabulous.  THe kids liked the pancakes.  The coffee was smooth and phenomenal without the acidity.  The OJ was freshly-squeezed and tasty.  

The service was fine.  They refilled our coffee and water frequently.  If we needed something, we were proactive about getting things done.  When we travel with kids, we have to be proactive about it which sometimes gets us the eye roll from wait staff, but we did not notice anything like that here.  Big tip at the end of the meal for good service.
