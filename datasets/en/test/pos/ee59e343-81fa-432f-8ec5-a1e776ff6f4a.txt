my favorite brunch in the central phoenix hands down. Awesome drinks for $5, and a small but delicious menu. The Matador is the best egg dish i've ever eaten. And i'm not even an egg person. But the way they do it, it's amazing. Two over easy eggs on top of cheesy, gooey cheddar potatoes, with a crispy tortilla, fresh guacamole, and possibly the best salsa verde in phoenix. To die for. If you haven't brunched here yet, you are missing out.
