A grand mandarin dinner is refreshing for anyone seeking an authentic american chinese dinner. The chinese always do it better though and this place has the best looking waitresses in the crown jewel of the west. The serve delicious buffalo wings. Thats the american coming out, compliments to chef Billy. Confusioun says "A progressive meal even satisfies those who speek chinese"  If you order the chinese itch, beware.... aunt ling dai will have your liver itching for hours! WE love going here even if just for the scenary.
