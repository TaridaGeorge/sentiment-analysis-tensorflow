Fat Burger is one of those places I always go to when I'm in town.  They have awesome burgers and fries that are made right in front of you, Subway-style.  Prices are about right for a whole meal, and since they're located near ASU, there's plenty ofcollege flavor to go around here.  Their menu is basic, but I would say that Fat Burger is comparable to Seattle's Dick's.  Yum!
