I am not sure if this is the actual grocery or what, but I will review it as such.

This is a small bakery that has great breads and pastries.  They also have a small grocery with specialty items and some of their own sauces, spreads and oils.  Their produce is always fresh and fairly priced.  They even make their own large dog biscuits which sell for only $1.50 each.  My dogs definitely approve.

One Saturday afternoon I went in around 3pm and they had the loaves of bread buy one get one free.  I don't know if this happens in the late afternoon every weekend or if I just got lucky.
