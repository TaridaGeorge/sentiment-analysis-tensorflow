Mercie J is the most honest, down to earth auto repair shop I have ever been to.  They diagnosed my issue with my car for free!  I told them I could bring back my car after my next paycheck and they actually told me a few things I could do to help the issue until I could bring it back. That has never happened with another repair shop so I really appreciate their help.I have recommended them to everyone in my family and all of my friends as well!
