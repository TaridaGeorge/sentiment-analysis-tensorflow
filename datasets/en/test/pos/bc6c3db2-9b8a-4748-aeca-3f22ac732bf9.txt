I personally think their fruit flavors are better than the chocolate based cupcakes, and I'll be the first to admit I don't like their cake-pops as much as I like Starbucks, but they're still great cupcakes. If you can try the orange, the key lime, and the lemon raspberry and share with a friend. Those fruity ones pair up wonderfully with a girly alcohol night. Yikes, can anyone tell I'm about to put on lacy pajamas and suggest manicures and a pillow fight? This is what Mondays do to me. Cupcakes and cocktails, people.
