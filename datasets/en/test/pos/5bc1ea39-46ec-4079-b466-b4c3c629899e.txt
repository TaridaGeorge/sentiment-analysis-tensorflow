I'm going to give this a 5-star for their Avocado Shake! I love, love, LOVE their avocado shake. It's best made when the owner (father looking man) makes them. His kids (well at least I think it's his kids) help out and make the shakes too, but it  just doesn't compare to how he makes them. 
I'm not into trying the other shakes because they're not made with real fruits...they use powder mixes...except for the avocados.
