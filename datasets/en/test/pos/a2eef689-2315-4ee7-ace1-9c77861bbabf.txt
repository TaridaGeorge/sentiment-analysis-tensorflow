My wife and I took my parents here.

The sweet and spicy fish is one of my favorite dishes in the Valley and will keep us going back for more.

My Dad loved the food and commented several times how that was a great meal.  

We ordered Dragon Noodles, Yellow Curry for the boys, and the jalape√±o fried rice.  YUMMY!!

Highly Recommend.  

A little pricey but very much worth the expense.  Not an everyday lunch place in my opinion because of price but a great treat.
