Absolutely fantastic food!  If you've been to Pita Jungle and want something a little more authentic to middle eastern region, than you'll love Tasty Kabob.  My wife and I lived fairly close to the restaurant so we would take-out at least once a week.  My personal favorite is the beef and lamb kabob, and my wife would almost order the Greek Salad w/Gyro Meat.  The food tastes fresh, and they don't over do it with spices and salt.

The service is always great and you'll most likely have the owner of the restaurant serve you.  We liked this place so much that my wife and I did our rehearsal dinner there.  Oh yeah, did I mention that the food is very inexpensive!

If your in the mood for middle eastern cuisine and are on a budget, be sure to stop in!
