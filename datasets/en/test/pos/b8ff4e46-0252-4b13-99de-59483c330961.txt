LOVE! I have been going to Flesh Creations for 3 years now and never will I go to another shop again. Probably one of the cleanest, organized, reasonably priced, and friendliest shop I have been too. They are always running great specials on tattoos and piercings and have regular tattoo parties ($40 tattoos). Duane has done 5 of my tattoos, a cover up and a handful of piercings for me & Taija has done a cover up for me as well. They are the best and Flesh Creations has definitely become my home away from home!
