Must try the vanilla/vanilla buttercream as it is a super intense vanilla flavor.  Red Velvet is also a true RV- lots of buttermilk, not very  sweet but rich and moist.  I usually find most chocolate cakes to be boring and flavorless, but these chocolate cupcakes are mind blowing.  Very chocolatey and again, moist. Also the malt ball was "good" butr not awesome.  I'd heard so much about the pancake and bacon and found it has an odd texture- actually like a really think pancake, it's hard to describe but I'd say it was crumpety with nooks and I did not like it.  The top your own station is very cute and kids love it. It's also a way to try different flavors of frosting on one CC.
