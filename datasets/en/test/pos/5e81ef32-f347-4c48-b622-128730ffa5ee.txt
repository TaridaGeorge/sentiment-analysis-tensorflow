One of my favorite restaurants! Everytime I come home to Arizona, I make it a point to go to Kona!  First of all, the food is great!  The calamari is a MUST! It comes with this slightly spicy/sweet dipping sauce that is to DIE for! 

Secondly, I highly recommend the Sweet Chili Salmon Salad as well.  It comes with a huge fried wonton shell and is tossed with a soy-miso dressing.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it! 

And finally, happy hour at Kona is really great.  They have great HH specials and great apps! Both Konas in Chandler and Scottsdale also have a fun outside patio area that is really popular every day of the week! Make sure to get there early if you want a table!  It's also a great place to start a fun day of shopping at Fashion Square ;).
