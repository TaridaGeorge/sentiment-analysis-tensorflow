I visited Tom's Restaurant & Tavern last week for a Fundraiser for two nonprofit groups--- Sheriff Joe's MASH for abused animals and the Animal Defense League of Arizona. This wasn't my first visit with this landmark restaurant, however, I hadn't been downtown for a few months. The food was EXCELLENT, better than ever. We had stuffed mushrooms for an appetizer and a cheeseburger and great coleslaw for an entree. The service was impeccable as was the ambience. We'll definitely be returning soon. There aren't many restaurants who sponsor and host fundraisers in this economy. Thank goodness for the independent restauranteurs of our city. Tom's Tavern has certainly stood the test of time.
