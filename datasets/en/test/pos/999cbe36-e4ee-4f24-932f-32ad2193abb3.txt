You can't find better bar food anywhere. The beer is also great, and I'm not a huge fan of beer. I LOVE their peach ale. The Beer Bread Sandwiches are terrific and their fries are delicious. No air conditioning, just a  swamp cooler so while you are fine to go there on a summer day, just make sure you get a table deep inside the building.
