Strange...the reviews seem to be all over the place  for this the best seafood joint in town.  I think their 60 year operation speaks for itself.  I've been a semi-regular for years now and love their fish.  It's the best breading I've ever tried.  Almost as important as the fish, to me, is you must have good tartar sauce.  If it's crap you can have the best fish and you've still lost me as a customer.  KKL does it right....best, freshest fish and the best tartar in town.  A few have mentioned that it's not in the best neighborhood.  What does this really mean?  Does location have some effect on a restaurants ability to cook food?  Or does your concern for it's location say more about you...
