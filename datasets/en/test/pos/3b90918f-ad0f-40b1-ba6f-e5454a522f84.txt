I've never wanted to move in (literally) to a public facility before.  D@$! this place is full of blings!  It was suppose to cost $10MM to build.

Finally, a place where I can go to sit on a Herman Miller Aeron chair for hours without menacing looks from pesky sales people.  Free wifi, coffee bar and yeah, lots of shinny new books.
