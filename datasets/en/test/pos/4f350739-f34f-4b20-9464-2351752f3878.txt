This place rocks. Great burger with all the fixins. Extremely fresh ingredients. Fries are awesome (cajun style, I gair-aun-tee). I have had a lot of different fast food chain burgers but this tops them all. Fatburger is very good, Fuddruckers is good, but really people? Comparing this place to In-N-Out is just silly. Way better at 5 Guys and yes you pay more but its worth it. The soda machine a lot of people complain here about is awesome. They do one thing and they do it extremely well. I will return as much as possible barring a change in pants size.
