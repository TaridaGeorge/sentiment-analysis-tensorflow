I like this mall.  I like the Wildflower Bread Co., See's Cany, Auntie Anne's, KB Toys, the pet store, Build A Bear, Apple Store, Nordstroms, Kiddie Kandids, ect ect.

I think they have a decent food court and I like that they offer a play area for the kids.  

I enjoy the outside area with the water fountain and restaurants.
