I love whole foods. Yes it is pricey , but the quality of what you get is incomparable . So many options for organic produce , a wide variety of fruits , veggies , herbs and much more. I love the fact you can order fish or meat and have them grill it there and you can also have a glass of wine or beer while you're waiting. I wish they had more in the valley , but then again I don't know if phoenix has the demographic to spread out as much as Trader Joes.
