YEs I'm a regular...and they please me with no ice and little boba!! what else could I ask?.  I usually order their milk mixed teas and I've tried the Rose, Hazelnut, Melon and Coconut tea. The green tea with green Mango...good!. All good. The boba is not for all, I started ordering later when I discovered it is funny to chew those gummy things while drinking the tea. Good attention!
