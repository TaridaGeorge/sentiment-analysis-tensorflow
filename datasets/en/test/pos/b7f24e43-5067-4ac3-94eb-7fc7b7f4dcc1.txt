I went to Moore to get my back bumper replaced and was very pleased with the service.  The initial quotes were explained to me and the pricing was fair.  The staff was friendly and courteous and the work was done as promised.  I went to Moore out of convenience and was apprehensive after reading the other reviews posted here but didn't experience any of the problems the other reviewers did.  This was not an insurance claim/repair, if that matters.  My car looks great and they cleaned and vacuumed the interior before pick up.  Based on this experience I would highly recommend them!
