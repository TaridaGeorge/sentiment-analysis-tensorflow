I only ate here once, so I am only rating the one meal I had there. But when I tried the Chilean Sea Bass, my faith in God re-emerged. I saw the light! Honestly one of the best things I've had in my life. Maybe I don't get out enough, or maybe I was so hungry that even vegan food would have the same effect. It's expensive as hell, by my standards, so if you've got the benjamins check it out.
