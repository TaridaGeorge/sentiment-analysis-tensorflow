I'm never a fan of going to the doctor.  This practice is an exception.  The staff is extremely helpful and friendly.  The doctor (Dr. Jorgenson) was thorough, listened to everything I had to say, and offered up excellent support.  I'm finally getting treated for allergies I lived with my entire life that no other allergist has cared to diagnose.  I highly, highly recommend them.
