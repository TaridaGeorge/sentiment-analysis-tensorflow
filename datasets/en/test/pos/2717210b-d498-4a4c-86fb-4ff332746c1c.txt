Love this place!  Wish it was a little cheaper, but it is well worth it.  The burgers have yet to let me down! The burgers are a great size, nice and crisp, cooked to perfection.  Their fries are addictive and their onions rings are irresitible. This place is in such a weird location, and I really hope business picks up for them soon.  Its always off putting to come in and be the only customer.  Bonus points for getting root beer on tap now!!  The lady who works at the register all the time is very enthusiastic and friendly, which is very refreshing.
