Unfortunately, Jetta R, Misty S, and I discovered that Leap's has shut its doors.  The note on the front of the building indicates that it is due to a disagreement with the landlord. I'm going to miss Leap's, particularly since it's the only coffee shop around that's not only kid-friendly, but also provided them a corner to play.  Out of all of the recent local business closures, this is the one that's messed with my head the most.
