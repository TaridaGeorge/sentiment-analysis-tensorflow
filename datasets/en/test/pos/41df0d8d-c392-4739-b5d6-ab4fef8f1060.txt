Can't ever go wrong with the happy hour here. MY GAWD! Oh and to make it better, it is pretty much allll the time. Watch out for the frozen sangria though, it'll get cha! Take a seat on the misty patio, and service can be spotty, but nothing that my frozen sangria and a little portabella mushroom and brie fondue can't fix.... and its where the best people watching is!
