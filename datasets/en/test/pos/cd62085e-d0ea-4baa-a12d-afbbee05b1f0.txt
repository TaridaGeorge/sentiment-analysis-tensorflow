One of the best North Indian restaurants in Arizona.  Their presentation is something you just don't see at other restaurants.  I've always loved Indian food, but my wife has shied away at times.  This all changed when I brought her here.  She loved everything from the Mixed kabobs, to the chicken curry.  I was very excited to bring her here, and have her enjoy it the way she did.  I was also a big fan of their nann bread and their Alu Gobi, which is a cauliflower and potato dish.  I can't wait to go back!
