This place is great for a small group...It's small, dark & moody.  The food is delicious!  

At first I was grossed out by the name...couldn't imagine what type of food would be served.  FYI-a pasty is like an empanada, but they put all types of different stuffings in theirs.

DH & I shared a greek salad (delicious!) and I ordered a spicy chicken pasty & DH ordered a chicken alfredo pasty.  We LOVED our food.  

Only negative is that they didn't have a full bar...so I just ordered a glass of wine. 

Would totally go back!  This place is fantastic.
