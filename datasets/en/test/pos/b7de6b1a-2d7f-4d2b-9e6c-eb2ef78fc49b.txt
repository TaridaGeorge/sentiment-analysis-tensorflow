This is the best self-serve fro-yo place I've visited.  The moment you walk in, you are welcomed to the shop as if they can help you with anything and to let them know if you have questions or would like a sample.  Everything is always very clean and kept clean as you go through and make expected messes.

I love the pomegranate-berry and chocolate frosty.  There are so many toppings to choose from, sometimes it can be hard to tone it down.  The fruit is delicious, every nut you could think of, every chocolate bar, some cereal, frosting ... you name it, they probably have it as a topping.

I would suggest anyone to go here who's looking for a quality frozen yogurt experience!!
