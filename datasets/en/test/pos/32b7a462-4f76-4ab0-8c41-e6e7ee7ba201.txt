I love this restaurant.

The above statement comes easily and without any sort of hesitation.

Their pizzas are phenomenal, the appetizers are great, the wait staff is very helpful, and the ambiance is great.

After looking at my budget, I noticed that my only expense for the last two months in my restaurants category is LGO.

Seriously, go there, order the artichoke appetizer, iced tea, a margarita pizza, and gelato to finish it off. Amazing!
