OMG. HELL-the-f*ck-O!

Culver's,
I sure am glad you came to the valley. I read about you in the paper. Guess what? I want to eat you!!!

So, I unfortunately have not eaten any real food here yet. But I'm sure planning on coming back for some!

I saw the sign about their strawberry mango smoothies. There is a reason these puppies come with a spoon. I don't care how good you are ladies, there is almost no way in hell you're gonna suck hard enough to get at it. They start out THAT thick! They have real fruit chunks in them too. But not too chunky. It's pretty blended, but you can tell actual fruit went in. It was a little too sweet at times but still ridiculously tasty. I think I liked the mango bit more than the strawberry.
