It's been a couple years since my last review and I am updating it!  This studio is really nice now, they got a new heater (no more distractions caused by a noicy wall heater).  Even better is the new carpet that doesn't smell!  They have the ongoing 30 for 30 which is $30 for 30 days of unlimited yoga that is available to any AZ resident. This is a great way to start your practice.  The teachers are accommodating, encouraging and keep the students motivated especially if you're new to Bikram Yoga! Definitely worth a try...
