This was a great museum. I would have NEVER taken my 5 year old here if it weren't for the Yelp reviews and they were right. This is much more then a bunch of stuffed foxes, lol. It was 90% about dinosaurs. It has bones, and life size dino statues. My 5 year old loved it. They also have a water feature out back where they can sift for gold (fools gold, the same to a child). There were quite a few interactive things for the kids as well. Really great for kids. I loved this museum. Not the largest I've been too, but the quality makes up for that.
