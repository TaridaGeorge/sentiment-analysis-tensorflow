I recently visited AZ 88 and ventured away from my typical chicken sandwich route. Ok, so I didn't venture incredibly far, but I like to think it was a tad healthier route. I ordered the AZ 88 Chicken Salad which is like the AZ 88 chicken sandwich sans bread. It's huge and topped grilled chicken marinated in buffalo sauce and accompanied with veggies (including avocados) and a bed of lettuce. It could easily be shared, was delicious and didn't even need to blue cheese dressing that I asked for on the side. Definitely worth getting your next visit!
