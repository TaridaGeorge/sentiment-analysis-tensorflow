I absolutely LOVE having pizza and a caesar salad on the patio with a fab glass of wine here. By far, my most favorite pizza is with prosciutto and arugula, but the margherita is wonderful as well. I don't even like to tell people about this place because it is one of my favorite, not super-popular places so it is not very busy when we go. : ) It is very casual and laid back plus the staff is knowledgeable and the wine selection is superb.
