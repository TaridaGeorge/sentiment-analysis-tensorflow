I dine out regularly and found my experience at Chelsea's to stand out above the rest. The food was very fresh and prepared just as I had asked. The fresh tuna tacos ROCK! We also sat on the patio, which I have to say is the best patio setting in town. The staff were friendly and made our experience more enjoyable. The energy inside the restaurant was upbeat and everything seemed to flow well. I'm definitely going back!
