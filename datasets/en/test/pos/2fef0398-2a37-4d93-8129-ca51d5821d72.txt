YUMM! No wonder why this place won awards! The service and food were amazing! Their prices are pretty good too. The neighborhood that its in isn't ritzy (there's a tattoo shop next door), but it's still a great little hidden gem. Unlike a lot of the chains out there, Yoli's will really appreciate your business.  (Try the Monte Crisco, it's delicious!)
