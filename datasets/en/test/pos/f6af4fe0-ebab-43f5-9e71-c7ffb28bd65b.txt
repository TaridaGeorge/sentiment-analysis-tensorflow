My FAVORITE local place. Its Mill Avenues best kept secret! I love that they do different salads everyday, and everything I have had is great, Greek pasta salad and chicken salad are my favorites. They give you great portions (enough for 2 meals) for a very affordable price. Her salsa (which is free w/chips) is really good too! I am at loss for words to tell you how yummy it really is, try it for yourself, you wont be disappointed. 
P.S. Your supporting a locally owned and operated business when you do... =)
