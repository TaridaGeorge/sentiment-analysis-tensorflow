I've only poked my head in once and there is quite a variety of items for sale.  I mostly know GROWop for their outside garden which brightens up the neighborhood.  They grow their own fruits and veggies and sell to local restaurants.

Also a very popular spot for during First & Third Fridays Art Walk.  Sunday is their local gardening day if you want to come play in the dirt and give back to the community.

Just volunteered on Saturday as they help maintain the Valley of the Sunflowers in the vacant lot directly south of them.
