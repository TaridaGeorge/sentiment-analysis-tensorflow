Sushi Time is as good as it gets! I live nearby and go at least once a week for happy hour.  Their happy hour specials are buy one get one rolls and buy a beer get a free hot saki!! for less than $40 two people can have 3-4 rolls and a couple of drinks each.  The food is excellent, the decor is simple, not much for atmosphere but you won't find better sushi in the area.  Score one for mom and pop!!
