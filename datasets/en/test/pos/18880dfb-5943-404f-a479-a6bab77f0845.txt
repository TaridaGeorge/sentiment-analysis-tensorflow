I would understand why this place currently holds 3.5 stars. But for me, Eli's was a great night out! The live band was actually pretty damn good (even though they hadn't much of an audience), and the service was even better.

My waiter was especially accommodating and very enthusiastic about the menu - usually a good sign. I ordered the petit filet mignon with mashed potatoes and garlic-sauteed broccoli, and WOW was it great! 

The only downside for me was how expensive the mango daiquiri was... but hey I'm on vacation.
