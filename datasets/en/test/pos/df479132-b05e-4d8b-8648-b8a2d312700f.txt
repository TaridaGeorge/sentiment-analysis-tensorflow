Not sure about some of the reveiws that talk about bad service or mediocre pizza...... We were seated after a short wait on a Saturday evening and our waiter checked on us every few minutes without being intrusive...... We ordered two different kinds of Pizza and one Calzone and all three were excellent........  The biggest negative was that I ate WAY more than I should have!!!!
