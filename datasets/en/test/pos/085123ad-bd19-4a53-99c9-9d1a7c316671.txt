What an amazing event!  I think this was the first time that I couldn't find room in my stomach for everything!
The scallop dish was definitely my favorite!  They were perfectly cooked!  I also really enjoyed the calamari.  We had the chance to also sample some of their signature cocktails.  I'll be returning for those cocktails, but this time I won't be sharing.
