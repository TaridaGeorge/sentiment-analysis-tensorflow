CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe is a charming little restaurant located in Central Phoenix. The prices are reasonable and the food is delicious. They serve both Asian and Italian cuisine here but I haven't had the balls to order anything from the Italian menu. The last time I ate here with my boyfriend we ordered a spicy tuna roll, spicy pot stickers, and Korean spicy beef with noodles. Service was great and everything we ordered exceeded our expectations. Our bill was less than $30 including drinks! This is my favorite Asian restaurant to eat at because of the variety and the quality of the food.
