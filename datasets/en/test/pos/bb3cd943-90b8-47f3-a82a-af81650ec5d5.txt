FRESH (in season ingredients), FLAVORFUL,  healthier alternative without sacrifice!!!!! YES!!!! Check
Food (overall) GREAT!  Check

Good: 
Garlic Chicken Flatbread.

Tasty, awesome price and perfectly satisfied me:  
Spicy Tandoori Chicken Skewers w/ fresh mango chutney & cucumber herb raita (normally I don't like chutney but the mango was so fresh and flavorful I DEVOURED it) and normally with organic mixed greens salad (but I was hankering for the Kalymnos Greek Salad and they were fabulous to switch it for me).

Perfectly cooked, tender, mouth-watering w/ a kick-y drizzle of the chipotle sour cream:
Grilled Buffalo Steak w/green veg trio, fresh corn, roasted mushrooms and chipotle sour cream.
