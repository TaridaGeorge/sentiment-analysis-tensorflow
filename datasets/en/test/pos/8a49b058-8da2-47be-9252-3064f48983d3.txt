Okay, I went back to Bandera's after realizing that I missed out on the Cornbread skillet...and boy I am glad I did!!!!

The Cornbread Skillet was Heavenly SIN!!! Crunchy, creamy, so flavorful I am in LOVE!

My friend and I shared a few different items, and everything we had was top notch, not sure there is anything at Bandera's that isn't good. I find it hard to believe that a "Chain" Restaurant could have so many great dishes, but Bandera's has proven me wrong.

We also ordered the Roasted Chicken & Low Country Barbecue Beef Rib Combo with Coleslaw. The Chicken is amazingly flavorful. The Beef Ribs were fall off the bone moist. And the Coleslaw was out of this world!! Can I please have the Recipe for the Coleslaw!?!?!?

What a great Menu, not many choices but all of them great!
