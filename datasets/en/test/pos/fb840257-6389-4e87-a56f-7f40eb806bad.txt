Warm atmosphere, smiling faces and cold beer!  Oh and a great menu with excellent food. Try the meatballs and the mignulata. Very delicious. Pizza choices include tasty standards like sausage (from local favorite DeFalco's) and more trendy tastes like fig and goat cheese. I wish it was closer to home. We would have our own permanent table!
