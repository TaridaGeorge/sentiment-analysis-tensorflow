I love Eden's Grill Inn.  The food, the owners, the lunch special's....everything!  It is, without a doubt, some of the best Mediterranean food in town.  Their gyros are the real deal. A perfectly prepared pita, lots of seasoned beef and lamb, fresh onion and tomato. A side of creamy goodness and some of the best rice I have laid my lips upon and you've got yourself one mighty fine meal.  The gyros, chicken and beef kebab combination ($33) says it feeds two, but I think it would be more than enough for six NFL players or eight midgets...I mean, little people ( approximately seven average sized humans).  What a smokin' deal!  

Trust me when I tell you that you are doing your self a disservice if you don't check out Eden's.  They will not disapoint!
