I'm enjoying this USPS location. I found it to be very convenient. I appreciate the set up that the employers at this location are not behind an entire wall of bullet proof glass. It is very welcoming and I am looking forward to utilizing their services more often. 

Negative review of the entrance/exiting door. The handles are broken. I know we are suffering a severe budget cut, but let's get the handles replaced in working order. : )
