Switch, the sister to FEZ and Ticoz, does not disappoint.  I've tried a few things on the menu, but keep returning to the chicken with pesto risotto.  Yum!  Everything about this place is trendy but comforting.  Great drinks, great desserts, love the patio!

My only concern is that service has been really spotty.  Sometime great, sometime very very poor.  I'm not sure whether the servers are overbooked or what.  Luckily, I had a few drinks and enjoyed the extra time with my friends.
