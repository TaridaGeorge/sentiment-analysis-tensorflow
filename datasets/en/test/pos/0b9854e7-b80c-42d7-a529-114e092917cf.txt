Dresses and Blouses and Shoes - O MY!  Went to the VIP Opening Last nite - what fun: H&M knows how to throw and Opening Party!  (Officially opens July 22).

The kids dept.  was so much fun - makes me want to take my daughter to Paris Now!  Cute hats, jewelry, tights, dresses, and eveything sparkly!

Accessories galore.  (wish the shoes had higher heels). The prices were amazing for all the detail & style put into all the clothing.  

OK, might go back tomorrow :-)
