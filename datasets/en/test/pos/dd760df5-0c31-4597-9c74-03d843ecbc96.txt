I've waited too long to write this review.

Go here.  Now.  If you're reading this you should go there.  Seriously.  Take the day off early to make sure you don't have to wait.

Pizza is great, fresh and authentic.  We had also a deli meat/cheese plate and holy crap was that good.  My friend and I could have got another one of those if our wives would have let us.  It reminded us both of our trip to Italy and the quality meats there.

The ambiance is awesome here, but small.  It is an old house but they also have outdoor seating which I bet would be nice on cool evening.  

Seriously, this place is great.  Sad I didn't know about it sooner.

Oh, and the crepes...yum.
