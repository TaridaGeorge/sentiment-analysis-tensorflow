I was in Phoenix for a week for a parking tradeshow (yeah, it's pretty serious). My company rented a house on the corner of 6th and Roosevelt, so of course I saw Hey Joe! and had to go. OMG!!! I got the pancit and lumpia combo... I 'bout died it was soooooo friggin' good. It was the best lumpia I'd had since a Filipino friend had made me a whole bunch to freeze. The pancit was seasoned perfectly. PERFECT AMOUNT OF FOOD!!! And the guys behind the counter... THE BOMB!!! Found out it's a small world after all after speaking with them a bit. Can't wait to take my girlfriend to Phoenix and share this NoRoach-coach food.
