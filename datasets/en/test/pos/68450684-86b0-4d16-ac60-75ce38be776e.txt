We have been here several times with family and for the romantic dinner for two and found both experiences outstanding.  In Scottsdale we often forego inflated pricing for a sub par dining experience not so here.  While you will certainly pay top prices you will also get what you pay for.  Delicious steaks, sea food and interesting appetizers.  Did I say delicious I meant it!  Without doubt one of the best ribeye steak dinners in the valley cooked to perfection, tender and full of flavor and you can choose from 3 or 4 different topping schemes depending on your mood.  Fantastic decor great service need I say more.  If your in Cave Creek looking for a great meal search no further than Cartwrights.
