One thing about Phoenix is that it's near impossible to find French food, and good French food at that. Well, look no further than Au Petit Four. I'm French, so I've got to admit that I've got a bias for eating at a French place that serves real French food by French people. The owner is really cool and makes sure that everything is tip-top while you're eating. To be honest, everything is pretty pricey but it's totally worth it and I don't think that there's such a thing as cheap French food anyway.

Be sure to check out the quiche lorraine and to try one of the eclairs. The only thing that is painfully missing from this place is having a stock of Orangina in the fridge, but c'est la vie, non?
