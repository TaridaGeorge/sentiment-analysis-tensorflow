THIS PLACE?!?!?  YESSSSS!!!

Not only do I love it because it is blocks from my house...  but the food it GREAT for the price.  Good stuff here.

I know a LOT of Pho snobs and so I dont' know what they'd rate it but...  I am BIG on service, value and flavor...  Pho Thanh came with it ALL.

I had the Spring Rolls and the Combination Pho and with tip, paid about 11 dollars.  I need to eat here more...  =) 

My only complaint...  well WISH I should say...  is that I WISH they were open later.  =/
