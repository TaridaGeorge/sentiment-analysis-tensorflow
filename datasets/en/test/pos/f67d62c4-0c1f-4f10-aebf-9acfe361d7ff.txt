Came in around 2pm the place was empty. Which by the way is awesome. Its so much better not to have to rush in the line. The place was clean and very presentable. Service was good I think it was the manager who was making rounds and checking in on someone. Nothing bad to say this time had a great lunch with my family no complaints.
