I think this was the first restaurant we ate at when we came here house-hunting. We loved it, and have been back many times since.

Their Miersden(sp?) is awesome! As are the garlic fries. I don't think we've had anything there that wasn't very good.

By chance, a few friends and us ended up there for happy hour one Friday. They had some great specials, and we've been looking forward to visiting for another HH.

And just the view from the balcony is awesome. I love looking down on Mill Ave.
