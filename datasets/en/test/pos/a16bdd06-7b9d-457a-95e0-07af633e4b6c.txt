Camelback mountain is where my parent's got engaged ahhh!

Every once in awhile, in any season but summer, I come and attempt to hike camelback. I feel I am in decent shape, but this hike isn't a piece of cake. 

I prefer to stick to the easier trail on the mountain ( I can't remember the name) or just explore. Not just because it is more flat, but also it is way less packed. So you won't get run over my half naked joggers or bombarded with families trying to stick together. It's a much better trail to be able to enjoy nature and still has beautiful views. 

Parking is a you know what, and don't think you will be the only one who thought it was a good idea to come early. 

Beautiful mountain with awesome views!
