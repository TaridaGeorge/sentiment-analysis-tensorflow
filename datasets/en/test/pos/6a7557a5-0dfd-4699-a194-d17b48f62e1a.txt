Great place to spend the day with your kids and prices for everything, I thought, were cheap.  The little train ride was fun for me and my sons.  I would say we don't have anything that compares to this in Sacramento.  The things we do have are much more expensive and the value is not as great.  The playground area was huge and there was stuff for our 5 year old and 17 month old to play on.
