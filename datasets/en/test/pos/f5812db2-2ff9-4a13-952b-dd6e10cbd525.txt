Very clean workout and locker (unisex) facilities.  TV has lots of channels.  Stair machine was nice and challenging, and gave me a great workout.  Went on Sat moning a week ago and some of the equipment was unavailable because of a class but went back the next night and got to work on some of those machines.  Next door was a barber shop called "Phoenix Sons" (lol) that went out of business.
