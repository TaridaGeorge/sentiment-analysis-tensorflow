If you are Irish (which I am) and in Tempe, Az., this is home for you!!!  I loved the place.  Lots of Irish momentos, had some of the finest Guinness's mixed with other items.  For intance, had a Guiness with Cider (corwn float).  It made it tasty.  
Did not have food, (ate nearby).  But saw the menu had reasonable prices and the food was irishy.  The Bartender, Steve, was friendly and informative.  Everyone should stop in when on Mill St. in Tempe and have a Guinnes.  Slainte!!!!
