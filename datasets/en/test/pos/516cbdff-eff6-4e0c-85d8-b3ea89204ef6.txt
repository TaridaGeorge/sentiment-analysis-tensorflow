Amore is a great match of personality with great service and bar staff, the food is absolutely killer and it's locally-owned and operated so when the owner asks you how your experience was, he actually means it.

It's the best place in the 85255 to have some laughs, delicious food and great beer varieties.

Kicks the competition square in the rump.
