This place is a hidden gem. I had to beg my wife to try this place, because she is such a creature of habbit. She is so glad that I talked her into giving it a try. We shared a pulled pork bbq sandwich and salad. The food and service were above average in every way possible. The place is remodeled, so the dining area shows well. The updates are modern. I was amazed that we were the only ones dining. I think that once this place catches on it will be busy so check it out while it's still unknown. They have a nice selection of beer and there is also outdoor seating. We live very close by, so we will definatley be back!
