The Stetson Chopped Salad gets 5 stars.  Have to have it at least once per visit each year I'm in Scottsdale for Spring Training.  And, it is so easy to make at home.  An added plus - this year we ate at the bar.  When I ordered a third glass of champagne the pour, from the end of the bottle, was about an inch shy of full.  So, the bartender comp'ed it. :)
