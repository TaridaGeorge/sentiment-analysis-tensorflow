The food is great (bar food: hamburgers, wings, fish and chips etc) and its not to pricey, possibly the best food prices you'll find in old town if you are looking to go out. The coolest part of this bar by far is the night time activities. The 2x4 jenga, the gold fish races, the midget bar (the little women who runs it is actually a really hot little person), the wheel of drinks, the plunger: all amazing. 
I thought it would be funny to ICE a buddy of mine (get an unsuspecting person a Smirnoff Ice, which they then have to kneel down and chug) and the bar staff decided to ice me, the shenanigans are fantastic. Ill take this bar over the up-you-ass snotty clubs any day or night.
