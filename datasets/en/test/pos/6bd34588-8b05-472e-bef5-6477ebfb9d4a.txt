If you've never been to the Compass Room, treat yourself and go. If that seems too indulgent, invite someone from somewhere else as your excuse to visit one of Phoenix's premiere dining landmarks.

The Compass Room makes one full circle high over the city atop the Hyatt Regency downtown. The dcor is black-and-white minimalist with floor-to-ceiling windows. Of course, window seating is preferred and in demand. The food can be very-good or average-good, and the menu changes frequently. 

But frankly, you don't really come here for the food. It's the VIEW. And living in a boom town like Phoenix, there's always something new to see. From 1995-98, we watched the BOB going up. In 2004-05, the entire block below was buzzing with little ant-sized workmen and a giant crane for major expansion and refurbishment. What will the view be in 2007?
