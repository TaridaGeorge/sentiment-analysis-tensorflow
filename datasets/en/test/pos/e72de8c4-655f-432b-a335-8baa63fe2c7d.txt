Take the word "bowl" away, and it goes from crap to awesome.   

Very Benihana in nature, but I thought the food was superior to Benihana, and, best of all, $4 for a 22oz Kieren and sake.  Awesome deal.   

Of course, the table-side entertainment was fun.  They set the table on fire and made a volcano out of an onion.  Fun stuff.
