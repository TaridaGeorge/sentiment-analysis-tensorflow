If you are looking for the best rescue to adopt from for a Golden Retriever, this is it. Amazing, caring, experienced volunteers will work one on one with you to find you the perfect match. They are meticulous and are known for their high integrity. Loads of support will come every step of the way, from placing into your home, follow up calls on a regular basis, access to well known trainers and vets. I was so impressed with their care and dedication finding me a dog, that now I recommend them to everyone! And they need volunteers too.
