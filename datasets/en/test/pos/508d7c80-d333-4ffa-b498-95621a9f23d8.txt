Shea Village Lanes ROCKS!  The staff is super nice and the alley is clean.  I mean that is really all you can ask for with bowling alleys.  I have never had the food at this one so I can't comment on that.  But I have used the ladies restroom and it was tidy, big plus in my book.  It's been sort of  updated.  Bowling alleys will always be a bit behind in the modern look but I like it that way to tell you the truth.

Shea Village is kinda hidden on the NW corner of Shea & 32nd St.  You won't see the building right away but you will see the sign, so look for that.   And have Fun!
