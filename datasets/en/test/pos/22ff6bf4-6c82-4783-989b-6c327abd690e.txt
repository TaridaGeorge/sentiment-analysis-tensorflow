This is one of my favorite restaurants EVER!!  My husband and I came here 2 days before our wedding as our last date as an unmarried couple!  Our go-to meal includes: Bruschetta Board, Brie and Prosciutto Panini, and a Salted Caramel Sundae.  Everything is AMAZING!  It's also not just about the food but about the atmosphere; we love the easy going feel during the day, and the more upscale night crowd!  It's trendy without being pretentious!  We will always be great patrons of this place!
