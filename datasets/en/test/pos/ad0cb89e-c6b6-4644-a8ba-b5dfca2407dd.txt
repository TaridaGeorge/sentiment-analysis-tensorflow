This restaurant was awesome!  My husband David and I chose this restaurant for brunch based on the feedback/ratings in Yelp and, we weren't disappointed!!  The Chef had two items (Sweet & Savory) of which to choose from.  We chose the potato, spinach & mushroom frittata with chili rubbed pork tenderloin and it was wonderful!  We asked the Chef about the sauce and 
He told us how he makes it and offered to send some home with us.  Unfortunately, we 
are traveling so couldn't  even take our left overs.  We will definitely go back especially knowing that you can call in a reservation and speak with the Chef about any food allergies, etc. and he will accommodate!!  We also like that you can BYOB!!

Again, awesome restaurant, Chef and service!!!
