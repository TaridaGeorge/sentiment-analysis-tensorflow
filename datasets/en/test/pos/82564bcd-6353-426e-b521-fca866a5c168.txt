For so many reasons, Costco is top notch but I'm going to review their Opto department. They are equally as stellar! Dr. Tieu is super friendly, knowledgeable and very approachable. The retail part has the best pricing on contacts, frames and lenses compared to any competitor. Lucky me they take my insurance and my yearly supply of contacts came to a big fat $0 after rebates. Always ask about rebates for contacts, both the Dr office and the retail desk will usually have some that you can combine!
