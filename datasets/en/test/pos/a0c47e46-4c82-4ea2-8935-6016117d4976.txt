I always get 5 star service here.  I'm most often there when I stop by and get a coffee on the way to the farmers market early Saturday mornings and it's almost always busy!  Luckly, busy doesn't seem to matter the employees always have a smile and are ready for a quick chat while you order or wait.

This location does seem to be a few cents more then others though, even the one just down the street near Target is almost a buck less with 2 coffees.
