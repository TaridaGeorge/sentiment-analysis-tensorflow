This place is fantastic. Food made from scratch and daily specials that are unbelievable. Home made ice cream to die for. I am not sure why all of the knocks on the servers, we have been there a dozen times and have never had any issues. When it's just the wife and I we eat next door at Poppy's Place, same menu just quieter.
