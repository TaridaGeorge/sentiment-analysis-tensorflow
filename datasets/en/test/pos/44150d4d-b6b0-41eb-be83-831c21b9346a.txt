One of my top 5 restaurants in the Valley. Every time I've been there, service has been impeccable, the food amazing. Most recent visit....had the chopped salad which was perfect. I had the Braised Berkshire Pork, and it was intensely flavorful. Nice martini, too (the house gin is Plymouth, my favorite martini gin). Highly recommended!
