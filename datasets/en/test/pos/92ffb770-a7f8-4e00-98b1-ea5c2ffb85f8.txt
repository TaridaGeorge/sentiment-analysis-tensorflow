This is the Barneys of pet boutiques.  On a recent visit I bought a quilted coat with a faux fur hood and a raincoat for my new puppy.  As for toys, they have a stuffed pizza that says "Wolfgang Pup", a "Dog Perignam" squeaky champagne bottle and a "Jimmy Chew" shoe.  For pet lovers who consider their pets as part of the family.  They also make great gift baskets.
