Must admit I'm not a huge fan of Chinese food. Probably because most of the food is deep fried. But I have found a place that makes something I love! Szechuan Beef! Lots of fresh veggies, good tender beef and if you add the spicy sauce they have stored in the little drawers really spicy! We also ordered orange chicken, even though deep fried, I really enjoyed. Especially because of the broccoli served on the side steamed and not over cooked. The boys had pot stickers and ribs and were very happy. 

I didn't pay attention to the cost but dishes were about $9 a piece. Really friendly, happy, helpful service!
