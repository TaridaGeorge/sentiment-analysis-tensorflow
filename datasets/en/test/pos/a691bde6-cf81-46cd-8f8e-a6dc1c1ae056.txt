I can't tell you how many times I have driven past this place without giving it a second thought.  Today, I happened to be in the area and was craving a quick Chinese lunch.  This is one of the friendliest places around, and the subtle aroma of fresh Chinese food wafts toward you as you enter.

Seated immediately, I waited less than a minute for ice water and hot tea.  I chose the General chicken.  Spicy, crispy, full of flavor accompanied by crunchy egg roll and wontons.  That hit the spot!  Oh the soup was good too.  Service was attentive but not hovering. Got out of there for eight bucks....score!
