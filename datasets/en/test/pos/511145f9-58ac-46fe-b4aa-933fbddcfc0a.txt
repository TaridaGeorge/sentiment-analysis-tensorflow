Who in their right mind does not like Yogurt?  Well this place takes it up a notch by having a really fun atmosphere with old style tv shows playing and some unique decor from years past. 

The Yogurt is really the best part...and the flavors really pop here and are quite tasty.  I found even the Vanilla Bean flavor to be more tasty than other shops in the area.  Prices were reasonable and they do have a frequent customer program that does not require a card.  Worth a repeat visit!  And yes, this is five star worthy because for a yogurt shop, this is as good as it gets!
