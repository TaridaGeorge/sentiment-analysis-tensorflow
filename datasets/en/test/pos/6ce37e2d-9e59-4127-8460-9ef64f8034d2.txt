Thanks to Avis, I got my pink Nano back!

We received a phone call after returning from a car trip from Santa Monica asking if we lost an electronic device. Since Tim knows how much I don't keep track of my Nano, he assumed it could be that-I hadn't even unpacked my suitcase yet to know!

We played phone tag for a little while, finally they sent out the Nano double bubble wrapped in a padded envelope in excellent condition.

They could have easily not said anything about the Nano, they could have not returned our phone calls, they could have not sent the Nano so fast and so gingerly. But they did, and I thank the Lost & Found department, Bonnie and Kory, for their outstanding service!
