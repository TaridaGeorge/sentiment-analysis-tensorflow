Never disappointing!

I've been getting breakfast and snacks here almost 85% of this past month. My coworkers introduce me to this spot on day one of my new job. It seems I've become quite the regular as the very wonderful staff remembers me and treats me just as nice every time I come in. The breakfast burritos are to die for and man that salsa has kick! They keep me going on days when I'm pushed to a late lunch due to a pile of work that unexpectedly jumps up in my face.

Plus, I don't have to cross any major intersections to get to it. Nor do I have to walk that far. Always a plus in my book! Ladybug Cafe with your cute lil' ladybug decor, I will continue to frequent you as long as I'm employed within the area! :)
