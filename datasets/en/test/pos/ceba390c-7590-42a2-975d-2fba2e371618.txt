This place better every time I go there. I work just a few blocks away and have been on the hunt for smaller independent eateries. I ate here the first time and they were out of bagels so I got a sandwich on regular bread, which was alright, but I'm glad I gave it a second chance. The bagels are the best I've had, better than Chompies even. They use all boars head meats and other fresh ingredients. For lunch $7 (after tax!) buys you a sandwich, chips and a drink. 

Down side, polystyrene drink cups. Also the building makes it not overly obvious that it's a restaurant.
