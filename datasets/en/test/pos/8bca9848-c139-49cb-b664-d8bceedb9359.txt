We went in on a Sunday morning and the place was PACKED.  We didn't need to wait to long though (went over to the guitar store for a bit).  We were seated pretty promptly and ordered eggs Benedict and my boyfriend got biscuits and gravy.  The food was really tasty and the service was quick!  I would definitely come back here for the great breakfast and nice service.
