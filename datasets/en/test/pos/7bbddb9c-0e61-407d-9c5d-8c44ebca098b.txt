I can't believe that Yelp has a review for the Festival of the Arts!  The Mrs. and I have been going for years (even before we moved to Tempe) and it's always one of the highlights of the winter and spring seasons.  While most of the items for sale are admittedly expensive you can always look for deals on the last day and we usually score something nice for the house.  The atmosphere is always exciting, friendly and entertaining.  We love that we can walk to Mill Ave. and not have to try and find a parking spot!  Don't miss it if you can.
