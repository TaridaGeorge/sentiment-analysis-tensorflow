I have nice teeth, no cavities, no big gaps, nothing...just nice teeth. 
So, when I refer people to Dr. Tricoli, they say "you don't have any problems with your teeth--why would I listen to you?"
Because I have nice teeth....
And, a GREAT dentist!
The office is clean, relaxing, and friendly. 
The assistant is friendly and very thorough. 
The receptionist, Christi, is a doll and very nice and accomodating.
The dentist, Dr. Martin Tricoli is AWESOME!
He is not a "product or procedure pusher" and is top notch in his skills. 
He is friendly, fun (yes, I said fun) and professional. 
He'll clean your teeth and fix up your problems (I can say that now that so many of my friends trusted me and went to him) and will not push you into anything you don't need....and I love that!
