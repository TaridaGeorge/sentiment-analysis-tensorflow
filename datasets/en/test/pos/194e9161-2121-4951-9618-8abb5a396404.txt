Seriously the best ice cream/gelato I have ever had. I like ice cream, frozen yogurt, gelato A LOT. I have tried a ton of places but Frost is the most amazing frozen treat I have ever had. I would give 10 stars if I could. Not to mention the staff is SUPER FRIENDLY and extremely knowledgable. You can try as many samples as you want - and I have. Oh and its low calorie!!! Wahoo! I frequent Brio next door often for date night, but never get their deserts any more - we always head to Frost.
