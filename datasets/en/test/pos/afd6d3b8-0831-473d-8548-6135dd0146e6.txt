I was in town visiting some good friends for the weekend, and right after the leaving the Airport we ended up at FEZ for Lunch.  I loved the whole look of the place from the second we walked in.  Great space, and great vibe.  I ended up ordering the Tangier Burger which is a grilled angus burger with hummus spread, herb pesto, oven dried tomatoes, red onions & manchego cheese served on ciabatta bread.  I have to say it hit the spot!!!  I will definetly be hitting this place back up when I'm in town again.
