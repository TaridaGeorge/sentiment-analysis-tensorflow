I don't shop at Banana Republic. I never have, and I probably never will. HOWEVER, I did decide to purchase my bridesmaids gowns from Banana Republic and I have to say I have never experienced better retail customer service. 

To make a very, very long story short: 

The dresses I wanted were almost impossible to find. I ended up purchasing two from two separate locations and having one shipped from California. The associate at this store, Vicki, personally called and had it shipped for me. She was extremely patient and very helpful. I was absolutely shocked (and gracious!) at the outstanding customer service I received at this store. 

Thank you!!!
