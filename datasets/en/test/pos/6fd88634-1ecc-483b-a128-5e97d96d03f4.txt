I have been here many times over the years since it's close to my work. It's a nice break from some of the other neighborhood offerings. I generally like to treat myself to a breakfast burrito on the days when I have to go to work extra early since they open around the time I start getting hungry for food. These things are heaven in a tortilla. Absolutely love them. I always get the original with potato, egg, bacon and cheese. Thankfully today is an early day and I am headed over in a couple of hours to get one.
