New TVs going in behind the bar.  Wish they were even bigger.   Wish the TVs in the main restaurant area were bigger too.  They're like 22"-ers.

Free Wifi is nice.

Sometimes they don't answer their phones and it goes right to voicemail.

Owner is super nice.  Place opens early for soccer, and he said to knock on the door earlier for other games (i.e., baseball) that start before opening, as he's usually there and will open it up for you! Sweet!
