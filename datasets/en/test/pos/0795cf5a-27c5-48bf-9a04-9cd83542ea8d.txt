Our other restaurant changed their Egg Foo recipe. Bad. Then we found Tottie's! Good!
This place is beautiful, the staff is happy (always a good sign!) and you can feel the good vibes in the air when you come in. The ambiance is soothing and comfortable for chillin' with friends or meeting with whomever....Really classy place. I don't eat sushi as I'm a veggie, but they've got a sushi bar that my neighbor couldn't stop raving about. He's the reason we tried Tottie's and we are so glad we did! 
Also, be ready for a sweet surprise after dinner! Save some room, you will NOT be sorry! mmmm...
