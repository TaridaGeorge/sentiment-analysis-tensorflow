Loved it!  I've been looking for a Thai restaurant that was up north and my friend found it and we tried it last night... 

We had the Keow Num soup (wonton) which was EXCELLENT.  Mostly because it had cilantro in it, which is my favorite leafy green, being a Phoenix native.  It was nicely spicy as well... it was pretty great.  Presentation was awesome as well, just make sure to not light any napkins on fire.

For my meal, I had the Gaeng Keo Wan with chicken... EXCELLENT.  I couldn't stop eating it. hahaha  I love my curry and got a level three which was a perfect level of heat without blowing my head off.

I'm definitely going back.
