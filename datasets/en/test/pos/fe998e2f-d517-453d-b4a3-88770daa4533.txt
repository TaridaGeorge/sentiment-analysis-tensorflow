I really like coming here, everything is always superb! The hamburgers are quite large, and the dressings they provide on the condiment table are very nice. The onion rings and fries are nice and crispy, and cooked to order, just like everything else. I love the toothpick system the hamburger chef has for knowing which cheeses and toppings to put with which patties. Trying to decipher it keeps me entertained while waiting in line.

Hot dogs are just okay, they slice them in half and grill them like burgers, even serve them on a burger bun! I usually just stick with the hamburger, even the lil one is enough for me.
