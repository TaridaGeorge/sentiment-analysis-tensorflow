Delicious!  Housemade drink ingredients (tonic water and ginger ale) are a great touch in this town still thirsty for authentic mixed drinks.  I wouldn't call it a great bar, though, as it's a very intimate space.  I enjoyed the food immensely, though, and would love to return on a weeknight when it's not a zoo - partially attributable to our group, but there was enough of a crowd (and given the expense) that I probably won't make a strenuous effort to return immediately, but it's a great place, I'm glad I went, and I will be back eventually.
