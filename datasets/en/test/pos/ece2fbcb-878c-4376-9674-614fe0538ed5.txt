Decided to eat here after realizing Bianco is closed on Sundays. I have eaten here many times before and it is always consistently great.This time we started with the sangria because it's so delicious and refreshing. The only complaint about that if I have to find one is the pitcher they serve it in is big and heavy and it's hard to pour. We ordered the ceviche and it was wonderfully fresh. We ordered the sweet corn and goat cheese pizza and mushroom party and gladiator. They were all Delicious in their own unique way. I know I will never be disappointed at the big orange.
