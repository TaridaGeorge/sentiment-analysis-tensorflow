Lately it's been so difficult to find an honest auto repair shop.  It seems like all these ads say they're honest and family owned and you end up feeling ripped off or over sold on a repair you didn't need.  These guys at mercie j never cease to amaze me.  they tell me what's wrong but say that i have other priorities and things that need immediate repair.  I dig this about them!  Honest is an understatement for these guys.  

I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THEM FOR MAJOR REPAIRS AND MONTHLY MAINTENANCE! CALL ME IF YOU NEED TO ASK ME QUESTIONS ABOUT THEM 602.561.7575
