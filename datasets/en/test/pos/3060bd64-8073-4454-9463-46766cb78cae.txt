It was a short visit but I will certainly be back for dinner, I was there on Thursday night for their servers dinner.  Possibly the best taco's I've ever had, I can't remember better, and the Carlsberg was at the perfect temperature and the bartender was great.  What's not to love about this place, next time I'll have to come for the full thing!
