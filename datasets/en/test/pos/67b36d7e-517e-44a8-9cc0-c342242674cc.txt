Be sure to make reservations!

This place was a splurge and a wonderful experience for us.  We had reservations and did have to wait, the bar is small and on a Friday night we had to do some standing.  The staff was very attentive, whether waiting in the lounge or seated at our table. 

We tried escargot for the first time...I was glad I did, for the experience at least, and I was not disappointed.  Wen ordered the salmon and king crab...what could be better?  The salmon was so moist and he crab legs were perfection...especially since they crack table side, so you get to spend your time enjoying them rather than making a mess.

I knew I would have a great time and I certainly wasn't disappointed.  It's been a place on my radar for some time and it was worth the wait!
