I love port of subs! I stop in so much the employees know exactly what I want. The workers are always friendly, I've never had a bad experience. I usually get the #1 which is Ham, Salami, Capicolla, Pepperoni & Provolone Cheese on white bread. They have their own mayo/mustard mix which is awesome so you don't have too much mustard and end up ruining it. They may not have as many selections of veggies as their competitors but at least their meat isn't made out of cardboard like some giant chain sub shops (cough*subway*cough). If you're in the mood for a sandwich and you're around the area defiantly give Port of Subs a try
