I'm always happy to go to Windsor.  Fantabulous $5 cocktails till 5pm coupled with the deviled egg dip thing and mmmmmmmmm.....

The roulette peppers are also fun, and I've enjoyed the brown bag chicken sandwich.  Their patio is pretty good but, for whatever reason, here I like sitting inside more.  They also have a bike rack which they've placed in plain sight of the patio, which is something we need to see more of in Phoenix.
