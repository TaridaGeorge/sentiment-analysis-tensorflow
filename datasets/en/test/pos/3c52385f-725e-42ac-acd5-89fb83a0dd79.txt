Found this gem of a restaurant on restaurant.com and read the few yelp reviews before we decided to check it out. We were more then pleasantly surprised. 
They greeted us with complimentary miso soup and salad which was a nice first impression. They have a great variety of sushi rolls as well as Korean menu. We decided on two rolls and two entrees and we loved it all. The sushi is probably some of the best fish I've had in the valley. I haven't had fish that melts in your mouth since San Fran to be honest. 
Definitely check this place soon!!
