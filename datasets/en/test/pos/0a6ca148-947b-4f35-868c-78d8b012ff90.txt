I was visiting from out of town and stumbled upon this place while checking out Mill Ave. Best discovery ever! We were there on a Monday which happened to be 1/2 off bottles of wine. The bartender, Dulia, only works Monday but try to go see her, she's very friendly and knowledgable. We started with the bruschetta plank (you pick 4 types and get 2 of each) and took Dulia's suggestions for dinner (I had a turkey,brie, and fig sandwich that I still dream about) and dessert. The dessert was amazing: a fresh baked, deep dish macadamia nut cookie with banana, caramel ice cream. It tastes like fresh baked banana nut bread. So delicious. Stop by id you're in the area. You wont be disappointed.
