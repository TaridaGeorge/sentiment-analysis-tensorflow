Love. So great.
I had the secret bbq chicken sandwich- mock chicken with caramelized onions and peppers in espresso bbq sauce with vegan mayo and thyme fries. Hubby had the Texas mushroom po boy. Both really great tasting, soft bun- messy, good stuff! We also had the crab puffs- very tasty.
I headed next door to Nami to get some iced coffees and a oatmeal cookie sandwich and peanut butter cupcake to go. Also totally fabulous! 
Will be back for sure.
