I love this place!  I know sounds crazy since it's a dentist but I can honestly say it is the best one I have been to. I really don't like going to the dentist but since I  started here a few years back it doesn't bother me anymore.  Very clean, relaxing and I actually laugh when I am here. Everyone is exceptionally nice. The dentist does not push any unnecessary procedures or products, just very honest.
