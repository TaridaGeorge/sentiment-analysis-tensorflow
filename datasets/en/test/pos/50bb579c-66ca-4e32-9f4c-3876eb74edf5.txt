Possibly the best burger I've ever had--definitely the best I've had in Phoenix.

I get the classic, which comes on brioche with a choice of cheese. It's the only thing I've ever ordered there, because it's so damn good I can't pass it up. 

AND they get their beef from humanely raised, grass-fed cows. And beer selection, and the fries with aioli... Well, others here have told you how good they are.

Pro tip? Throw a little of that aioli on your burger, too. Oh, and come hungry--it's a generously sized burger.

It's a little pricey, but Delux is a really delicious treat.
