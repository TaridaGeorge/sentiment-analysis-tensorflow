LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the W!! It's my first time staying there so I notice all the little details / services provided by the hotel staffs, so I think this hotel fully deserves the 5 star rating.  All the staffs I met at the hotel were very friendly, approachable, not pretentious at all.  I think the pool on the rooftop is definitely a draw for me, being able to enjoy the sun at 6 in the morning in the pool is pretty neat.  

I didn't think my room was too tiny, I think the room layout is very different than most of the hotels I've been to, but it has that minimalist edgy feel to it, which i love.  I would book this hotel in a heartbeat!
