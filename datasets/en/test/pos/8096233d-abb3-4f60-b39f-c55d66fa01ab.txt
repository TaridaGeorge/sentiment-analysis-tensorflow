Selection. So many frozen yogurt flavors and toppings. By the way, this is yummy frozen yogurt, not the frozen yogurt that literally tastes like they took some Yoplait and froze it. My personal favorite is the coconut flavor...it's nice and light and perfect to top with all the different fruits (fresh strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, kiwi, etc...). I also like the small cheesecake bites and fruity pebbles. Yes, fruity pebbles. I always thought people were odd for putting this bright cereal all over their yogurt but I now get it. It adds texture and crunch and an extra fruity flavor. The cups are unfortunately large therefore you can't help but to fill them. I usually end up getting way more than I need. The prices are good and this can be a less fattening way to get a sweet treat mixed into your day. YUM-O!
