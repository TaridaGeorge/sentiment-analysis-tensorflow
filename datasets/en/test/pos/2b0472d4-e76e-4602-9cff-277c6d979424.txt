Encanto is a ton of fun for kids and adults alike. 

You can rent a paddle boat or feed the ducks. Or simply stroll the spacious grounds and soak up the oasis of water, grass, and decades-old shade trees.

For a fun day or birthday party or special day with the kids, head over to Enchanted Island, thekid-sized amusement park. Rides are only a buck or two a pop.
