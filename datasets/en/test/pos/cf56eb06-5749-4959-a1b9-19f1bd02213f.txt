1st time here. Impressed with the food. Yummy and tasty. 

Crepe was very good. We had one with salmon. Ok I am a salmon slut do if it's good I will love it. This did not disappoint. Also had flammenkuchen. Wonderful. Ki
D of like a white pizza with better crust. 

Didn't try the fondue cause I am not a fan, but will come back with friends so hubby try. 

Give it a try was nice. Oh yeah they also had a singer which was very pleasant surprise. Nice atmosphere
