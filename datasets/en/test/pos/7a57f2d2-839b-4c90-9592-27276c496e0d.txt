This place is one of the best sushi places (if not the best for their variety and made to orders) we have ever been to.  Each visit, we order something new (and we've been coming here once a week for several months now).  The cut and quality of the sashimi is consistent, the rolls are always prepared immaculately.  The miso soup is perfect.  Do not believe the negative reviews.  Believe the reviews of those of us who come here on a regular basis to enjoy fine quality sushi.  I have never seen this place short staffed, nor have I had a roll that fell apart because it wasn't prepared properly.  We have never waited long for our food, ever.
