This is the best local sushi spot I've ever been to... and I have been to ALL of them. There is nothing like this place... such a fresh, authentic, flavorful taste to every roll and all of my girlfriends agree. It's such a hidden gem, surprisingly. When we found this place, we didn't know what to expect. After one happy hour session and tons of rolls later, we were ECSTATIC. It's so close to home, too. I love love LOVE this place!
