My original review seems to have disappeared...

Anywho, love these guys. I was introduced to their deliciousness at Yelps pleYdate. A few months later I contacted them about cupcakes for my husbands birthday. Lana was so awesome. She tweeked one of her delicious recipes specifically for us. Our fave shot is an Irish Apple (Irish whisky instead of Crown Royal) so she turned her Washington Apple cupcakes into Irish Apples, and they were soooooo delicious. We also got the Irish Car Bombs, so good. Lana even worked w/ me on a time and place to pick them up! My husband was super surprised and thought they were absolutely great. Success!!!

Affordable prices, delicious product, and awesome people. Could you ask for anything more?
