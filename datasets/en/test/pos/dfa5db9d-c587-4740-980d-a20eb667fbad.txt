Hey, why oh why can't you be in California?  There should be a law requiring one of these near my house.  It's not fair.

Food Network turned me on to these incredibly creative entrepreneurs and so they were on my list of "must try next time I am in Phoenix".  After experiencing other ice cream shops in the area, and trust me, I tried many, this wins hands down.  Their ice cream is top notch, creamy, good.  I especially enjoyed the vanilla almond crunch (they sneak cinnamon into the mix), and the basil lime sorbet. 

Can't wait for my next trip.  Sweet Republic, you rock!
