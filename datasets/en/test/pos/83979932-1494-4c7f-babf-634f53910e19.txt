Up until this point, I had lived 26 years without ever trying Scandinavian food. It wasn't until this past weekend that I ventured out and tried something different. Beaver Choice, as the reviews suggest, definitely didn't dissapoint. I took a chance on the schnitzel and fell in love immediately. My girlfriend, ordered the meatballs and also loved it. Without a doubt, this place has great food at reasonable prices.

If you're looking for something different I highly recommend Beaver Choice.
