My Brother who lives in Chandler took my Mom and Me to the Lux Cafe and I loved the food, I had the Kentucky Hot Brown which was very tasty and my Mom and Bro. had the Pot Pie which was huge and very good as well, the dessert we had was also yummy (it was not cheesecake). When I arrived I mentioned that this place looks just like the Cheesecake Factory I'm sure it's a sister w/a slight different menu, I will definitely return, lucky for me there is one in Beverly Hills...
