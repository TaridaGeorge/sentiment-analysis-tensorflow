First off I LOVE this place! I have never been disappointed with the food or service. If you love breakfast food this is your place. You have to try the Salami Scramble with home fries (which are the best damn potatoes this side of Idaho). 
Also, if you're lucky the special of the day might be the eggs benedict that are making me hungry just thinking about them.

If you get there around 11:00 am be prepared to wait but they will seat you pretty fast. The customer service is great and the prices are cheap! Don't come here if you want a healthy breakfast because it won't be but it will be some of the best breakfast food you will ever have!
