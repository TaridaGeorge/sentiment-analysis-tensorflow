If you live within 10 miles of this place and don't go at least once a week, you are doing yourself a disservice. Every time I am in the area, I MUST drop in for a bingsoo. It never disappoints. The word "refreshing" comes to mind every time. Can't go wrong with mango, pineapple, strawberries, with mango sauce. Top it off with boba and you've got the best dessert around. Seriously, you need to go... now.
