You can't go wrong with Waffle House. Come here for their waffles and everything else on the menu. My favorites include the raisin toast with apple butter spread, grits, the eggs, bacon, sausage and not to forget their famous hashbrowns. Scattered, smothered and covered is my favorite way to go. Bert's chili is also great too! This is a great place to go 24/7. The place is a bit tight but I prefer this over Dennys anyday. I wish there was WH in California but these are abundant in Arizona and all over the south. Not so much in Texas though.
