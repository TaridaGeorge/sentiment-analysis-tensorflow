Love fancy Fry's!  This was my usual location before the remodel, I was not happy about having to go to another store for 6 months but it was well worth it. This store has the best selection of anything you are looking for.  The staff is super friendy and polite.  I love that they often hand out samples like Costco, hope this doesn't go away after it's been open for awhile.
