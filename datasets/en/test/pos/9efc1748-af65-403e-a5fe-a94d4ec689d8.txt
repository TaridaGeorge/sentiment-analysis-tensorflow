Two visits here and no complaints. They really are fast and very knowledgeable. 

Normally I wouldn't advocate health care that takes less time than pizza delivery, but on my last visit, the physician figured out a problem I had seen my primary care physician for two times without any headway- and sent me to the ER where they said my gall bladder needed to be out post haste. He also recommended not driving myself since the pain tends to ramp up quickly and he was right on that count as well.

Quick, professional, and thorough!
