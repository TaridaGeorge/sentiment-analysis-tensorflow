This is a New York style deli with meats sliced to order with a wide variety of hero options and daily specials.  
Hours are 6am to 5pm M-F

If you work or live in the downtown area near 1st Ave & Adams, you've gotta try the Hero Factory. I'm making my way through the menu one hero at a time with a visit at least once a week and enjoying every bite of it too.  These are honestly the best hero subs I have ever had in my life. The portions are huge, enough to share with a friend.  Not only is the food awesome but the people who run this shop are very cool. They put a lot of heart into every meal they serve with great appreciation.

Need a recommendation? 
Try the Godfather- Italian meats on toasted garlic bread...It's to live for!
