Their Feta Shrimp Salad is my favorite.  It's by far the best Greek salad I've ever had.  There are tons of vegetables, the perfect amount of shrimp - grilled just right, and the pita they serve with it..delicious.  

The service is a little slow at lunch time because they get a rush hour thing going on.  1pm it clears up a little.  The staff is great though, very friendly and totally accommodating.
