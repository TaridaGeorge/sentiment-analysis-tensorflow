If you're from NYC (like me), and you're looking for a good slice, then you should try Ray's.  I've been to a couple of Ray's around PHX, and they are consistently good... at least as good as you're gonna get if you're looking for a pizzeria style slice- not fancy schmancy or thin crust or some other non NYC authentic corner pizza.

Perfect cheese to sauce ratio for my taste.  And good bbq wings.

I recommend ordering a pie on your way home from work, and get it to go to enjoy at home.
