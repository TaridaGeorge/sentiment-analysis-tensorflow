Great burger-they never skimp on the fries and the buns are never stale.
I could do without the dine in however, it's usually too busy to sit down and enjoy a meal. I just take it home.

You can pay a lot more at other boutique burger joints (Coal Burger leaps to mind), and get a lot lesser of a product.
