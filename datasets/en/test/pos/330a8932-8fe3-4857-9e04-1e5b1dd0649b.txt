The weather is warmer so Froyo is on my mind a lot lately so we decided to visit Golden Spoon and they did not disappoint; well maybe a little cause they were out of Banana. The lady in front of me in line got the last of it, WTH was I gonna choose now. So I asked for a taste of Chocolate and the Peanut butter and they were yummy so I mixed them with Heath Bar Bits and Almonds. It was so good, I will have to choose that combo again.  This place is not self serve and during my visit there was only one counter person and she was busy, but she was nice and efficient. I think Golden Spoon is my favorite Valley Froyo spot the taste can't be beat.
