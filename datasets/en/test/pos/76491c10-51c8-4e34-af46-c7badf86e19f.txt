I hold coffee in high regard, well above religion, food, and everything else.  So when I find a place that makes a truly fantastic espresso, I'm very surprised.  This is certainly in the top five that I've had anywhere in the world.  When you get a macchiato it is not only made with perfectly thick foam, but they give you a nice design on top for that visual appeal.  


On top of that the shop is well lighted because of the big windows and looks clean and inviting.  I use it for short meetings in the area or to get a little work done, and find myself energized and comfortable when I'm working there.
