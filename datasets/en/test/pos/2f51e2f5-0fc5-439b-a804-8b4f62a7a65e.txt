Went back again on two subsequent Scottsdale trips. It doesn't matter how far we have to drive, who we can get to go with us, we are going here. And this place never lets us down. The boba pearls on my BingSoo are perfect. The fruit is SOOO fresh. And now they know that Travis buck and one of the players from the Dodgers come here and proudly display their autographed ball caps. I love this place and will make a special trip out here every time we go!
