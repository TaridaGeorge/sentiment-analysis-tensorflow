We just love the Phoenix Zoo.  The layout is perfect -- you can spend all day here, or choose a loop and just spend an hour or two.  This is ideal with young families.
i love the little extras for the kids - play areas, the petting farm, water play.

This zoo is always improving.  We bring our out-of-town families here on an annual basis, and they always notice that something is new and imrpoved.

I think that the membership to the zoo is a fantastic value.
