Very nice family owned restaurant. They are always polite and friendly. They remember regular customers and make a point to come over and say hello. 

They prepare and serve authentic Vietnamese food and everything on the menu is delicious. I recommend the Pho over anything but honestly, you can't go wrong.  The prices are right. The place is always clean. It is a great place! 

It is tucked away in a random shopping center, but trust me, it is worth the trip!
