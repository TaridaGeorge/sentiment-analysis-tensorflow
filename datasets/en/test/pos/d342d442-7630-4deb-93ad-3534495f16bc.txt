Who know you'd find this in the desert??  Pizza Heaven! Pie Paradise!  Bianco is blissful!  Was on my list for a while.  Finally stopped in for dinner before an event at a nearby arena.  Got there at around 6 to beat the crowd.  Charming old building with a hip fun atmosphere.  Service was timely and very personable.  Recommendations were thoughtful and relevant.  The food was AMAZING.  We split a salad and the sausage pizza.  I didn't want it to end.  I could have just eaten the sausage and been happy.  The crust and the smoky flavor from the pizza oven threw me over the edge.  Highly recommend just for the flavor.  Throw in great location and awesome service and you have the trifecta!  It is important to note that this is a very small place with just a few tables and a small bar.  Not ideal for big groups.
