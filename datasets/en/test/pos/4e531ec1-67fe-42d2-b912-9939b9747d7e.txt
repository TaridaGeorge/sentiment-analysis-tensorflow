Genesis is the absolute best. I've gone to her for more than a year now, every 3-4 weeks, and the cut is consistent and awesome. Her attention to detail separates her from any other stylist I've ever gone to.

If you're a guy and you care about your hair, you can't do better than Genesis for a cut. Not cheap at $35 + tip, but it's worth every penny.
