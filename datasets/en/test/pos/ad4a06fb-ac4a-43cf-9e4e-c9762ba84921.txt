My favorite breakfast joint in AZ. I always come here when I am in town visiting. Get here early cause this place is always busy. Although I never get their lunch items, I hear they are just as good. I am a sucker for breakfast so I always order it, no matter what time of day. 

Their special board always has something good on it but my favorites are their Omelettes and their cinnamon rolls. The French Toast is great too. 

The staff is always so nice and the prices are great. I love this place.
