My dear Haji-Baba, oh, how I miss you so! Best chicken shwarma plate in Arizona. Best falafel, best prices, and best dolmas. Great people, good service, and an awesome middle eastern grocery store attached to the dining room. Cheap eats, but huge quality. You can get a great falafel sammy here for under $3. Middle of the day, there's a short wait, but it's worth it. They've also got great baklava. Definitely something I crave on a near-weekly basis.
