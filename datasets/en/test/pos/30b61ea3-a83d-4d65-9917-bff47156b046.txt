I came here for lunch and was able to try their Pad Thai. It comes with Shrimp and Chicken as well as your choice of soup or salad. We got it with Medium Spice and it was not too spicy. The lemonade was good also but no free refills. I would suggest this if your in Arcadia and looking for great priced Thai Food.
