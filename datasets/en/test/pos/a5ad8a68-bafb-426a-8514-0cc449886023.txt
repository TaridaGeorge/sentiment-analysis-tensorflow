One of the best 'za joints in the PHX. 

No corkage and BYOB so the pizza wont be the only thing that is deliciously sauced... cheesy... my pun not the pizza... well the pizza too. 

Both the thick crust and thin crust are amazing, i prefer the thin. Large sausage, onions, and shrooms with a few cheap bottles from Safeway across the street = a night of fun for all your friends.  I have NO idea what people are hattin' on the 'nato's for, it is nearly perfect pizza. They also have great huge grilled sandwiches and fresh salads.
