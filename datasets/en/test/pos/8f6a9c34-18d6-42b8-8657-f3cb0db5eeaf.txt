My husband and I had dinner here last night and the food is fresh and amazing! I've not had Chinese food this good in a very long time. My husband isn't really into Chinese food and I can call him a skeptic but he wanted me to tell all you yelpers that this place has the best Chinese food he's ever had. (and mind you he's really picky) We will definitely come back to this place and the service is awesome!
