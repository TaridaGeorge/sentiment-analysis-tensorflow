I walk in here with the intentions of getting an egg salad sandwich, when the three people in front of me order a "straw" sandwich.. basically pastrami, sauerkraut, melted cheese and bread.

Damn that sounds good!!

So i end up getting the same thing with a side of fresh fries and a pickle.

These sandwiches are big enough to share with someone, but with me starving like I was, I quickly polished off the entire thing.  it was yum.

I used to go to the one that was at Christown, but it's been closed for many years.  I was happy when they opened up this location.  It's right next to work, so that helps.

I will be back!
