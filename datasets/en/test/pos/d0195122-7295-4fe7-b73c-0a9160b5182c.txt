Good lord, people, it's Chuck E Cheese, not Picazzo's... I think we all know what to expect from this place.  Who cares what us adults think, our kids think it's a five star joint, and that's super awesome in my book.  

The pizza has actually gotten better from recent years, in my opinion.  This location is super clean and updated, the employees are attentive & friendly, and there is a good variety of games & activities.  

My daughter wanted to eat her birthday dinner on a Wednesday here & we all had a blast.  It's really what you make of it.  How can you be miserable in Chuck E's presence, anyway?!
