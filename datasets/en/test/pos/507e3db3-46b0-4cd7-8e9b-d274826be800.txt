My wife and I had dinner in the main dining area of the restaurant which looks like a cross between a New Orleans oyster bar and a Steak house. 
 The place was clean and comfortable, especially the large booths. They also have a laid-back bar  area with an raw oyster bar as well as outdoor dining.  
We started with some sushi (eel and shrimp) which was excellent and well presented.
We were there for lunch, I had the Seafood Cobb Salad and my wife had the Salmon Summer Salad.  Both entrees were excellent.
The service was good and we didn't feel pressured by the wait staff.  
 A good experience and we will be back when we get hungry for fresh seafood.
