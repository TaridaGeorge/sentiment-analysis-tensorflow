Washing my car is something I hate doing. As a matter of fact I never do it. I think this is because of my former career as a M1A1 tank driver. We were responsible for cleaning that beast. Needless to say, I hate cleaning vehicles.

Thank God for this Weiss Guys!

Their rates are reasonable if you use coupons or former receipts. And the job they do seems satisfactory for me. But I am not the pickiest person either. As long as my truck looks semi-descent then I am happy. 

Having a starbucks next door helps to pass the time as well.
