This is one of the best pizza's in town! I've driven by this place for years and finally went there with a friend and was completly surprised.  It looks small on the outside but it's a pretty big place inside.  When you order a pizza they bring out half of it at first then the other half when you're table is ready. Great service and delicious food! Definelty a must try atleast once, but I'm pretty sure you'll be back for more!!
