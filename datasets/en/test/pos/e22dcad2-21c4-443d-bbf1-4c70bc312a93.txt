My girlfriends and I happened upon this restaurant when we were in town for our annual spring training trip. We will def be back! 

Our friend is vegetarian and even though it doesn't have some veg options ont he menu, the hostess kindly told us that the kitchen was able to work with her and offer some vegetarian suggestions. Score!

We all shared a mix of salads, pastas, appetizers and desserts... Seriously, we all fought over the last bites and we nearly licked the plates! Even the salad was amaze-innngg... It's tough to make an ordinary salad fantastically yummy and "new."

Our waiter was incredible and very knowledgeable and the manager was just as kind when we told him how incredible the restaurant was.

We were so pleased with our experience. We are def fans and will be back for another girls night dinner! :)
