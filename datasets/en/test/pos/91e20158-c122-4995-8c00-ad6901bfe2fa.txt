Bandera is one of my favorite places to bring visiting out-of-town guests because the service is consistently "best in class". The Bandera Baby Back Short rack of ribs is the best I've had from anywhere in AZ. On this evening, my guest Sheldon had sliced sirloin and enchiladas which were excellent, both in presentation and flavor.  There are lots of restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale, and many of them are very, very good... But, I keep going back to Bandera because of their incredibly consistent high quality service and a menu that may be less variety than most people are used to seeing, but which every single entree is excellent.  Plus, I seem to run into a lot of the PHX Valley's movers and shakers in this establishment while dining there or hanging out at the excellent bar that seems to be quite the hot spot.
