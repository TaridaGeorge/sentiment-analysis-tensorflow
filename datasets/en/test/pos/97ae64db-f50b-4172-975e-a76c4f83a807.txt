I have wined and dined here on several occassions and have enjoyed it every time.

Favorites include: Baked Brie, Baked Goat Cheese and Marinara, Prime Rib Sliders, Three Cheese Panini and The Cheese Board (great cheese selection) is just perfect when sampling the wines!

Highly recommend the wine flights : )

The staff are friendly and the atmosphere is great. Patio is nice on a cooler afternoon/evening and inside is cozy at night.
