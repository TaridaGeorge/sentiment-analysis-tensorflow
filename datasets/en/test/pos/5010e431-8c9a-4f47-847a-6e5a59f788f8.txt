Great home-cooked style breakfast/lunch diner.

I LOVE the pancakes and syrup here! I have eaten them so many times. I think they are just from Krusteaz mix, but I can't make them at home like they do. Not even close.

Their omletes are big and tasty, stuffed with great ingredients of your choice.

Most of the dishes are hearty and tasty. Nothing fancy, but definitely WAY better than I dare say IHOP or Denny's? Ya, it's not even a comparison.

I'm not a fan of the much celebrated cinnamon roll. It tasted a bit sour and bland to be honest.

Most of the staff are friendly, though usually busy.
