Pitta Souvli is without a doubt my favorite Greek restaurant in the Valley. It is locally owned, has fantastic customer service and the food is amazing. I am a vegetarian and this place always has delicious options for me. However, pre-vegetarian days were filled with their tuna salad which is out of this world :) Don't miss out on an order of the greek fries when you visit!
