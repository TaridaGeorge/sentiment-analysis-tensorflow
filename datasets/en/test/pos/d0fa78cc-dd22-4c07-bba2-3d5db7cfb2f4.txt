Very good California Pizza Kitchen location, one of the best I've been to. If you're a beer drinker, ask about any specials on tap. This is one of the largest CPK locations I've been to as long as the patio is open. I'd say stick with the pizza rather than the pasta, also the pizza is far better with the honey wheat crust. There is usually a mushroom pizza which is the best choice.
