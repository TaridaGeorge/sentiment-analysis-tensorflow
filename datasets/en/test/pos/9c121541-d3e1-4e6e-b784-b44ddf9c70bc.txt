Great steak with very reasonable prices. I had the filet with prawns and 2 sides for $26 what a great value.  Comes with homemade breads and pesto garlic dip, and bacon corn bread.  The only downside is very small restaurant and you can hear the casino slots ringing during your whole meal.  Will be back soon.
