This was my first time at a Pei Wei and I was thoroughly impressed. I had the spicy chicken, my wife had the honey chicken, and both were excellent.

Probably the most surprising was the vegetables. There were pea pods and carrots in the meal and they were perfectly cooked. 

Last but not least, the crab wontons, don't miss them, they are exceptional. More crab than any I've ever had before.

The service here was also impressive. Since it was our first time it took us quite a while to order, and the cashier was very patient and helpful. The table attendant was also great, making sure we had everything, and very friendly. 

Don't know if all Pei Wei's will be this good, but my first experience was excellent.
