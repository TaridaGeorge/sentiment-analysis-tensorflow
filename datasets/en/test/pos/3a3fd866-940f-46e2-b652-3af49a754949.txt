I've been to the Hotel Valley Ho for a couple events, have used their spa once before during Arizona Spa Week and been to a their lounge bar and their restaurant. I am in love with the hotels' retro decor. Cool and classic with little spaces to lounge and enjoy a cocktail. The staff always seems attentive and helpful. 
Last night we ended here for our SanTan Brewery bicycle booze cruise and enjoyed music and drinks by the pool. Although we were enjoying mostly SanTan beers I tried one of their patron margaritas which was large and green and potent.
Thanks Valley Ho for  welcoming all us rowdy pub crawlers with open arms.
