The food and beer here is the same as at any other BJ's location--consistently solid. The customer service at this location is excellent, however. My friend spilled her beer while trying to maneuver into the booth, and the manager not only replaced the beer, but found her a BJ's t-shirt in the back to wear home.  Totally above and beyond the call of duty.
