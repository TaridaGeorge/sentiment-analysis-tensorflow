WOW! I cant believe I had never been here before! I'm usually not a big fan of Scottsdale night life, but this place was sooo great and totally unique! I had such a fab time dancing and jamming away to this sick jazz band who totally rocked! Plus my sparkling wine flights were delish! I loved the mixed crowd and decor too. Will be back for more soon.
