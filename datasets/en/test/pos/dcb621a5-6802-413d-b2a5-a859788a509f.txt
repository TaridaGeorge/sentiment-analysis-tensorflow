My couch cushions were getting flat so what's a guy like me to do?  Stuff them myself with old newspapers? Yeah right, but I did think of that.

They knew exactly what the problem was and the proper way to stuff them.  They are actually better than new.  They charged $65 per cushion, but I thought it was a fair price since it's way cheaper than a new couch.

It looks like the service I used them for is just the tip of the iceberg.  They repair, restore, and recover about anything.
