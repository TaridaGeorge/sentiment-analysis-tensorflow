Great breakfast food!  Small, cozy and a fun place to meet friends up in Carefree, AZ.  Seating indoors and outdoors.  There is a very small section for pets, so if you have a dog, there is a separate patio area with two small tables.  First come first serve but well worth it if Fido likes to eat with you!
