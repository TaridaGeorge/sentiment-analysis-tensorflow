This restaurant is an ABSOLUTE gem of the arts district down town! My husband and I rode the light rail with our bikes in tow when we found Breadfruit. What an excellent choice. Craig, our server was fantastic and helped us pick out the perfect dinner and drinks. We ordered the fish of the day (red snapper) prepared with their custom seasoning and their house salad. With a red strip and their signature Jamaican mojito, we were in food heaven. And just when I thought it couldn't get any better, we ordered a chocolate souffle and ice cream for dessert. Everything was just perfect.....The fish was the best we had EVER had, the drinks were exceptional, the atmosphere was great for our date night, and the service was on par. We loved our experience and highly recommend you check it out. What a great place!!
