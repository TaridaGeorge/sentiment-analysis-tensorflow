If you or the person you take out knows and loves authentic & very fresh sushi at very reasonable prices then this is the place to go. The chefs behind the bar speak Japanese and not Spanish. While they don't do alot of fancy custom "Americanized" rolls like some Scottsdale douche was complaining about, their sashimi is amazing! Try the Toro "fatty" tuna and the seared tataki is the best I've ever had (Over 80 diff sushi places coast to coast)
 
Of all the places I've ever had sushi if I could only pick one to eat at on a regular basis then Kampai would be that choice hands down.
 
When I do out on a date this is one of my top choices of places to eat.
