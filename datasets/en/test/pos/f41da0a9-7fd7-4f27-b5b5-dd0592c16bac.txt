Great energy and tasty food.  If you can find parking and a seat, it's a great place to come and grub on a lazy Sunday.  Had the Thai Chicken Salad, and the spicy ahi, while the wife had the veggie burger.  Great place.  I've eaten here twice in the last week.  I see  what the obsession is all about.  You just feel cool when you eat here.
