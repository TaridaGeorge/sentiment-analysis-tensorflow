This is close to school and our preferred spot for a quick bite in between class. 

The jalapeno cilantro hummus is delicious, as is the roasted red pepper hummus and the regular hummus. 

I have had both the falafel and spicy chicken wraps, and they both certainly delivered. Beware- They are HUGE! I took the other half home for dinner both times.

The staff is always friendly, always accommodating our large groups and splitting our checks for us without a moan and groan. 

BTW- they have options for vegans, vegetarians and carnivores. This place is good for all!
