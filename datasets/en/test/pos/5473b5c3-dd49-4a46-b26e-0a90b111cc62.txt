Found this seamstress on Yelp and since she wasn't too far from my house and had such great reviews, I decided to give her a try.  I am SO glad I did!!

Valentina has done everything from shorten a dress, take in some pants, repair a rip, re-line a dress, etc. for me.  Her prices are incredible, her turn around time is great (a few times she has worked hard to get me something I needed repaired right away), and she is extremely friendly.  I won't trust my repairs to anyone else!
