The lunch buffet at Yummy Buffet is cheap. But that's not a bad thing! I use this buffet to benchmark the value of other restaurants in the Valley. Even though it's dirt cheap, the food selection and quality are on the same level as other $9-$10 lunch buffets. It's even better than some of the chain restaurants in Arizona.

I went to the Elephant Bar with a friend last week and she ordered the sweet and sour chicken for $12+tax+tip. It came with a side of rice. The food did not taste good. You don't realize how awesome Yummy Buffet is until you purchase a terrible meal at a restaurant. The $12 that she had wasted could have fed 1.85 people at Yummy Buffet.

Overall, if you're going to out to lunch  with friends, family members, poor college students, church goers, Yummy Buffet is an excellent place to eat.
