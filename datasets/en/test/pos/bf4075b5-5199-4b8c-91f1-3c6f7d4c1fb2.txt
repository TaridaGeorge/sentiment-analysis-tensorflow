I have been a Sutra regular for almost a year now, almost as long as they have been open, and have been meaning to write this review for almost as long! I have done yoga at all kinds of studios in AZ and other locales and can honestly say Sutra has provided the best experience by far. Matthew and Rebecca, the owners, are the nicest people and really understand the downtown Phoenix vibe. The instructors, espacially Danielle, Sebastian, and Tami are clearly very highly trained and make the yoga experience both challenging and a blast. Being on the monthly unlimited membership plan (which is considerably cheaper than other local studios monthly plans) means that I pay peanuts per class given how often I go. I would give Sutra 10 stars if I could!
