Easy to rate, because nobody comes close to this place.  Have been here may times.  Hands down the BEST wine bar in Phoenix.  Woe to the competitor who attempts to take them on.  Great wine selection with some obscure varietals/vinyards, great food and bruschetta, great people-watching, and valet parking to boot.   Amazing.  Don't read any more reviews.  Just go here.
