My experience with Vincents is a solid nine out of ten every time. There duck tamales are incredible and you still can even find Vincent himself in the kitchen cooking on many nights. Nice to see success hasn't changed the work ethic for this restaurateur's dream. Im sure it was a hard road, but there are few, if any, French restaurants in town that offer such splendidly sinful food choices. Overall I love the old world look, the service is usually top knotch and for fine dining, the price is no more or less than other similar quality restaurants.
