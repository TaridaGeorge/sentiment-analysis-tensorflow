What Poncheros is in AZ now!!!!!  How lucky could we get!!!!!  Poncheros is compared to Chipolte but just so everyone knows who has never tried it before.... It is a million times better.  They even freshly press EVERY tortilla from fresh dough each time you order.  I came to AZ and tried Chipolte because everyone raved about it, well when I walked in I immediately though of Poncheros and became very excited!  Unfortunately to my utter dissapointment is did not even come close to how good Poncheros is.  Sooooo I hope all you Chipolte lovers will give this new to AZ spot a chance, I guarantee you will not be dissappointed!
