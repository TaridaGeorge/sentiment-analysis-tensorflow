Love this place!! It's by far my favorite bar in the Phoenix area.

The drinks are always cheap- especially if you come on a Wednesday or Saturday when everything is 2-4-1.

They always play great music, and show the music videos on the wall as your favorite songs are playing.

Even my straight girl friends agree that this is the most fun bar in town!
