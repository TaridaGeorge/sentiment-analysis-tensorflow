The owners are so nice, and I dig cheeky retro garb for the house. They have a huge selection of vintage furniture and vintage-looking stuff. If you're a greaser/rockabilly/tattoo fiend, you definitely need to check this place out. 

They also have apparel and accessories made by LOCALS, which is so refreshing. You must get yourself some Lila-Jo and Lucky 11 gear.
