We went to Times Square for the first time tonight thinking we would get a pizza, but the menu and the dinners we saw tempted us to get pasta.  We tried the meatballs as an appetizer - wonderful - tender and the sauce was good.  Side salad was good too.  I had the Pasta Giovanni and my husband had the spaghetti alla Paesana.  Both were delicious.  The wait staff were "on their game".  We did not have to wait for anything.  Our waiter, Nick, made good suggestions and was there when needed even though it was very busy.  All in all, a great dinner and we will be back to get that pizza!
