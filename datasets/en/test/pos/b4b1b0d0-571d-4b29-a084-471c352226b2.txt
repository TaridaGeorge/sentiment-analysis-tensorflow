For a sub shop, great place.

Delivery is freaky fast for sure.  I order delivery half the time.

Pro's
- fast delivery
- quick service if ordering onsite
- staff friendly
- food is good

Con's
- No WiFi.  Would like since AT&T service spotty near this building. 


Good spot.  Glad there is a location here.
