The Molinari Pizza, the Sicilian Pan Pizza, The Picnic Sandwich, and (even though i missed it this time) the unbelievable Salt River Bar.  If you like Pomo, Pizzeria Bianco, or the like you will love the wood fired pizzas at Liberty Market.  Great concept, great food, and a very savvy menu.  I have full intentions of visiting this place as often as I can.
