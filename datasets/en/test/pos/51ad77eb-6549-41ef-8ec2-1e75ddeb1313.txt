I have had Panang all over the country (and the valley), and the Panang Chicken, level 5 spicy, at the Thai House is my all time favorite hands down.  It's a dish worth dreaming about.

They have awesome lunch specials during the week and it's a fairly small establishment, so they are usually full.  I recommend going a little before 11:30 to beat the rush.  We went a little closer to noon yesterday and had to wait, but it was only for a few minutes and well worth it.  The service is quick, so even when I do have to wait for a table I can still make it back to work within the hour.
