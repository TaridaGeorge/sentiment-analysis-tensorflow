I really enjoy the beer from Old World, it seems as if they are working on new Brews that always are a hit.  The staff is friendly and helpful and ready to answer any questions.  I have purchased a couple of kegs as well as growler refills and pints and have yet to be disappointed.  Give them a try, you will find  some satisfaction.
