Really flavourful and light  phos/soups  made here. This is the reason that I like Mom and pop stores. They don't leave you feeling like a greasy  over stuffed cow. I keep ordering the tapioca noodle soup as I haven't seen many places that offer that on the menu.

Next time I'll try the rice dishes. They looked yummy when the next couple ordered it.
