Ah, my favorite not so secret, secret bar. Fantastic place to take a date, even better place to chill with your girls and a yummy drink. Not just sweet foo foo drinks (though the white rabbit never fails me)...no, there some kind of sparkly ginger fastasma that seems like it could be a manly drink. The seating is lounge style, low lights and original art lining the walls. Hipster Central Phoenix crowd, but laid back and not too cool for you. I always come here when I go there.
