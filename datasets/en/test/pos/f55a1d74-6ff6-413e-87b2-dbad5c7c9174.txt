i stayed here on business a few weeks ago. my employer didn't make reservations for a me and a couple of my co-workers, so on the day we were supposed to stay, the front desk agent who took our reservation was accommodating and helped us reserve our rooms. 

when we checked in, the agent was also very nice. she explained breakfast and checked us into rooms near each other. 

this spring hill suites is very nice and well kept. it's quiet and located in a great area (close to arizona mills). 

the only thing that was unpleasant was the light shining in my room all night while i tried to sleep. this is entirely my fault because i did not check to see if the curtains were black out curtains. wish i would have known! would have gotten way better sleep, hahahaha.
