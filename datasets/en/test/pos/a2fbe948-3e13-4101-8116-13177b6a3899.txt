If you're looking for a good burger, there is no better choice then the Chuck!

I first discovered this gem while attending ASU, and can't get enough. Don't be alarmed by the very old decor, there is no missing when it comes to burgers in this shack with the charbroiled awesomeness and the overflowing toppings bar.

Try the Tijuana Torpedo!
