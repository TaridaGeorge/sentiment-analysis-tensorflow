Seriously great people who work here.  A HUUUUGGGE shout out to DAN who was the bomb!  We put travertine down in our casita bathroom ourselves and by giving us excellent advice and showing us great products, he saved us money.  DAN spent lots of time with us and seemed to be genuinely interested in giving us the best advice at the best prices.  They carry wonderful flooring at very affordable prices.  I don't understand how anyone could give this place anything less than 5 stars.  If you want great service, a giant selection of flooring (other than carpet..they don't have carpet.), and modest prices, check this place out, you will be glad you did.
