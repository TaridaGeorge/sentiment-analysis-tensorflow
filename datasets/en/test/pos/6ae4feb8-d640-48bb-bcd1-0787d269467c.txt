So I feel like I need to write another update. We've eaten here several times and have a great experience every single time (minus the first time with the delivery issue, but we just decided to go get takeout every time). The owner and pizzaiola (it's what they call the guys who make pizzas in Italy) are very friendly and the pizza is always great. I can't say enough nice things about those guys and this little pizza spot. Keep up the good work boys!!!
