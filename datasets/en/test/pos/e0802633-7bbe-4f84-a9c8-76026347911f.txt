I ordered from this company cupcakes for a client of mine out in Phoenix and I have to say, the rave reviews from the client gets 5 stars! Apparently, the cupcakes never stood a chance! The email I received from my client leads me to believe I helped to create many OllieCake fanatics. 

SInce all I can really comment on is the service-  The person who assisted me over the phone was very polite and helpful as I did not know what to order. The process was very smooth and easy as I was off the phone with an order placed within 10 minutes. (It only took that long because I didn't know what to order) 

Thank you again for making me look so good ;)
