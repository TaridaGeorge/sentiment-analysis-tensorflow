I've been a fan of sushi for a few years now, and have tried it in NYC, CA, Hawaii and many other places. Hana Japanese is up there with the best of them. All of their sashimi selections are fresh, and fish is flown in frequently. The service is top notch and the sushi chefs are happy to chat with you. My favorites include saba, ika, and salmon skin. For those of you not looking to eat sushi, the rest of their menu is excellent. If you are in the mood for a traditional Japanese frozen treat, stop by and try the mochi ice cream! I recommend the mango.  Hana is BYOB! Take advantage of this and pick up a bottle of sake on your way. Kanpai!
