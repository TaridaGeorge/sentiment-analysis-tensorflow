It was a great place to start a day. I went for a morning ride before it got to hot. Our guide was very knowledgeable of the area. We went up and down hills and crossed the dry creek. She showed us what plants were edible and what to be aware of. The horses were all well trained. Make sure you get there on time or the old man (owner, maybe) will let you know your late. He was a little cantankerous but what you expect from old people. LOL.
