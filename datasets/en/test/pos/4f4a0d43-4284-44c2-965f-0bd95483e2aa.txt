I realize that by giving Simply Dentistry such a high review, the chances of getting the appointment I want, go down even more...and there's a reason.

You will love Dr. Tran and her staff. 

The reviews by the other patients and myself speak for themselves. Sure the majority of us don't like going to the dentist but when you've stepped foot into their office and gotten the service they provide, you won't hesitate about going to the dentist ever again. Just check it out, you'll know what I'm talking about.
