Really? Did I just have the BEST prime rib dip sandwich at an AIRPORT? Yes! It happened! 

This charming restaurant (yes, charming - it even has a fireplace!) is located in the middle of Phoenix Airport, before going through the security lines. I was impressed that they were able to pull off an environment that feels like a 5 star restaurant in the midst of all the hustle and bustle.  The only time I was even reminded that I was in an airport was when I saw a few people with luggage under their table. 

Service is first class, food is a little pricy (but typical of the airport), menu is outstanding (they aren't messing around with their french fries!) and there is even a free gourmet cookie before you leave. Love it!
