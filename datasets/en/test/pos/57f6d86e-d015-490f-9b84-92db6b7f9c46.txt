Sally our server was excellent.   We ordered the new $39.99 and  $49.99 dinner deals and it was a great price and tons of food.  Sally was on it with the refills.  I mean ON IT....

My fillet was under cooked but they immediatly fixed the problem.  We had to wait 15 minutes for a table on a Monday night which was upsetting as they had one dining room empty and some open tables in the room we were in.

I've eaten here several times over the years during spring training and it's always been great.

The flavor was superb....
