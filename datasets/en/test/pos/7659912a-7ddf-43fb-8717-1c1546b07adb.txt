While the hamburgers are delicious here, I can't get enough of the grilled cheese. A perfect lunch -- when I'm not counting calories -- is a grilled cheese and hashbrowns, my favorite combination at this East Mesa strip mall gem. And if you have room, be sure to wash it down with a thick Chocolate shake. Lunch definitely won't set you back. Everything is extremely cheap and the eats will put you in a food coma for the rest of the afternoon.
