Literally the best coffee I have ever had. They have wi-fi but tell you up front that they dislike "internet squatters" so you kind of feel pressured to purchase more throughout the day if you stay there several hours. Dislike that. The level of hipsterness can be quite nauseating but you can get past that as long as you sip your delicious coffee and just stare at your computer screen.
