One of my all-time quick lunch spots in Phoenix (both this and the McDowell location). Love the Grueben (grilled turkey, swiss, slaw, spicy mustard, rye) and chicken roll-ups (tortillas, feta, lettuce, tomato, caramelized onions, salsa). To me it's a great marriage of Mediterranean and American, with a little Southwestern and Mexican flair. I also really like the limeade; go for the large cup and get refills anytime you visit for 99 cents. Chocolate cake is great too. It's a little pricier than average lunches and portions are slightly smaller, but way tastier. Note that parking is way easier here; it's become very difficult at the McDowell location. Another tip - if you're on Foursquare, sign in your first time and get 10% off.
