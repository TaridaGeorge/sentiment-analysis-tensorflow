I did you a favor.  You can thank me later.  

I have completed an official, side by side comparison and can definitively say that Rainbow Donuts beats that other competitor.  You know, just think double D's.  No, not those kind.  

It took several hours and 4 donuts (okay, 6...gawd!) to reach this conclusion.  By my very scientific and mathematical calculations, that equals about 1500 calories.  Which is why you should thank me.  While you were out strutting your stuff, I was stuck wearing grannie panties and an elastic waistband.  You probably had sex.  I was pretty sure I would never be able to again.

But it was worth it!  Fresh, aromatic and delicious donuts are unbeatable in my book and I can't find anything to complain about here.  The glazed, cr√®me filled, and plain are all delicious and worth the caloric splurge.
