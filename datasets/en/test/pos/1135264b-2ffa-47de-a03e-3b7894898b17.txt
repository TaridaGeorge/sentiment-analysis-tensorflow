Every time I move I have to find a new lady that threads. If waxing makes  your skin irritated with red bumps. try threading.  Anita did a great job! She shaped my brows but didn't make them too thin. She charges $12.00 which is a steal. She also does hair and facials. I will have to try those too!
I am now a loyal client!
