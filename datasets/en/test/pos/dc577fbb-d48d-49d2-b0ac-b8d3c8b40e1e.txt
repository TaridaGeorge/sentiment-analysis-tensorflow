Hey! Thai E-San, I'm back.
I just went to Thai E-San last Sunday. It was busy day! I ordered appetizer #angel wings to start with. Then TOm Yum soup came right after angel wings, it took us 15-20 min to finish those soup and appetizer. The meal came a little late BUT the taste was so GOOD. My spicy eggplant was little too hot, but don't worry I love it! I'm not a big fan of noodle dish but my mom ordered Rad Nah noodle with gravy sauce. That dish was surprise me! I think I like noodle from now on. We would love to try mango sticky rice for dessert BUT we were so full , maybe next time. The food portion was so big, finally we finished it all, and have a very great evening!!! 

Thank you Thai E-San, I will be back soon.
