I loved this store. It was the first place I went to the day after I moved to Arizona back in in 2008. I was only able to enjoy the location for about a year and a half before it was ultimately closed by the various closures that Basha's was doing.

It was a really great store. Great staff. I was in there a few times a week, at least.

When they closed their doors in October of 2009...the rest of the shopping center took a hit (with the exception of the nearby McDonald's). Just before I moved back to California in May 2011, I noticed the UPS Store next door had moved locations; business dwindled after Basha's closed.
