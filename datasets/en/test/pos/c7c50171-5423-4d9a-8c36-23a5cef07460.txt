We love Rustler's Rooste! We just moved to the area, and have stopped by twice. Both times, the food and atmosphere were amazing. We ordered the NFL Burger, and it was phenomenal - enough food for 2 or 3 to share at a great price. We went there again for New Years Eve. We ordered a full rack of pork ribs, and it was so much food we had to take half home! Delicious! Great view! We will definitely be back - many times!
