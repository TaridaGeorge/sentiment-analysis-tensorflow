Went to a Holiday Party here, beautiful holiday decor in the lobby entrance way highlighted by 5 huge gingerbread houses all decorated with different candies, jelly bean walkways, brownie roofs..and the outside bar area is gorgeous, all on the lake, with the lighted dock, fire pits and heat lamps, its a very nice atmosphere here. I never stayed here, just partyed in the bar and wrap around outside patio...love love!
