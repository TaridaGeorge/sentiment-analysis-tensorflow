I've always been a huge fan of Oregano's, but my last time there was unbelievable! I went on Veteran's day with 4 guys- one being a veteran. We mentioned it once that that was why we were out celebrating. When our to go bag was ready, every staff member in the place wrote on the bag to our friend thanking him for his service. After the bag was presented, the staff started coming around the table to shake his hand. It brought tears to all of our eyes. Their appreciation touched all of us- so not only is their food amazing, but the employees that work there are too.
De was the best-I highly recommend to sit in her area when you go- very high energy and  a sweetheart!
 My friend Tom says he will keep that to go bag forever.
