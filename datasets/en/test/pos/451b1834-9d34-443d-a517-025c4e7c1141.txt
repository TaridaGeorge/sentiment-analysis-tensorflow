Amazing service. Our waiter knew his wines and I was pretty happy with the one I got. I love a burger joint where I can order wine with my burger. Fries with truffle oil and parmesan were delicious. Zucchini fries were interesting and good too. I got the Kobe beef burger, medium rare, with grilled onions and the regular suggested toppings. Very delicious and juicy. One of the best burgers I've had. Totally worth paying more for the Kobe beef than the regular stuff, and though I haven't tried the regular stuff I was more than satisfied with the Kobe. Their milkshakes bring the boys and girls to the yard, too. No room for dessert unfortunately.
