This are not gourmet sandwiches but it doesn't matter because they are so delicious!! It's definitely the bread because I get the veggie sandwich with avocado and none of the toppings are "awesome" - although they do give you a lot of yummy avocado! Whether you get the croissant or the baguette you'll be happy. However, I didn't like the Asian Vegetarian sandwich at all so I wouldn't recommend you get that one! My husband LOVES their shrimp spring rolls too!! They have awesome prices but the catch is that they only take cash - although they do have an ATM if you forget. I should also mention that you can get the best baguette ever for a little over a dollar. I don't buy baguettes from anywhere else! If they're fresh out of the oven and warm you will be in heaven.
