LOVE THIS PIZZA!!!!!!!!!!!!!

OMG
So good!

The crust is that like thin but crunchy kind, and the red sauce on the pizzas is absolutely perfect.
I like their wide array of pizzas and toppings (even though I can't have any pesto pizza because of the nuts in the pesto, boo)

This place, and Classic Italian in Tempe are the best pizza places I've been in to AZ hands down.
