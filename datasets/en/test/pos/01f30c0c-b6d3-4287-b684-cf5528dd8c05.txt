We love the Desert Botanical Gardens and always enjoy our visits .It's holiday time and so we went to see the Luminarias ....Breathtakingly beautiful ! 

To take an enchanting stroll amid the Luminarias really made us feel surrounded by the spirit of the season ,further fueled by warm cider and raspberry vodka ,the play of light on everything is spectacular ...nature framed by an ethereal glow .

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas ....
