One of the best I've been to in the Valley!! Called in my order for the office, was ready in the time stated, everything was made to the order requested! PERFECT! Food was amazing! They have a simple menu with all the great items of Greek food! It was so good I went twice back to back!  had the Gyro Thursday and the Chicken Souvlaki Friday! delicious!!

ADDED note -- You may want to request for them to poke holes in the boxes for the fries, they get soggy pretty quick... no biggy, just saying.
