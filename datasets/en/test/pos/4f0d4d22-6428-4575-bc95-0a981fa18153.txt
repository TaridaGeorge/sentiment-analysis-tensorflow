One of my favorite hotels in Phoenix.  I worked there for a year and have stayed there a few times as well.

Love the boutique feel, the colors, the furniture, the great atmosphere, the art, the pool, the rooftop....  I have been to fashion shows here and spent the most awesome new years eve ever here.  I have gotten guys to get naked and jump in the pool, I have done naughty dirty things in the hallways!  I have met numerous celebrities here.  I hung out with Cheech from Cheech and Chong at the bar.  I have been to magazine launches and birthday parties.....

Every time I go in there something new and exciting has happened or changed!  

I love this place and I love Ben too!  I hope it is around forever!
