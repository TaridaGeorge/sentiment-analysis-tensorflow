Best fondue experience, hands down. I've always loved fondue, but until going here, I never knew it could be so delectable. The seating is very private and intimate, and the mood lighting really adds elegance. As for the food - delicious and satisfying. Also, our server was uncannily timely. He always knew when to serve the next course, haha. I wish I could remember the name of him - he was an excellent server

The only thing I dislike is the price. It is, quite frankly, outrageous. Especially, since you're basically cooking it yourself. My friends and I only go here on VERY special occasions - because the check was an occasion itself.

But above all, wonderful food, wonderful servers and hosts, wonderful atmosphere.
