We live in the area and frequent Papaya Thai quite often. We love the food, the price is fair, the people are very nice and service is quick.

I have 2 favorite dishes:

Thai Fried Rice - I'm not a huge "fried rice" guy at other restaurants. But this isn't the typical fried rice you see at other restaurants. Maybe less eggie and greasy? It has it's own flavor and it great.  The dish is HUGE. We often share this and get an appetizer.

Vegetable Thai Rama with Tofu - The peanut sauce is great and the tofu is firm. This is a normal sized dish, not as big as the Thai Fried Rice.

The ambiance is extra fancy ; )  Big fan. The dramatic see-through curtains make the peanut sauce taste even better.
