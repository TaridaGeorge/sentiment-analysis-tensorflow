These people are from new jersey, like me, and are the only authentic bagel place in the valley. They never overload their bagels with cream cheese and their price for lox and cream cheese is the lowest in town! Even after being frozen these bagels still maintain a crunchy outside and soft inside. They never taste dense or heavy, these are 1 of a kind.  It's a cozy small family operated place go and will not be disappointed!  Just listen to all the compliments you'll hear during EVERY visit.  YOu'll see why the Bagel Man is the man, OPEN EVERY DAY OF THE YEAR.
