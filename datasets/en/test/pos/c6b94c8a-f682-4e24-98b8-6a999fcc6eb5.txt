I have been using Seablu for  probably 10 years or more.  It it probably time for me to write a review, as I couldn't be happier with Susan's dependability, and her extra...extra customer service.  
  My pool looks great.  Her rates are reasonable.  My dog looks forward to her showing up every week.  She runs a very professional business and values her clients.
