After going to the same wax salon for years I decided $55 dollars for a brazilian wax was getting a little expensive, I decided to try the European Was Center.  I got a killer deal.  I prepaid for 9 waxes and got 12 out of the deal.  It comes out to $35 a wax!  Great Savings!

I have been getting waxed by Lyndsi now for several months and I have to say I just love her!  She has great technique, professional, and is really friendly.  It helps to be comfortable when getting a brazilian done.  I would recommend going to Lyndsi if you are considering coming to the European Wax Center Camelback!
