The best breakfast restaurant I have EVER eaten at.  YUM!

Loved the lady that opened it about 7 months ago.

There were no tables available when my husband and I arrived at about 10am on a Saturday so we ate on the love seat.  Great ambiance and comfortable.

Have never seen tofu as a breakfast side dish along with ham, bacon or sausage but it was crispy and delish with a sauce on top.  I had the baked blueberry pancakes.  So good!  Must have had 10 blueberries in each bite.

The french toast looked beautiful and tasty but I don't like cinnamon so I didn't try it.
