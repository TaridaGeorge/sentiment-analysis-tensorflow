My husband and I went to Sophie's for a date night and were very happy with the results.  I have the Beef Bourguignon and it was outstanding.  We were told it takes 3 days to make the sauce.  My husband ordered the duck confit, which he enjoyed.  I'm not a fan of the ducky flavor myself.  We also followed the suggestion of ordering the warmed brie app.  De-lish!  The service was great as well.  Little touches like asking if we would like our milk warmed for our post-meal coffee.  So great!  We will for sure be going back for future date nights!
