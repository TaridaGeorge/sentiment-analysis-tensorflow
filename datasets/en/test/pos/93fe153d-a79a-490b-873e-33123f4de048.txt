This is by far my favorite pho restaurant. The owner is great and remembers us when we come in and always makes sure we are happy. I don"t live in the area, but when I make it to town I am sure to go there. The pho varieties are diverse and they cook the broth for 24hrs. They also have my favorite dessert that you can"t always find. Love it!
