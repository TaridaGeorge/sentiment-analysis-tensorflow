This is the kind of place you go to be left alone... We love that you can walk to "Lon's" from your room. Beautiful grounds tucked away in a Paradise Valley neighborhood with close up view of Camelback Mountain. The History of the place and artist Alonzo Megargee is also interesting. Very laid back atmosphere... Don't expect full services or a ton of attention. If I was going to suggest only one place for someone to experience an "Arizona" overnight, it would be The Hermosa Inn with Lon's for dinner.
