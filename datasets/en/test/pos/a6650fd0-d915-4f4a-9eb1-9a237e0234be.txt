My two grandchildren 2 1/2 and 4 1/2 received the best attention and haircuts ever!! The girl got the cutest cut with sparkles sprayed on top with a barrette to tie it all together, while the boy got a dashing red set of bangs (the color washed out in the bath that night) that looked terrific! I wish you could see the photos! I recommend this place highly. We went because of the name-so snappy- and true to name of salon.
