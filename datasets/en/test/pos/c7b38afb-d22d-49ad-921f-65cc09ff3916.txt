I love this place! It is perfectly located for my needs, the staff is always friendly and the food is fantastic. It is super easy to order anything vegan or gluten-free and where I have had trouble communicating the level of spice I want at other Thai places, that is never an issue for me here. Their Coconut Soup with Tofu and the Mas-Sa-Mun Curry with Tofu are my favorite.
