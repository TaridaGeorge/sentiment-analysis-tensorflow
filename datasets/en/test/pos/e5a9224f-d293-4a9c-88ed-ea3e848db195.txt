Crème de la crème experience!

The 5 for $6 happy hour at the bar is nothing short of fantastic.  What does 5 for $6 exactly mean?  As I found out, it means they have 5 options of food or drinks for $6 each.  Happy hour ends at 7pm.

The drinks and food are superb.  I tried the burger and brie puff and they were very tasty and filling.  The service was also exemplary.

I am an instant fan of Fleming's and will be a return customer.
