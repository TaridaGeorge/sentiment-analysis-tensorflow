QT is my favorite gas station in the whole wide world!!!

I found this convenient location via the YELP app I downloaded on my phone. Isn't technology great? Located down the street just north of the 202.

Like any QT, it's consistent with FRIENDLY employees, quick check-out, lots of beverage choices, grab n' go snacks and sandwiches, lots of gas pumps, CLEAN, CLEAN, CLEAN...also CLEAN restrooms, and competitive prices on gas & stuff they sell inside.

QT is always my 1st choice!
