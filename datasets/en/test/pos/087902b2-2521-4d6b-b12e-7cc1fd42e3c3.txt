Finding this little breakfast spot in Phoenix certainly made our trip!
Strawberry Rhubarb French Toast- out of this world, with a sie of chicken apple sausage--yummy!

The other half had the Dolores( Mexican style)- fantastic!

Portion sizes were perfect- we finsihed our breakfast and left full, not stuffed.

Tamarind Lemonade also sensational- however, the potatoes w/ a side of creme fraiche needed a few minutes longer in the skillet..but overall- this place would probably be the onlny reason we'd ever come back to Phoenix!

Oh- and they recently switched over to table service....sit outside and enjoy the shade and the water misters- even in 95 degree heat - it still felt good!
