I lived in Seattle for 5 years before moving here, and was spoiled with delicious cheap sushi. I thought for sure I would never find good sushi in the desert until I found Tomo!

I've been here at least 25 times, and have never been disappointed. Without fail every time we get the miso soup, spider roll and always a sushimi boat.

Thank you Tomo for showing me that we could find good sushi in the desert!
