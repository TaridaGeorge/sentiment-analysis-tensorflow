I've been to this restaurant several times, all for the same darn salad!  The Stetson's Chopped Salad is...hmm..might I dare say the BEST salad I've ever eatten!  I live in CA and have actually booked some training in Scottsdale, only so I could eat this salad!  

Not a big fan of the cowboy motif, but based on how good this salad is, I can look past it!  And I will say this place has a decent wine list (coming from a Napa Valley Wino).  

I've tried other items on the menu as well, and I will say all were good - even down to their burgers!   A must try - the Stetson Chopped Salad for sure!!
