AMAZING BEER SELECTION!!

If you love craft beers this is the place to go.  I browsed their online catalog and I was not very impressed and was somewhat skeptical on the selection they would have.  Their online catalog does not do the store justice!  There is an entire row from the front to the back of the store with amazing beer selections.  Very cheap prices, I was amazed to see dogfish head for 3-5 dollars less than what I pay in Chicago.  Also, they have a make your own six pack deal where you can pick up singles.  Still comes out just as cheap as buying a 6 pack of the same beers.  Prices for single 12 oz bottles/cans range from .99 cents - approx $1.60.
