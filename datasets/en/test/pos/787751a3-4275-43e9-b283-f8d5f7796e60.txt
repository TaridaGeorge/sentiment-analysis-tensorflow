A little surprise in my Sacks sack today: an extra cookie!  They usually just include one cookie, but I guess I got the hook-up.  That and it was Facebook drink day, meaning I mentioned the occasion and got a free drink out of it.

Sacks continues to be well staffed with nice folk and innovative with their sandwiches.  I'll definitely keep them at 5 stars because at their price bracket they offer a serious and original sandwich. 

 I'm still buzzing from the ice tea I had at lunch (or maybe it's the extra cookie).
