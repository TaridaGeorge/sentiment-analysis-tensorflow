As a professional recording artist and musician, I have visited just about every music store/pawn shop in Phoenix. While Ziggy's may not have the largest most current inventory the folks who run the place are the kindest most knowledgeable people I have ever met in the business. I recently took a bass in to them to have it rewired (I was ready to throw it out) and they fixed it like new for only $15! Ziggy's music is the quintessential mom and pop shop and they clearly love what they do. Huge Thanks Ziggy's Music!!
