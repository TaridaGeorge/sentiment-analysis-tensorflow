Had a great time at this bar!! My friend Mike and I did a road trip to Arizona and we ended up hanging out here 3 nights in a row!  Everyone was cool to us.  I have to give props to the women that work there dancing and bartending.  They were very entertaining and friendly.  The bouncers were really cool to us.  They recognized us and treated us like brothers.  Thanks! :)
