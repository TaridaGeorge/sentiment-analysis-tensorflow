This is one of my favorite places to go for some post-work drinks.  The sangria is delicious - not to sweet, which is a really common with Sangria around these parts.  The portions are small, but it's a tapas place, so what do you expect?  The prices are reasonable given the quality of food.  Try the tortilla or the garbanzos, they are both really delicious!
