Was driving on Baseline this morning and noticed the car was not driving smoothly so I pulled over to check and saw I had a flat. Fortunately I was in the Discount Tires lot when I pulled over so I went inside and had them take care of the tire. The tire was not repairable but they had an exact replacement in stock. I bought the new tire with warranty and had my wheels balanced and tires rotated while I was there. They got everything done very quickly and I was on my way. I liked the fast friendly service.
