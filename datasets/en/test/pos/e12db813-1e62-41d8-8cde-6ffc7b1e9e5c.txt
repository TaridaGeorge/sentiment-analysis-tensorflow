I started going to Fattoush in high school, and I continue to return 4 years later.  The food is very good, and the servers take care of you very well. I can't remember the last time I went there and didn't get an appetizer or dessert for free.  The Turkish coffee is excellent, as is the Baklava.  The chicken gyro for lunch is both inexpensive, and excellent. I highly recommend this place.  The location is shady, but in my opinion it adds to the experience. This place is the definition of a "hole in the wall."
