I almost NEVER give a chain restaurant a 5-star review, not because I'm opposed to the idea but because very few are worthy. But Bandera is just that good, from the upscale casual, relaxed and inviting atmosphere to the excellent service to the delicious food.

Ordering the cornbread to start is a must - it'd be a crime not to. The grilled artichoke and queso/guacamole apps are also wonderful. I had the macho salad, which was quite large and packed with good stuff. I also had a side of the mac and cheese that was outrageously good. Dessert offerings are limited to two choices, and neither blew me away, but the Oreo one was the better of the two.

Bandera is, like its sister restaurant Houstons, always a wonderful experience with reliably terrific food.
