The employees are very friendly and accommodating and the food is delicious!

We love this place! The roasted beet & brussel sprout salad is so good that we find ourselves craving it routinely (sans cheese, obviously)!

They are very happy to answer my questions on ingredients, omit cheese & other items from predetermined dishes and even substitute extra items (like pine nuts) at no cost. Very vegan friendly establishment!

Other food that we enjoy there: The pizza crust bread (vegan), pasta primavera using either a garlic olive oil sauce or a marinara sauce, with pine nuts added.
