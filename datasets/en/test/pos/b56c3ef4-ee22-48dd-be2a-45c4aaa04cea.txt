Wow, very good barbecue and the best Cole-Slaw I've ever had.  Hopefully you don't get turned off by the religious message of the day that might be on the white-board, and stay focused on trying out their food.  It was purely by chance that we stumbled into this joint, and it's totally not near my house... but if you are in the area, you should try this place out!
