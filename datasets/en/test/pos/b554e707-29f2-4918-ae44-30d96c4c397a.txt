Good fresh subs. I like that Meat and cheese are cut in front of you. Work-mates swear by the tuna, and I've not found a hot sandwich on the menu I didn't like. Ask for a sandwich "Mike's way" for all the fixings. 

The place is new to the area (opened late December 10) and it didn't hurt my impression of the place that they partnered with a local elementary school to celebrate opening. Add to that fact that the manager and employees remember me though I only go every other week and greet me warmly each time.

Fresh ingredients and a "local place" feel - a great place for lunch!
