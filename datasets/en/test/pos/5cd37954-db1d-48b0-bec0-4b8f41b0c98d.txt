I love love love the rooftop at Bar Smith! The electro music, lights, fresh air, the view, it's amazing! Definitely something to try if you live in Phoenix at least once! The crowd is pretty cool, everyone is so friendly. The attire is trendy/indie/electroish. Sometimes they have a cool photo booth. Bar Smith totally rocks (UPSTAIRS!). Downstairs it's a whole other world. It's more of the mainstream hip hop and more skanified lol.
