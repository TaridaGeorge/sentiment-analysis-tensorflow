Best pizza in the country? Still not sure. But I will say that the mystique of this restaurant is part of what makes it so much fun. We arrived around 4:15 and waited about 2.5 hours to get seated, which ended up being at the bar. The whole experience was good, though, even the wait. With Bar Bianco next door, they really have a good setup. We ordered apps, which were excellent-- spiedini with prosciutto and fontina and a fresh tomato mozzarella salad. We had the margherita and sonny boy pizzas- both excellent! They have a limited menu, which I think can be pulled off only by a place that does everything on its menu well. I'm really glad we decided to go. If you do too, though, know what kind of wait you're getting into!
