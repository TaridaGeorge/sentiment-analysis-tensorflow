Cut my leg on a table piece that was absolutely out of sight (nobodys fault) and notified the manager. He was quick to be very concerned about my leg and fixed the table while ensuring that the remainder of our experience was exceptional. We were very pleased with his customer service and ability to turn our perception around. We will be back for sure!
