Knew I had to go here after seeing the theme and giant blunt hanging from the wall. Next time I will get a blount size sandwich, but today just tried the 8 inch pinner. My order was for "the Kind", turkey/bacon/mushrooms and swiss. This was a great toasty sandwiich, best one I have in the toasted category. Lots of fresh toppings added as you yell out what you would like in the sandwich. Garlic herb Bread is clearly the way to go here. Of course of my first visit I had to try the snacks and ended up with a chocolate and vanilla rice krispy treat, which was unusual, sorta healthy and good for post session desert. This is my kind of place, it would have been back in college too. Some things never change. Alsom oipen til midnight.
