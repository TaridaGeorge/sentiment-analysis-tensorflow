I love this place... I am a southwesterner to the bone, languishing in California, and whenever I am back home to visit, this is my first food stop. The menu is simple and straightforward -- mostly fry bread, pozole, and chili... indian tacos, sweet fry bread, stew... plain home food, excellently prepared. Ambience is quiet and unpretentious, the service is fast, the prices are great. Parking can be a problem, but it's worth walking a couple of blocks.
