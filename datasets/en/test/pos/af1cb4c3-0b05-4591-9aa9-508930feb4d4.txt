This is one of my favorite places in AZ.  First of all, the "buzz" is one of the best inventions of the 21st century.  It's delicious.  Both breakfast burritos are phenomenal, but my two favorite items are the oatmeal and the turkey club.  They are superb.  I ashamed to have written this much without mentioning the guys that run the place.  They are hilarious and always in a good mood.
