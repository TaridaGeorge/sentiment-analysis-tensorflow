I had my husband take my Jetta here because it was making a odd noise that would speed up when I accelerated and slow as I decreased speed.  I thought it was a bearing.  Turns out it was just the tires.  They inspected the vehicle, took it for a test drive and still did not charge us anything.  They said we could replace the tires if the noise was unbearable but they were fine to drive with for a long time yet.  I will be taking my car here for all future service.
