beaver choice is not a restaurant, it's an experience!  yeah, it takes a while, and it is a bit chaotic, BUT the food is amazing, the people are hilarious.  if you just decide to pull the stick out of your ass and relax, you can't help but smile the entire time you are there.

be sure to try the (life changing) potato salad
and the beaver balls are also quite delicious

beaver choice is the only choice
