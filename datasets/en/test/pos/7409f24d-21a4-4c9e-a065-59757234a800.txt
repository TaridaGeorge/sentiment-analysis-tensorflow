I hope to meet Patsy sometime! This pizza is the best...and sometimes I am hard pressed to say so since I am biased to Chicago's deep dish. Great pepperoni that is sliced nice and thick.....as a family we always enjoy the traditional pepperoni and also the calzones...nothing like that ricotta cheese! 
I don't think that there is a bad choice to be made here....your tasted buds will thank you! Have enjoyed this place many times, both DC Ranch and at the Qauter...you will not be disappointed!
