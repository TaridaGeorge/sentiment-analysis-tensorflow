By far, one of the best bakeries in AZ. We used to order these cakes for B Day celebrations at the last place I worked. My fav was the lemon poppyseed with buttercream frosting. I am not even much of a fan of lemon cake but this one is delicious. Also great are the carrot cake and the chocolate chocolate chip. Not only are the cakes delicious, they are visually beautiful as well. The cakes cost a bit more than if you went to a grocery store bakery, but its worth it!
