My 3 children actually beg me to go to the dentist!!  That sounds crazy I know but once you walk into Dr. Libbys office you see why.  She has all the space pad fun stuff to play on computer games and the tokens for prizes afterwards.  What is by far the best is her kind and gentle manner that she has. She just recently had movie tickets available for the new cars movie just out in the theaters to her patients and 1 parent.  The entire movie theater was filled with just her patients!  She also does a lot for the community and with the movie tickets asked for a donation for a homeless shelter for kids that she supports.  Truly a great dentist and humanitarian
