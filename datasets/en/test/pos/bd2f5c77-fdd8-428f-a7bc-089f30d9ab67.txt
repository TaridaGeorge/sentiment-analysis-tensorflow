i finally took my little  4 yr old girl to this gem of a public library.

She was so excited she screamed. Fortunately there was a courtyard

and she enjoyed the kid's area as well as the art installation in the

entrance and the main building. There was staff to assist in her to play 

legos. Happy day!

Daddy likes it because it has Prada writ all over it.
