My family loves this place!  

We have had Meatballs, Mignulata (not to be missed), Three Crustini, Eggplant Parmigiana, Arugula and White Bean Salad, Margarita Pizza, Grilled Vegetable Pizza, Toasted Marshmallow Milkshake. 
 
The one thing we did not like very much was the Ricotta Cheesecake.  It tasted like it was bought and spent too much time in the refrigerator.  

My 7 and 5 year old loves the food and the old fashioned root beer (and the toasted marshmallow milkshake, of course). 

I love the Simply Naked Unoaked Chardonnay, not too cold, perfect temperature.  

My husband like a very cold Sierra Nevada. 

We are here every other weekend.  I tend to over order so I can have lunch the next day.  Cold meatball sandwiches!

It's small, with miss matched chairs and beautiful warm lighting.

It's a great place for families.  I'm glad LAMP is in my neighborhood.
