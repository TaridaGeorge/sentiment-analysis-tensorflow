This little shop in Tempe is awesome for all your pet and tack needs.  Sure, it's not the biggest outlet in town with the most variety but they have everything you could need, competitive prices, great service, and knowledgeable people.  Trust me when I tell you to spend just a few dollars more on high-quality feed for your pet (albeit it dog, cat, horse, etc.) you are helping them live a longer, healthier life than what is found in so many commercial grade products.  

Go here, you won't be disappointed!
