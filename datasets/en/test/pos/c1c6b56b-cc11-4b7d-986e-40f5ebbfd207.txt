Home of:  Rocky Horror Picture Show, The Room, Birdemic....Horror/Sci Fi festivals, cult movies, and anything independent and anything worth seeing.  

Run by people who really care, and pretty much a non profit organization from what I understand.  It exists for the artistic community and theaters are available to rent for events, movie screenings, concerts, parties, etc.

There are always fun people to hang out with, and I enjoy sitting and chatting with friends in the lobby before or after the cult movie showings.  Many turn into mini events, sometimes with vendors and pre shows. Screw Harkins, and screw AMC...this place is where its at.  Sure the place might be old, but its not filthy, and its all about the atmosphere of the people.
