I was AMAZED by Ranch Market.  The produce selection was picture worthy and the prices were really, really cheap!  The every day price for mangos- 2/$1, persimmons - 5/$1...etc...The meat department has every possible cut of meat and the prices were "sale" priced.  The marinated beef chuck was CRAZY good.  While you're there & before you shop, you need to stop by the agua fresca bar (about 8 diff flavors) and the restaurant indoors has some of the best carnitas I have had in a long time.  My 16yo son actually filmed the place to send out to some of his friends.
