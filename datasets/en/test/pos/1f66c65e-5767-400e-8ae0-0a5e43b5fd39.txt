I was surprised, I thought this place would be a five-star yelp page.

We've loved every experience here. 
Awesome breakfast burritos. A must try.
Awesome cupcakes (they offer vegan and gluten free sometimes! Call ahead to see what they have that day if this interests you!)
Awesome espresso and fruity/ smoothie drinks.

I use to love to come here on my lunch breaks to relax. Great atmosphere!! And I love the outdoor seating. On days with nice weather, it makes you forget you're in Arizona for awhile! ;)

Check it out, for sure!!
