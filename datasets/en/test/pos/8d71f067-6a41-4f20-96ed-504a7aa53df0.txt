this place is amazing!  everything is made to order and they have fantastic breakfast dishes and a great selection of bread, beer, wine and cheeses.  i was very impressed with the quality of their food, espresso and cleanliness of their store.  it is dog friendly and a great place to eat.  i hope to come back to this place whenever i am in town---they offer something for everyone and also have a very good gift shop with shirts, cards and books and other unique stuff.   for those seeking quality food at reasonable prices, this place is very hard to beat.  i only wish they had one of these in Seattle.
