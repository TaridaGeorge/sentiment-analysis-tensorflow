My most favorite place to get coffee---I love their Americano-style drinks (black, iced only for me; save the sweets for someone else), and their awesome employees! I seriously want all of them to come motivate my staff with their infectious, outgoing demeanors! They always brighten my mornings, and now that they are no longer on my path to work, I sometimes wake up early just to drive five miles out of my way to stop there first. The company motto is one I hope to adopt for my team, as it has clearly impacted their staff and business; I recommend and share their motto to my fellow service-industry providers constantly. These guys are top notch!!
