as a server i think everyone should have a couple months experience how there experience is.  all the reviews i have read were bad. i had a very good experience. good food and waited for my steak to be med well to med... only 20 min at max.  good job to all team members. ignore all bad posts. just enjoy youre company and enjoy dinner
