Known for their prime rib in the evenings, they have a wide variety of other menu items.  I should know, I've eaten lunch there on average of twice a week for 4 years now.  No wonder I'm the "Duke".  Great rooms for private parties or presentations, one seats 47, the other seats 35 with closed doors and a nice patio when it cools off.
