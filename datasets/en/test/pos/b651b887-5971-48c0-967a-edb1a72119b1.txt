Yummy!!  Pecan wood permeates the establishment.

Rack of Ribs:  Pork spare ribs, cooked so long that the bones were pliable, meat seperated from bone instantly.  Joes BBQ sauce is very very good and I love the habanero BBQ myself

Pulled Pork Sandwich:  very good and same super tender meat with same super BBQ sauce...bun was okay

Side Mac n Cheese and Pit Beans - both awesome

The best part was the homemade root-beer.  I can't put in words how tastey craft root-beer is.  This tasted down home and not like coke with rootbeer syrup.  I wish they would stock Birch-Beer in place of the red creme soda.  Birch Beer I think is much more tastey than rootbeer but all in all Joes is A++ 

To have Joe's in your neighborhood is great, good country BBQ
