I am so impressed with this place - in all my searches for a piano Milano was the most helpful and knowledgable!! I am also the proud owner of a piano too!!
I have been playing since the early age of 4 and have always enjoyed the sound of a good piano.
Milano Music had also referred me their piano mover GREG - holy cow this man moved my piano faster than I can get a pizza (and he's a one-man team!!)
For piano tuning - ask for Dave - he's an expert in his trade and he made my piano sing beautifully.
Very happy!!
