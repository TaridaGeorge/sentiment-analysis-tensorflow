I have never had my butt kicked so hard as at The P.I.T.T.! The Performance Institute for Training and Therapy is a unique experience in group fitness. Every class session is different, using muscle confusion and constant movement to enhance fitness, promote healthy body weight, and prevent injury. The trainers get to know you by name and are genuinely interested in seeing you get to the best shape of your life. Being in a group fitness environment like at The P.I.T.T. encourages pushing yourself to be better every session. I have been going here for three years now and have made leaps and bounds in my fitness, losing 15 pounds and 10% body fat! I would encourage anyone in a fitness slump, or just looking to mix-it-up a bit, to check out The P.I.T.T.!
