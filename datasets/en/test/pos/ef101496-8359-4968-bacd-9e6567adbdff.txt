I am a Golden Spoon fan but hands down this is one of the best yogurt places I have ever been in. Visited here with some out of town guest and during there 4 day stay we had to make a trip back. Ample free samples and tons of toppings to chose from - various fruits, sweets, nuts, granola and even cereal!

Just don't let your eyes get the best of you - you are paying by the ounce here.
