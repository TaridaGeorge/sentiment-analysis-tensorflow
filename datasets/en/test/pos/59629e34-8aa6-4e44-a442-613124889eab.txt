Awesome food! I dream about the falafel from here. I have tried Pita Jungle and many other places, even resorting to making my own but it is never the same as Elie's. Elie is so warm and inviting as she serves you herself. Prices are a little high but so is the quality. The fries are fresh and so is the meat. The pitas are so soft and fresh, very hard to find pitas such as these. I remember I passed out once here, I don't know if it was from a serious disorder or from me being in so much ecstasy from the food! Remember to bring cash, that is their only drawback.
