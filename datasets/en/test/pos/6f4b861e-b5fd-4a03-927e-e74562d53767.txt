Anyone who reads my reviews knows I'm a big believer in shopping local. The Spirit Box is owned by a local artist who is talented and attentive to her craft. Her pieces are one of a kind. I would describe them as organic. She can design custom pieces for any occasion. Check her catalog out on Facebook catalog or browse at http://thespiritbox.com. If you sign up to be a fan of the FaceBook page, you'll be privy to private sales. Favorite place both, for those special occasions and holidays!
