Food was amazing!!!  The menu isn't huge, but it is all delicious.  Started off with a Maid in Mexico cocktail and sea salt chips w/ onion dip, and had the scallops for my entree.  Soooo good!  Unfortunately I was too full to have dessert.
Service was as good as the food.  They substituted spinach for brussels sprouts in the Sweet Potato Tortelli - the only vegetarian dish here - and my friend loved it.
I will definitely come back.
