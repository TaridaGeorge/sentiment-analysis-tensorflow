Amazing place!   The menu is limited but in way like In n Out Burger.   The staples are the housemade mozzarella, local tomato & basil, the
tuna with red onion, gaeta olives, lemon & arugula, and the soppressata with aged provolone & roasted peppers.   There is also a daily special which I would always recommend.    There is always something for everybody here.   The sanwiches are big enough to split, and you can wash it down with a microbrew soda.   Your meal also come with a complimentary caramel creame.    There is no seating on the inside however there are picnik table outside for those that prefer.   GO!  TRY!  ENJOY!
