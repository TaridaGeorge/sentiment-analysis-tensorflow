I got my first adjustment from Dr. Jordan last week and it was fantastic. He went over and above to get me out of pain. I felt instant relief! He also helped me with tendinitis. I didn't even think that Chiropractic could help with that. Thank you so much Dr. Jordan. I recommend going to see this Dr to everyone!!!
