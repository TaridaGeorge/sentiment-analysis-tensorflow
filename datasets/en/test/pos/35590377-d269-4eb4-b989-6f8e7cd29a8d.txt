From the moment I called, I knew I found a place that cared.

The gentleman was very straightforward on the phone. No suggestions that there might be an extra charge for anything, no mention of any "value adds", nothing of the sort that I've experienced at countless other facilities.

I asked him how much, he asked what year, make and model, I told him, he gave me a price.

I asked if they could get me done that day, he said yes.

Less than an hour later, I was there and home already.

Very nice.

I will be back for future lube and oil work.
