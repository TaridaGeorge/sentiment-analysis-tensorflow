My hotel dropped me off in what was suppose to be a cool part of town for drinks, dinner and shopping.  Anyway, this was definitely one of the coolest stops in this area!

I picked up some a really great children's book- The Uncle Wiggily book - which is now out of print.  I also picked up a paperback book for the plane ride home for less than 3 bucks.  

I love the smell of old books, and it was easy to navigate the shelves, floor and overflow of books.  The owners were very polie and willing to help me find anything.  

And, yes I did see the resident cat milling about!

They also have an old fashion honor system for books they leave outside afterhours that you may purchase using the honor system.  How quaint!

I loved it!
