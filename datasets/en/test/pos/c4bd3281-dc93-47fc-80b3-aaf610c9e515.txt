If I lived closer to Zinc I would be a regular. Instead it is the spot me and my husband always end up going to for date night, anniversary's, and birthday's. Great atmostphere, amazing food. Sometimes it's a little bit of long drawn out meal, but I think thats part of the fun and it's worth the wait!
