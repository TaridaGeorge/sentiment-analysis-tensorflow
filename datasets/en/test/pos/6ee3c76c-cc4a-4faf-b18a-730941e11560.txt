Got a call from a friend today asking for a Vietnamese food recommendation in Phoenix .. and of course the answer was Saigon Nites.  AMAZINGLY friendly family owned business.  We go down to the desert every summer and we drive straight here from PHX.  Better than almost all of the Vietnamese SF places and definitely on par with So Cal.  Highly recommend the Banh Xeo - crepe and the soup stock is excellent.  Just had to yelp-it because I'm craving Vietnamese food and glad to see all the photos !  Oh and it's pretty cheap - usually under $25 for both of us
