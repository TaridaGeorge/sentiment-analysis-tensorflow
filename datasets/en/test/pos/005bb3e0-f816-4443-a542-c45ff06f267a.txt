I loved the place. The atmosphere was great. The staff is friendly. The pizza was great. It can get a little pricey when you order your own pizza and start adding things to it but its well worth it.
I can also say that I ordered a drink at the bar and it was a nice drink. Alot of times I go to restaurants and I hate to order drinks as they are expensive with little alcohol.
