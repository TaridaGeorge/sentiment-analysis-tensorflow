Always a fun time. Food is good, drinks are good, and THEY HAVE COTTON CANDY, along with a mechanical bull (which is on my list to-do). This place is really good for large groups and the crowd is very diverse in age, which I enjoy. I've never been here during the day time, just late dinner and drinks time, but I still highly recommend it! All the staff is friendly and seem to enjoy their job which kinda makes you have a better time since they are all joking around and laughing.
