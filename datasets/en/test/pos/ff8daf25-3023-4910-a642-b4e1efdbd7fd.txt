I love the fact that you can get hotdogs without all the added "unknowns" in them.  Also, I've purchased their pizza dough and throw it in the freezer. I simply take it out the night before, slip it in the fridge and it's good to go the next day for homemade pizza.  Great pizza crust.  Also, the pepperoni and black forest ham are really good there, as are the breads and the interesting salads they sell.  And their bacon - whoa.  Yum.  Staff is always cheerful and ready to chat one up as they are going through checkout.  I really like Whole Foods Market and just enjoy the whole experience of wandering down their aisles.
