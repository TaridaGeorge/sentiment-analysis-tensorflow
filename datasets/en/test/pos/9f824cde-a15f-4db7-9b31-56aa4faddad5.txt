Had a great meal with unusual and authentic Italian flavors.  The sun dried tomato bruschetta was great and reminded me of food I ate in Italy with the cannellini white beans! The string beans in red sauce were awesome!  My husband had the meat loaf and said it was delicious!  Definitely will be eating there again.
