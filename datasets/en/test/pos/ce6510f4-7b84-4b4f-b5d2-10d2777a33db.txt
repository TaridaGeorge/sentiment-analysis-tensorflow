As far as I can remember, I have yet to feel such warmth and comfort at restaurant!  With the dim lights, dope beats, and friendly faces, you can't help but to want to visit The Main Ingredient more often than necessary! 

The staff is amazing and I look forward to sharing a meal at The Main Ingredient with many of my friends in the near future.

Regards.
