I love donuts. The buttermilk donuts are the best. The new store on Southern opens on Monday. I'm going to have to start jogging again. (like I ever did in the 1st place anyway). I have to think. Is there any other donut shop better..... NO. Although putting sugar in your mouth is good by itself, Bosa has some real special way of making their donuts crispy on the outside and real soft and fluffy or dense on the inside. Dunkin is great and will always be getting bigger and bigger like some other donut shop we all use to know. But Bosa is just down right yummy.
