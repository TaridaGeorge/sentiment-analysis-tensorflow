This food was great. I don't see what anybody has to fuss about. It was so fresh, the portions so generous.... I'm going back.
The prices were a little steep, and with this past time being my first, left me a little uncomfortable seeing that I only had a slight idea what I was getting into. 
All in all it's worth going to. The guy inside was really nice and chased me down in my car to give me a 10% off coupon, so his heart is in a good place looking out for me and my stomach.
