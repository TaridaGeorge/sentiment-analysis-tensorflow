Nordstrom Rack is my go-to spot! I love the Rack! Designer clothing, discounted...retail heaven. 

I have gotten great deals here on jeans, shoes, and shirts. 

The Rack is usually well organized and you won't have to worry about clothes being stained or ripped like you might at Ross or Marshall's. 

I have been to both of the Rack's in the valley, and I like this one the best. They have a great selection, and friendly staff. 

The line can get a little long on the weekends, but this is definitely a great place to find great pieces to complete your wardrobe!

Also, The Rack accepts Nordstrom gift cards, credit cards, and points.
