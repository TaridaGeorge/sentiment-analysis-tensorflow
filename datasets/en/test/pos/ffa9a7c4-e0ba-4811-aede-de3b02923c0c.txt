Oh yes, you gotta go here on Food Truck Friday! The guys are so friendly and they play the best music too. Super blues-y, Creole, Old Louisana style. Had the longest line so you know it's worth it! Their glass coke bottles are the tall ones so you get your moneys worth too. I got the Chicken Jamburrito and couldn't finish the whole thing in one setting. This is a big deal because I'm a midwestern girl and you always finish your meal out there. 

Highly recommend anything with their creole sauce or cheese, just melts in with the rest of the ingredients!
