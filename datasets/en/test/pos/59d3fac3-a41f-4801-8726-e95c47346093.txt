Love this place... excellent for the morning after bar hopping when you are too exhausted to even make yourself coffee.

And nothing beats good food for not much money.

Two people for 9.00... bring it on.

I have had the hungry man special, the two egg deal (which they recently increased their prices, probably due to demand because they are PACKED every time I'm in there, even during the week), their breakfast burrito and a couple of their omelets.

I haven't been failed yet.  

The service is awesome, the menu is simple and easy to read and everybody seems friendly, and it's well lit.  A well rounded group of people are in there, from the senior citizens to the hungover tattoo artists I've seen.

I would definitely recommend... it's just like Mom's home cooking.
