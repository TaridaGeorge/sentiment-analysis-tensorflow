Went to the Mill Ave location and ordered the Philly Cheesesteak with wiz.  It was greasy, oily, fatty, and absolutely perfect.   I'd probably die of a heart attack if I ate it every day, but I was in town for only one night and had it both for dinner the first  night and for lunch the next day.  I will have to work hard to keep myself away from it when I return to Phoenix.

Oh, and I should mention that the guy who appeared to be the manager was very friendly and cordial.  These small things make a difference to me.  Also, although others have felt the price was a bit high, I cannot complain about paying $10 and being fully satisfied.
