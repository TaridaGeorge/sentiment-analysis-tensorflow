I had some time alone yesterday so I ventured out to use my Groupon.  I was aware of this place, but never stopped in.  I must say that the quality and overall taste of the tea in this store is by far the finest in the Valley.

I am a tea lover so this store was quite a find for me.  In addition, they sell a number of tea related gadgetry and trinkets.

The tea selection is mainly sold in 100g packs between $5.00 and $7.00.

My only suggestion would be to increase seating and sell some mancha and other less common pure teas.

A helpful and well learned staff.

Give it a try.
