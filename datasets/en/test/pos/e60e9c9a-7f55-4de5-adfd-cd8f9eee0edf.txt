You think in Phoenix they would have more brushless car washes, but there's really only two -- Hot Shots being one of them. 

With the Basic Car Wash, you're able to get an exterior and interior clean for little over $15. With three to four guys working on the car all at once, I was able to get a thoroughly clean car within 20 minutes. 

After looking everything over, I quickly concluded that they had done quite a detailed job within the given time. Highly recommended, will definitely take my girlfriend's car over there later this weekend, which is also black. 

My only suggestion is that you try and get there early in the morning when it's not too busy.
