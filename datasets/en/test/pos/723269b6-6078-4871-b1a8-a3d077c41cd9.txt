I give this local neighborhood hot spot five stars. Owned by Pizzeria Bianco's Chris Bianco, this sandwich/panini joint bakes fresh bread daily made fresh to go, and although the menu is limited usually to three sandwiches and a foccacia bread, it's well worth it. The Market Sandwich which can change is always my favorite. From fresh mozzarella and tomato to superb meats, they can never go wrong. This is a great in and out spot and there is only outdoor seating next to Lux Coffee bar. They also offer salads, fresh baked bread, fig jam and chocolates. I highly recommend this hot spot!
