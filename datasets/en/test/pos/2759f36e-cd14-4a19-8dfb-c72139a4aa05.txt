We visited this establishment for our 13th wedding anniversary and we were not disappointed!  Very relaxed atmosphere.  We sat outside and there were no smokers!! They do not allow smoking on the patio - smokers can go around the side of the building to partake.

Great wine list, also has beer and pop.  No mixed drinks.  Light food menu.  We ordered off the appetizers and it was more than enough and had the Salted Caramel sundae for dessert.  If you get there before 5:00 p.m wine by the glass is $5.00 and pitchers of beer for $5.00 - not a bad deal.  Very nice staff and free valet parking.  We'll definitely return - a very nice alternative to the chain restaurants that seem to have overtaken Phoenix.
