Ignore the fact that it is in a strip mall.  (You live in Az, everything is in a strip mall).  Inside is a magical land of Japanese food unlike most in town.  It is not limited to sushi, there are robata style nibbles perfect for eating with copious amounts of sake or green tea.  The chef's features are the best bet.  When I come, I don't even order sushi unless someone insists.  Trust me, you won't be disappointed.  This is one of the first places to try the izakaya style (props to them for doing this even before Nobu tried with Teeter House).
