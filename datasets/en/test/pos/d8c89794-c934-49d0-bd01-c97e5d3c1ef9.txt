I love these guys! I've taken my car there for years and they've always fixed things right the first time. Other garages have suggested repairs. I've gone to Crutcher for those repairs and they've often told me that I didn't need them--the other garage was just trying to make some money off of me.

DO NOT HESITATE to trust these guys. They're honest and do great work in a timely manner. Their shop is clean. Their staff is friendly and knowledgeable. They take the time to explain what's wrong. They stand by their work. And their prices are fair. I'd give them ten stars if I could.
