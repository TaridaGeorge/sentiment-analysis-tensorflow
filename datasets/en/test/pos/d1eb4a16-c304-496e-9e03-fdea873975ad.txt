The Fez Burger is my favorite burger of all time!  In the valley, I have tried Deluxe Burger and Zinburger which are all great and they come close but can't quite top the Fez burger for me.  Who knew that pears and feta cheese could make such a great combo in a burger?  

And they have the best sweet potato fries to boot.

Cocktails are tasty and the decor stylish but not too pretentious.

The music could be dialed down a bit but otherwise, perfecto.
