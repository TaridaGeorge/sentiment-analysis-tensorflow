My experience at Sally Beauty Supply exceeded my expectations.  Unlike other locations I've visited this store was organized and well-stocked.  I was greeted promptly and all of my questions were answered.  The sales associate was extremely helpful; she had extensive knowledge of the products I was inquiring about as well as the attributes of each brand.  Plus, the product that I chose was a reasonable price and satisfied my beauty needs.  I'll be back for all of my specific beauty needs!
