Breakfast is one of my favorite meals of the day and OVER EASY hits that spot!  I had the signature dish OVER EASY, which is toasted brioche topped with spinach and fried egg.  Oh so yummy!  I also shared a cranberry scone.  The place is small but if you go on  a Sunday before 9am your sure to get a seat in no more than 5 mins.  LIke Kristin says its cheap and oh yeah coffee was good too....anyway try it bc it is seriously tasty!  I had some of my bf's french toast topped with caramelized banana and pecans. TO DIE FOR!!
