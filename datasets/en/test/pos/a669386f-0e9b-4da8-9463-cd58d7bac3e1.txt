its know wonder this place was just voted one of the top 10 places in the country to dine at. comfort food at its finest from the service to the food everything was exceptional..small plates are great to share and the entree are just the right size. thursday all night is $5 wine ..will return on another night to try the different specials.  my only draw back was the manger spent his time sitting at the bar maybe should have done the rounds to acknowlegde the patons..creating the great neighborhood place you want to return..
