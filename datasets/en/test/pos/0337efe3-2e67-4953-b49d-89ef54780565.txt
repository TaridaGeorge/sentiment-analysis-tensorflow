Great atmosphere, good service by attractive people, good selection of wines, and a perfect place to chill and relax. This place is so comfortable... it's dark and full of comfy couches. Occasionally, there's an amazing jazz band that plays. The food is fantastic. You don't have to dress up to go here, but you'll probably want to. I love this place and have only been bummed out a couple times going there... once because of the douchebaggery that night and another time because the door guy was a bit of a dick. Both times though it was on a really busy night. Most of the time, it's one of the best places to go.
