My husband and I chose Binkleys for our 5th anniversary dinner. We don't usually spend that much on a meal, but for a special occasion we decided to splurge, and we are soooo glad we did. We decided to do the 4 course tasting meal, and with the many amuse bouche's throughout the meal we left so full, I couldn't even finish my wonderful seared foie gras. The atmosphere was cosy and inviting, the wait staff friendly and helpful. The three hours we spent enjoying our meal was well spent. We would both like to revisit and enjoy another taste adventure with this lovely resturant.
