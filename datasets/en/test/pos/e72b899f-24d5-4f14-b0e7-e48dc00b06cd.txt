I love Oregano's.  It's hard not to love a restaurant that is able to recruit friendly staff, serve large portions at very reasonable prices, have good thin-crust AND deep-dish pizza, and offer an iconic dessert.  If you haven't been to an Oregano's yet, don't let the prices fool you; the portions are large.  So unless you're morbidly obese, be prepared to share your food family-style and still have some for leftovers.
