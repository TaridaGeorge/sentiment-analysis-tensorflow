Never thought of reviewing the Phoenix Permuculture Guild.  I utilize them for getting answers to our questions regarding raising our chickens, advice on eggs, our consideration for a goat and we even bought fruit trees from them on their annual tree buying day.  They have fantastic classes where they show you how to grow a garden and all kinds of things.  They even have a tour de coups witch shows you different chicken coup ideas throughout the valley.
