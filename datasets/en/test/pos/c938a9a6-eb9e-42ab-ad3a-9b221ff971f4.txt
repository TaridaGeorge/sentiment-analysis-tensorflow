Probably the best customer service I've ever experienced, and the food was good too! 

I went here with my brother tonight and the manager?? was so friendly and accommodating. He told us all about Sandela's mission and gave us recommendations for dinner. I had the Fiesta salad which was simple, but still good. Also got the Brazilian flatbread, Buffalo chx panini, and turkey pesto wrap for the family which all got great reviews!

Definitely going to go back here as they have tons of healthy, delicious options, and customer service is phenomenal!
