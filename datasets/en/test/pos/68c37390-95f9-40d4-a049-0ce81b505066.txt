Update:  I'm upping this to 5 stars because I find myself saying out loud, "I LOVE Fresh and Easy!"  Even though they don't carry fresh beets anymore :(

I REALLY like this grocery store.  I can't stand to shop in a mega store and go back and forth between 27 isles just to get everything on my list.  I usually feel like I need to go home and change into tennis shoes just to do my grocery shopping...but NOT now that I've discovered this quaint little store that has almost everything...including fresh beets!   The produce is far fresher than what I've found at the regular Fry's, Bashas', Safeways...but I'm disappointed they don't carry jicama or living butter lettuce, otherwise, I'd never have to step foot in another grocery store again.  LOVE  the store, the staff and the concept...BRILLIANT!
