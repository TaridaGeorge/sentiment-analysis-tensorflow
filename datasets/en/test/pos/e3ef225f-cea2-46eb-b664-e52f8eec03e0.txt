I love the Daily Dose... moved from AZ months ago and have not found a place like this in my new home.  The menu offers something for anyone so it is a great place to take co-workers or a first date.  The food specials at Happy Hour will leave you full with money in your pocket. 

The food is fresh non-traditional American fare.  My favorite is the Turkey Burger sub Blu Cheese Crumbles.
