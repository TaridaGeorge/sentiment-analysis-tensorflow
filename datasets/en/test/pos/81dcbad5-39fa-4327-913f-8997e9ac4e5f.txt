I'm not a big fan of hot dogs but I could eat Famous Uncle Al's any day of the week.  I happened upon it when driving through the shopping center one day with my mom and we gave it a try.  I've been back numerous times since.

So far I've had the chilli, philly, chicago and corn dogs, fries and onion rings.  All equally delicious.

It's a mom & pop place, attentive service and decent pricing for what you get.  If you're looking for a good dog at a local place (with a local atmosphere - they have plenty of regulars), check this one out.
