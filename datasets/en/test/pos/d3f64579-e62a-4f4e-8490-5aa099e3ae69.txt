Dinner last night was my first visit here and it totally rocked!  The risotto with shrimp is a "must have" if you're a shrimp or risotto fan.  My friend and I split the dish and they added an extra shrimp so that we would each have the same amount!!!!
Pear salad was great and the spaghetti and meatballs were awesome as well.  My boyfriend had the lentil soup and while I'm not a fan, he raved about it also!
