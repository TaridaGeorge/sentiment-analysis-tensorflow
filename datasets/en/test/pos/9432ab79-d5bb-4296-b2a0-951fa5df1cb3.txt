I have dealt with these guys on three occasions and they have been great every time.  

I went to Lowe's and they:

a.  Didn't have blanks for all the keys I needed
b.  The keys they did copy didn't work anyway

So I went to my friendly neighborhood locksmith where every key was flawless, even the "manufacturer only" keys that they didn't have a perfect match for.  They were still able to shave a close blank down and make my keys.

I never go anywhere else now.  Why bother.
