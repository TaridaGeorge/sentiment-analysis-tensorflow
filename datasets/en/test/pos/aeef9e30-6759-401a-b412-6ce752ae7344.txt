This new yogurt shop just opened in our area.  What a great decor and family friendly concept.  The workers and the new owners were friendly and energetic.  We all loved the frozen yogurt and interesting toppings there are at least 50!!  My wife doesn't eat dairy so the mango sorbet was a great and delicious alternative.  We are planning many trips back.
