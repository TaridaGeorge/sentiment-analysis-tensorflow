-Pizza is awesome - they aren't afraid to use sauce (the best part!), the crust, which is a little crunchy, is also great.  Also excellent reheated :)

-They have a good deal on pizza, wings, and a 2 Liter bottle of soda.  I don't normally drink soda, but when it's cheaper to buy the three instead of just pizza and wings, I do ;)

-Parking is difficult.  We went to pick up our order on a Friday evening and couldn't find a spot in the small lot behind the shops.  I ended up having to back my way into the Jiffy Lube next door :/
