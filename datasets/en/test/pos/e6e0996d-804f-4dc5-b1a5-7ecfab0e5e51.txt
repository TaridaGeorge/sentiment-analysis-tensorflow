Fantastic experience - bartender was super friendly, the beer list was HUGE and high quality, prices were unbeatable. We saw "Being Elmo" for $5, can't say we've ever literally smiled through an entire film before! And when we were finished, voila! already at the bar! Beautiful space, very cool decor and tons of seating. Close to some good food and good bars as well. We will be frequenting Filmbar with our handy dandy punch card!
