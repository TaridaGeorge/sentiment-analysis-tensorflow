Top's is the only place I consistently find rare beer and get insightful suggestions on new beer to try.  I never seem to walk out of Top's with less than 2 beers and I never walk out disappointed.  It might be small, but they pack more of a selection of beer than any of the big places.  They utilize their space well.
