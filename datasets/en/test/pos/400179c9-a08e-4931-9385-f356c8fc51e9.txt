We were in town for a couple of nights and we ordered take out on our 2nd night (I wish we would of came the first night too).  I'm not a pizza person, so I opted for the Soho Pizza Salad that was sooo delicious - thanks to the gal that told me how to eat it!  =)   My boys had the Mott Street Meat Lover's Pizza and they said it was all good.

When we came in to pick up, the restaurant seemed to be family orientated and friendly.  I would definitely come again!
