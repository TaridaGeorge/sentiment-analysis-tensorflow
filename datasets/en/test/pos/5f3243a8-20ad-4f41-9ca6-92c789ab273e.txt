Much needed shopping for this area even though it is a little crowded with the Anthem folks.  It has a similar vibe to Kierland Commons but not quite as nice.  It's easy to find yourself in many shops when you come here for just one whether it be Dick's, BevMo, Sunglass Hut, V's barbershop, movie theatre, etc.  Parking isn't too bad, except for Christmas time of course.
