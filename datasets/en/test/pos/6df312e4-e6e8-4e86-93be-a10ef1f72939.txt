This was my first time getting airbrush tan.  I know..pretty shocking.
Brenna was warm and super welcoming.  Im a bit shy, but she made me feel comfortable from the time I walked in.  She went over what she would be doing and checked out my pasty skin tone, before deciding what shades to use on me.  She had me change out of my street clothes and then applied a moisturizing solution via the airbrush.  Then had me assume a stance so she could begin spraying.  It was little chilly going, but felt nice after the heat outside.  She engaged in very pleasant conversation and had me move about to get an even application. After about 20 min we were finished and she showed me my new tan lines.  Very cool. She does an excellent job and is a real pro!  You will not be disappointed.
