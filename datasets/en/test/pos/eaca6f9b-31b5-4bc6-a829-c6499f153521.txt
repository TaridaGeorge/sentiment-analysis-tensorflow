Great pizza! Light but filling, super fresh homemade ingredients that you can taste and just delicious! It does get busy but we were able to snag a table around 1pm so some of the lunch crowd was starting to die down. they are very fast here and servers take good care of you. The caprese and Margherita pizza are fabulous!
