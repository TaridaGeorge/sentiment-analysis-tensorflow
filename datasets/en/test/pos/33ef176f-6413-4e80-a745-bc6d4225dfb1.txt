Absolutely loved this place! My fiance and I came across the Arrogant Butcher while we were in Phoenix celebrating my birthday and our engagement. My fiance had found it on yelp and said "we must go there for lunch one day" while we were there. We ended up going here for my birthday dinner, after a "higher end" establishment couldn't accomodate my gluten allergy. The food, the drinks and the waitstaff were great! It was so good, we went back the next day!
