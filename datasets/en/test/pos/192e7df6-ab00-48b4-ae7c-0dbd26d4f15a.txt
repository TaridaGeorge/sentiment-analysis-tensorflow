We had an event catered last night by Postino for a group of 30.  

The event was a fabulous success.  The food was terrific.  The service, both during the planning process and delivery was excellent.  

If you've never catered food before, please, for your own sanity, consider Postino.  They have an easy menu.  It's affordable.  They're easy to work with.  They also offer discounts for non-profits.

We will be using them for many events in the future.

Thank you Postino!
