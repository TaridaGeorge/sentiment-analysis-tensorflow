love me some retro redux.

a) it's on 7th ave and adds to the fantasticness that appears to persist there

b) it's a queer material candyland

c) although a vintage clothing shop...it doesn't sport the bougie pop your eyes out prices that most do (it's fairly cheap!)

i got a fantastic dress here that I just feel happy staring at in my closet (I don't have a lot going on these days). Seriously. Go to Redux and support 7th ave (and 7th st) businesses!
