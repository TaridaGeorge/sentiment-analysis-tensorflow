I totally love this little place!!! The family that owns this place are friendly. The service I've received have always been excellent. The food has never failed me. I love their Panang and Eggplant...I find it really difficult to avoid ordering the same thing, but it's just so yummy! This is by far the best Thai food I've had in the Phoenix area.
