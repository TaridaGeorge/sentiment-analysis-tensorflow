I could eat here every night...it's that good.  Had dinner a week ago Friday.  Started with the Creamy Grits and Sausage (although the roasted beets were tempting...I never liked beets until I tried them here.  Amazing.).  I had the Pork Osso Bucco with the awesome grilled apple spaetzle.  He had the Beef Bourguignon Shepherd Pie.  Fig and Pecan Pie with that incredible Cream Cheese Citrus Zest Ice Cream to finish.  Good wine selection. Great Service.  Coffee needs a little work, but hey...nothing is perfect.   Beckett's Table is pretty darn close though.
