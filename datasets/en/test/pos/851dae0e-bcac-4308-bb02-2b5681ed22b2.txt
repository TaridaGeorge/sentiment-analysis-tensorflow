Great theater that hearkens back to the olden days when theaters were elaborate in design and a production in and of themselves. Seats, despite being traditional, are comfy. I don't think there's a bad sight line in the house. We were in the 21st row, center and had no view or sound problems.

I especially loved that they served coffees and cappuccinos in the lobby.
