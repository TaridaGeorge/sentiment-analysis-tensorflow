This place is amazing. Love the food - pizza, wings, salads are terrific. It's quiet and the service is excellent. Food quality is consistent. Place is spotless. Very upscale in this little town. We take all of our out-of-town guests here. It doesn't get any better than this. They just opened another restaurant in Tucson off Oracle.
