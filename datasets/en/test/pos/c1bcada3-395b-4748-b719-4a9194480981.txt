First of all.... CHEESE CURDS!!!!! AMAZING! 

second... my experience. I went through the drive through, where they told me to pull forward because they were making my food fresh. I waited 5-7 minutes as expected. when they brought my food out, they apologized about my wait and gave me a free $5 or $6 ice cream container. 

I appreciate the customer service and will return frequently. In tough times, customer service wins business.
