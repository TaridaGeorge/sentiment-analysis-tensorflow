It does not get better than this butcher shop.  Delish cuts of meat, very clean, great help, and great butchers and owners.  I have been buying pork from them for 2-3yrs. now and it just gets better.  Now they are doing alot of the skin on roasts and porchetta, which is to die for!  The nice thing is it is all locally raised, the pigs, beef and chicken.  I drive down from Cave Creek and it is worth every mile!
