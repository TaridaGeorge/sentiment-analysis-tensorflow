I have been to America's Taco shop many many times! Food is GREAT, service is great, and fast. I have tried many different items on the menu and always been pleased. Every person that I have taken to America's.. it has become one of their favorite spots. Great for lunch or dinner.
Chips and salsa are very good, as well as the beans, carne asada, and pork! Definitely a must try.
