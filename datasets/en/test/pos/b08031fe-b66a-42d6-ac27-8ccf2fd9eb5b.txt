Great food!  Great atmosphere!  Great service!  Our table was even visited by the deliciously french manager Andreane (spelling?)  

Outdoor patio seems more like Brooklyn than Phoenix......Ultra urban!  Plus the over all decor seems  notch up from other Pita Jungles I have visited.  I can't wait for this weather to get better.  I hope spend more time on the back patio throughout the winter months, and hope they will bring some live acoustic music on board.
