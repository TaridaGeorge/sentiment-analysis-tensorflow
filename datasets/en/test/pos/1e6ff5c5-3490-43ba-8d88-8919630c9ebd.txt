First timer here during the Christmas holiday season. Attended the Desert Botanical Garden with my family in town. I HIGHLY recommend for anyone attending to hands down go through the grounds with the FREE tour. TRUST me on this! You will be enlightened by the information that these tour guides provide. Honestly if my family and I didn't use the tour guide we would have had a completely different opinion of this place. We very much enjoyed it and our tour guide was great! t

Keep in mind there is a lot of walking. Be prepared. Wear comfortable shoes and clothing and maybe have a beverage and snack on hand, just in case. I liked taking my time to view just about everything out there. 

STUDENT DISCOUNT is HONORED at only $10. Normal adult admission is $18. 
Great savings!
