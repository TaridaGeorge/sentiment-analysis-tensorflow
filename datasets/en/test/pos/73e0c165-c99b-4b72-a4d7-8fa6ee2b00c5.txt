I was in Phoenix for just 2 days and managed to hit this spot up twice!!!! I really wish they had one in LA.

All vegan blizzards, tons of baked goods=my paradise!

My favorites were the Monsoon special (choc cake, choc chips, and choc syrup) which I added PB too and another one with pretzels, PB and chocolate chips.

Can't wait to come back on my next trip to Phoenix. They have a sister veg restaurant next door that I can't wait to try too (yes I may have just eaten Tsoynamis for dinner).
