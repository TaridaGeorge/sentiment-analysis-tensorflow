I'm with Tracy. I really like this place. The layout is clean and simple. The atmosphere super chilled. The food fresh and tasty. Whenever I have business meetings at lunch, I bring people to independent downtown eateries. I feel its my duty to show them that our city is starting to bloom. And everyone I have brought dug the food and the vibe.

But the most important thing? The owner, Dwayne, is super friendly, keen to hear feedback, and eager to make his new restaurant work. 

That's a whole kind of refreshing in itself.
