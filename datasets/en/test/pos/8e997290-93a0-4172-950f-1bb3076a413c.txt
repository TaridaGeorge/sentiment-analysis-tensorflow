There is a lot of dogs here and there is always some snapping and snarling here. Take a tennis ball, leave a tennis ball. It helps if you bring your own jug of dog water so you dont have to get up and walk to the water fountain. Dogs stick their nose in your purse and some dogs steal your toys so whatever you walk in with is a grab bag free for all so be ready to share and get slobbered on too.
