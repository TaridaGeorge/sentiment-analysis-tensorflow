Okay, I came here to today after one year and a half. The food has gotten significantly better. This time I ordered Banh Ouc w/ thit nuong and cha lua. It was pretty bomb. There thit banh mi was SO YUMMY and crunchy! They need to add another slice of beef though. I had some of my boyfriend's pho, it was pretty decent. The place has gotten a lot cleaner too! One waiter even speaks english which is nice since I suck at vietnamese. What a hole in the wall place with good eats! I need to still try their rice and vermicelli plates.
