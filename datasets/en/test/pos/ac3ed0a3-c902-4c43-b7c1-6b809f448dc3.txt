I love this place. I am big on saving money at the grocery store and this one does the trick! And I feel like I'm going gourmet! Their fresh soups are amazing.. try the tortilla and if you're sick, the chicken noodle is Heaven. The breads are so good, and even though at regular price they are well over my budget, there is always a sale loaf that is perfect. If not, they have the 88 cent bread at all times. Never crowded, parking spots for me when I have the kids, no lines at check out, amazing taste testers where they even provide some juice to wash it down. The security guard is super nice, I see him there every time I go in. I don't know how you do it, Fresh and Easy, but I like it!!
