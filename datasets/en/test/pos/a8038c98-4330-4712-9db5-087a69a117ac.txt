After getting hit in the mouth by a crackhead downtown, I went to the web trying to find a dentist to perform emergency repair and reseat my 2 front teeth. I thought I was going to lose them. I found DaVinci  Dental, and was lucky enough to reach them by the emergency cell phone number - and both came into the clinic late on a Saturday afternoon. I still have the teeth. Great service, competent and  friendly dentists
