Love this store! Its huge with a great selection & the saleswomen who helped us was wonderful. Her name was Marcella so you ever go here speak with her & she'll take wonderful care of you!! We had a horrible experience at a competitive store (Mor) after a month of issues (we were promised our furniture in time for a party we were throwing at our new house) we canceled our order with them & went to the Room Store. Should have went here from the beginning. We saved more money, got exactly what we were looking for (which was a lot) and got everything by the next day. Love the Room Store & Marcella, they were life savers!
