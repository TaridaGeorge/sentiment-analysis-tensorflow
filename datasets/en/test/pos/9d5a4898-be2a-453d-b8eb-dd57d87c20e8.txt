as you are walking in the parking lot to chelsea's kitchen you begin to experience chelsea's kitchen.  the smell of wood burning.  the inside of the restaurant is definitely a wow factor.  fyi, the restrooms are nice too.  lol.

the service is top notch!  i feel very welcomed while eating here.

the food is the best.  the chicken nachos starter is amazing!  the cheslea's kitchen cheeseburger and green chile burger, and howie burger are the very best!  the ribeye steak, rotisserie chicken, pork roast wake up my taste buds.

c.k. is in my top 3.
