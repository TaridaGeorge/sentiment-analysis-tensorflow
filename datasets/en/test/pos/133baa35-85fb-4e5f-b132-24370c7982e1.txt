Besides the LaJolla, CA (UTC) location, this is by far one of the better PF Changs. YUMMY! I'm hoping it's not because it's still only 8 months old. (Crossing my fingers)! All the others that I've tried have been way too generous with the sodium in their cooking. Everything is prepared and spiced perfectly! The decorations and design are a bit more subtle than other locations, and the servers and rest of the staff are great. 

Note: I know they advertise that they don't use MSG in their cooking. But my mother had a very allergic reaction; which she gets specifically to large amounts of MSG intake. Maybe that's why the food is so AWESOME!!! (Oh yeah, mom is fine. It's one of those reactions that trigger multiple trips to the restroom before we can pull out of the parking lot. No worries. She thought the food rocked too.)
