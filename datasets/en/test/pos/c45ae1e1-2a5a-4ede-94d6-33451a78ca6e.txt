...I really dislike Cell Phone stores - actually, I'd go so far as to suggest I hate them - but the service here as actually outstanding from the moment I walked in the door until the time I left.  Worked with a young man named Preston who set up my new phone, troubleshot all the issues, and had me on my way in less than 45 minutes.
