If you like trying unusual flavors this is the place for you.  Their Bacon Ice Cream is amazing.  I also tried the Cheese Course Duo(Blue cheese and medjool dates).  The staff was great encouraging us to try as many as we wanted to.  The only bad part is there isn't a location in the West Valley. I'll just have to make a weekend drive to try their Avocado-Jalepeno.
