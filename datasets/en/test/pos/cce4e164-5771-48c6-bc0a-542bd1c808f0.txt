My favorite downtown bar, hands down. Why? It's got the perfect atmosphere -- it's loud, but not deafening, it's cozy, it's got great character and it has a kick ass beer selection. Matt Pool can't seem to do any wrong in my eyes. Have you tried the grilled cheese and tomato soup? There's so much Gruyere on that thing it oozes out on all sides. And the creamy tomato soup, that mixture of heavy cream and savory tomato... it's bliss. 

Kinda tough to get in here on a First Friday, but the Sunday all-night happy hour is an awesome deal.
