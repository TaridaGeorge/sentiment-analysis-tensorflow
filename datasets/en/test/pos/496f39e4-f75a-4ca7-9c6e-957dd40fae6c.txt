Wow I have never met a doctor like Dr. Kim. She is so sweet and compassionate. I had a small scar on my back and went to see Dr. Kim. She asked if she could do a skin exam and I said yes. She did a quick body skin exam and everything was great thank god. She is helping reduce the scar size on my back and is so gentle with any shot or anything she gives. I have a huge needle phobia and her nurse even held my hand LOL can you believe that? I know I sound 10, but it worked! I give them an A+. I would recommend her to anyone. They really know what they are doing!
