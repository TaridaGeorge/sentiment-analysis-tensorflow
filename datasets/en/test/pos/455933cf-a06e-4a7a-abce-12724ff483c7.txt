The last two times I've returned to Solo Cafe, I've brought friends.  Each of these friends have remarked that their drinks were the best coffee they'd ever had.  I have to agree that the espresso drinks are absolutely perfect.  I wish they were open later, but the quality of the drinks, the very friendly staff, and the atmosphere still makes this my favorite coffeehouse in Arizona.
