I don't often come up to the Carefree/Cave Creek area but when I do, we always stop by Bad Donkey. I'm a big fan of their Pizza on a Bun and Donkeypasto salad--the helpings are generous, the food is extra tasty, and the service is quick & friendly! Bad Donkey is also conveniently close to Barlett so it's the perfect place to stop before or after a day at the lake.
