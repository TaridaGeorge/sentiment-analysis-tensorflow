To start off...I am not a big fan of burgers. It is about the last thing I will pick as a food option given a choice. Well we came here for a burger one night and wow, I was impressed. The burger was delicious!!! We both got the BBQ, Bacon and Cheddar burger. The best parts of this burger were the haystack onions and the bacon. I got the BBQ sauce on the side. The burger was SO juicy! The fries were delicious. The staff went out of their way to be super friendly and helpful. 

Now if given the choice...I just may pick a burger as an option to eat, so long as it is at a Smashburger.
