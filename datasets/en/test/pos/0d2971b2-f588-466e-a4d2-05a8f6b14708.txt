I was able to work out a deal with Janet, who is in charge of promotions. I have only had the pleasure to do business with her over the phone.  

She was able to get my items shipped to me, as I received them last night.  They look awesome!  

I now have enough poles to take my nephews out fishing :)

This is now my new favorite Bass Pro- thanks for everything!
