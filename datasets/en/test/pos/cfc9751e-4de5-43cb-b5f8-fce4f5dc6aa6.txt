Tried this restaurant with a groupon. Probably would not have, if I didn't have the coupon. Don't let the storefront and decor stop you from going in. The restaurant is super clean and the wait staff is very friendly. And the food, WOW!  We split the Shrimp Ceviche and the combination pupusa plate. The portions were very generous. I ordered the fruit drink. Everything was absolutely delicious. One of my new favorite restaurants . Will definitely be back.
