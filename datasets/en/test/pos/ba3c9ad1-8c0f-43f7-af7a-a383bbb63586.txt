Back when this place was Katz's Deli, I looked at the grungy, pallid walls, the worn vinyl booths, and the dreadful florescent lighting and thought to myself: "Wow, this place would look better gutted". 

And yes, yes it does.

Nice brunch menu that's priced surprisingly well, comfortable atmosphere (and really nice booths), good coffee and service with a smile. 

New favorite.
