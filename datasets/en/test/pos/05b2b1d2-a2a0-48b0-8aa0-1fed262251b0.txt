This is a slice of heaven in Chandler.  Having a Troon Golf Club in the heart of South Chandler is amazing.  The course has 27 holes...3 nines that all have plenty of water.  The layout of the course is interesting, challenging, and beautiful.  Homes, lakes, and sand traps are abundant, which makes this Golf Resort tough, yet fun.  The Clubhouse is charming, with beautiful limestone and a cedar wood ceiling.  The patio is spacious, with plenty of great food and drink.  Check out Bernard's for lunch, brunch, or dinner.  The restaurant has weekly dinner specials (try Carlo's Italian Buffet on Friday Nights), and you can always order off the menu.  Love the 19th hole Bar, too.  Great place to go, even if you're not a golfer.  Friendly service, feels like a private club (without the dues).
