Great location, gorgeous rooms
Was very grateful to be in such a place.

Rooms came with a fully stocked kitchen, two bedrooms, and two nice flat screens, and a bathroom with jacuzzi and were spotless.

The concierge and the staff were quite helpful and the surrounding area and malls have everything you need in a 5-10 min car ride radius. The business center was also quite helpful for printing my grand statistics homework (a travesty that my break was spent sorting that out but never mind about that).

Overall a great place to spend break.


Oh yeah free fast wi-fi (always an underrated perk)
