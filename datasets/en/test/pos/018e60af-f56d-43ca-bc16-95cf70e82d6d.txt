Another satisfied customer!  The food is so freaking delicious and fresh.  Cibo is in a beautiful old home that makes it feel intimate and romantic - there's really not a bad seat in the house.  Service is consistently good.  

Things you should know: they close from 2-5 on weekdays; they don't serve pizza for lunch and if I'm not mistaken, I believe they make fresh pasta on Tuesday's and Wednesday's.  

My favorite wines: Chianti, Neprica, Aglianico 

My favorite menu items: Burrata, margherita pizza
