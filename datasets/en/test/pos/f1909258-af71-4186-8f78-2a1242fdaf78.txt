The quirky name drew me in, but the craft beer selection is what really won me over. A personal fave is the Bells Two Hearted Ale, with its delightful balance of hops and malt. It goes fast when they have it, as the taps rotate regularly to ensure fresh options from local and national brewers. The boneless wings are moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. The selection of sauces (lemon pepper is my addiction) will have you licking your fingers and counting your lucky stars. If you want to indulge, order the fried pickles--a Midwest favorite, like spears of salty, crispy goodness. There are plenty of healthier options such as salads, wraps and rice bowls. You won't be disappointed by the witty bartenders and warm service.
