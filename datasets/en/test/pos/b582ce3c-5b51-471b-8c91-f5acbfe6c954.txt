There is no way any single restaurant can live up to the 5 stars of so many heavy-hitting Phoenix Yelpers, srsly. This place must be a myth. 

That's what I thought as we made our way down to the tiny (i mean, tiny) hole in the wall that is Pizza A Metro.

We got a pizza in the "metro" size, which basically means "this is the inside dimension of our oven/this is the biggest pizza we can possibly make" size.

I had a foodgasm, and I'm not ashamed to admit it. I was, however, a little ashamed to do it in front of my best friend's mother. 

"Oh, he's fine, Mom. He just really likes basil."

I cannot wait to go back and try everything on the menu.

Go. Go now. Your lunch/dinner plans have just been shanghaied. You will thank me later.
