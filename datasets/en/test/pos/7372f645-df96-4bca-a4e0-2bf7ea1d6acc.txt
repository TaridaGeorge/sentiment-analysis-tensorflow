What the? 6.99 per person and it's a GOOD quality buffet!! We arrived in AZ very hungry and found this next to our hotel so went straight to it and noticed a lot of cars parked outside which indicated it was popular.

inside, was very neat. Workers were continuously filling nearly empty trays. The food is fresh, lots of homemade dishes, very clean, fully stocked, nice staff! The carrot cake was so fluffy and homemade!! i also loved the fried fish, roasted and fried chicken, peach cobbler.
