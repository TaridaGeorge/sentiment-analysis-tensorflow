Exactly what Ahwatukee needed. Great food and service every time I visit. The chicken fried steak and eggs with sausage gravy that barely fits on the plate is a favorite of mine for breakfast. The club and patty melt for lunch are both very good choices. The french fries are not the greatest but the onion rings are awesome!!
