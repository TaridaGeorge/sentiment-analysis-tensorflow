Is there really anything that can be complained about when it comes to TJ's?!?  

Favorite place to shop, hands down.  As if the itmes they carried weren't enough to keep me coming back, the staff is the topping on the cake!  Always friendly, helpful and willing to do what it takes to make customers happy.  

I love you TJ's!
