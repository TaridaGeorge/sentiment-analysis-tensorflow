I was so excited when I was their store sign go up! I usually get my flavored oils and vinegars while driving thru Cottonwood once a year. I'm so glad i can now purchase them locally. I love that you can taste the flavors before purchasing. The owners, local Laveen residents, are friendly and love talking about how to cook with the oils/vinegars. I have purchased four flavors and use them for making salad dressing, for dipping bread, and as extra flavoring for grilling veggies. I also bought a dessert vinegar that I like to pour over fruit. Yum! I saw the owners at a local event, Second Friday Laveen Art Walk, and they mention that they now offer  their space for events and small parties. Great for a girls night out, wedding shower, etc. You can byob.  You got to check them out!
