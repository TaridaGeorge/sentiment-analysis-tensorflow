I admit it... I usually don't venture into vintage clothing stores, but I was told that Retro Redux was the best in town.  Since Stephy S. (admittedly a vintage clothing fiend) was in town, I had to do some research and show her that Phoenix has a little bit of everything INCLUDING great vintage!

Not only was Stephy impressed (see her review recently posted), but I was pleasantly surprised, and I even walked out with a purchase of my own!  Retro Redux was a very cool place... from the vintage furniture, clothing, shoes, jewelry, books, and more to the music playing inside.  (Each room had different music and it made shopping there even more fun!)

I will come visit again, Retro Redux... and I may even come visit when Stephy S. is not in town!  Vintage is fun and the prices are just right!
