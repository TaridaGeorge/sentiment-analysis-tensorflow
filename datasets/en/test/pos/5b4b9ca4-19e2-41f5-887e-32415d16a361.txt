We take our family here nearly every week. The food here is great, and the prices are very reasonable. Our favorites include the Buffalo Chicken focaccia (as someone else has mentioned, this is really a thick-breaded wrap), the burgers, the onion rings, and the fries. The best item on the menu, though, is the fried cheese stick appetizer. They wrap the cheese in what appears to be wanton skins and fry them up - amazing.

As sports bars go, this isn't the place to watch every detail of a big game. However, they have lots of tvs with a good variety of sports on - more of a diversion than the actual main event of the restaurant.

In all, this is our favorite local restaurant.
