This is one of my favorite places for both lunch and dinner (separate menus for each).  The food is amazing and unique.  The atmosphere is quaint and intimate, perfect for date nights or dinner with close friends!  Service is not quick but the mood is relaxing and casual.  Never disappointed with this place!!
