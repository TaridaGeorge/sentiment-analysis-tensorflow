OMG- DEELISH!
The super dark chocolate is to die for, especially combined with either pistachio, cheesecake, or coffee.
All of the fruity flavors are a huge hit with my kids and my husband.
Their prices vs portions are completely reasonable- and knowing that I'm getting something that is better quality than ice cream just makes the whole thing sweeter!
