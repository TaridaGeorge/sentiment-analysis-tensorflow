I am not a big wine drinker but Total Wine is awesome! They have the biggest selection and the best prices.This place puts BevMo to shame! I can spend hours just wandering the store.The employees are very helpful and have some great suggestions. I am the worst at remembering wines I have had at friends or restaurants, even though my descriptions are often sketchy, they know exactly what I am talking about. They have an area where they do samples of wine, champagne or sometimes beer. This location is awesome and the employees are always very friendly.
