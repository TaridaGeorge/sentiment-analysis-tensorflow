You can't really say it's the best burger in Phoenix because it's not really a burger, it's a Delux burger which is very different.  The bun is not round, it's like a hoagie roll cut in two.  The cheese is fancy, the veggies are fancy, the meat is medium rare and very tender.  The service is usually pretty good.  Very professional and they're always checking back on you to make sure you have everything you need.  The decor is very hip and modern.  The blue lights are very easy on the eyes.  It's very dimly lit- I almost couldn't see in the bathroom.  They have a pretty decent beer selection.  I tried the Papago Orange Blossom.  Very unique beer that's very smooth and flavorful.  The french fries come in a little shopping cart.  Very cool.  They are flavorful and addictive.  This is a great place.
