We travel a lot, so I feel comfortable saying that the parking spot is pretty dang good. The parking is covered, the shuttle vans come frequently (probably every 10-15 mins), and the service is efficient and friendly. When you enter, you can get a copy of the paper, and when you exit, you can even bottled water.  

Over Thanksgiving, we got exceptional service. As was expected, it was quite full. Even though we didn't have reservations, they valeted our car for us and parked it so we could easily catch the shuttle.  We have been very pleased.
