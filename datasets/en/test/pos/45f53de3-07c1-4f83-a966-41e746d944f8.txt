Amazing, amazing, amazing. Been there less than 10 times due to living super far away, but would be there every day if I could. Haven't had the fruit flavors, but all the chocolate and nut ones are great. Had real gelato across the walk from Treve Fountain while in Rome... and this might just be better. 

Only complaint is one time I had a snotty high schooler helping me out.. but whatever. The ice cream makes up for snotty kids.

DELISH!!!
