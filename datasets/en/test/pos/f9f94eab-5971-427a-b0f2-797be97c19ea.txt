I probably will never buy a cake from anywhere else.  I am totally spoiled. I was treated like a Queen, the shop itself is lovely, and the cake??? OMG!!  I've tried two now, and both were beyond delicious. I bought one small one for my husband for our anniversary and another large one for my daughter's birthday.  It didn't just taste amazing, they took such care in wrapping and appearance.  The customer service is the best I've experienced since I've moved here.  Price? I thought it would be along the same line as the cakes I used to buy in KC where I moved from.  Nope, not as much.  The prices are great.  I LOVE this place!!!!
