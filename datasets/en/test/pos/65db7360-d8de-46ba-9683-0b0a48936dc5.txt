Cornish Pasty Co. is awesome! Fun environment! Friendly people!! Great service!!! And the food is INCREDIBLE!!!! Seems like every time I try a new pasty, it is my new favorite... Until I try another! The dessert pasties, seriously, are the most AMAZING deserts I have ever had! ***warning: pasties are HOT when delivered to your table... Be patient, enjoy slowly!
