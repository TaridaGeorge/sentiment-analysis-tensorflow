On a super crowded Sunday during football season, Four Peaks still delivers. Great service, cold local beer, and a good selection of better than average bar food. I had the breakfast burger with a large patty, topped with bacon, an egg, cheese, and jalape√±o mayo. The bun was flavorful, and the burger itself was perfect. The potatoes were well seasoned too. Hubby had a white pizza with chicken and mushrooms. Great portions. We rode our bike here as do lots of other fans. This place favors the Vikings on SuNday mornings, so beware! Breakfast till 2pm, and good eats all day long. Thanks for the friendly service too.
