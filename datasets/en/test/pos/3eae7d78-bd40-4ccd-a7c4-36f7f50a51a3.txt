I took my friend to lunch for her birthday, and the entire experience was incredible.   A birthday card awaited at her place, "happy birthday" confetti was strewn on the table, PLUS the most charming waiter brought us complimentary glasses of champagne!  Also, dessert was comped.  The staff was attentive, but not intrusive or "cutesy", and did not seem to mind that we lingered.  The food, oh yes, we were there for lunch, was outstanding.  I will most certainly return.
