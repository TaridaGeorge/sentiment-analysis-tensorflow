Stayed here with my wife when business brought me to Phoenix and had a great time. Our room was a nice suite a la the Embassy Suites brand and the price was reasonable. The casitas are much bigger and also a good deal, price-wise. We just didn't need that much space. We enjoyed the lazy river, the water slide, the wading pool with a waterfall, and the hot tub. It's great in the summertime as well as the shoulder seasons.

Note that this hotel is very kids-oriented. At peak times there can be crowds of boisterous adolescents in the pool areas, many of them with no adult supervision. The hotel is also "pet friendly", a plus for some and a minus for others.
