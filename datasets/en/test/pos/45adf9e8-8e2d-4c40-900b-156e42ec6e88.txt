Great Food, Great Service and Great prices!!!

Cozy environment with good music playing throughout the night!  Service was exceptional - all staff very polite and attentive.

Garlic knots were exceptional - both the knots and the sauce!  Meatball sliders melt in your mouth and Peanut butter dessert was delicious too!  Forgot the name but only one with peanut butter.  Everything we had was delish but these items really stuck out.

Give them a try I don't think you'll be disappointed.
