This store is a diamond in the rough.  First, let me say that I have purchased several computer systems from this location as well as had them repair other computers.   These guys have a vast array of experience in all things computer related and they have a very loyal folliowing of customers including myself.  Living in Surprise, I can say that going to AZ computer solutions is worth the drive!!
