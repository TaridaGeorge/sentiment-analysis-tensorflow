My family and I have been going to the Farmhouse for 4 years now. I have tried almost everything on the menu and have not been disappointed yet. Their potatoes and honey wheat french bread toast make every omelet or scramble delicious. The sandwiches are just as good. The triple decker club is my favorite. If you are there on the weekend the green chile pork omelet is hands down the best breakfast dish I have ever had. I love that dish so much I wrote in to Diners, Dive Ins and Dives on the Food Network to try and get that recipe shown on tv. 

On a side note, when I have recommended this place to coworkers they confused it with the Gilbert House in the Farmhouse Village. The Farmhouse blows the Gilbert House out of the water.
