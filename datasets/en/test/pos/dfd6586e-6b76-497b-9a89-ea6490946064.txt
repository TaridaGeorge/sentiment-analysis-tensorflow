I love the frozen yogurt here.  The place is VERY clean, with lots of selection for yogurt and the toppings.  I especially like the peanut butter and chocolate combination -- oh, the cappuccino is a new favorite.
I've been here at least 10 times, and the service is always very friendly and helpful.  
The decor is clean and a little sterile -  chairs are not comfortable (they probably don't want you to linger).  They also have these sofa type seating that is more like trying to sit on a single bed -- the seat is very deep, not sure what that's all about.
They now have wifi available too.  But you can probably catch it from the Starbuck's next door.
