I came for my parents' anniversary and ended up taking advantage of the happy hour. We ordered 12 appetizers (two of each), the Penedes cava wine, and four Mai Tais. Five stars for everything including the service. The Creme Brûlée was perfect: served in a shallow, large-diameter dish to get the most hard shelled top!
