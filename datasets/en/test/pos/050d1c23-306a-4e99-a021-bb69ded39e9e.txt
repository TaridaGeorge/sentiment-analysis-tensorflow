Honestly, the burgers are damn good. I got the Greek (which came with fries and a canned drink, tea or regular lemonade for $6-something). It came piled with feta and had this great pesto mayonnaise. 

The fries went really well with the curry ketchup they have available at no extra charge. 

Midway through lunch, I decided the lemonade menu was far too tempting, what with how many flavors they had, and got a prickly pear-flavored one ($3). 

No lie. Best lemonade EVER.
