This place is absolutely fantastic.  The prices are the same as any of the corporate spots, the wait is shorter and everyone is actually nice and helpful.  Forget about the long waits and rude corporate pharmacists people.  Do yourself a favor and stop in to Melrose Pharmacy, support a local business and maybe even check out the drum setup they have for First Friday!  I highly recommend this place!  Theresa the owner is great and super helpful!
