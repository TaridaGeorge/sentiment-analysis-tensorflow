I've been here twice. Once for brunch and once for late night type stuff. 

As most of the reviews state the food is good. I feel the portions are great. I think the overwhelming cheese plate could use more bread.

The service is friendly and reminiscent of going over to a friend's house. A friend that charges you for the food you've eaten.
