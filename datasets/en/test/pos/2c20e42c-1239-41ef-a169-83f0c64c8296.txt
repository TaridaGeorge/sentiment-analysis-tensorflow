This is some of the best vegetarian pho out there.  It is so flavorful and delicious.  The veggies you get with it are perfect.  I have been to some other places where the veggie selection in the pho is lacking, but not here.  My man (a meat-eater) even gets the veggie broth because he actually likes it better.  (He does add some rare beef to it though).

The staff is always extremely friendly and accommodating.  

Happy hour is good.  I recommend the spring rolls, which are around $3 with happy hour.

You can certainly leave here happy, full, and with money still in your wallet.
