I found Fit City Crossfit (also known as Scottsdale Healthcare Crossfit) through a friend that had joined. I had been doing crossfit for a little over a year, and was looking for a new gym. (CF gyms are pricey!)

I was surprised to learn that this gym cost about what a normal 'globo gym' membership would be monthly, so I figured it couldn't hurt to check it out. I'm SO glad I did - the trainers / coaches are awesome, and the group of people that work out there are super motivating, welcoming and keep you energized. I really like that FC has beginners classes as well as regular CF classes, so there is a place for anyone that wants to workout. 

It's a great gym, with great people, with great pricing.
