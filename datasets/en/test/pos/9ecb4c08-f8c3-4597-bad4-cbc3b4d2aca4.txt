When you walk in, you may feel like you entered a mini Asian version of the IKEA cafeteria. Although the furniture and decor is simple and modest, it is a cozy atmosphere that feels clean.

The food was excellent--the best Vietnamese I've had in the area so far. We tried the seafood pho, which had real seafood broth from real crab meat; the beef pho; and some bruschetta-like thing with black pepper shrimp on top. The portions were satisfying. 

The prices may be slightly higher relative to other Vietnamese places in the area, but it's worth it.
