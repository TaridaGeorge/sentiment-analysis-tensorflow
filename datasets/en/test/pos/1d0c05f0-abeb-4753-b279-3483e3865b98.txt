We just went for happy hour - great drinks, nice decor and very friendly bar staff.   The Mai Tai and Suffering Bastard are both killer and our bartender kept giving us tastes of other drinks too.

Only slight downside is that one of the happy hour apps were curried chicken wings that just smelled awful whenever anyone near us got an order of them.
