The huge screen and crystal-clear digital projection make this an awesome theater to see a blockbuster film in. All Harkins theaters are great because their concession stand doesn't rip you a new one when you show up (Yay loyalty cups!), but this theater is particularly impressive. My wife pointed out that the arm rests don't go up as they do in some other Harkins, which meant she couldn't get up close, but it doesn't diminish the sound or picture quality.
