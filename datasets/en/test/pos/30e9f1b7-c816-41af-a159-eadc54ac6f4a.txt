Due to this pregnancy, I've given up my vegetarian ways so this baby can have some extra protein! I should have known as soon as I was craving cheeseburgers, he was a boy! 

I work about two blocks from here and some co-workers decided to go here for lunch one day. Cheeseburgers and milkshakes? Count me in!

I love this place! Very 50-ish with the counter and barstools. The cheeseburgers are to die for! I mean it! And they give you a heaping of fries! They also have sweet tea here, which is a bonus for me. The orders are so quick! Granted, you do come out feeling as if you can't eat again for days, but it is so worth it! Good thing there isn't one by my house or else, I would eat there more often than I do!

Definately recommend!
