I love this place.  It's a small restaurant inside Talking Stick Casino.  Sit at the bar if you want the full experience.  Watch them fix your Cajun meal right in front of you in the steam pots.  I've been to New Orleans several times and this food stand up with meals I've had along Bourbon St.  The portions are large and flavorful.  They tend to run spicy ... You set the level on a scale of 1-10 when you order.  5 is as much as I can handle.  It's fun to watch if someone orders a 10 while you're there.  Everything I've had there is good including raw oysters, steamed shrimp, gumbo, and jambalaya.  Only thing that could have been better was the collard greens.  The bacon in them made them too salty.
