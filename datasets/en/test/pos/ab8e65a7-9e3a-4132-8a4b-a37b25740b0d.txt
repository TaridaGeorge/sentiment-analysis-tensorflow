I think this is a gem in a sea of mediocre restaurants. Lunch on Friday was very flavorful fried rice with chicken, tasty shrimp and vegetables. They use fresh herbs; It came with a nice little salad for a total $8.00, generous portions for such a small price. 
My last visit was a Thursday night for pad Thai, also very good but I ordered it mild. Order medium heat (flavor) it's not overwhelming hot. 
 The music is contemporary coffee house blend not the whinny Asian music you get at most Asian restaurants. A very comfortable atmosphere for an intimate conversation, relaxed, clean and friendly. They make a good mojito too.
