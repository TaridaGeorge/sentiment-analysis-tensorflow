A wonderful trail for when you are in the mood for a more leisurely hike with views that are not too hard to work for. I can say that now that I am sitting in the lounge feet up while casually typing on the laptop : ) Seriously though it is an easier hike .... good for the kids and pets with some very nice sweeping views of McDowel Mountain Ranch. A wonderfully preserved trail with easy to follow directions. Don't forget the water and sunscreen!
