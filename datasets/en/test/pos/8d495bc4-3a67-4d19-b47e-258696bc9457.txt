Friendliest doctor I've ever met. I have tried a handful of dermatologists here in the Valley and Dr. Racette was a great find. He's younger than you would expect, but his bedside manners are great. He's friendly and makes you feel comfortable and appreciated as a client. Last but not least for the ladies I can easily say the Valley has found its "Mcdreamy" in him. No hesitation recommending him. 
I also just found out he is among the dermatologists listed in this year's Top Doctors in Phoenix Magazine and deservingly so.
