Love this place...i try to come here everytime i'm in Phoenix. The service is always great, the crowd is definitely my kinda people and the decor is beautiful. I love the patio. Here's a few things that i love from here. 

FEZ FRIES!!! They do the sweet potato well. They taste like little strips of heaven fused with French toast. I love them!!! 

Breakfast Kisra - absolutely delicious. Definitely good for a hangover lol...kinda heavy. I suggest ordering for 2. 

The champagne mimosas are good...kinda on the bitter side, but still good. My absolute fave is the Peach Belini...always gets me drunk lol
