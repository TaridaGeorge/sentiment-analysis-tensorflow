I won't make this too long, because the key point is this: amazing food. 

The Fez burger is the best hamburger on the planet. Seeerrriously! Such a perfect combo of, well, everything. And the sweet potato fries come with an icing sauce, unbelievable! 

A little too uber-trendy, but the unique menu makes it worth the foray into unnecessary chic-ness. 

Recommended occasions to go here? Weekend lunch date or weekday happy hour.
