I LOOOOOOOVE the staff at the Metro Center Petsmart!!! Especially Kayla in Grooming!!!!!

She realllllly loves my dog, takes great care of him, is always happy to see him and does such a great job with him! And Ladmo loves his special girlfriend! When we tell him he is going to go see his grooming girlfriend he gets all sorts of excited! 

The staff at this store is always friendly and always full of information and readily give my dog attention and pets whenever we are there :)
