This is for the office in Ahwatukee. I was originally a patient with the dentist who sold his practice to Imagine Dental.  I put off going as long as I could and even considered looking for a new Dentist.   But because of a tooth issue I needed someone quick.  I scheduled my appt with Imagine, got in pretty quick and was especially happy with the new hygienist.  I loved that she would tell me exactly what she was going to do.  So I knew what to expect.  The dentist did a great job on my fillings (replacing).  Virtually pain free.  The shot was the worst part, but that wasn't even terribly bad.  Everyone in the office is friendly and welcoming.  I'm pleased with the service and, in a way, am looking forward to my next appt.  That's saying something!
