I love this place. I have been going here since i moved to the valley and have never ever been even remotley close to disappointed! every single thing i have had here has been delcious. i usually start with the ahi temura roll then i move onto soup, i love a good corn chowder and tonto has some of the best, slightly smokey and nice and chunky, i have tried almost everything on the menu and usually notice when they add something new (such as the butternut squash soup) excellent! my favorite entree item so far has been the chilean sea bass which just melted in my mouth. I think it was a featured item though because i have not seen it since. service is always good and the atmosphere is excellent, i recogmend a nice sun set dinner on the patio.
