Crunchy Spicy Tuna!!! Oh so Delicious!

I underestimated Arizona....This place was just awesome!

They have the best happy hour I have seen even in LA. $5.00 beers and $5.00 sushi 8pm-close. Yup we closed the place. 

It a small little whole in the wall restaurant that is located in a shopping center next to a subway.

We arrived here after our 7 hour Drive from LA to AZ. The place closed at 10...i think, but we arrived at 11:15 and they still let us order food and beer! YAY
Even after we were done....they let us order dessert! Excellent Service and Awesome Staff. 

Oh Yen Sushi...You had me at Hello....
