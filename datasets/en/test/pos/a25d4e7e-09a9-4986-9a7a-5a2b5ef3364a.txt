This chapel is really cute! Right across the street from campus :) I've been to mass here twice they have mass here daily m to fri at 6:30 pm and on sat at 5 they also have mass sunday at 12 pm. I loved the priests homily he was so funny! He's current and up to date and relates very well to the students as he talked about Taylor swifts swifts song we are never getting back together!! I actually had a newman center on my campus and it was similar to this one :)
