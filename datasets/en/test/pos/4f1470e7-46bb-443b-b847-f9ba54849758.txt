I have used Mr Handyman twice now and they are the best if you want things done right the first time.  I also called them yesterday to help me fix my patio roof leak since they are the only ones willing to help me.  I used to have a handy man I found on Craigs List but he shows up when he wants to and the last time I saw him I thought he might be on crack.  I don't take chances any more.  They replaced the seal around my back french doors since there was light coming through which mean air going out.  They are very professional and communicate well, someone always answers the phone and they show up when they say they will.
