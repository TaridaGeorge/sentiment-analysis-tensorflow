My mind has been changed about this place, upgrading my last reviews.  I guess 3rd time is the charm, but the pulled pork "jumbo" sandwich and sides were amazing this time around.  I had the mac and cheese (love the crust) and the potatoes were perfect.  Everyone else in the group loved what they got too and had no complaints.  It is pricey for having to serve yourself, but I guess I don't mind as much when its this damn good!
