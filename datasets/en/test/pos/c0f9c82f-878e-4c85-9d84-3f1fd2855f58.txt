Great HH - totally fun place. Nice clean bar with tons of TVs. HUGE selection of beer on tap. Service was fast as we had multiple people stop by to check on us when we were in last week. We got a mini pizza and some salads which were fresh and had a really flavorful house dressing. We'll defiantly be venturing back during the football season.
