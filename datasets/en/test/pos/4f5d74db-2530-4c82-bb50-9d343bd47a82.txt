A great little thrift store in the Melrose District run by a local charity that helps young women out--easily one of the best with their great selection, low prices, and very sweet and helpful staff. I usually find awesome books and clothes here every now and then. Way more organized that other places close by and very reasonable, too. Help out a good cause and expand your wardrobe with some kooky vintage pieces too!
