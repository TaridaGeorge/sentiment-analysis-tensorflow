Once you navigate the madness known as "Central Ave. Construction" and arrive at this Kinko's you are met with the most friendly and professional staff. It is worth the travel time for ya'll I promise. Other Kinko's, to me, seem less personable. Here, Raul, Rhonda and Cameron (and the other unsung heroes) treat you like a king. Or a queen. Depending. U get it. They really know their stuff here. UB. Link. FAX...all the lingo...they are in the ringo! I've had invitations, signs and all sorts of other "paper" products produced here...all the best. "Oh Kinko's you're so fine. You're so fine you blow my mind. Oh Kinko's". Darn, there's a song in there somewhere!
