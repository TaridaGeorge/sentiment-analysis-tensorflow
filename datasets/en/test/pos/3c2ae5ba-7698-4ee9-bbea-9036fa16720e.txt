The overall experience will become something you crave.  Take visitors here, take your dog!  Nestled in a huge pecan grove, with organic garden, just moments from the city, the food is amazing.  You will never forget it.  The place should be named "The Jolly  Farm," because I didn't want to leave.  I woke the dreaming about the chocolate cookie I took to go and ate when i  got home.  FANTASTICAL !!!
