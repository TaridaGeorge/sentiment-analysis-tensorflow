My wife and I were in Phoenix for the weekend and had a wonderful time touring the Melrose District. Retro Ranch has so many mid-century treasures that we were tempted to fork over the gas money it would take to return to San Diego. Lamps, stereos, clothing--some of which would actually take a time machine to find otherwise.

Not only that, but the woman who helped us was kind and very, very well informed with respect to her inventory and its value. Great shop--looking forward to visiting again next month. Maybe they'll let us stay in favor of a hotel?
