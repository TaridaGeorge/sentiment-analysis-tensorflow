This is a great gaming store.  The staff here are friendly.  There is enough space to walk around people who are gaming.  There are plenty of tables to play at.  The selection of merchandise is great.  There's a dedicated card store attached.  The weekend hours are great for gamers who want to stay up a bit later to play.

The prices are retail, which is okay if you're just buying something small and don't want to bother with or if you really need to look at what you're buying before you pay for it or if you really need something the same day.

I don't believe they sell individual dice.
