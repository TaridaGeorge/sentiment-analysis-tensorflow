My visit with Dr. Sims, was great!!!  I transferred to her from another Physician that didn't give me the results that I felt I needed.  I chose to go on a student shift where they consult the attending physician after the intake, but I actually saw Dr. Sims each time I came for a visit.  She got right on it to "fix" my situation, without me having to go on a round about way of wasting money and no results.  Based on my experience with Dr. Sims, I have chosen to make her my primary care physician!
