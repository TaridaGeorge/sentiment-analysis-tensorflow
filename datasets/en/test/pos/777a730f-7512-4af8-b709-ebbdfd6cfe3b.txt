This place NEVER disappoints! What can I say that hasn't already been said here?

Outstanding, delicious homemade food! Excellent service! Generous portions! Reasonable prices! The BEST homemade soups!

Be sure to eat here if you are in the downtown Glendale area. 

Margaret & Waldemar are the owners. Margaret waits on tables and Waldemar is the chef...the food, portions, and service are just as consistent today as it was when they opened years ago.

Your first visit WON'T be your LAST!

FIVE STARS!!!
