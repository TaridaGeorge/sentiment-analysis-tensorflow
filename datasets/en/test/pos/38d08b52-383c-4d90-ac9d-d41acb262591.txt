Back to 5 stars cuz I just love this place! And because I haven't seen the server with a corncob wedged tightly her nether regions the last two times I have been in. 
Holly, the bartenders (there are 2!) are both super nice and always friendly. One of them always calls me "hon", which reminds me of Arkansas and I love it!) Anyway- my new fav is the honey ahi salad on their specials menu. The seared ahi is sliced and tastes amazing with the strawberries, mangos and pineapples all covered in the tangy-sweet honey dressing! I can't get enough. I would only love it more if they added avocados. Maybe I will ask next time!
