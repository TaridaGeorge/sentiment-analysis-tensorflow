This place has become my favorite Pho in the area. It's not the kind of place you would take a date, well unless you knew them well and they like pho but the food here is awesome and it's very inexpensive. I'd say -1 for atmosphere but +2 for the food. Every time I go here they are fairly busy but there is always a table available. It's quickly becoming my favorite lunch hangout. I give two thumbs up, Vietnamese hole in da wall pho at it's best!
