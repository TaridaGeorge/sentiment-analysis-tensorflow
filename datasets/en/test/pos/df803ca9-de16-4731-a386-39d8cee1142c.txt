Ok. before I start raving like a love struck fan boy at a (insert appropriate cheesy band) about the service, let me say this - dude that was about the best God blessed service ever! Holy bleep batman this is a tire store ! 

I mean seriously, think about it - a trie store ! Lord have mercy they are 

- good 
- fast - and how 
- courteous 

It really is that damn good. They had me in and out in about 30 minutes, and to think the same discount tire branch down the road on Frank Lloyd Wright told me it would take me about 2 hours. Bottom line, if anyone ever at DT reads give your guy Matt a raise. He's worth every damn penny.

Love the place.
