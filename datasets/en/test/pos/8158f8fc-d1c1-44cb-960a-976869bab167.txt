Two words, CHICKEN PANINI!!!!
Actually, I'd like to add the mixed basket of fries. The burger is great too but I always default to the panini. I have never had anything like it. Its fantastic. The atmosphere is pretty cool and the staff are friendly. Its open until 2am so its always a great place to go for late night eats. Definitely go here, you wont regret it.
