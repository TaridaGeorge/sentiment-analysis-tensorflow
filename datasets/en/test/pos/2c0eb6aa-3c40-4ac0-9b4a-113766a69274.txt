My girlfriends and I go to a different restaurant in the EV every month, this was my pick, it was delicious! 
Though the center is a bit   lacking in appeal , the food absolutely makes up for it! 
Some tried the Cuban Sandwich, the Steak Sandwich, Chicken Sandwich, and I had the Cuban Shrimp in creole sauce with the rice & beans, just wonderful. Everything is flavorful & plentiful, and the staff is very nice, as well as the great Cuban music! Can't wait to go back.
