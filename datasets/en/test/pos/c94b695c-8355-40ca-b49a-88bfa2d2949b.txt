I actually visited here about 5 months ago, but I liked it so much I figured I should give it a few good words! 

I was at the mall looking for something healthier than a pizza or burger and decided upon this place. It is part of their little slogan after all!

I was not disappointed. I chose the beef kabob with a side of fries and pita bread with a cup of hummus. Everything was positively fresh and absolutely delicious. And the portions were big, too. I didn't think I would be filled up after the meal, but I was stuffed!

The staff was very friendly and cooked everything in a timely manner. I was surprised they weren't getting nearly as much business as the other joints around the food court. They don't know what they're missing!
