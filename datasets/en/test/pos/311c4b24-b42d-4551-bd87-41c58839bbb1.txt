I have been waiting a long time to eat here. Lunch was a great compromise. Only a 25 min wait at 11:15 am. We were told 45 min. Began w/Tom & mozzarella & a wonderful glass of wine from Dos Cabezas. We shared a Margarita w/ maeta olives ( pizza, of course). We were completely blown away by the sauce & crust. Loved it
