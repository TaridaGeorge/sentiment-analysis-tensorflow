Delicious breakfast , and filling! About the other review by "pepper" , I like that the orders there are large. In my opinion it is quality and quantity. Some fad places here in phoenix charge double , some triple for a meal that doesn't stand up to this restaurant. I have only been there during breakfast but I hear dinner is fantastic too. I personally love the sunny side up eggs. They seem to be the only place that makes them perfect. And the toast , its just irresistible to me.
