I tried Torched Goodness yesterday, at Techiepalooza at Skysong, in Scottsdale. I bought the vanilla and the sea salt caramel.

The good: Eric was polite, the portion size was reasonable and the price was affordable.

The really good: The creme brulee was delicious. The top was caramelized and crunchy, the custard had a lovely texture and an equally lovely flavor.

I hope to track down the truck around Thanksgiving, and try the pumpkin flavor. If it's anything as good as the vanilla, I'm in for a treat.
