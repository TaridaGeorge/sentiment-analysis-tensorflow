Me and the Ladies (as our tab was named) were spoiled rotten by our bartender Jonathan! Seriously the service on Saturday was unbelievable. We were there for about 5 hours I believe and we had a grand ole time. I mean it was $2.00 wine by the glass day (as it was the 5th of the Month) and the bruschetta boards were as yummy as always.  Thank you so much 5th and Wine and an extra special thank you to Jonathan for putting up with us for 5 hours! You and the team ROCK!
