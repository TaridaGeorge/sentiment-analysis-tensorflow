This place is Great!  I took my family there Sunday morning to watch some football and eat breakfast/lunch.  The atomsphere was good and the food was awesom. I know it is an Italian place but I had an omelette with green pepers onion ham and cheddar.  It was unbelieveable and I am guessing it had at least 4 eggs. Kid friendly for football as well.  I would go there again and probaly will on Sudnay!
