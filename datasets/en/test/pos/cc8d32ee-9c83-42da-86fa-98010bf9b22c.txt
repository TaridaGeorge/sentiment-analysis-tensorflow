Excellent! I got the 10oz. filet and it was cooked perfectly at medium rare. The rib eye was also very good. My dad got the crab bisque and he said that it was excellent. Someone else got the Chilean Sea Bass...which they said was VERY good. The jalapeno au gratin potatoes are fantastic. The corn was also a very good side too. The appetizers were also good. A few in our party got the oysters and they were very good. As for desserts, my wife got the creme brulee and she said it was the best she has had. We also ordered the peanut butter/chocolate pie which was excellent. The food is on par with Mastro's and Ruths Chris. Overall, the service was excellent.
