Five stars because it's a place were comfort food meets a classy and friendly atmosphere, meets a perfect and very attentive service. The duck breast was spectacular, I'd totally recommend having the duck. It took them longer than expected to bring us the starters and they came separately, and they took them off the bill. We were definitely delighted by great food and a great service.
