I've never bought a bike here, but I have bought a lot of accessories, riding gear, and had service done.  It's always been a great experience.  They are helpful when you are trying to decide on riding gear and get fitted.  Service is super-friendly and makes it clear they appreciate your business.  Prices are middle of the road, not cheap internet prices but not jacked up either.
