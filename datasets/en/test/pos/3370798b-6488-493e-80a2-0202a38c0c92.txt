To all the gals working in their stores in this foothill treasure island, you are awesome; )
 
Walking into this little stand alone furniture and collectibles mall is like walking into the attic with antique goodies. Every corner, every turn, there was stunning furniture, clothing, old toys, jewelry cases, you name it, stacked with fun all around. It's holiday shopping time.

I'm looking for a girls bed and I believe I found a really cool one, headboard, foot board and rails circa 50's. French provincial style with a beautiful hand painted motif on the headboard that is very feminine without being trite. I saw a beautiful wood and brass large mirror. And a wonderful chess set.

Thank you Nanci, love your store.
