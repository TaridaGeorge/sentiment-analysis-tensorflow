Metta is amazing.

I've been to a few other yoga studios in the area, and nothing compares to Metta. The teachers are amazing, and Zuzana - the owner - is just great. She remembers names and really cares about the little community she's built.

Pretty much, I will never go to another yoga studio for a good flow class unless I move out of Phoenix.
