For community meetings, they are welcoming and happy to help. For brainstorming, the place is full of genius. There is always a wide array of activities to attend and they stay true to their focus of building community.

Designers, writers, programmers, scientists, musicians, parents, children, entrepreneurs and so on... this place is for anybody who has a heart for connection and learning. I have met so many amazing people here; Gangplank has given me access to people, activities and opportunities I never knew existed. This place is my home away from home.
