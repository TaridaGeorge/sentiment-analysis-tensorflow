I love Desert Roots CSA service .  CSA stands for "Community Supported Agriculture" meaing you are directly supporting a local farmer and in turn get the freshest, most delicious, seasonal fruits and vegetables you can find. Desert Roots offers a full share, which feeds a family. I have a 1/2 share, which is perfect for 2 people and comes out to $18 a week. 

It is so great to get veggies I'd buy from the grocery store in addition to interesting veggies I normally couldn't or wouldn't think of buying. For example who the hell has ever heard of mizuna? It's a most delicious Japanese lettuce that makes you want to slap your mother it's so good. 

If you're feeling adventurous or just want to eat locally give Desert Roots a try!
