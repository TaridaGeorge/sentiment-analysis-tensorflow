By far one of my favorite restaurants in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  Ever since I've moved here for school, I've always come here with my fiance, friends, or out of town guests.  The food never disappoints.  MUST try their tuna tartare in "taco" shells.  It is DELICIOUS OMG.  They make an awesome red sangria.  Their ahi tuna steak and sea bass are DELICIOUS!  Also, I've tried their featured specials from time to time and they are always yummy.  Overall, great restaurant.  On the weekends, they have a live DJ so it really makes it a great dining experience and they have a nice open air atmosphere with tables on the terrace facing the canal.  Service is always great here.  MUST EAT HERE!!!
