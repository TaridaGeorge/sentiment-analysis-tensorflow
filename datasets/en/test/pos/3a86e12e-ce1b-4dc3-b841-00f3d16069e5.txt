Countless pasties later and I'm back for an update.

The patio had some issues so the owners (who are awesome) tore out the glass top long tables outside and added huge (seats 6+) booths with flower pots on top with cushion seats and backs.

They've added more "dessert" pasties, plus more side dishes and salads.

Sunday's now feature breakfast pasties, a bloody mary bar and mimosas.

They are doing a lot more with this location than with the original Tempe shop, which I assume is because of the added space. Whatever the reason, they are doing it right.

If you want to get the expanded Cornish Pasty Co experience, take a few extra minutes and hit the Mesa location. It WILL be worth your time.
