I'd stopped in and purchased a couple of watch bands, and happened to be meeting my wife next door today, so I stopped in for a band adjustment on a new watch that she'd given me.

I arrived a few minutes after 5:30 (when he closes), but despite this, he reopened the shop, and adjusted the band for me.

Best part?  Since I'd stopped in before, Eddie wouldn't even accept payment for this.
