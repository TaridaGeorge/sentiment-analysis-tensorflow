As my girlfriend explained to me on one of our several trips to this place, it is common in Japan for restaurants to server typical japanese food and the cuisine of another country.

Hence the Italian, and Japanese, cuisine.

Next time I go, I am going to order some italian, just to see if it is as good as everything else I have ordered there.

If you are going on a theme date, pair lunch here with the Japanese Friendship Garden.

A great alternative to Oregano's, since they are almost always slammed and have no parking!
