Dear The Roosevelt,

My friend and I, in town from Boston, came in to enjoy a delicious beer on the night of First Friday.  We thought this would be a big mistake.  Thank you for proving us wrong.  And thank you for proving that you are by far the superior beer drinking and food eating establishment in the downtown area.

We took it upon ourselves to steal some seats at the bar.  Despite the crowd we were given above and beyond attention by your staff, the lovely ladies behind the bar.  The beer flowed continuously and the food was quick and delectable! (Who knew you could do that to a hot dog?!)

Thanks for keeping such an impressive roster of beers on tap! 

See you soon!
