This is one the favorite restaurant in Arizona.  If you like hot noodle soup, this is THE place.  You get to choose from a variety of soup base, then you get to pick 2 main ingredients ($2 for the 3rd ingredient and so forth) and there are 6-8 different kinda noodles you get to choose from!  My daughter loves its Chiu Chow soup base and me is fish soup base.  Expect a big bowl of noodles filled w/mushrooms, tofu skin, naper, and cilantro.  YUM and healthy!  NO MSG and not salty soup base.  Average cost for our family of 3 is about $25-30.  :)
