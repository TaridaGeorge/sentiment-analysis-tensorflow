Yogurt Kingdom is located right next to the Barro's on Signal Butte, making this a good stop for both yummy pizza and frozen yogurt. We have been here quite a few times since it opened.

It is entirely self-serve and how much you pay is based on how much your yogurt plus toppings weighs at the register. They have several flavors of frozen yogurt, some of them fat/sugar free, and lots of toppings, including fresh soft mochi candy.

The mural is really fun to look at, and the owner is definitely a character. Love it here :)
