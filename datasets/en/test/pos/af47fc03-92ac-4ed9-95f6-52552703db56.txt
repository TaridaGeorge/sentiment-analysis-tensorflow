I've just bought a historic home here in Phoenix and have worked with numerous contractors, handymen, electricians, etc. to help renovate the home and get it looking good.  Flores AC has been hands down my best interaction with anyone for the whole home!  Miguel is thorough, prompt, polite, helpful and will answer any questions you have.  He's flexible with scheduling, even when I needed him to work around my schedule as I moved into the home.  My new AC and vents are fabulous and he did everything for a very reasonable price, something important to those of us who are on a budget.  I would highly recommend Miguel to anyone; I'm not exaggerating when I say that it has been a pleasure doing business with him.
