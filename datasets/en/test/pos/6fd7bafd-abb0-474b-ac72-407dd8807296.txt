i moved to the bay area over a year ago and still can't find anything that compares to XB!  i miss this place...

pros:
- OPEN 24 HOURS ON THE WEEKENDS. amazing.
- lots of seating, for individuals and groups (indoor and outdoor)
- chill atmosphere that welcomes anyone (mostly young crowd but no one is out-of-place here, non-elitist. 
- good drinks of course
- local music performed on friday nights
- drive-thru
- free wifi

cons:
- it's always a little chilly (must come prepared with jacket!)

it's a great place to do anything. there's usually a little bit of everything going on here: students working, businessmen working, groups playing cards or games, some just "socializing".

great place. good times.
