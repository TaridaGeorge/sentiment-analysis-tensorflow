This is by far my favorite pizza I have had in Arizona. The big chunks of cheese and the perfectly sized and seasoned pepperoni have such an amazing flavor on the thin crust pizza. We get the large pizza and have plenty to eat for lunch the next day. The menu is reasonably priced.  I went overseas for a month and this was the first place I ate when I returned home.  The staff is always warm and welcoming. They usually have a sports game on the tv's which is a bonus for my husband. If you sign up for their email club, they send you a certificate for a free large cheese pizza for your birthday!
