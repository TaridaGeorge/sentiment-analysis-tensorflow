Durant's Ohhhhh how I love thee, from your meat puppets to your prime rib. I can always count on your cooked to perfection food, stellar service, and stiff drinks. If only more were as great as you. I would have to say that DURANTS is the one restaurant that any visitor NEEDS to eat at to experience Phoenix. 
Putting my love and affection aside, please check your slider buns before service mine were a bit stiff tonight, not bad just not up to the level of amazingness I'm accustomed to.
