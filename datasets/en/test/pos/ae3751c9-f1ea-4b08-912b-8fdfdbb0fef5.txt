This place is just wonderful!!  I'm not even much of a sandwich fan, but this Jimmy John's changed my perspective.  I wasn't sure what to order, but Erika was so helpful!!  She recommended one of her favorites, and I must say she has great judgement.  Great food, amazing customer service, and a great atmosphere.  Now I crave sandwiches from there. Thank you, Jimmy John's!  :)
