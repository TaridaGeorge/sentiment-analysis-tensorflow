I've been here several times now and have loved everything I've tried. The pulled pork sandwich, the tempura friend string beans, the hummus sampler, grilled chicken and goat salad, the burger, the sweet potato toters, the wine- it's all been good. 
The wait staff are very friendly and nice too. 
Can't go wrong by coming here!
