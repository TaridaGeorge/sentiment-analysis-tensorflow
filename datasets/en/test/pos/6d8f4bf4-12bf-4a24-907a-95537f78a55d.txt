The staff at Skin Gravy is fantastic. I cannot put in words how pleased I am with the service provided. They were extremely knowledgeable and answered all my questions and concerns in a very professional manner. They are more passionate about changing the lives of their clientele than cycling people in and out to make a quick buck.  I will continue to go to them for any of my personal needs that align with their scope of work.  Side note: I can certainly relate to and understand their recent struggle with scheduling but it is in no way a reason to provide a negative review. They recently relocated to a larger location to provide more services to their clients. They are growing their business into a more end to end service provider which says something about the quality of their work in this down economy.
