Char's is a hidden Phoenix gem.  It is a very small bar that hosts some pretty awesome bands.  Of course my FAVORITE band is Soul Power.  Friday nights are packed.  The one wish I had is that they wouldn't over pack the place.  So what can expect from this neighborhood bar?  The good:  Great music, reasonable drinks that are not weak by any means, a very diverse crowd, the urge to dance the night away, only a $6.00 cover and reasonably priced drinks.  The bad:  Dance floor is very small, they do not serve food, if you don't like crowds or tight places this venue is not for you, the VIP section is a shabby one.
