I attended a Yelp Elite event here and I was completely wowed by the seafood.  Having lived and spent time in various places on the water I have diminished expectations for seafood now that I live in the desert.  

Fear not!

I will be back here on the oysters alone!  Much less the jumbo shrimp, fresh tuna and crab cakes.  

The last time I was this impressed with crab cakes I could smell the Atlantic.

The last time I had such good oysters I could smell the Pacific.
