Oh Rhythm Room, how I adore thee!

I have seen some of the greatest Blues legends play here and have never been disappointed.   Whenever The Rhythm Room All-stars play, I definitely try to make it.  They are rockin'.  

I dig the dancing, the bbq (mmmmmm)  and I enjoy when the f*ck the police guy is roller skating on the dance floor!

I do recommend getting there early if you want a table and a chair.  For bands I really want to see I get there before they open, get in line, get a table, then someone in my party goes to grab us some bbq and we start drinking and eating and waiting for the music to start!  

I always have a great time here!  And now that you can't smoke it's even better!
