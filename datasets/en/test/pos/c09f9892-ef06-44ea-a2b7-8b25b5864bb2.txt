This place is definitely a diamond in the rough.  For me and my friends (who have mostly all grown up in PHX), this place is our standard, staple, our Cheers, if you will.  Four Peaks feels like home.  The beer holds its own against any domestic microbrews.  Their constants are worth coming for (such as the acclaimed Hop Knot and Oatmeal stout), but the seasonal really generate the real anticipating locals; the coveted Pumpkin Porters will get tables fighting over the last growler of the season.  Every time I have traveled abroad, this is my first stop upon my return.  No other place in PHX can you get such world class beers for so cheap, superb food to rival any pub (served till 1:00 am daily), and a crowd that makes you feel like family.
