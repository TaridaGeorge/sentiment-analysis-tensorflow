I love leaving a store thinking, they're soooo nice in there.  Today I had to go in because my heart rate monitor from there wasn't working well.  I had gotten it for Christmas.  The guy said, we don't have that one anymore, but I can exchange it for the one we have (which is better and has many more features).  It only took five minutes and I was on my way with one signature.....I love good customer service.  They're having a huge sale by the way until August 28...everything was really discounted.  I want to go back when I have time to shop.
