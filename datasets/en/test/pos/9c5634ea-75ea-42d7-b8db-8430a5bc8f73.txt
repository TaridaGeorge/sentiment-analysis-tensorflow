I have since gone back 3 times for the green curry.  I'm pretty sure it's laced with cocaine to keep me coming back for more.  The spice is perfect (if you love the burn) and the staff is more than friendly.  

From the outside you wouldn't think to even walk in as it's pretty close to the ghetto, but upon stepping in, you will be saying, you are not in Kansas anymore.

It's a very pretty restaurant on the inside.  The wooden screens on the wall are gorgeous and the tables are wood with runners down the center to create a very peaceful and relaxing atmosphere.  

Siam Thai has become my favorite Thai restaurant hands down.  I cannot wait to take my friends and family here!
