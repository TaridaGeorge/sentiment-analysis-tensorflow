I don't know where they get the pickles that go in the beef Gyro's but I cannot get enough.  So yummy, I always ask for more.

This place takes me out of the desert and puts me in a much more hip city.

I absolutely love the Tsatziki, full of garlic that you are protected from vampires but cannot kiss another human being until you do a thorough mouth clean up.  Still worth it.  Bad for first date.

Go here.  Eat here.  Your will be pleased.  If not, there might be something wrong with YOU!
