If your dog needs space and you like to walk or do laps with your fuzzy buddy, THIS IS THE PLACE.  It's a nice large basin with trees, lighting and a timid dog area.  You can find pretty much the same group of people every evening or morning.  Friendly too.
The only bad part is the only water is located by the door, so if your walking on the other side of the park, you should bring a cooler.
This park is great for runners and dogs that love to play fetch.
It's closed every thursday.
