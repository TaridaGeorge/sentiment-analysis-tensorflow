I'm kind of worried about Zulu Caffe. It's such a lovely little restaurant with an truly entertaining view. The food is really well prepared and pleasantly served. I had the BLT which was brimming with well cooked bacon, a nice piece of cheese, fresh greens and a tasty basil mayonnaise. The sweet potato fries were freshly prepared and very hot. My companion' turkey panini was thick and the cranberry mayonnaise was very good. Our server was attentive without being intrusive. My concerns stems from the fact that we were the only patrons for the majority of the lunch hour. One other couple came in as we were leaving. Such a shame. It's fun to watch the planes take off and the restaurant is very pretty.  I hope that it can hang in there because it is a great place for lunch.
