Awesome hike. I've done it a couple times and loved it each time. Bring lots of water and wear good hiking shoes with good grip. There are loose, little rocks on some parts and I've managed to slip and slide, but luckily catch my fall, at least once each visit. The BF saw someone fall and busted his head on a recent hike so just be careful!
