This place is one of our favorites!  I would call it cheap Mexican/Asian fusion food.  Portions are huge.  As if they do not give you enough food, they also include a cookie along with the meal.  After finishing, I usually have left overs for a meal or two.  To date, I have yet to try anything I haven't liked here.

The biggest downside is the wait.  Come before you are actually hungry because it always takes a while for you food to come out.
