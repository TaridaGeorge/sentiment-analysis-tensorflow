After reading the reviews here I had to chime in.  WHAT ABOUT THE BEERS?  OMG soooo many imported brews on tap served in the appropriate glassware?  This is awesome!!!  Not to mention that everything on the menu here comes out to less money than the god awful Fudrucker's that so many cardboard people in Phoenix adore.  I wont even go into my dreaded $13 lunch experience there.  EW!

An amazing burger for 9 bucks.  A shared basket of fries for 5.  10 or 12 beers at 4.75 each?  This is a dream come true.  If you don't look out the window you can even forget you are in a parking lot.

This place is even open late so after a night of bar hopping and parking lot traversing you can still pop in here and get a burger and beer in appealing surroundings.  LOVE IT!
