Chris at Stellar did a great job.  Responsive, reasonable, ontime, and thorough.  Found him on Yelp via these reviews.  We needed a door spring replaced.  While he was here, he recommened replacing the 15-year old rollers on our door with nylon, which we did.  The whole door runs smoothly and so very quiet!  Give him a call.
