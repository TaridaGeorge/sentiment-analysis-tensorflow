Nello's pizza is awesome! The staff has always been efficient and very nice. I'm not sure why the recent bad reviews, but hopefully Nello's will look at those and fix whatever can be fixed. People have very different ideas of good pizza so hopefully a few bad opinions won't sway others from trying it out. Keep up the good work Nello's!
