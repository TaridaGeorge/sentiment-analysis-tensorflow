Queen Creek living is the Life...I have lived in the Valley for most of my 35 years and this is the best place I have been, West side, East Side and South Side...it's got that small town feel, you know your neighbors and the scenery is still somewhat rural...

The worst part = school choices are limited for the discerning parent, but schlep into Chandler for private school and enjoy the quiet life in the "country" the rest of the time.
