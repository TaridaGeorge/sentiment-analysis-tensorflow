My favorite restaurant of any kind in Phoenix. Cochinita pibil in platter and sandwich form is very memorable. Chiles en nogada too. Amazing guacamole, delicious tapenade for your bread, but be sure to save room. The posole verde soup is another home run. Honestly, I read the negative reviews of this place and could not understand how this was possible. Innovative, satisfying, absolutely top notch cooking and service. The criticisms of others strike me as bizarre. If you like fine dining and you like Mexican, Barrio is an incredible find.
