I'm so glad I found this place through Yelp.  I brought in the ugliest bridesmaids dress I've ever been forced to wear (and I have been an attendant in over 20 weddings). She was able to turn a hot pink, empire waist, asymmetrical, billowing Grecian gown into a garment that fits well and flatters my frame. The dress is still hideous, but I look great. The dress was done within two weeks despite all the alterations necessary (taking in 2" off each side, taking in bodice, hemming, shortening strap, etc.).
