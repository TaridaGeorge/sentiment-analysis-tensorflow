We grabbed dinner at the Streets of New York this evening, what a great meal.  I had the cheese ravioli with pesto sauce and my husband had the spaghetti and meatballs.  Fabulous!  We started with artichoke and spinach dip with flatbread appetizer and the bread sticks and marinera sauce, num.   Our server was so sweet and helpful--what a nice way to end a good day.
