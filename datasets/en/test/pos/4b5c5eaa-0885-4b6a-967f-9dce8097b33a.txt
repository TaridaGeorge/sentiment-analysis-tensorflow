A friend told us about good South Indian food at Woodlands and she was right. It's a fast food place so if you are looking for a fancy restaurant this is not it. But if you are looking for good food, efficient and polite service in a family setting, you've found it.

We ordered South Indian Thalli. It was great. The rasam was "to die for".

Definitely recommended and we're definitely going back to try the rest of the menu!
