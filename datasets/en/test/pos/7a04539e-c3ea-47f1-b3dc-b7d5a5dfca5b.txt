I still crave the Jalapeno Pecan Pancakes and the Mushroom Gruyere omelet  they are both delicious.  I found this place while in Scottsdale on business and ate there 3 times in 4 days.  As someone said before the staff is a tad unpredictable but who cares when you have food that is better than any you've had before? Not me :)
