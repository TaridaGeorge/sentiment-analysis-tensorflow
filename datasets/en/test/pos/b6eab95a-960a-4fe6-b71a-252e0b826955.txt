Doug Lakin is one of the best doctors I've ever encountered -- as his 9 consecutive "Best of Phoenix" awards will attest.  He is warm, personable, and knows his stuff.  You never get the feeling that he is rushing you or disregarding your concerns.

The office itself is standard fare - a lobby full of elderly patients and a semi-unfriendly staff who will keep you waiting for 30-60 minutes without communicating a thing.

They also take very few types of insurance and I have always had to pay out of pocket.

Nevertheless, I will go to see "Dr. Doug" as long as I live in the Phoenix area because I trust him to give me top-of-the-line medical care.
