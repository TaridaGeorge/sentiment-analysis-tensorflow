Best authentic made when you order Scandinavian food ever! Forget ikea! Lol. This is fresh -  delicious - great service and super friendly owners and family! I will bring all my friends and family here for years to come without hesitation! 

This place does not cut corners. They make the food only once it has been ordered. This is a truly a great place and I never write reviews since finding amazing places is rare for me. This place makes it worth sharing! Go try it! 5 stars!
