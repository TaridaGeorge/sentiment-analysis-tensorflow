I love this store! Today was my first time going there and I spent an hour just walking around to see what they had. I love the bulk foods section. They even had these dried apple chips that I have been searching for at so many grocery stores across the Valley. It is a 30min drive from my house but I will gladly make it to shop there. Can't wait to take my husband.
