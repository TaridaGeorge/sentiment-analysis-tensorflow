Great place to meet with friends :)
Good ambiance, staff is always friendly, you hardly ever have to wait too long even when it's crowded & the food is much better than most chain restaurants. 

I highly recommend the avocado egg rolls appetizer (enough for 2 people to share) & the BBQ chopped salad (it's a huge mound!! I normally eat half & take 1/2 home).
