We ate here before the Cardinals vs. Eagles Game on September 23, 2012. I had truffle fries and deviled eggs both items were scrumptious! We had a terrific server. I am not a drinker but they offer a huge selection of draft beers, I did enjoy two St. Pauli Girl NA beers. Get there early on game days, we arrived at 10:30AM and the place was getting busy! P.S. the Cardinals won.
