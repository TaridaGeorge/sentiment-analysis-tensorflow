We checked this place out because we had a groupon. You can also get discounted certificates for Fuego Bistro on restaurant.com, and they occasionally do offers through LunchClub.

This place has an extensive drinks menu. We got mixed drinks and loved them. I think mine was a flavored mojito, and his was something tropical. The Seared Ahi Tuna Mini Tostadas were OK, but the Angus GriIIed New York Strip Steak was an absolute showstopper. 

As others have said, this place is hard to find. Look for Apollo's on the east side of 7th Street (giant lambda sign) and park in the lot just east of them.
