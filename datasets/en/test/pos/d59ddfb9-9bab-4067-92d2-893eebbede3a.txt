My 2 boys and I have been going to Phil for the past 6 years... As a matter of fact, my 5 year old will not let anyone else touch his hair except for Phil. Phil gives great haircuts and is one of the nicest guys you will ever meet. His shop is very comfortable and reminds me of where I went as a kid in Brooklyn to get my haircuts. I would highly recommend Pavilions Barber Shop to anyone looking for a great haircut and a great environment.
