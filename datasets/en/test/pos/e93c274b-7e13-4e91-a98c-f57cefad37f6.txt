We went to bonfire last night and it was amazing!! The service was fantastic. The drinks were delicious and creative. The food was flavorful, cooked to perfection, and had wonderful presentation. Damien, the bartender, was friendly and helpful. The chef learned it was our first time and came out to speak with us and cooked food for us to try that we did not even order. The atmosphere was comfortable and fun. Drinks and food were well priced. We will definitely be back!!
