All I can say is WOW!!! My Mom and I started going here about a month ago. We are treated like queens!! I agree with Valorie...this is hands down the BEST nail salon EVER!!! They remember us every time we come in whether it's for a fill or a luxurious pedicure! The employees are so very caring and the environment is so relaxing!!
Mom and I are looking forward to our next visit! Michelle and Hai are the most courteous people I have ever met!
You will not regret making this your spa!!
