this establishment is very modern.  almost too modern for my taste BUT the food was damn good!

it seems like whenever we go it's hard to find parking and there is a 30-60 minute wait.  the service is always good and professional.

we always go for any burger and the sweet potato fries.  we also order desserts too.  our bill for 2 adults is usually around $40.  it's too bad that other folks have had bad experiences regarding quality of food and service.

dang it, now i got sweet potato fries on my mind!!!!
