I stopped in this location to redeem a coupon for some free Hemp Hand cream and this store is so vibrant and welcoming, plus they were burning the aromatic oils so the clean fresh smells of citrus beckoned me to linger and look around. This store is doing it right; the sales person was very nice and friendly even though I did not buy and was just there to get my gift. I will return here in the future when I need to stock up on body butter or more hand cream.
