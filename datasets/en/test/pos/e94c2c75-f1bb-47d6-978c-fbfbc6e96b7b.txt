Il Bosco is an excellent little restaurant and pizzeria.   warm, fun decor.  the food is fantastic.   the food on the menu is fresh and creative.  the owner, Bill Forrest, has a very personal touch and oversees it all quite well.  it is a hidden gem in Scottsdale but once you know where it is you will go back again and again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
