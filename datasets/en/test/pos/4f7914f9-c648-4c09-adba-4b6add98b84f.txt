The best thing about Life Power Yoga is they happen to be lucky enough to have the best Ashtanga Yoga teacher, John Salisbury. In my humble opinion, he is the best yoga teacher in the world. Originally from Laguna Beach, California, I often would ask the Universe "why am I in Arizona?" After meeting John Salisbury, it is very clear to me and I will never leave. If John Salisbury were to go to another planet, I would  pack my bags and follow. Trust me, he is the best.
