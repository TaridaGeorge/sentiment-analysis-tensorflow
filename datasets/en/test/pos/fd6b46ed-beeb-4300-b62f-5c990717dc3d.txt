Always have the best service and recommendations! It's easily accessible and has a great selection of always rotating beer and wine. I recommend trying a wine flight or beer flight and talking to the bartender to cater to your taste specifically! It's a perk that you can order food from Thai Basil or Tessio's and have it delivered to Taste of Tops.
