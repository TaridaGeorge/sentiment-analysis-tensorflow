Brought them a Vette i crashed pretty bad. They fixed it perfectly. You'd never even know. They worked with me on some custom touches I wanted while they were working on it too. Price was less than I expected for a pretty major job. I'd recommend Fast for sure.

***update*** My girl dinged my door and I took my car back. They got me in and out really quick and gave me a great deal.
