This is about as good as it gets for brunch food.  As self-proclaimed foodies and avid brunch eaters, my siblings and sister-in-law tried out this place when we were visiting Phoenix.  I was highly impressed with the menu options, and the spread we ordered was no disappointment.  We shared all our entrees, so I can comfortably say favorites included:

Salmon, asparagus, capers
Chilaquiles (!!!)
Waffles
Banana french toast brioche

They were all amazing.  The decor is cute and welcoming (I especially am a fan of the bright yellow walls), and the service was excellent.  I loved the outdoor sitting area, although it was a tad too hot in July to enjoy it.

Great brunch spot!
