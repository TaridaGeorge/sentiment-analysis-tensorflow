GREAT DOSA! They have really good south indian food, just a heads up... it is all VEGETARIAN, no meat. Yes, I see people complaining about the decor, service etc. but who cares about all that as long as you get to eat good food, and the owner is an awesome guy, strike a conversation next time you go.
