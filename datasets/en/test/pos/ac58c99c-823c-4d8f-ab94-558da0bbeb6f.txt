I needed to shave the bottoms off some doors after installing new flooring, and I found Duane "Diamond D" on this cool website called Yelp.com. I gave him a call and he came out the next afternoon - he sawed the doors, did a few other things around the house, was very pleasant to speak with, and the price tag came in less than I would have expected. 

Highly recommended.
