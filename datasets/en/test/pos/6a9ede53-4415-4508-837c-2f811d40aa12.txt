Probably my favorite restaurant in Arcadia - I find myself there at least once a week.  In short, the food is fresh, healthy and affordable.  The staff is friendly and knowledgable.  Their happy hour may be one of the best-kept secrets in town - specials on beer/wine and a large selection of delicious tapas - all from $1 to $3.

If I had to find a flaw I'd say the cavernous ceilings can make it a bit loud during peak times.  If you go with a date that's a soft talker, prepare to do some lip reading.
