I love this place!!!
This is a hidden gem inside an Asian market place. One of the things that surprised me was their workers spoke English very well (in my experience, this isn't common). The service I received from this place was Super Excellent. The food and the service makes me want to come back.
The best thing I ate from this place is their Fried Pork with Seasoned Salt and Jalapeno (perfectly cooked and so tasty!)...broccoli with garlic sauce (you just can't go wrong with this mix)...and I had their combination of roasted duck, pork, and BBQ pork (I thought this was just okay). 
I would definitely recommend this place and will come back again!
