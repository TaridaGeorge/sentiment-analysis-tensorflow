Hands down best sushi/sashimi I've had in valley.. I know there are several other good sushi places in the Valley but they are too far of a drive for me to go. Its not cheap but its not extravagant. BYOB. Japanese-run. They also close for holidays and holiday weekends..so check before going. You will leave smelling like Tempura.
