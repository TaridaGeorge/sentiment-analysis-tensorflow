This new bar spot was just opened by the owners of the next-door Breadfruit restaurant (Jamaican food).  Same as their restaurant, everything here is amazing quality.

They also punched a walkway into the wall between the two places, so you can order Breadfruit food over in the RumBar as well.

Verdict: over 70 quality rums (working up to 108) = YES!

**NOTE: Their grand opening isn't until Jan 27th.  Until then they are still playing with hours & drink recipes, so during this time all drinks are only $6!**
