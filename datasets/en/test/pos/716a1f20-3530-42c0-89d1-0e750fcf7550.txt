This is one of my favorite restaurant/bars at this time. The bartenders are skilled and generous in their pours, and the drink specials make drinking at Ticoz affordable. My favorite is probably the Kiwi Sangria (go there on Tuesday for 1.99 Sangria night!) with the chips and salsa. I'm also a big fan of the tortilla soup. The servers are always friendly, and the atmosphere feels like a swanky city bar without being too pretentious or over the top. Go there if you want a unique twist on Latin cuisine, and take a seat at the bar. The food specials at the bar are pretty decent.
