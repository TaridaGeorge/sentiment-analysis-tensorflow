I'd been hearing about this place via Twitter, #evfn, etc... for weeks and last week @rrodrigo & I were looking for a place to work on some RSS research we were doing. We hit Gangplank during lunch time and it was dead. We had our pick of places to hang out, so we grabbed a table and got to work. There were some people working in rooms around, thinking up the next best project, and it didn't feel weird at all grabbing some chairs and collaborating. After the lunch hour a ton more people came in, and I knew many. We said our hellos and everyone got to work. This was a great experience and we'll be back soon.
