Mary was wonderful in handling my sweet boy Coco. She was also able to recommend a wonderful mobile vet to come out to my house so that I wouldn't have to take my sweet boy to a hospital where he would be scared. When Mary came out to get my Coco she did so very gently. He was handled with care. I highly recommend Fairwinds! Even though its tough losing a part of your family, Mary helps in making sure that they are handled with just as much care as when they were here with us. Thanks Mary!!
