They get top stars just for making sure we knew they weren't putting the rush on us!
So we get there kinda late on Sunday evening,no worries...
We're treated very well,staff warm and genuine.
We both opt for different types of personal pizza.
I got the cheeze...Simple,simple,but good and tasty.
I never knew this place existed and look foward to going back and tryong something else!
