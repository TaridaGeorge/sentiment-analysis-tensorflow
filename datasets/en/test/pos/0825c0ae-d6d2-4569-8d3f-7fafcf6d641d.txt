Love it! Love it! Love it!

It reminds me of home (Chicago) and I am soooooo happy to have one here in Phoenix. 

I recommend  getting an Italian beef dipped with hot and sweet peppers. And, NO, the hot peppers really aren't all that hot. The peppers, both hot and sweet, are an essential part of the sandwich. They add so much delectable flavor to an already delicious sandwich. 

Don't forget the dip. Yes, it's messy. But when it tastes this good...who really cares?
