Found this place on Yelp and got 10% off.  It was fantastic.
Had the brisket and pulled chicken.  The brisket was good, but the pulled bar-b-q chicken was out of this world.  Every meal comes with skillet cornbread that was delicious.
For sides we had the baked beans and mac & cheese.  Both were excellent.
The incredibly sweat tea (I suggest getting it half & half) was awesome.
There were plenty of wait staff on hand even though it was an unusually busy Sunday.  They were all friendly, attentive, and attractive.
