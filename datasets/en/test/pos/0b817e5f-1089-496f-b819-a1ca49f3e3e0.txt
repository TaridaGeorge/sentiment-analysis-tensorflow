Came here while visiting family in Scottsdale and our experience was superb. Everything we ordered was fantastic and the service was outstanding (I think our server's name was Clark, he was so dedicated and enthusiastic.) Clark even brought us a salad for us to try on the house which was also delightful. All six of us ordered different entrees and not one was displeased with their choice. I ordered the scallops, which were delicious, and went perfectly with the bottles of white wine. We all felt very welcome here and I certainly wouldn't mind stopping in on my next trip to Scottsdale.
