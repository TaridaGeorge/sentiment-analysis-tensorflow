Born and raised in Scottsdale and I've always defaulted to LGO or Taylor's Cafe for a good brunch spot, but Chestnut Lane has edged both of them!

I've been here for both breakfast and lunch many times and it's always so good!  The pancakes are fabulous, the salads are delicious and satisfying, and the drinks and pastries are soooo yummy.  

If you don't want anything too filling for breakfast, go for the Baked Oatmeal, it's awesome!
