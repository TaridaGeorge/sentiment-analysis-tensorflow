We've eaten Thai food all across the country and this was phenomenal. The duck breast curry was lean and flavorful.  We had a small plate of a wonderful blend of spices and coconut on mustard greens....mmm mmm...the extra lean  short ribs came on a sauce that I would love to steal the recipe and attempt recreation at home,  would love to clone this place and bring it to Chicago !
