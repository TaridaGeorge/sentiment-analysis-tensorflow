We decided to start the new year right and go on a hike January 1st. Took a refreshing mile loop and looked at the scenery, the animals, and the unfortunate graffiti over pictographs. 

The gate into the park now closes at 7 p.m., but the park closes at 11. So you can be up at the peak for a while, but you can't drive straight to it from the street after dark any more. 

The peak was CROWDED before sunset, but if you can get a space it's entirely worth it. 

There's something about Arizona sunsets. The sky is redder. The cacti silhouettes are charming. It's captivating, and South Mountain allows for this extraordinarily long look at it.
