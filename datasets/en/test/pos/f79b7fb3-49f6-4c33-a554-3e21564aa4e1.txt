There are certain items that I always buy at Trader Joe's.  My most favorite is their orange flavored chicken.  You buy it in the frozen food section.  It is low in calories and is so easy and fast to make.  I serve it over rice and I have a great dinner.  My husband loves it too.  I also love their ready made salads, especially the reduced fat Greek salad.  It is about 125 calories total, even with the dressing and it takes great.
