When my mother died, I inherited an oil painting which had been displayed in her living room for years. Since it had a great deal of sentimental value to me, I was not happy when it was almost destroyed by UPS  during shipping to my home. Despite the large hole ripped in the canvas, Tina was able to restore it beautifully. It is now impossible to see where the defect had been. Thanks so much for your amazing  talent and skill! My mother would be so pleased. Jane .
