Over the years this place has been our main-stay.  We go for one thing, the Surfer Roll.   It is the best roll we have ever had, or ever found anywhere.  The place is just solid.  Good price, good service and a lot of fun.  
Take our tip... forget sitting in the dining room.  Sit at the bar, take the recommendations of whoever is working behind the counter, and order at least one Surfer.  You won't be disappointed.
