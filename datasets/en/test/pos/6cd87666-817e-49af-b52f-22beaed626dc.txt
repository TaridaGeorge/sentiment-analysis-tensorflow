Remember on the sitcom Cheers how "...everybody knows your name, and they're always glad you came..." - well, that's how I feel when I go to this particular Buffalo Wild Wings. I'm always treated like a visiting friend who everyone is happy to see. And though I have a special order (wings cooked 8 extra minutes) it's right every time.

I take editing/critique work up there and spend an hour or so at it (gets me out of the office once in a while). MJ always keeps my glass full and the wings crispy. I get a lot done and am treated to terrific conversation. I can't say enough about this place or the people there.

If you love wings, this Buffalo Wild Wings is a must. And have them add 8 extra minutes. It's worth the wait.
