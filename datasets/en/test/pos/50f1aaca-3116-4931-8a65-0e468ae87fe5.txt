Soo, I decided to finally try this place out thats close to the house. I took a date here on a Friday night. I was a huge Fan of the place from the minute we got there. I loved the vibe of the place and the friendly staff. 

When we arrived we were told about specials and wait time....so we hit up the bar and waited for our table. Enjoy'd some good Red wine. and our host found us and took us to our table.

We order the Gumbo and the Carne Asada plates. Both were good. But the GUMBO WAS GREAT!!! would def order again....
