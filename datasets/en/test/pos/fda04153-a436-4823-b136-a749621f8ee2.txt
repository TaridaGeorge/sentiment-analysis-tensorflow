So glad I stopped in here! Was a last minute check in after I found out I was released from being on call all day! In need of a pedi bad and this place is right down the street so I went in at 5pm. 
I went for the ultimate spa pedi (decided to really treat myself!). Was not disappointed one bit!! For 49.00, got all the add ons, hot scrub, hot lotion, paraffin wax soak , a hot stone foot massage and the results= two very happy and exhilarated feet!! My tech was Kevin and he was awesome!! The place is beautiful, quiet and liked the fact that the pedi stations are in back and away from the front. Felt very relaxed and soothed!! Thank you Biagio and Kevin!!
