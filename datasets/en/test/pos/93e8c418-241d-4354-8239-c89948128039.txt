I hesitated in writing this review as I truly feel it is one of the valleys best kept secrets.  You see, inside this whole foods is an amazing bar with over 20 AMAZING beers on tap.  You will not find your average domestic swill here.  What you will find is a dazzling assortment of some of the finest beer produced.  The proverbial "icing on the cake" is James.  James knows more about beer than the monks that perfected it.  He is always quick with a thoughtful suggestion and willing to share his knowledge.  You wine drinkers will find more than enough to keep you happy as well.
