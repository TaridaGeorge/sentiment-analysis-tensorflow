My husband and I went here, after a recommendation, for our Anniversary.  I called in advance for a reservation (don't think it is required) and when I called they asked if it was a special occasion. I told her it was our Anniversary.

We arrived 30 minutes early and they seated us early (only waited 5 minutes).  When we got to our table there was an Anniversary card signed by all the staff and a rose on our table.  Sweet!

The waitress was very nice.  We ordered the Beef Ribs (which was amazing, falling off the bone) and the Salmon (so good).

We received a complementary dessert since our Anniversary.  The Huckleberry Cheesecake...MMM!!!

I highly recommend this place for a date!  Romantic and Intimate!
