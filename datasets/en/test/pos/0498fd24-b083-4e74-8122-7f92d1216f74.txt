I love this place, my family has been going here for over 15 years. It's a staple on our list of options when we're looking to dine out. 

The place is always very clean, the service is friendly and the food is delicious. The peking duck and the mongolion beef are amazing. 

Jenny, the owner, treats her regular customers like they are family.
