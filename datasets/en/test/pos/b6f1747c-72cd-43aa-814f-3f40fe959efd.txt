Probably the best pizza I've ever eaten! And I'm from NY :-) I've been in the west for 3 years now and haven't been able to find a good NY pizza. We ordered 1 personal pizza and that's good for a couple. Girl eats 2 slices and guy eats 4. Everyone is satisfied :-). Seems like there's like 4 manager for such a small place but they stay busy so it's good. I'll be back for sure.
