One of my favorite lunch spots has always been Churchill's. A quick pint of Tetley's and some fish and chips is just what the doctor ordered sometimes.  Have never had a bad fish and chips here, beer always ice cold from the tap, only down side being lunch lasts an hour.  I will try and go back during the night hours to watch some rugby and try something else off the menu.
