The food was great, went with me and my girl, and was blown away by the atmosphere, and style of the place. It's not over the top but it's not a hole in the wall, great place to take a first date and enjoy great food and a good environment , Alfredo Pizza was delicious, I highly recommend it to any pizza lover
