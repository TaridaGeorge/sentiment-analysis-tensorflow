Okay I finally ate on site. Service was beyond fast..every table that sat near us including ourselves.. exclaimed "wow that was fast" when the food came. Im talking not even a 15 minute wait. I had the grilled chicken pita and it was delicious...pita was fluffy and doughy and chicken as grilled to perfection. Greek Fries are a must have.. you will eat them first before you even get to your pita they're that good. Its delicious, fast, inexpensive, you cant beat it.
