How can I not give them 5 stars? How? I ask you how people? I mean, these people MAKE candy. Blocks from my house. Lots of parking. Clean. Clean. Clean. You could make smores on their floor. Wow, that even rhymes. I'm thinking bumper sticker here people. Create your own box. With the nicest of nice ladies to help you. I mean really, they have to be amped up on sugar. What else is their to nibble on? Great service. Great candy. Great location. But where was the See's Candy professional to slap that 14th piece of candy out of my hand last night as I slipped into my my milk chocolate coma on my 600 thread count sheets, nearly drowning in my 1/2 inch pool of drool? I don't care. Five stars. Five stars I say!
