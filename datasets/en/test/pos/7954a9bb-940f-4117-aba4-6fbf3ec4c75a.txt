...for Arizona, this is as good as it gets when it comes to fine art.

Unfortunately a large portion of the museum is dedicated to an era of art that is currently distasteful: desert landscapes depicting early statehood.

Fortunately, since it has taken over the old library there is space for modern and rotating exhibits that will inspire young artists. (Example: the exhibit called "being obliterated by a thousand fireflies" will be a great experience for a child of any age).
