Man, I wish I could come here every week! 

Came in for my birthday breakfast and got the Musketeer omelette - very good and perfectly cooked with a side of pan-fried sliced potatoes. The coffee was amazing for being plain ol' coffee (it had a brand on the menu but I forgot [again] to write it down). 

Right now, they have a bunch of seasonal pumpkin dishes on offer. We tried the pumpkin bread pudding and it was AWESOME. I want to come in soon and try the pumpkin cheesecake pancakes.
