Great service, good food. I don't get to eat here as often as I would like, but I consider it a treat when I do. Not the cleanest place in the world, but i'm not a germ freak like a lot of people so it doesn't bother me. I always get the Jerk Chicken, just the right amount of spice and "kick" to it. I have tasted some of the other items on the menu and all have tasted good. Chino Bandido is one of those places that I go too when I have guest from out of town. It's great in the fact that it's unique. The service has been great every time I have been here. If your from somewhere other than the phoenix area ask for help from the employees and try the samples.
