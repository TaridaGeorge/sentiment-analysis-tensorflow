Mr Goodcents.  Yum.  This place is located very close to me.  I used to visit the one on Broadway, but this location is much better. Very clean, friendly atmosphere, fast, good food.  The $5 footlongs can't be beat. They even have "club" cards so you can get a free sandwich after so many purchases.  I've never had a bad experience here, either with the service or the food.  If you're looking for something good and fast and don't want to settle for the typical fast food fare, give this place a try. 

Oh and they do have pasta, but I've never tried it. The subs are too good!
