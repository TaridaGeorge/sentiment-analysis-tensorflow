Good Times! I was sooooo excited to be here and watch my team play! It felt like I was home! Of course the weather here was waaaaaaaaaay hotter than the city (duh)! Everybody was nice, venders, bartenders, police officers (lol)...They were walking around from breathalyzers, yikes. Did I really want to know my alcohol levels, nah!! Maybe next time... lol

Great location! You are in walking distance of many bars, restaurants, shops etc..

See ya next year!!!
