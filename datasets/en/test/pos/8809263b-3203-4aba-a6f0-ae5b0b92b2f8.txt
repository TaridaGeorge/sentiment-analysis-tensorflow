Gelato love!

I have traveled near and far, high and low and this is the best gelato I've tasted in the US!  It comes the closest to the gelato made in Italy.  It's creamy with rich flavors and my mouth feels like it's in heaven every time I eat it.  I have visited a few different locations around town and they are always consistently delicious.

The staff is nice and the atmosphere is comfortable and inviting.  The Old Town location has a few comfortable lounging chairs with armrests and free wifi.  This is the perfect place to take a break and to get away from the AZ heat.

Definitely check it out.  You'll be addicted, I am!
