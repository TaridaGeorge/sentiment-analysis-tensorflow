i love this place. i had a "dirty" chai tea latte... yum! and i am not a big chai fan too. why did i order it? i dunno. 

had the fig/proscuitto sandwich aka the OMG ... which is exactly what it was. the proscuitto is cured in garlic? and the combo of figs and i believe mascarpone... mind blowing. HUUUUGE fan! and their hours are quite impressive, considering phx businesses propensity for closing when the sun goes down.

the only downside... i now live in Tempe. but still worth the drive!
