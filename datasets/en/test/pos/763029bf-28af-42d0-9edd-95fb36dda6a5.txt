I have been going here for years. The owner has expanded the menu over the years to include korean, thai etc. They have one of the better menus with a larger variety and the quality of the food is good. you an either order in and eat there or you can take it home. 
favorite dish is Spring Rolls and Orange Chicken ( spicy) 
Owner is always very nice and knows many of his regulars by name.
