This is likely the finest grocery store in the valley. The selection is limited, but only because they have limited their inventory to the finest products made.

I love their half-prepared meals in the deli section. 

The wine is unbelievable, I have to ask for help whenever I venture down this isle (they have a wine guy waiting to help you make a selection).

Love the full service gas station next door too.
