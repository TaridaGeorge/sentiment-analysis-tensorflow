I've been going to THIS restaurant for  almost 7 years and have always left satisfied!... The portions are large, the food is served hot, the beer is good and you can get a good look at the brewery in the background while overlooking Mill Ave. The atmosphere is casual but you can be dressy on weekend nights. I suggest the pecan crusted chicken and the garlic fries but anything you order will be awesome! A must try!!
