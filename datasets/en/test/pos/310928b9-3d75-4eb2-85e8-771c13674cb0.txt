What a find!  The food here is amazing.  It's owner, George Venezia is back in business.  Many locals will remember him and now he's running this small place that serves fantastic crepes and delicious sandwiches and salads.  The portions are generous and the prices are low.  It has a real international feel since George is fluent in so many languages and converses with his customers in their native tongue, be it French, Italian, Japanese...etc.  George and Faby make every customer feel special.  Ask Faby to make you a salad...just say..."make me a salad" and be amazed at what she comes up with.  Again...the portions are huge.  Breakfast and Lunch only.  This is a very small place so depending on the moment, there may be a line.  But, like Bianco, it's worth it.
