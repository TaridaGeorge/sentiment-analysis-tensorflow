Simply outstanding!  The exact type of location my husband and I have been seeking since we returned from Europe last  year.  The food was portioned perfectly, the beers were excellent and the staff + atmosphere was as close to a beer garden as we have found in AZ.  After one visit we knew we'd be regulars.  PROST!!!
