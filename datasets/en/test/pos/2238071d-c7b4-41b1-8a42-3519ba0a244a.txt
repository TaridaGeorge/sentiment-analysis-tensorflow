very professional and friendly.  they even offer you free bottled water.  you have the choice to either stay in the car or go wait in the waiting room.  the staff is knowledgeable and thorough and never pushy.  they're also hard-working, as they open at 7am even on saturdays.  their oil change is somewhat more expensive than some of the other places, but i totally think they're worth it.  i've been to probably at least 10 valvoline locations in the past and they usually range from okay to excellent, but generally always outclassing jiffy lube in my books.  and this particular place ranks among the best valvoline locations in my opinion.
