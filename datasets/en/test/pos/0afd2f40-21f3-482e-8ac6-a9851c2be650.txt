In a word: WOW.  If you are a foodie, do not miss this place.  We had the 6 course tasting, which literally was 16 courses - no joke.  Amazing service.  Crazy good flavors.  This is a top dining establishment for the US, not merely Arizona.  I won't recount each dish; that will spoil the fun.  But be warned: the portions are larger than you'd expect, and you'll leave full and happy.
