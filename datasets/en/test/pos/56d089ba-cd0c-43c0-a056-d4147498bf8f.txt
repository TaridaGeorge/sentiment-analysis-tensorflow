Fast, affordable.  Eddie is a really good and honest guy;  he will tell you as it is, and I appreciate that.
Be sure to bring exact change in cash, and in small bills.
There was a long line of dudes selling jewelry to him.  I wonder where he sells those, because it doesn't look quite like what is being sold at the watch store, so he may have a nice store where girls like me can buy our shiny toys.  
Tell us where, Eddie!
