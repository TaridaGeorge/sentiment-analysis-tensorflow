I love this place!!  

Service is great, gets a little slow  when its really busy but the atmosphere is so relaxing and chill, that you won't mind.

My girlfriend and I go here every Saturday morning for our Mexican Mocha coffee and delicious breakfast.  It has become part of our weekly routine!

I have recommended this place to everybody I know, and am now recommending it to you!  If you don't like this place, I will give you my personal address and you can come and slap me in the face for being a liar!  But that will never happen  ;)
