Excellent professional service. Garret is a straight shooter in a profession that seems to attract a lot of BS artists. My car was a tough one - black, with lots of baked on water spots. They had to spend a lot of time to get it right and kept the price very fair. Got the headlights and "chrome" cleaned up too. Garret is very concerned that he does quality work and that the customer is happy.
