This place rescued my mother more than once over the years and were very helpful to me when I needed extra keys made and when I had questions about how to operate the "keyless entry" lock on the front door.  I had the combination but needed the technique and they gave me enough suggestions that I was able to figure it out.  My worst fear was that I would lock myself out and not be able to get back in if I couldn't work the combination.  Thanks for all your help guys!
