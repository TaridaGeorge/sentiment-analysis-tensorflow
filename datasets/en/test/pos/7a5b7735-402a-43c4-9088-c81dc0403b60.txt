I just got home from Sweets N Beats and I already want to go back for more candy and vinyl. 

This place is a small shop specializing in music and old school candy. They are nestled between The Trunk Space and The Bikini Lounge.
I found lots of great records ranging from Talking Heads, various ska bands and a Rudy Ray Moore album. Good selection of yummy candy like squirrel nut zippers (a chewy, nutty candy), lemon heads, cherry heads, bubble gum cigrars and cigarettes. 
They also have a selection of books, t-shirts and novelty items. 

Definitley check Sweets N Beats out. It's a great addition to the downtown area and it's owned by two wonderful people.

Cash only here folks, so bring the green. Everything is pretty cheap, so you can walk out with a bag of candy under $3.
