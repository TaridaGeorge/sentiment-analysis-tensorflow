The menus are greasy.
The burgers are greasy.
They only take cash. 
Real cheese.
They'll let you drink the cooking wine if you ask nicely/persistently.
The beer is cheap.
Good soda syrup/carbonation ratio. 
Monty is A W E S O M E. 
Sleazy, sad, and mostly dark. 

The bottom line here is that this place predates your Delux burgers, Fatburgers, Vig uptown or downtown, or bougie artisan pizza joint by possibly a thousand years. Alas, this is true Phoenix- the Phoenix that existed when we were acres of orange groves, palm trees, peacocks, canals, and farmland. Way back when Phoenix was modestly larger than Palm Springs and a burger was a burger. 

And if the state of affairs at Harvey's bothers you, well, then it may be time to look inward my friend. :)
