Such an awesome antique and vintage shop!  I found a vintage- super cool, super narrow and long metallic blue vinyl clutch here.  Perfect for wearing with any outfit.  They've also got vintage toys, jewelry, dresses, antiques and more.  I got to talking with the owner, Bonnie, who tells me the shop is kinda haunted, people have claimed they've seen ghosts in her shop.  I'm not into ghost hunting but if you are, maybe you'll see one when you visit!
