I would definitely consider myself a regular at Aloha.  My boyfriend and I have been going since we moved to Tempe not just for the yogurt but the outstanding cutomer service as well.  The only employee typically at the counter is also the owner, he is so friendly and makes you feel at home.  He also will bring his dog with him to work to greet the customers outside, a nice touch as an animal lover myself.  Overall the yogurt is great, they are always coming out with new interesting flavors, evening making Milkbone yogurt for dogs.  I highyl reccommend this place to anyone, especially on Thursday evenings, BOGO!
