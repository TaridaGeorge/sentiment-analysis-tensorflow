Was visiting on business and simply Yelp'd for a quick haircut. Arguably the finest haircut I have ever had! Ask for Angel!! He cut my hair and was incredible! Very personable, even gave me incredible advice on food locations and all 3 were perfect. The quality of the haircut second to none. No rush, free drinks and they even gave me a $1 for meter!! Best location in Phoenix! You wont be disappointed!! Attention to detail second to none!!!
