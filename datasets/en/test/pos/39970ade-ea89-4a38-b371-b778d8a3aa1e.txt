Hot damn!  If you want more bang for your buck, make the drive out here!  I would say that this Chinese buffet is comparable if not better than Pacific Seafood Buffet, which is one of my favorite restaurants.  The quality of food is fresh and delicious!  I ate everything on my plate!  I tried one of each sushi - all excellent, one with orange sauce was ridiculously spicy and tasty!  The baked crab on the crab shell has haunted my dreams; it was that good!  The tempura vegetables were absoultely delicious - Grade A quality!  All food was hot and fresh; waiter service for drinks was courteous and prompt.  Excellent price!  Lunch with soft drinks was less than $10 and I was full enough to skip dinner!  :)
