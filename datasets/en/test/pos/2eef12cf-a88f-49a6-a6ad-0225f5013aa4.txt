I wasn't familiar with this small chain until I traveled to the Southwest last year.  Elephant Bar was a welcome find when I visited one near Albuquerque last December.  The menu is diverse ranging from salads to sandwiches to stir fry to entrees.  I have tried a selection from each of the menu sections and I have always enjoyed my food at the Elephant Bar.

Staff is trained well and very informed about the menu choices.  I like the casual atmosphere of each Elephant Bar and I find them good for lunch meetings.

Manager Leo at this Scottsdale location is welcoming and attentive to details throughout the restaurant.  Elephant Bar is along something of a restaurant row on Mayo.  Parking is plentiful and the restaurant is easy to find off of Scottsdale Road.
