If you seriously want to lose weight and become healthy and strong, this is the place to be.  I signed up not too long ago and love it.  You get small group training and personal attention. The staff here really does care about you, will encourage you and yes, push you. Shannon is amazing,  and Shauna is a powerhouse! The whole crew will challenge you and cause you to feel strong and young.   Go for it, it's the real deal!!!  (I've already lost weight and it's been 3 weeks.)

ALSO, Shannon has written a great book called "Then Just Stay Fat"....it has fantastic reviews on Amazon.
