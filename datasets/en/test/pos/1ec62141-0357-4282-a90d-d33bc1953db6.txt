Awesome spot for good, reasonable and tasty sushi. It's the only conveyor belt sushi I know in town, and is it awesome. They have your standard rolls all the way to more exotic concoctions. Plates are broken down by $1.50, $2, $3, $4, $5 increments- but don't think everything is $5. I eat sushi often and eat a wide variety and when I go to Station, 80% of my plates are $2. I went with my gf, both had a drink and ate until we couldn't anymore...and it was $40 when a typical sushi dinner is around $120-$140. 

Definitely love this place and is now one of my favorites.
