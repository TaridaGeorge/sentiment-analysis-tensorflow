I felt like I had just been given the secret handshake when we went to this place... There's no sign other than "The Truth Lies Within" We walked around for a good bit before we found it...

This place is in an alley behind Cowboy Ciaos. It's very dark inside and cozy. The wine was excellent, they have the largest wine list I have ever seen. My one complaint would be how they organize the list, it's by price, sort of... So if you want a specific type of wine, from a specific region, good luck...

We had the antipasto platter and it was great. Olives, cheeses, cured meats, various pickled veggies (caper berries!!). No food that's going to really make a full meal, so you might want to eat before coming here.
