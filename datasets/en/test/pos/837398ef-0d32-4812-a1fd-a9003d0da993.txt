My family and I love this restaurant. We've been coming close to 20 years. Our ten year old grand daughter has been coming with us since she was 6 weeks old.  Her favorites are crab puffs and mu shu pork.  My favorite is General Tso's chicken, but I will eat anything they make as long as it doesn't have green bell peppers in it.  My stomach cannot tolerate them, but there are so many great choices, it has never been a problem.
