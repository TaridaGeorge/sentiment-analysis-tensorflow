Another great visit to 5th and Wine recently! Went with a group of 9 friends to celebrate a birthday. Chicken Pot Pie is a MUST HAVE as is the Sloppy Joe. Music on the patio is great. Service is EXCELLENT. Scott Yanni and staff really have things down pat. This is a definite MUST GO place in Scottsdale and worth the drive for us West-Siders.
