Right what I wanted when I needed it.

My father has been very sick for the last two months and I stayed in the La Quinta Inn several times over that period which happens to be across the street from the Corner Bakery.  

Every morning I would get a double shot latte with a breakfast to go.  Perfect latte every time.  The girls were really nice and the service was fast and good.  I tried all of their oatmeal breakfast bowls and an egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and healthy.  

A welcome stop every morning.  Thank you!
