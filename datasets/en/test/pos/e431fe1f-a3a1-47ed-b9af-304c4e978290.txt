Eduprize Queen Creek Jr High is the worst. The honor classes are NOT honor classes they are accelerated classes and when you switch your kids to public school they will not be able to keep up with honors classes. My child was a straight A student, loved math and hated it after Mr. Gaede for math. He is one of the worst teachers we have ever had. The aides also treat the junior high kids terribly. We switched to the gilbert school district. It took a little time but my child is finally catching up and is treated well at school. Ofcourse all the sports, music, cheer and lots more is a plus.
