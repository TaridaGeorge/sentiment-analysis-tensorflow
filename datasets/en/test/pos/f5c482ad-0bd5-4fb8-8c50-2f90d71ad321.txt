As unassuming as the hippie decorations are, the $5 value meal as I would describe it is well worth it.  The only complaint I had in going here was the seating, and I could see how it could be a detraction when it's either hot or cold.  Seems everyone complains about the fries, I on the other hand liked them just fine.  On the day I went it was just right, I'll look forward to going back again and again.
