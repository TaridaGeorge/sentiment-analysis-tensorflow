From the front office to the quality of dental care, this place is perfect. My boyfriend started going there, then I did. We even switched our son over from his pediatric dentist to go here because they are so gentle, clean and professional. I have also had some dental issues in the past and they actually were able to give me OPTIONS to correct them, not just telling me what to do. I have never had a choice in decision making in my dental care. When I went in when I was pregnant, I let them know the taste of mint made me nauseous and they easily accommodated me. We have never felt ridiculed or scolded here, which is a common issue with dentists.
If I move to Sun City some day, I will still make the drive to this office. This is my forever dentist.
