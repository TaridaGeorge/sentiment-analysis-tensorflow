It doesn't look appealing from the outside but inside it was very welcoming. Went to watch the second half of late football games a week ago sunday, and Alycia (sp?) the server was very happy to take care of me, unlike others on my trip.  She was prompt and got a very good tip when she was cut at 5, and she treated me like a friend though I didn't know her.  OTB was in next room, and I watched football and horses, and even won a little money.
