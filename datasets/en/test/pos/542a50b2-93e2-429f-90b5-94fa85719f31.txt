My cousins and I saw the sign for this place while driving, and it boasted 350 flavors of tabacco. What the hell? That's crazy-talk.

We stopped by, I'm pretty sure all of the employees were Native American. Come to think of it, I'm pretty sure this is the border of a reservation, since the Casino was a stone's throw away. Plus, ya know, the name of the place. 

We were carded right away, because apparently this 26 yr old looks 17. 

The place was packed! And, there's a drive-thru!

There really are 350 different flavors of tobacco here. I didn't count, but I'm almost sure of it. My friend bought some flavored cigars, because it said Al Capone smoked them on the box. They have cool lighters too. 

Maybe I was just in awe because I don't see shops like this in San Diego. What a tourist.
