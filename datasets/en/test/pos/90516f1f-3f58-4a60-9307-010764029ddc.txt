Heard about The Breadfruit in an article in Az Vines & Wines. It sounded so good we couldn't wait to try it. It was OUTSTANDING!! The drinks..the service..the staff was amazing..& the food just incredible. We can't wait to go again. Highly recommend it.
We just moved here from the East coast & we are trying as many rest as we can.
This place is a must..
