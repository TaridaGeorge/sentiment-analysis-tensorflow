Pita Jungle is awesome. 

I could stop there, but I won't.  

The atmosphere is casual, yet professional.  The staff is laid back and friendly, the kind of people you could just kick back and hang out with.  

The food is good, and you get what you pay for.  I love the chicken pasta salad, it tastes great, and there's always some left over for lunch the next day.  

I have been impressed at PJ's steady growth, it seems like every time I come back, there's another store opening.

I'd say they're worth a try.
