Hit up the local comedy show on a recent Friday night. It was great. It was cheap. Like 10 comics for $10. There were no lines at the bar. Bartenders we super cool. It was walking distance from downtown Tempe. There were cabs and bicycle taxis available. The venue was awesome. Brand new, nice, swanky, clean, well lit. They had a jazz show going on in another studio and a party up on the rooftop also. Every seat in the comedy show had a great view. Right on the water. C'mon get down there and check it out for a concert or a show or an artist exhibit!
