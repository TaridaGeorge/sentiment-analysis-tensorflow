Kachina Dry Cleaners is the best in town! ...and the owner (Stella) is adorable! 

I've been bringing my dry cleaning to Kachina since 2005 when I moved to that part of town; today I don't live over there anymore but I still bring my clothes to Kachina. 

I have anything from Hugo Boss suits to a few button down shirts from Old-Navy and everything in between, and I trust Kachina with everything. Never once have they let me down! My shirts are always perfect, never missing a button and they even put collar stays in the collars. My pants have razor sharp creases and my sweaters look brand new!

I even trusted them with a California-King goose down comforter, this truly is the best cleaner in town.

Thank you Stella, I wouldn't take my clothes anywhere else!
