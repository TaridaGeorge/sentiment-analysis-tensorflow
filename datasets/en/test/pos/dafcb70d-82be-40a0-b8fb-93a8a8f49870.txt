I had lived in Gilbert for 10 years and unfortunately never came here until after I moved away for college.  Everyone told me this place was fantastic, so I finally brought my family here one Sunday while I was back for spring break.  The reviews are not underrated.  We absolutely loved this place!

Sunday lunch can take a while, but it is sure worth the half-hour wait.  I ordered a Portobello Salad, knowing that their greens and fresh from Agrotopia.  Words cannot describe the wonderful medley of juicy vegetables and the succulent grilled portobello.  It was pure delight.

The rest of my family shared a large order of barbeque ribs with a side of sweet potato fries.  Everything was simply delicious, and we got to enjoy a really nice lunch outside.
