I was at this hotel a while back.  The interior had no deferred maintainence, but the decor was a bit dated.

The service, however, is nothing less than outstanding.  The bell boys are particularly attentive.  They remember your name, which is a nice touch.

There's a Houston's within a stone throw, so I had dinner there.  There's also a hip lounge within walking distance.  I had brunch at the restaurant inside the hotel, and that was excellent.
