wow.  i had split this plate with my boyfriend. we had the jade red chicken, jerk chicken, jerk fried rice, and black beans.  nothing dry. nothing stale, just great flavors all around. amazing combination, and it was really, really, delicious.  this was the first time i had chinese x mexican fusion and i feel that i would never find something close to this back in L.A. sad that all the mexican food in L.A. tastes the same to me. though i'm only in arizona to visit my good friend once a year, this is, again, one of the places i must come back to.
