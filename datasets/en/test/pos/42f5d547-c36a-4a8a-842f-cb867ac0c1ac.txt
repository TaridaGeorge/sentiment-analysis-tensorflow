This place is the best!!!! The staff is extremely  knowledgeable and helpful. The sales they often have on beers is ridiculous..where else can you get a 24 pack of tall boy Fat Tires for $10??!!! But you have to get there quick for their sales because they do sell out! if you're looking to try a new liquor ..no problem they always have specials that are pocket friendly. If you live in Tempe this is the place to go.
