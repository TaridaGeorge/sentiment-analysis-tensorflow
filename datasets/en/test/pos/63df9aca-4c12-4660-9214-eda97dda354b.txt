i was seen at this location 4 days ago after a long weekend of severe coughing, sore throat and generally yucky feeling.  I live in NY and was vacationing in AZ.  
The service was great.  Registration process smooth.  Wait time reasonable.  Staff polite and helpful.  I was diagnosed with bronchitis and left with a couple prescriptions.  After one day of meds, I was feeling much better.  The doctor who treated me called 2 days later to check on me!
This was my first urgent care experience.  Kudos to NextCare!  Thanks Doc!
