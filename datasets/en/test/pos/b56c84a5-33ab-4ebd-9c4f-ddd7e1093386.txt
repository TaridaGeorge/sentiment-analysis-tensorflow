Preston, you need to know about this one. Greeter explained the menu well, staff was friendly and courteous. Had Beef Pho with Brisket and Meatballs. Came with the bean sprouts and fresh thai basil.  Food came out quickly. rice noodles were well cooked. Vietnamese Coffee was good but high calorie. Attached to the Asian Market. One of the best small restaurants visited in a awhile I'll be back and send friends.
