Brought my parents here for lunch last time they were in town.  Dad loved his gyro. Mom and I both got large salads, hers chicken and mine gyro meat.  SO much delicious food for not a lot of money.  Between my Mom and I's leftovers I had a full dinner to eat later.  

Hooray for pleasing the parents!!
