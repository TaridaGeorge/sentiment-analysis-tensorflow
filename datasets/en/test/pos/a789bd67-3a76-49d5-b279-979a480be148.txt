Where else can you rent dvds or cds for free!  Wi-fi is free and as long as you want. There's even a cafe downstairs if you really need a pick me up. The second level has a good selection of magazines and newspapers if you need to look at a past issue for school or work.   Get inspired by all the books or just by the views of the city on the top floor!
