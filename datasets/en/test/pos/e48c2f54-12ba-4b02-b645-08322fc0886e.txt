I love the Pointe! This hotel is so fun and nice! My Uncle from New York would come visit AZ for business trips and he always stayed here. The rooms and casitas are nice but the real fun is at the water-park and pools. The lazy river is to die for it's so long and refreshing. The main pool area, or the river ranch, is a blast. There are slides, the lazy river, waterfall pool, volleyball pool, kids pool, and much more.I have only stayed at the Squaw Peak location, and I have been impressed and had a blast each time! 

Also there is no need to leave the hotel to get something to eat...they have great restaurants!
