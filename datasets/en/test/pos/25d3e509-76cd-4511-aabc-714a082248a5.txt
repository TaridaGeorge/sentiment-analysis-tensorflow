I am a huge fan of fondue and this place has got it down right.  A four course meal is the way to go, starting out with a cheese fondue of your choice, then a salad, then an entree (I prefer the broth for dipping rather than the oil as it makes the meat just so darn tender), and then of course, the dessert in the form of a chocolate fondue.  The seating is very intimate and private in large booths.  This is not a place to go for a quick meal, but a place to savor the food and the company.
