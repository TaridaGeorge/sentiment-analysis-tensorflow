Phoenix is big, but so is the reward you'll earn by getting across it to My Mother's. You'll enter a homey-decorated time machine back to when food and drink were generous and scrumptious and service was authentic and personable. In the latter function, look for Teresa, who presented our chicken-themed dinner entrees --- chicken tenders, chicken-fried steak, and chicken-fried chicken --- with ample sassy conversation. And how about that fresh-most salad bar, and the potent margaritas? We were lucky enough to catch Mother herself, on a rare visit from her place of retirement, but once you've visited the place, your return visits won't be rare at all.
