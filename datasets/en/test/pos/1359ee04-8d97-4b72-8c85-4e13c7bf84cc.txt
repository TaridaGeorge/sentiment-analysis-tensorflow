Went here one afternoon after seeing it many times but never trying it. I had the gyro and it was SO delicious! The meat was moist and tender and the portion was HUGE! My friend had the hummus and dolma pita which she said was really good and I think will be my next try! Well priced an authentic, and there is also a middle eastern market attached next door. Definitely worth a try and I can't wait to go back!
