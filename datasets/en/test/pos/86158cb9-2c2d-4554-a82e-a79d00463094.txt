One of the best Philly Cheesteaks I have had!

Great little restaurant where the owners are super friendly, the staff I pleasant and helpful, and the food matches the quality you would expect.

We stopped in on a Sunday evening, not wanting to have to wait to eat. They were happy to help and offered some sugestions as we were just kinda "blah" about eating.

We ordered the sampler appetizers, a small cheese pizza for the kids, some bone in and boneless wings, the philly Cheesteaks and a ham and provolone sub. 

We took a menu and a magnet on the way out and will be visiting again!
