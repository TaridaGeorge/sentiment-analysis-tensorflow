Awesome!!!!!!  I had pho with well-done brisket and it was great.  I have a favorite Vietnamese pho place that is Zagat rated back in Philadelphia and the pho at UnPhoGettable was very similar.  The noodles are perfect and the broth was delicious.  The meat was also very tender, melted in your mouth and had no fat. The soup came with basil, lime, sprouts, and jalape√±os like usual, which were all very fresh.  The service was great also.  Always had a drink, food came out fast, and very friendly servers and owners.  Great place for pho lovers!  I will definitely be going back!
