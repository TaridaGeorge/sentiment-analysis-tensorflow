Sure it's a chain, but every individual establishment has its quirks.

However, this Cheesecake Factory delivers with gastronomic fireworks.  The quality of service and food were reflective of a five-star restaurant without mirroring the small portions and high prices.

For instance, the pizza with salad lunch special combo was so big, even a Wooly Mammoth probably couldn't get it all down.  The burgers are also so big, I even had trouble getting my big mouth around it.  The food was exceptionally delicious.  I also highly recommend the Thai Chicken Pasta, which I usually get almost every time.

Of course the ambiance inside is also very nice.  I think about 5 staff members said "thanks for coming" on the way out.  Hands down, this is one of my favorite chain-locations to dine at!
