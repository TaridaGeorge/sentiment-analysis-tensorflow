Liquid.  Chocolate.
Holy. Crap.

Chocolate lovers unite!!  Urgent meeting at Chocolate Surprise!!

I had their iced mocha/chocolate today... omg.  The guy called it "Jet Fuel". hehe  It was SO GOOD... you gotta try it. Seriously.

We got the half pound of belgian chocolates... tried two of the chocolates when we got home... omg.

That's all I can say.

OMG.

The guy up front is a true artist (I'm sorry, I didn't get his name) who enjoys his artistry and chemistry work with chocolate.  He knows what he is doing.  He even has this beautiful picture frame piece that he did... he showed it to us.  You can see a picture of it on their website listed here.  It's gorgeous... and completely edible.

I am super pleased with our experience.  We'll be back... they have some awesome gift ideas... and who doesn't like chocolate?
