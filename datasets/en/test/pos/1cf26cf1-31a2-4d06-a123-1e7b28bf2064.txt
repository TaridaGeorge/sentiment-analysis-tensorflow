Don Can-Am Spyder -- I'm a new rider and I went to the store to look at motorcycle helmets and wound-up buying ALL of my riding gear from these guys because the owner (Dave) and sales rep (Nate), along with everyone else in the store were extremely friendly, knowledgeable and passionate about riding and safety. I also bought a Scala Communication System and Dave offered to help me set it up and get it running properly. Everyone at the Helmet Center Phoenix could not have been more helpful and professional. These guys spend a lot of time with me and their Customer Service is great!
