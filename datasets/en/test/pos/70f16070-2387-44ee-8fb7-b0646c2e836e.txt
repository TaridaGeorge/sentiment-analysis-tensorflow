GREAT!!!!! The food was so fresh and yummy. I love how they grow their own food or get it from AZ growers. I went there with some friends and we all order different things and they all rocked. You will not be disappointed.....go.
The staff was great as well, friendly, super nice. This place has a kewl vibe to it and is kept clean. Don't forget the expresso bar are the red velvet cake.
They also help with local charties. This place totally gets 2 thumbs up from me.
The line can be a little long, but it is worth the wait.
