I've stayed here several times in the years since it's opened.

Most recently my husband and I decided on an impromptu stay after having breakfast at the Saddle Ranch that's a walk away at Westgate.  They currently are running a promotion for $89 a night plus taxes.  I think the whole stay was about $101.  Everything is always clean.  The staff is awesome, and the rooms have always been up to par.  When we stayed in June last year, we were upgraded to a suite for free.  We're always satisfied when staying here, and always miss it when we go home.

The pooool is amazing as well!
