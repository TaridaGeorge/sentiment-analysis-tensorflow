Excellent!  They were professional, courteous, took time to hear my complaint fully.  I brought the car in because the a/c had been acting weird the previous day.  On my way to the shop, the a/c acted normal, and it did not malfunction while in the shop.  Rather than push unnecessary repairs/parts on me, they educated regarding potential issues and what to look for.   I feel they were fair and honest, and would recommend this shop to anyone!
