We had a great lunch at the Cafe at the Heard Museum!
Ordered the posole, which was a generous bowl of pork/hominy/chili soup.  Delicious!  But for some reason it was served with an unusually small tortilla.

The coffee was excellent, a flavorful brew.  Our server was cheerful and attentive.  The cafe had a warm inviting atmosphere and was doing a good business.  

This cafe is far superior to the museum's previous cafe.  Looking forward to another lunch here!
