Great food, great service! I've never been a Vietnamese restaurant as clean as this one. We were seated promptly and our waiter even helped us with our order with recommendations and making slight changes to our items as we requested. We each had an order of spring rolls and a bowl of pho with drinks. The shrimp spring roll was delicious filled with lots and lots of veggies just the way I like it. My brisket pho was absolutely delicious. I don't like rare pho meat so I got the brisket and it was cooked well with the tenderness still intact. The Vietnamese iced coffee also perfect. Never had a coffee quite as good and creamy, even better than the powder packets that so many of my friends swear by. Love it!
