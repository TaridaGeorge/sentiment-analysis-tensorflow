TT's was the first place I was ushered to in the Phoenix area. Straight from the airport to the bar. Somehow I've been transported from Portland to Phoenix but I feel like I'm in Portland. Well, other than the heat and brownness. But, I digress...
TT's is a small, scant bar devoted to the motorcycle. Moto paraphernalia adorning every part of the bar with an occasional skateboard here and there. The place is cheap and fills up easily but has comfortable booths, a pool table and darts. The bar has a rather awkward shape but the two tenders do their job well and keep the cheap drinks flowing.
If I lived in PHX, this would be a regular stop. Even if it is in Snottsdale.

Crazy kudos for their jukebox! It had all my favorites and I felt like I was a 12 year old skate rat again....
