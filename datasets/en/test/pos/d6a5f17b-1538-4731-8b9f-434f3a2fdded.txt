Discount is always great, but usually there is a 2 hour wait but not this location.  I only had to wait and hour, but it gets better...now that I have joined Mountain Side Fitness I just get a workout in while they replace my tires.  Talk about killing 2 birds with one stone, got to love it.  I usually shop online first to check the tire ratings and mileage warranty before I buy so that I am not suckered into buying tires that I dont need or that dont last long.  This place has friendly service and it is nice, new, and clean for a tire shop.  All their places aren't bad but there is usually a long wait anytime you go to one of these.
