Visits to AZ are never complete without a stop at Four Peaks.  Fresh beer, great food, great atmosphere, and helpful staff.

We have been to both locations, and hands-down the Tempe location is where to go to people watch, hang out, sip some tasty adult beverages, and eat some tasty food.  On the weekends, it gets packed with people, so go early.  Scottsdale was a nice place on a Sunday to watch football, and enjoy a casual --albeit, quite afternoon.

Both locations rock!  

When the Mrs. asks to go there, (the salads and light adult beverages are her thing), that makes me a happy camper.

In support of local independent breweries keep up the great job!!!

Hope to be there soon...
