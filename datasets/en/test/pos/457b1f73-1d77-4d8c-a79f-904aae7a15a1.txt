I have never actually eaten inside the Side Door -- we are strictly take-out customers here, and we are very satisfied ones. Their burgers are absolutely giant and really, really good. I've also had and loved the Italian beef sandwhich (french dip) and their Mediterranean chicken sandwich is awesome. My only complaint is the fries usually don't travel well and I've never been all that wowed by the pizza. But this place rocks as a great, inexpensive take-out option.
