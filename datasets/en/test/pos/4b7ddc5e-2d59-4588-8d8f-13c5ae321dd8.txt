Very helpful and knowledgeable staff.  I had stopped on a whim, and their staff helped me choose the best plants for my situation, and even helped load them in my car!
They have a great selection of trees and plants, unlike the nurseries who claim to have "thousands of trees," and then you arrive, and find they simply have thousands of two different varieties.  A & P may not have thousands, but they do have many varieties, and all are in great condition.
