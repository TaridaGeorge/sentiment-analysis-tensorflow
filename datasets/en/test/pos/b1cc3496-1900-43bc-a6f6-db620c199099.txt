Pho is great.  This Pho is great.  The veggies Pho is top notch.  I get soup about once a week and always have to get more for everyone I work with.  The price is good and the place is always busy which is a good sign it will not be closing down anytime soon.  

If you are not a big fan of the veggie try the meatball because that is good to.  

I believe it is better then Maxim.  But try both and compare for yourself because Pho is good.
