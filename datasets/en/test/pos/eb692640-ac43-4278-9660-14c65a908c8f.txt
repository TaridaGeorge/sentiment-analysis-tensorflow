Another great lunch at Ray's - 2 slices with drink for $4.00.  Crust was just right with golden brown edges, nice crisp on the bottom, moist & chewy in the middle, and topped with a tangy tomato and milky mozzarella cheese.  Crust has a lot of residual flour on the bottom, which is perfect for me (and preferable to cornmeal).

Staff are always friendly and the atomosphere has a NY-tribute theme going.  An older crowd was enjoying their slices at lunch today, which is perfectly fine with me.
