I've been to C-Fu on numerous occasions. We even had our rehearsal dinner there and the owner was very courteous and did a great job delivering us a custom menu.

Recently, the day after my brother's wedding, we had a huge party and were thinking about all going out to dinner, we decided to call up C-Fu and they told us that there wouldn't be any waiting at all. They quickly took care of us all and then we all decided to hit up the bar and do karaoke. It was a blast.
