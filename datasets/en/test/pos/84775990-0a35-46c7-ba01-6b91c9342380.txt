Bottom line: Speedy print service, good prices, and an extremely friendly staff!

I had to print out 2 massive posters (6ft wide and 4ft tall) for a convention and wanted a place that would do a good job, but not charge a fortune.  I am on a grad school budget.  I received my first poster and it is perfect.  The business is also family owned and I love to support local businesses.  I will never go to kinkos again!
