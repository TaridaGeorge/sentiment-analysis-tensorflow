Love the shows the promoters bring in. Cozy spot where I've seen Owl City, A Fine Frenzy, Landon Pigg and more. Plus they are generous with the Malibu Rum :) You will need to visit the bar to get your own as I've never really seen cocktail servers. Oh well... 

Atmosphere is laid back, chill. A large patio. And yes, the Shaker Room. The hot, shake your stripper ass, place to be.
