I felt like I was back on the streets of Manhattan when I bit into the cheese slices at Mamma Mia's. No, not some foo-foo gourmet version with duck and pomegranate flecks, but a real pizza like you'd find in, well, a pizzeria.

$4.00 for two huge slices and a can drink? Wonderful, and psst, right next to New Orleans Snowball. I have to think that I'll be trying everything but the motorcycle shop on that very complete and varied strip mall! 

Thanks, Antonio and Mama Mias's!
