I love taking golf clinics there, Bruce Calhoun is an awesome teacher and you learn SO much in one day from him. He covers body position, swing technique, physics, accuracy and is very nice too. I saw a road runner bird when leaving in the brush...so that was cool too. I think the caddys are real nice too and they give you rides in the golf cart when you need to get to a diff part of the course.
