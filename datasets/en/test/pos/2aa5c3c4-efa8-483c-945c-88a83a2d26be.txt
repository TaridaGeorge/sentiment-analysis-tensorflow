Well, to be honest, we only hiked 2 trails in this park but my kids loved it so much we came back 2 days later. Of all the things we did on our trip to the Phoenix area, they voted Hole in the Rock their favorite. And it was free!!!! WOOHOO!

The hike up to the Hole in the Rock was easy enough for my 3 and 5 - year olds to do pretty independently. My 18 month old needed some hoisting here and there but he loved it, too. Great views from the top - we spent almost an hour up there climbing the rocks and enjoying the view of the zoo and the valley.

We did some other hiking in the area but Papago Park was easily the best experience for us. Highly recommended if you're visiting the area.
