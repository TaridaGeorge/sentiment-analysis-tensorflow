NYPD ranks up as one of my favorite pizza places in the valley. Their pizza and calzones are absolutely amazing; incredibly fresh ingredients all with their own unique twist. (Their italian sausage is to die for) The pizza is very traditional new york style - very thin crust, the focus is more on the ingridents.

What impresses me the most however is the prices are superb! You can get a 18" pizza for about $10 with two toppings, amazing price!

For under $25 we had two sodas, an appetizer and a pizza that easily fed both of us (without the appetizer)

Highly highly recommended!
