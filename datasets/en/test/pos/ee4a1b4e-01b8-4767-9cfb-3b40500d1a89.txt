I come when I have quick, close, and edible on the mind! 
The food is pretty good for fast food ( I am a picky fast food eater.)  
Eating in the dinning room is something I suggest. The general manager makes rounds asking how you are doing and even offering to refill your drink! I was without a drink once and a crew member even gave me a medium cup to sip on something. Hospitality is great, food is good, Comes out piping hot ( my burned tongue fell victim though ) what else could ya want from a fast food joint! 
The dinning room is open 24 hours which is awesome when coming home from a concert or late movie.
