Of course I would give Sephora 5 stars and even more for this location. Like the other reviewers have mentioned, this Sephora is a lot better than the one in the Scottsdale mall. Employees are great here, very knowledgeable, and eager to help. I like the fact that they are able to give me ideas for the products that I am going to buy, in addition to letting me know about other products. 

While there's a JCP being constructed near our house, with a Sephora inside, it's obviously not going to be as good or stocked as the one in the mall (besides the points aren't added).
