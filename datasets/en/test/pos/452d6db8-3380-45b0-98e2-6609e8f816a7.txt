I took a friend to Hulas Modern Tiki tonight that had never been there and as usual, we were greeted by the hostess who has the most awesome smile ever...starts the night off great. Our waiter Andrew, who incidentally has been my waiter every time with only one exception, was as always very attentive, laid back, and just an all around nice guy and great waiter. Ice tea was in order along with some ribs for me and a Jawaiian Jerk Pork plate for my friend. The food arrived within minutes and was, par for course...SUPERB!!!  Thanks to the team at Hulas for another great dining experience.
