TIme for an update -

The Hungry Monk is still awesome!  

I have been here several times now and I have never been disappointed.  Most recently I dropped in for lunch on a Wednesday and found out that it was my lucky day!  They offer $3 craft beers all day on Wednesdays!  I had my favorite chicken pita and tried Nitro Stout.  It was delicious.  I know the place gets pretty packed when there are games on.  This time last year I wanted to watch some baseball during the playoffs and walked in to find the place was packed to the rafters with people waiting.  Good for your Hungry Monk!!
