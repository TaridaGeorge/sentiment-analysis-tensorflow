I love the ASU downtown Campus.
I started studying there in the fall of 2008, when Taylor Place dorms first opened up.
It is a very clean, safe, and bustling campus. There is always something to see and do, but it has a smaller feel than Tempe, which I like. It's very close to Civic Space park and the lightrail. The starbucks in the TP dorms is one of the nicest ones around, and it's not just for college students. The Cronkite building is state-of-the-art, and the UCENT building provides great library, classroom and study space. ASU is my alma mater and my husband's alma mater and I couldn't be happier with the experience both of us had here.
