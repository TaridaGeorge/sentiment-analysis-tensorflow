Healthy eating has never tasted so good.  Kirstin, the ever present owner,  has hit a home run with her restaurant. I'm not usually a super healthy eater, but I found the menu diverse and tons of things to choose from. 

It helps that they have a ton of cool micro-brew type beers too, not to mention a full bar.  Plus, I love a place that allows you to try a few things at once, a la the tapas plate, which allows you to choose a few apps.  I had the mac n cheese, tuna, ginger long grain rice (obsessed) and sweet potato fries. 

Great place and great location - loved the complimentary valet parking.
