Bosa Donuts, how I love thee. I come here with my husband from time to time and get a dozen doughnuts that lasts us all week. It seems like this place is always stocked up on the right doughnuts, and they are always fresh when we get them. Their glazed ones are to die for, as are many of their other varieties. The employees are always SUPER friendly and this place just overall rocks my socks off. Bosa FTW!
