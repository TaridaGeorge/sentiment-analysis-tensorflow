What a great hole in the wall mom and pop shop. I have a friend that lives close by and I happen to work up the street so we meet often for their happy hour. Their happy hour specials are some of the best in town (5pm-9pm Monday-Saturday) They offer fun combo specials and during happy hour its buy a sake, the beer is free or vice versa - at any rate, the prices are spot on. 

The entire staff is part of the neighborhood and they take the time to get to know your name (if you want that bonding to happen) Yes, it's a hole in the wall, but it's clean, comfortable and you can't beat the price.
