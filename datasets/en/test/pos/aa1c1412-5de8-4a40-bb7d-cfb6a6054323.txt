lo-los's food is amazing. way better than roscoes chicken n waffles.

compared to roscoes:
the waffles taste the same, the chicken taste better, getting drinks in mason
jars was pretty cool, the corn bread and mac n cheese was way better than roscoes. but what gives lo-lo's the better restaraunt is the service. the service is very friendly. our orders were right when we received our food. the servers kept coming back to check on things and refill drinks.

i also dont know of too many restaraunts that have a kool-aid
