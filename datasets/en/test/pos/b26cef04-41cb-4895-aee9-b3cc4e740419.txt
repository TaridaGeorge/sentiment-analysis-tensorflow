After a horrible experience at Mimi's Cafe, we went to Village Inn.  Very promptly we were seated, our orders taken, and the appetizers were delivered.  We had hardly eaten half of our soup/salad, before our entrees arrived.  Very good food, nice portions, and prompt attention by the waiter, Jamie.  Our drink glasses were never more than half full, and he visited us several times to check on our needs.  He also was very knowledgable of the menu offerings, and informed us of the specials during the week and the pie specials.   We'll be back, Jamie!!!  Thank you for a very pleasant experience!!!!
