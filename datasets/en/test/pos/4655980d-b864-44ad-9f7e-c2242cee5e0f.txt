We used to go to the Biltmore location and were psyched when this location opened (closer to us). You always feel good leaving this place. Yummy and healthy! I really like their unique drinks too. The open atmosphere (same buildings as the Green House I think) is very cool and I can see why others said it reminded them of San Fran.
