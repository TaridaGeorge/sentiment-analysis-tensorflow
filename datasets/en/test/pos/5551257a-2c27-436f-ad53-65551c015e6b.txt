Ive been living in Tempe for 3 years now and Pita Jungle has to be in my top 3 places to eat at any given time. The ambiance is awesome inside. The art work on the walls is always awesome, for sale, and gets turned every once in a while. The staff is always friendly and attentive. The food is great, fresh and healthy. Ive always ordered something different there and am never disappointed with whatever i get. Although not on the menu, i always order a side of sauteed broccoli which is the best broccoli you'll ever have. All and all, this is a great place for lunch or dinner.
