If you want a good burger in Scottsdale, this is the place to be. I went because of a Groupon purchase and was not disappointed. The food was delicious, and the service was very friendly. The owner came to our table to make sure that we were happy, and he even sent over some additional appetizers to try. I thoroughly enjoyed my burger and the atmosphere.
