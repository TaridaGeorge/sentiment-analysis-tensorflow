Who doesn't love themselves some good ole' fried chicken and waffles?

I got the Betty Boop which is a  fried chicken breast with a yummy waffle...the chicken was well flavored, hot, juicy, and fried to perfection!  Then pile on the maple syrup and hot sauce.  Hot sauce and maple syrup doesn't seems to go together, but it's delish.  Whoever thought to mix chicken, waffles, hot sauce and maple syrup all together is a genius.
