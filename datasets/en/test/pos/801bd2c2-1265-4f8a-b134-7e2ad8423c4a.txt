What's in a name? This restaurant name says it all - Morning Glory Cafe! If you can handle the wait you will definitely love it. The food is scrumptious and the view makes you feel like you're somewhere other than south Phoenix. 

My only advice would be to try it early in the morning in February or March when the Phoenix heat hasn't begun. I don't think it'd be too pleasant in our 100F+ days!
