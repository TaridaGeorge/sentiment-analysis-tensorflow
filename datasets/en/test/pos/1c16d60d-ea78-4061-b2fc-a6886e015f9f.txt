Ate here on a recent trip to Phoenix and loved it. We had a group of 16 guys, mostly drunk and they even put our meals on separate checks without us asking. Gratuity included of course. I had Penne Pasta with chicken as I am allergic to shell fish and had no worries watching everyone else engulf lobster tail, gumbo and crab claws.
