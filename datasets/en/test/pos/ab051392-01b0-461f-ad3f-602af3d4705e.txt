Great food, bar, service, prices, atmosphere. Waiters will bring over ice cream from next door. One time, they gave us cookies that they haven't sold for the day. The food is great comfort food. The macaroni and cheese or ruben sandwiches are both amazing with a delicious draft beer.

It's a great date spot because of the slight conversational noise (but it's not annoyingly loud) and the 80s and 90s music they play is always interesting to listen to.

I'll come back again and again.
