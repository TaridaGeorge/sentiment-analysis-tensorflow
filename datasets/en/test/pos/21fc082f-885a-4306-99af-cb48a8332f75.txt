Don't know how I never noticed this place, especially considering I drive past it all the time!  Finally discovered it after mentioning to a friend that I was looking for a good used book store and she pointed me here.

The place is surprisingly clean and organized.  Everything is categorized, labeled and shelved.  Books of all varieties, on every subject you can think of.  I sold several books, and got a fair trade in price for them.  ( I think the cash trade in is only 25% though).

The books sell for a bit higher than most other used stores I've seen, but they all seemed to be in really good shape. 

Have already returned a few times since my initial visit, and will deff continue to come back regularly. 

Enjoy!
