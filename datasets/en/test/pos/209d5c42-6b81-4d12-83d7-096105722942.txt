5 Stars is saying a lot about the quality of your dining experience at Pappadeaux.

-I've been here probably over five times since I've lived in AZ and every experience is top notch! 
Our server was really chill, laid back and even though very busy always checked to see if we needed anything. Most people these days even if the place is dead will not even check on you unless they are looking to drop off the bill. 

-The food is bomb, I had Stuffed Jumbo Shrimp wrapped in bacon over dirty rice (recommended). 
Atmosphere is fun and poppin all on a Sunday at that! I was really surprised. 

-Beast Seafood in AZ hands down for the reasons above, I would definitely check it out if your in town and want some good food and southern hospitality in the desert.
