There is nothing like a twilight stroll through the gardens.

Take some time to enjoy the beauty of the desert we live in. Walk quietly and look around and you'll see all sorts of desert flora and fauna.

I have never seen it crowded at night...and it's open until 8:00 P.M. (The main trail is nicely lit and paved - the secondary trails close at dusk though.)

One of the true gems of the Phoenix metro area.
