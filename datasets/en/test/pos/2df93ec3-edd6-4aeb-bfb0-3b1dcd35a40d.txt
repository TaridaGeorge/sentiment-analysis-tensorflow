Went here for a company party and was very impressed with the food and the service. My absolute favorite thing I ate was the lamb chops. They were amazing, they had so much flavor and were cooked perfectly. The filet is up there with the best I have ever had. 

We were treated like royalty by the staff, but they were down to earth as well. I had a fabulous time here and would recommend this place to everyone!
