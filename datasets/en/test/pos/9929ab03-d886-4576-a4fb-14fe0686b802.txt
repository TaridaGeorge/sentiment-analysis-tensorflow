I started going to Hiland's a few years ago and have been a customer ever since.  The owner (Scott) is very knowledgeable and gives great advice.  Even if you don't know much about cigars, he is more than happy to give you some suggestions.  Whether you like mild, medium or full bodied cigars Hiland's has a great selection from which to choose.  It's a small place, but it is full of character.

They even have a little smoking room for you to enjoy your selection.
