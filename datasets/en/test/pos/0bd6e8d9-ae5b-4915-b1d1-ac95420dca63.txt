I love this place, I think the biggest reason I love it so much is because my old lady loves Olive Garden so much but I hate eating there, it's so "chainy".  Red Devil has great food, I've eaten their salad, wings, pasta, chicken, and pizza.  It's not the fanciest place in the world but they don't try to sell themselves as a fancy restaurant.  Just a really good, family, italian restaurant.  I've always had a good experience with the wait staff, especially Dewey.  Waiters don't have to be fake or say something special to me, I just want them to be nice, and they are nice here.  Prices are good, and their "pre-dinner" roles are amazing, much better than olive gardes geasey ass breadsticks.
