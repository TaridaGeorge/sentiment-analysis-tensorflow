Nellos rules!  I don't think the people who disliked it chose the right pizza.  Get the all meat one that has bacon, meatballs, sausage, ham etc and you will fall in love.  That or their fish pizza...it sounds kind of gross but it is really good. Their salad dressing is good too, I bought a bottle for $5.95 to take home.  Give them a shot, great food, great service, good prices and you only need to eat like 2 pieces to be stuffed!  Ignore all the NY and Chicago comments, good pizza is good pizza.
