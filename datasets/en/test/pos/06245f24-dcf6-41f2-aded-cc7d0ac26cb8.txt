Short and sweet.  1st time to Postino Central and LOVE the bruschetta!  OMG it's all good.  I might come back very soon and order some "to go".

Just a thought ... noise level is high.  NOT a place for children.  People were enjoying happy hour and It's very loud in there and someone had a tiny little baby.  Take that baby home and put it to bed.  I'm sure it was crying because it's ears hurt.  (My ears hurt listening to the baby cry.)
