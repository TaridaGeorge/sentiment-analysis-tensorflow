In a desert state, finding sushi this fresh is an exciting surprise. Finding it just around the corner from my house makes it that much better, though that second part is really just for my wife and I.

Shimogamo was impressive. Fun atmosphere, intimate setting, friendly staff, and above all incredible food.

It was amazing the difference in quality between this place and our regular sushi spots; we are very happy to have a new place to go when the sushi craving strikes. 

Will definitely be going back... a lot.
