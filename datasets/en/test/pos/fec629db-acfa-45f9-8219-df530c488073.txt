This is the socially awkward and shy person's dream come true.  Self serve yogurt and toppings with limited interaction with people.  I am one of those shy folks and I love that I can go get some delicious blueberry tart yogurt, add some vanilla wafer yogurt and pay without having to say anything more than 'no I don't want the receipt.'
