Just want to give a shout out to Francisco in the Drum Department.
WOW! Where do I begin.
He was helpfull in every way to  me in deciding on some cymbals.
He was cordual and very knowledgable about cymbals.
He was with me took time with me until I was satisfied with my purchase.
You don't see that to much nowadays.
He's a good listener too!
The people at Sam Ash is really lucky to have a knowledgable employee working there.
Thanks Francisco your the best.
