I love this place!!!! I used to work right next to Sacks and when I discovered it, I was completely hooked. As an avid sandwich eater I am always looking for good sandwiches and Sacks it at the top ten of my list. Their sandwiches are just amazing and have the best taste to them. Their great selections of always fresh ingredients and different types of bread is the best part. I usually get the baguette because it's simply delicious topped with grilled chicken, melted provolone cheese, and fresh spinach. As simple as that sounds, it just melts in your mouth. Very yummy and a must try!!
