Absolutely love this place.  Frank, the owner, bought the place from Seamus, who went on to start Rosie McCaffrey's.  You won't find a more authentic Irish pub in Arizona.  Plenty of choices for beer on tap, although no domestic beer on tap.  If you go, get the fish & chips or the shepherd's pie.  If Andy is tending bar, you'll be well taken care of.  Check out Andy's authentic collection of police patches around the bar area.
