What can I say? AWESOME PIZZA! Some of the best pizza in the entire valley can be found right here in Chandler. Quick tip:  They can be a little skimpy with the cheese so the wife and I always order the pizza with extra cheese and extra pepperoni. If you get it that way you will swoon with pizza ecstasy I guarantee it. Also the canole's are to die for! The only other pizza place that comes close to this is at Casanova Brothers in Gilbert.
