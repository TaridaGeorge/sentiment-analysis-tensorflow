This place is professional and a very good value.  I had to get a denim maxi dress shortened.  The style was such that the seamstress had to do a bit more than simply cut the bottom off and hem it, yet it still cost me a very reasonable $14.  But I'm not sure if I would say they are "fast."  I had to wait a little less than two weeks.  I didn't mind since I wasn't in any kind of hurry, but it might be something to consider if you are someone who just can't wait to bust out those new threads.
