Brackin's is exactly what Scottsdale so sorely needs.  A nice, friendly neighborhood joint to grab a drink for less than $10.00 (way less) that is unpretentious, warm, and inviting.  You don't even need fake boobies or cougar attire to get in, although I doubt you would be turned away!  

I came with my husband for the first time for a Yelp event organized by Donald S.  Our own Michael C was not behind the bar that night but enjoyed the evening with all us Yelpers and made sure Brackin's knew to expect us.  This place is small!  But with the two patios, we were set.  The owner, Doug, treated us like family.  Our server, Renee, ran her little butt off and we were never without a drink in hand.  And the best part, clean bathroom!!
