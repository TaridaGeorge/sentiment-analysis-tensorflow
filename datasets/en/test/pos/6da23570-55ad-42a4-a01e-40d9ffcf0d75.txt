Kept hearing good things about the happy hour here so we finally stopped in. And WOW, can't believe it took us so long to check it out - it's now one of my new fave places. The happy hour is INCREDIBLE! For $3 you get some amazing food, got 2 apps and it was more than enough as a meal. 

The 2 apps I had were the shrimp/eggplant which was so MOUTH-WATERING-DELICIOUS-I-WANT-SOME-RIGHT-NOW good, and also the margherita flatbread (also tasty). 

Hubby had the Brio burger and it was HUGE. 

The drinks were not on happy hour (boo) but I was happy to pay the $8 for the pomegranate martinis because they were delish! 

We loved the place so much we took advantage of their gift card special, buy $100 and get a $20 card free.  Can't wait to go back!
