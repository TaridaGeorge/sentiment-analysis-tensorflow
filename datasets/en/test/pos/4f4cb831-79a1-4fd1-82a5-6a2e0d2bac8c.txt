I was very impressed by this place! Everything was more than perfect, from the friendly hostess, to the hard-working bus girl (she was GOOD! Our drinks were always filled, and as soon as we finished a plate she took it almost immediately), as well as the awesome service from our server, and lastly, everything we ordered was so so SO good.

 Everything was so fresh, and so tasty, just imagining it all is making me hungry for it all again. The calamari came, and my fiance and I looked at it kinda freaked out but then as soon as we tried it we couldn't get enough. We got a few different rolls, and they were all perfect. 

I believe this is now going to be our go-to sushi spot from here on out. Will definitely be coming back and will DEFINITELY be recommending this to everyone.
