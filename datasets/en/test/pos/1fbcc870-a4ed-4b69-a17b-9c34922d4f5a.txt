Love this library. I have lived in areas with the sprawling mega library that takes you 2459874 years to find a book and the teeny tiny library that only carries large print Danielle Steel. Mesquite is perfectly in between. Love that Interlibrary Loan gets you a book from a larger library in like 3 days. What they do have there is a great selection. The staff are friendly and the hours are fabulous.
