Everything was so delicious here for my first ever visit. The complimentary buttery rolls are huge and I had to force myself to not eat more than two because they are so good. My BBQ ribs fell off the bone and tasted great and fresh. I swear they put cinnamon and sugar on the sweet potato fries because they tasted incredible. even the broccoli tasted amazing! Dipped in some kind of lemon pepper sauce. I was impressed! They took two coupons and we even got a free dessert for a birthday. It can be a little pricey depending on what you get so I wouldn't come back without a coupon, but I'm just cheap like that. They have big screen TVs and a fun country/bar atmosphere. I like throwing peanuts on the ground.
