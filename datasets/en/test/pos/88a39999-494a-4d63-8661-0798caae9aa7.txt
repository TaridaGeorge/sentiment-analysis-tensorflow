I used to work here so my opinion is swayed.  The food here is top quality and good priced. I loved working here and I miss the pizza. I couldn't pick just one good thing there. I really do like it all... serious. 

But If I had to pick:

my fav app is the Guca Tony

fav pasta is the Big Rig, but... the Alfredo is close too

fav pizza..... ugh.. I like them all, all styles....

fav sandwich is meatball

fav salad is the pablo

I could go on but its Saturday night and I need to go out.
