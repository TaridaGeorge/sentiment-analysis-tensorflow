zinc bistro holds a special place in my heart.

i love patio seating as long as wafts of cigarette smoke isnt blown into my face as im enjoying my meal. the service can be a bit spotty here, but pretending youre on a parisian sidewalk makes up for it. ok maybe youre stuck in the scorching hot arizona desert, but zinc will bring you there for a couple hours. even for a drink or two or three, zinc is the perfect place to round up your pals and throw back some greygoose martinis in hot 115 degree weather.

choice dishes:
duck confit sandwich
side order of mac & cheese
croque madame
flatiron steak
illy coffee

bonjour scottsdale-ites.
