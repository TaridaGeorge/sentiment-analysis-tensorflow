I went today for lunch with my husband and really enjoyed everything!!

What we had: 

fried chicken- this was the best I have ever had..it was juicy and flavorful and the skin crispy and delicious

fired catfish: The Best!! wonderful flavor and perfectly cooked

beans over rice- tasted just like homemade, it was really good, did need a little salt though

mac-n-cheese- yummy..not the best I have had, but still good

cornbread- absolutely perfect and buttery

sweet tea- this was the best part of the meal and they gave us a to go cup so we could take it with us

SERVICE- very welcoming from the time we opened the door until the time we left...they all seem to work together and we were very well taken care of

Thank you Lo Lo's !!!!
