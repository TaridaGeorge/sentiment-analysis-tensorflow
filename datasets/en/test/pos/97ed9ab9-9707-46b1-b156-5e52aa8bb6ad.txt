Yeah!   Love this place!!  Went for coffee, nothing special an Americano...it was so creamy and delicious!  Wonder what they use for soy milk?  While I was there, directly after eating at green, I could not resist the soy soft serve tsunami...hope I'm spelling that right.  Chocolate and peanut butter with chocolate chips, so awesome!  Makes me want to move downtown so I can go to Nami at least once a day!
