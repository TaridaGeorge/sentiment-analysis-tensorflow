I can't say enough good things about this place.  I was introduced to it when a couple of friends of mine got married here.  I am still impressed by it five years later.  There are a few eating options here, a couple of restaurants and a large picnic area.  It's an oasis in the middle of south Phoenix.  The area around it is nice too, the old farming lifestyle all around.  If you weren't around in Phoenix twenty years ago, you can see the type of farming pockets that used to exist in more frequency around the city.  The only thing missing is an orange orchard with the trees painted white at the trunks.
