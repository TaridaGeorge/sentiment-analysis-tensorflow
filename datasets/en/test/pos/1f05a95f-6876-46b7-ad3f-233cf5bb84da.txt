Oh my god. My first experience at MBB was on Good Friday, and it made it an Awesome Friday. The bacon was one of the more memorable things. Thick and cooked perfectly. Oh! And that delicious Honey Lemonade. Such a quaint little spot. Cute, small restaurant makes it feel small-town. The wait wasn't too bad either, but, I haven't been on the weekend yet. 
Can't wait to go again!
