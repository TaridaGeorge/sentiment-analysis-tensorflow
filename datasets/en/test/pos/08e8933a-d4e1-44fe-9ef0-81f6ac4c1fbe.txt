I go here every single weekend. 'Nuff said, already, right?

The food is great - it'll put your granny to shame. The manager walks around striking up conversations with all of the regulars and there's virtually ONE waitress. She's a little biker, a little redneck, a little rough, but she's easy to fall in love with. She'll even remember your name...

Join me for a cup of coffee? I'll be there most Saturday mornings with the paper and maple syrup on my face.
