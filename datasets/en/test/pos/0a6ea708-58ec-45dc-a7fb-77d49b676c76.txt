Best pizza in phoenix to date. It stinks this location doesn't have dine in, but its ok. My fav? The "classic combo" on thin crust. If you don't like this and the flavors don't explode in your mouth, I'm at a loss for words. The absolute best pizza money can buy. I have NO problem paying $20+ for a large combo pizza when the end result is this. I can't get over how amazing it is.

They are pretty busy so make your to-go or delivery orders early. The staff is really nice, even when they are super busy. On each pizza box, they have coupons you cut-out. Save 12 of those up, and you get 50% off any pizza of your choice.

The wings are also excellent.

A+
