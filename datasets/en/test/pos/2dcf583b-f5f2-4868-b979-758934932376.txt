I was impressed by  the customer service distinction of offering to gift wrap my $20 tube of hand lotion.  CLASSY, and well noted.
 I didn't need it wrapped, it was for myself.  What a nice touch though.
I will gladly  pop in here again in the future to get gifts for myself and friends.  
 Considering I didn't spend a lot of money in this store and they were still  compelled to show me the level  of distinction they strive for is nice.
I genuinely enjoyed this store and the warm manner of the swell fellow who greeted, left me alone, and helped me when I beckoned. 
Thank You, for not being a robot.
