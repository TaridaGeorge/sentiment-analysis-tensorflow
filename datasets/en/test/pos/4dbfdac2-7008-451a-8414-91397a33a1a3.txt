I completely agree with Roger S.! Although this is a chain restaurant, that's not the feeling you get when you step in. First off - the place is spotless. Everyone is genuinely friendly and helpful. The manager, Anaya, is always visible and talking with customers. The food is ALWAYS fresh and I have yet to try something I don't like (the California Turkey is my favorite!). As long as you're not expecting an ocean view and a French ma√Ætre d', This place is fantastic!
