Talk about a bitchen Gyro!!! Load that thing up with the Gardien Peppers & Tzatziki Sauce!! Oh and ask for an extra Tzatziki sauce just because - it's sooo good. I can't really speak for Gyro's in Chicago or for that matter any other place than Phoenix so with that said. THIS PLACE RULES!!  I've had a Gyro over at Greek Town on 7St and while the food was authentic and NO YOU CAN'T have any damn FRENCH FRIES with your Gyro... I dare you to even ask that dude - so while it may be authentic it was also a light weight compared to the Feast of Awesomeness that you'll experience at Chicago Gyros!! and don't forget the extra Tzatziki sauce.... 

p.s. The Fries are damn good too!!!!!
