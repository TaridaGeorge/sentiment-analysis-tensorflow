Unlike Black Bear on Bell Rd., which went from 5-Stars to 4-Stars to 1-Star & finally folded, this Bear is still roaring at full volume!

I loved this place from the moment I set foot inside...  SO comfortable!  I ordered one of the current breakfast specials, which was an 8 oz. New York Steak & eggs.  I chose hash browns & an English Muffin for the other items.  Everything including the BIG serving of potatoes was just delicious, & my service from "Rusty" was perfect.  What an amazing value too, at only $6.99!

I'll be back to bite my way through most everything on the menu here, because this Black Bear is absolutely 5-Stars!
