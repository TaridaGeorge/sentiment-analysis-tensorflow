First of all I love that everyone knows my name. IT adds to the special factor. I get waxing services done with Viktoria. She is THE BEST. Everyone needs to go see her. I ALWAYS get compliments on my eyebrows. 

Ashlee cuts my hair and does my color. She is also very good. She did my color before a major event last year, and I received lots of compliments. Cut-wise, I've only gotten trims and bags, but no complaints.
