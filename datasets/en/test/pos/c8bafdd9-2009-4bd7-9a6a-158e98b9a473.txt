It's just ridiculous I have not bumped Z's up to 5 stars yet.  Never have I had a complaint.

The pita is perfectly cushy, yet toasty.  Veggies are crisp and fresh.  Chicken (I always get chicken) is wonderfully flavored and devoid of all nastiness that can come from a chicken.

There.  5th star.  Well-deserved.
