Came here for the Magic Mike's Ladie's night Yelp event.  What an awesome place to come watch a movie, friendly staff, and clean.  Very hip, definitely different way to a boring movie night.

It is a great place for an date, family or just having a girls night out.  Love it!!  I will definitely have to bring my family here to watch a movie or come back here for an movie date night with my husband.  They offer variety of selection on their menu, from Chicken tenders, pizza, salad...etc  Price is decent, we had their chicken tenders, burger bites, and buffalo chicken bites;  I had an Ice tea and my friend had a beer, our bill was under $30, plus watched an awesome movie and had a great girls time.  Can't beat that.
