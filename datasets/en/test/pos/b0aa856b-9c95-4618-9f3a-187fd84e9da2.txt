I was visiting Scottsdale from Chicago and wanted to get some good food.  

Had the ribeye hear and everything was fantastic.  The steak was cooked perfectly and the creamed spinach was very flavorful.

The service was also excellent and they had good wine recommendations.

Definitely lived up to the 5 star rating.
