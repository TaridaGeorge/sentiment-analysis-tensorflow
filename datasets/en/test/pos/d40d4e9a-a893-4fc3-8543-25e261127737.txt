This park is far better than Cosmo for several reasons:
1.  Much cleaner. 
2. Easier walk from parking to the entrance
3. No lake. My dogs don't swim and even if they did, I wouldn't allow them to swim in disease ridden Cosmo.
4. Smaller crowd
5. Seems like the same people show up all the time
6. Dog owners at this park seem to be more educated about dogs and appear to be more responsible.
7. Easier to get to know other dog owners based on 4,5, and 6 above.

The only downfall is that it is closed on Thursday nights for maintenance.
