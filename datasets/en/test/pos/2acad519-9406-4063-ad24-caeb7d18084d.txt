I've been to a few spas across the spectrum of spas, cheap to expensive, and this one tops the lot. The staff there are very nice and accommodating. They make you feel very welcome there. My husband and I went for our anniversary.We both had a very thorough and amazing massage. Making use of the jacuzzi area before and after was a real treat. I indulged in the 'go nude' option there and it was very nice. I only saw a couple of other customers while I was there and then only briefly. I loved the lemonade with agave nectar and cucumber water. Very refreshing after a soak in the whirlpool. I only wish I was wealthy so I could afford to do this regularly!
