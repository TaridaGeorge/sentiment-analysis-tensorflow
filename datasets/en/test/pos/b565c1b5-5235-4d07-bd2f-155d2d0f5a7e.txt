My boyfriend & I went on Saturday, Aug. 4th at around 4:30pm. We were greeted as we walked in & told to take a seat where ever we felt comfortable. Most of the seating is high top tables or at the (high) counter, but there was one table in the corner we found that was perfect (I'm short & not comfortable sitting up high). 

Our waiter, Andy, came over right away, a very charming and personable young man. I'm not much of a wine drinker (or a drinker at all!), but was in the mood to give a sweet (inexpensive) wine a try. He recommended a delicious Riesling, a bargain at $12. The food was excellent, fresh & full of flavor. You could taste the quality of ingredients they used. We will definitely be coming back here.
