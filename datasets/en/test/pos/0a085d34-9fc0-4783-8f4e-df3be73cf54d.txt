As a Chicago native I've finally found a midwestern style breakfast place. Little did I know the first time I ate here that the owners really are from the Chicago suburbs. I have yet to find another breakfast place that compares to Butterfields. I've always had great food and service, plus I love the fresh orange juice. The portions are huge. The Good Egg which everyone seems to love just can't compare, nor can the chains. Butterfield's gets my vote for best breakfast. Just go early before the crowds get there. It tends to get noisy.
