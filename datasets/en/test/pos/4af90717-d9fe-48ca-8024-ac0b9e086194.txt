I really enjoy Narcisse on weekend nights.  Cool atmosphere, great house music and lots of people dancing, talking and having a great time.  Demographic is late 20s to 40s.  There is an extensive outdoor balcony that surrounds one half of the club which is an excellent place to relax and take in the sights and sounds.
