Just recently moved to the area and took some family here for dinner and drinks. It was pretty quiet inside so we got a seat right away. 
Good service, I think our waiter was either a little shy or tired but still kept on us. I had the broccoli cheese soup which was amazing!! Yum.  We all enjoyed our food and the experience. I will be back to try out some more of that menu!
