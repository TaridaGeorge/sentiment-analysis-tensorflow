I've been coming to Nousha for years and she never disappoints or makes a mistake... best beautician in ALL of Phoenix! 

I have very thick, curly hair and she has been the only stylist to figure out how to tame and make it look pretty :)

She also does my eyebrows, brazilian & facial wax, and a fabulous job with permanent make-up (eyebrows).

Her prices are ridiculously cheap compared to everyone else and she's so hospitable and friendly. You won't regret coming here - I recommend her to all my girlfriends and family members.
