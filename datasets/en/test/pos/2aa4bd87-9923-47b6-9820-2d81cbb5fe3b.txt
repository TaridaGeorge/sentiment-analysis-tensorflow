Last night was my 1st time coming to this location. I have been to the PV mall & Scottsdale & Mayo locations a few times in the past. Oh & does anyone remember the OLD location INSIDE of PV mall, where it had 2 stories?! That location was the shit. Any way I love Chick-fil-a! Their nuggets beat any fast food joints out there-McDonalds, Wendys, all of em. I also love their waffle fries, so addicting! I haven't had one in a while, but their milkshakes are bomb too! The employees are also very friendly which is always appreciated.
