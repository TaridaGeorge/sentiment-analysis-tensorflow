This place is uber swanky!  It reminds me of a nicer version of the Standard LA and has a similar vibe.  The views from the place are AMAZING.  The pool and the rooms are also top notch.  Definitely a 20/30s crowd.

We ate at Element and the food was fantastic.  I had one of the best burgers of my life there.  One of my colleagues had the hot dog/w pretzel bun, which also looked crazy good.
