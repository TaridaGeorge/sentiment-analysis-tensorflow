Well I love this place!!! Awesome country fried steak and corned beef hash.  Love grandma too! Some ppl may call her rude but I think she is very real. No phony waitresses here. I don't know about anyone else but she is just like my grandma. Don't take no crap frm anyone. For sure worth a try if lookin for a great breakfast. :)
