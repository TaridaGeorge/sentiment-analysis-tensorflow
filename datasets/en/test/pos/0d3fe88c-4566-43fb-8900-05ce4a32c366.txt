When I first saw Dr Karawi I was very surprised as he looks 20 years younger (no kidding)  than a dentist who has been practicing for 12 years. Within a few minutes he had erased any apprehension I had and as i turns out he has been the most accommodating, friendly and knowledgeable dentist I have been to. He is very forthright and patient and makes sure you are not just comfortable but are also well informed.  Highly recommend him !
