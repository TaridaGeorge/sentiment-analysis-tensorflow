This place is very small but it's so similar to what you might see in Japan. The food is very tasty and very inexpensive. I had the kitsune udon, which I haven't been able to find in any Japanese restaurant for a while in Arizona. My husband had the chicken curry which he said was awesome.  This may be my new favorite place.
