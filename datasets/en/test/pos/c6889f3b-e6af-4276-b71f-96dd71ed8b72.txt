This is one of my favorite haunts...Inexpensive good wines with tasty comfort food..I had my birthday celebration here last year and it was such a wonderful experience.. Grade A service, never an issue with the tab...Try the Butternut Squash soup and of course the Bruschetta! The atmosphere is retro dinner meets living room..If you sit at the bar, talk to the beautiful & knowledgable Cindar....ALL DAY HAPPY HOUR ON SUNDAY, CAN I GET AN AMEN?!  I take all my out of town visitors here!
