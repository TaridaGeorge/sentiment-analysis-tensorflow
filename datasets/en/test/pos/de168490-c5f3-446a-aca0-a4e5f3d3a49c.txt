It just doesn't get better than this place, in every way... service, quality, value, taste, etc.  And I can't over-emphasize VALUE!!!  This is just plain old CHEAP, yet lacks nothing in quality.

I've been to this place dozens of times, and I would give it a 5 every time.

Get the lemonade.  Trust me!!  It's made in house, and is such amazing.
