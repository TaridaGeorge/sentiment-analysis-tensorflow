I am native to the Phoenix area and have been going to the Duck and Decanter since I was a small child, in fact my older sister used to work there. They have really great sandwiches that are high quality and very tasty and they come with great customer service. This is a good place to enjoy breakfast or lunch with a client, friends or go by yourself and enjoy the free Wi-Fi. Plus they have a great little meeting room that they let people use. I use it every Wednesday for my networking group. Wonderful place and an institution in Phoenix.
