Gosh, I have to say that I am VERY SURPRISED by the poor review given by Abby G as I have been using Boojum Obgyn for years now and have always had the best care and compassion shown.  

I sincerely wish I could use them for all of my medical needs not just women type issues.  I also received high quality pre-natal care when I was pregnant with my daughter.  

Everyone that I have dealt with has been very good but Venessa Thompson is the best!  She remembers me every time and truly seems to care about my concerns. 

I have recommended Boojum Obgyn to every woman I know and everyone that I have referred has given me similar feedback.
