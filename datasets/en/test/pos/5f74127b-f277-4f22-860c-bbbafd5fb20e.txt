This is by far the best sushi restaurant in Phoenix and I've tried many.  This is not the typical modern fusion type places that seem popular these days. You will have the legit Japanese style sushi restaurant experience.  The quality and freshness of the fish is top notch.  Be sure to check out the specials on the board for some out of this world flavors.  I got both maki rolls and sashimi and loved them all.  The spanish mackerel was wonderful.  The fish was neatly presented and they even deep fried the leftover bones and head which was 100% edible and super tasty in the vinegar sauce.  I'll be sure to come back here again next time I'm in town.
