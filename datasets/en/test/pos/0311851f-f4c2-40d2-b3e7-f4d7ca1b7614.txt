A few months back, the 7-year old A/C unit in my 1920s house stopped blowing cold air. Fearing a very expensive repair but having no choice (it was June in Phoenix) I found Flores Air Conditioning and Heating on Yelp. I made the call on a Thursday. Friday morning, right on time, Miguel Flores and his crew came to my house. Within 20 minutes the unit was blowing cold air. He charged me $130.75 for labor and a few supplies. While he was on my roof he also fixed some sagging insulation and let me know it would make my unit more efficient. Miguel was helpful, professional, knowledgable, everything you'd want an HVAC professional to be. I learned that they also do sheet metal fabrication which I stored away for the future when the unit will need to be replaced.
