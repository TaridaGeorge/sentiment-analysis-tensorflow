To make a truly great restaurant you need great family recipes, food with big bold taste and items that you can find no were else.  The Sunset Cafe has all that plus much more.  The interior is beautiful and well thought out. The staff will make you feel comfortable and pampered.  You must try the grilled shrimp. The one pound tamales are a real show stopper.  Easy to find and lots of parking. I am going back.
