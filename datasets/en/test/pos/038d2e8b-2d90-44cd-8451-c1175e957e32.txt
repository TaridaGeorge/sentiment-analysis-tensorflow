I went there for my first time today. Ordered the gyro feta with a side salad. It was 6.75$ and I couldn't believe how generous they were with the feta!

It was a HUGE gyro which was nice (although much more than I should be eating) and the side salad was delicious as well with all sorts of peppers!

The service was also very accommodating and friendly. 

I will definitely be going again soon- It's my new favorite downtown lunch spot!
