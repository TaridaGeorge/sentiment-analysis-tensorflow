Went back again......Still AMAZING!  I love, love, love this place so much.  I brought my brother and his wife and they were in love too.  They loved the Italian Sausage with Mozzarella cheese sandwich and Tomato Bisque soup.   My kids love the mac and cheese, grilled cheese, and build your own kids sandwich, too.  The only thing that is lacking is the super friendly, chatting staff.  I love supporting local places and just with the staff was excited to see us as we are to see them....

Oh, and the summer wine Muscato is delicious!
