This is the place to go if your looking for an outstanding cup of gourmet coffee. The staff is seriously knowledgable about the entire process and will gladly give you an information overload if you ask, even if they do so with a hipster poise (it doesn't really bother me when they have some useful nuggets of knowledge to back up their hipness).

Local artists regularly grace the walls with their artwork and you will always find a variety of artists, designers, developers, and general hip folk typing away on their respective mac book pros.

Haters gonna hate, but I love this place. Truly original.
