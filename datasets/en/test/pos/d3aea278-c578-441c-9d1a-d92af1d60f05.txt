Every time I eat at La Bocca I think it can't get any better - but it always does.  This is an amazingly good restaurant in the heart of Mill Avenue restaurant row.  The pizza's are great - cooked perfectly.  The toppings are fresh and tasty.  I just don't see how this restaurant can get any better - at least until my next visit!
