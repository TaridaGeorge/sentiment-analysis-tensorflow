Okay, they just deserve 5 stars....why?  Well, the food is always fresh here and so tasty.  Combine that with spectacular customer service and you get 5 earned stars!  Who knew a burger joint could be so well run?  

Soooooooooooo many restaurants need to check this place out and copy them please!  The management here is always in touch with what's going on, helping out wherever needed and that is impressive.  Having been in Management for many years I tend to notice this.  

I've been several times and every employee you interact with is accommodating and pleasant!  The Smash Chicken Sandwich is heavenly!  So nicely seasoned and tender.  The whole grain bun is an added YES.  The Smash Fries are my fav!  Malts rock and I hear the Root Beer Float made with Haagen Dazs is to die for!
