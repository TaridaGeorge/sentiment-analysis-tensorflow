Very nice property set in beautiful grounds.  Not too far from Scottsdale road and some nice restaurants.  Rooms are very spacious and well furbished.  Parking is plentyful, and next to your room.  Gym is excellent.  Room service is very good.

I have stayed here three times and will try to use this as my go to Marriott property when in town.
