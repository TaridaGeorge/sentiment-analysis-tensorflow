Outstanding experience.  Great food and ambiance and the food presentation ws also great.  The wine list is lacking in great Italian wine.  Many of the wine prices are unreasonibly high.  Monsanto $60, with a wholesale of +-$15, Antinori Santa Cristina $60, with a wholesale of under $10 and can be purchased online for under $10 at the wine library.
