Im still a fan!  I used the deal and they also had a check in offer.  I really don't understand why this place doesn't have better reviews. 

What we got:
Garlic Naan- GREAT!
Vegetable Karma- AMAZING!!!
Chicken tandoori- GREAT!!!

The service here is always really good and I have never got anything here that I was disappointed over.  It is a little pricy because you have to pay for everything separate, rice is like $4... UMMM Yeah rice, $4...  But it really is the best in town.  Anyone who is not eating here is missing out. My husband said he went for the lunch buffet and he really liked it, so I am sure it is great too!
