Yay for tater tots!

I love that Teakwoods is in my hood. I work at the coolest advertising agency (www.lavidge.com) on 28th and Camelback and we love coming here for lunch because the menu offers something for everyone.

Teakwoods offers come-back coupons, LunchClub coupons and always service with a smile.

I'm glad that old nasty McKenna's is gone and some real food moved in. Thumbs up for your great service and awesome Gallagher-look-alike.
