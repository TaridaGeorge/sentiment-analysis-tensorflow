As a vegetarian, I will tell you that this place is one of my favorites! I am in love with both their Massage Salad and their Kaleidoscope Salad..both of these have kale as a base..they also have 'heartier" fare for my non-vegan/vegetarian boyfriend such as sandwiches and wraps My boyfriend loves the Basil Pesto Focaccia. Unfortunately, the cafe is only open for lunch but I am holding out hope that they eventually extend their hours..
