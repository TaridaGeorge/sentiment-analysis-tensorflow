Simply put... My home away from home.
Lux is so much more than a coffee bar...  it's a community.  The staff is great, the owner has an amazing memory for names and faces...  I'm constantly impressed, and the people who frequent this great spot are eclectic, intelligent and friendly.  It's like Cheers... but better.... and without the booze.....
*anyway* you get my point... from my first visit here, it has felt like home and over the years I've made more great friends here than I can count.
