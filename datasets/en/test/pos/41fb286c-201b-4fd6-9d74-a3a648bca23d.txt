Easily one of the best steaks I've ever had.  We started with the seared scallops, which were delicious.  They come out in a bowl soaked in a butter/wine/garlic sauce along with bread to dip.  

Ordering was a tough decision.  We each ordered the filet (no brainer), but deciding on sides was tough.  Initially I had planned on the Gorgonzola mac and cheese based on the other reviews here (and the two girls who sat next to us salivating over their side dish), but they had a special side...Lobster Mashed Potatoes.  Basically a half pound of lobster meat in butter soaked mashed potatoes.  Holy crap was it good.  But now we have to go back again to try the mac and cheese.

Excellent food and service.
