Not only has everything I've had (in excess of a dozen dishes) been great, but the face-to-face bar atmosphere has made many of the employees friends on a first-name basis. In fact, I'm embarrassed to admit that they remember my name more often than I remember theirs! More than this antisocial nerd can say for most restaurants. Seriously this place is great, and open til midnight. The only way you'll possibly be disappointed is if you hate pasties, soups, and salads, or if you hit them at the peak of rush hour. Why haven't you tried it yet? GET GOING! They're probably still open!
