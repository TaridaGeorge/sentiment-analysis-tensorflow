Great yoga. Tasty coffee. Beautiful patio. Cozy indoor seating. And (I hear) awesome soups. Sounds to me like a perfect combination!

The wife and I liked the yoga so much we bought a package and plan to attend every Saturday. It's a great workout and a perfect start to the weekend.

I'm really looking forward to hanging out on the patio once it warms up a bit. Overall the place is very inviting -- so much you just want to hang out there all day. 

Oh, and the people there are wonderful! All very nice, almost as if you're family. (Come to think of it, I think they're nicer than my family.)
