An airport in the US with free wifi is a rare find, so Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport definitely deserves 5 stars for this potentially life-saving service. At my terminal, there was a sports bar with college football on TV, a Starbucks and usable restrooms.

Although my layover flight was delayed about 20 minutes, I was completely fine with it. My friend who got delayed at DFW Airport was less than lucky.
