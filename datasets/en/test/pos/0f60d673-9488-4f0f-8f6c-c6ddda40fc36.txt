Play Whirlwind atleast once a week, 2 great courses.  The greens check up better then any green I play.  Bunkers actually have sand in them comapred to Ocotillo.  Can't beat the price, since it's the same price as Ocotillo I prefer Whirlwind anyday.  Food is amazing, I order the Gordita everytime.  Great practice facilities as well.
