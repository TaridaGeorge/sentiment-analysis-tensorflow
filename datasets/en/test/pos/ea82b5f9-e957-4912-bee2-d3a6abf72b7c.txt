This place was great and had a large menu.  Ordered off their low carb menu section and it was delicious.  Service was quick and food came out REALLY fast!  My girlfriend and I both had different omelettes and they were great, but it was hard to choose because all their low carb stuff looked delicious and they had lots of specials too.  Great breakfast place!
