Far and away the best dive bar I've been to. Nate is light years beyond any other person working any type of customer service, safe to say the best bartender you'll ever have. Great environment, the food is bar food but still tasty(Cali burger and cheese curds ftw). The wait staff, especially Alex, are awesome and friendly. All in all it's an amazing place that you'll always enjoy.
