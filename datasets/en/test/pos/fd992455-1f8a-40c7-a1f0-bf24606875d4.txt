Even though I don't dine here nearly as often as my taste buds would like, I love Sauce! The handful of times I've been here, I've never had anything to complain about. I've had a few different menu items, namely, chicken/pine nut salad, chicken/spinach/apple salad, chicken/broccoli pasta, chicken/broccoli pizza and nothing has ever disappointed. Right now they have their summer special: one pizza, one salad, two glasses of wine for $20. Such a delicious deal!
