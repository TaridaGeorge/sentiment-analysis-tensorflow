I rarely go for Jamaican, as there are usually no vegan options except peas & rice.  I was lucky enough to find this place (via Yelp!)  when I was traveling for biz in PHX.  

had an awesome lunch.  the menu clearly marks vegan options.  the tropical salad had a lovely tart dressing & the fresh pineapple was a nice touch. the sorrel drink was gingery hibiscus goodness!  but my entree took the cake:  an AMAZING coconut curried tofu.  it actually was seitan-- not tofu-- whatevs.

simple, modern ambiance. super friendly & attentive waitstaff.

will definitely go back if I make it to Phoenix again!
