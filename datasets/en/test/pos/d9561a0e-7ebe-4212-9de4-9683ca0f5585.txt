Me and my whole family (around 12 of us) stayed here for my graduation. They got us all rooms together and allowed pets! There is free drinks (cant remember the times), popcorn and awesome breakfast. There was enough room by the pool to have my graduation party and everyone that worked there was very nice! Only reccommendation would be to get more parking.
