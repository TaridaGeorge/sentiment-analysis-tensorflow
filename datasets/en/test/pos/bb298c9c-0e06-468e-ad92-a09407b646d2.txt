This is meat nirvana, and the best Brazilian-style steakhouse I have visited.

I started with a Brazilian beer in the bar, then met up with several friends for dinner here on Saturday night. 

We all had a great time trying the 15 different cuts of meat, the unusual salad bar, and the sides of potatoes and plantains (which are all included for under $50). My personal favourites were the filet, ribeye, and the "house beef".
