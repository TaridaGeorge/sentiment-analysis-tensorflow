Had to write an update since they now serve brunch on Sundays.

I went in and was slightly disappointed to see that just about everything was with tofu scramble (not the hugest tofu fan), but I made a selection: The Benedict Arnold.  Made up of roasted asparagus, Canadian "bacon", "hollandaise", and scrambled tofu.  You can get it in a bowl (for the gluten-free kids), or wrapped in a tortilla.  I chose the tortilla, cause well...I love a damn good burrito!  

It came out, and I was ready.  First bite in, and I knew we had a winner!  The combination of all flavors was perfection to my taste buds.  They have a decent selection to choose from, including: cinnamon rolls, yogurt parfaits, other burrito or bowl delights, coffees and juices, and more.

It was a nice brunch experience and hope to come back for more.
