Best staff in the world in the EPS lab.  Thank you!!

Boswell has a long history of being the best hospital in the West Valley.  When Banner took over I was concerned but that proved to be worthless worry since the people are really what makes Boswell great and it looks like Banner has not tampered much with a successful formula other than adding their banner (no pun intended) which looks like a chicken.  Seriously, just add the legs to their logo and you have a chicken.
