I love everything about Roka Akor! The food and ambiance as well as service is second to none.  Pricing is very affordable too.

Whether you're looking for the ideal place for tapas and happy hour or dinner or brunch, you'll love it too! and do try their specialty mango tea - it's divine.

Also great space for parties and events.

ALL IS A MUST!
