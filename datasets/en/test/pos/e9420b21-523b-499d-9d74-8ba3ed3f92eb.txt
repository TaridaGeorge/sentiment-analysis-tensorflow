I wish we had a Mellow Mushroom in California and would seriously consider it- Spoke with the manager at this location and he said that California does not allow one of the ingredients they use in the dough.  THAT'S WHY California pizza sucks!  The dough!  I need to find out what this ingredient is, smuggle it into my state, and TAKE OVER the pizza industry here in California!!!  Great service!  great beers!  Great selection of pizza and other foods- Everything is perfect- When you see a Mellow Mushroom you have to go in.  And enjoy!!
