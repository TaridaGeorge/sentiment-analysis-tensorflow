This place is amazing and one of our favorites when visiting Scottsdale. The Bruschetta is by far the best I have ever had (several varieties to select from) with a large enough portion for two. They also have a great wine list ($5 a glass between 11-4). Asked the waiter for any evening special for the week ( They had a plate of bruschetta and a bottle of wine for a great price after 8pm)
