What an awesome place!  Everyone is so friendly and helpful.  You call up to refill a prescription and it's normally done within the hour.  Kelly at the counter is always so friendly and everyone greets you when you walk in the door.  I stop by religiously every month for my hormone fix and it's such a warm and wonderful experience.

Keep up the good work!
