I went in to check out the new drop of denim that the boys at The Phoenicia Association got in and left with a new pair of Naked and Famous Raw Selvedge Denim, Weird Guy cut; and a shirt by Wrath Arcane with the sickest little pocket that drops from your breast to your waist (perfect for my lighter and cigs) with a little zipper at the bottom. Spent a nice chunk of dough but nothing crazy for such a nice combo I can wear to dinner with the parents or to Old Town/Downtown on a Saturday night.
