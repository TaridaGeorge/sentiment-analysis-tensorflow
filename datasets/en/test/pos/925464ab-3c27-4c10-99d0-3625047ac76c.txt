This place is slick. The expanse of windows provide the best views of Paradise Valley out into Scottsdale that I've seen without strapping on hiking boots. 

The food was very good, but the service was outstanding. This is the ultimate "impress someone from out of town" spot and doubles as a "I am very successful but private about it" location. 

For all the glitz and glam, it really isn't all that expensive. I had a sandwich that was nine or ten bucks and it was filling and came with a side. 

You just can't ask for much more than that.
