We found this place here on yelp and couldn't be happier with this great little restaurant. The location is nothing fancy and easy to miss from the road, but the food was fantastic. We ordered a beach house burger and a brûlée burger and both were flavorful, unique, and delicious! After hearing about their Facebook page and the specials they post, we checked it out and their specials sound amazing! They are really creative with their burgers and come up with combinations that you would only expect to find at a gourmet burger spot. The fries and sweet potato tots are also better than the price. 

Overall, really fun food options, relaxed atmosphere, and good prices. The staff is really friendly and we will definitely be back again soon!
