This is my favorite go-to antique an vintage superstore.  I even come here after a bad day at work because it is therapy to sift through amazing treasures and try on sweet vintage threads at AntiqueSugar in the back.  I LOVE love this place and will see you again soon, I'm sure.  Best antique / vintage store I have EVER been to.
