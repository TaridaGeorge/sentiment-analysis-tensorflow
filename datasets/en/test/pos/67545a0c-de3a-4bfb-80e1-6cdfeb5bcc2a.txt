Been here many times.. Great place to bring out of towners..I've never had anything bad here, love the fried chicken and waffles, fried catfish is out of this world and the shrimp and grits are amazing. I usually like going to the original location near downtown Phoenix for charm even tho it's in a barrio and industrial area. Service is always prompt, one of my favorite valley restaurants.
