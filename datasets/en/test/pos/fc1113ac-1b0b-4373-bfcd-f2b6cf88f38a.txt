They do one thing and one thing to perfection -- pasties! If you've never experienced one, imagine your favorite food baked into a light, flaky dough and served with the perfectly matched sauce. While you're at it, order a side of English style coleslaw or garlic chips and an ice cold draft. How could you possible go wrong? Even better are the amazing prices and relaxed atmosphere!
