Green is, hands down, my favorite restaurant in the Valley. The ingenuity of offering comfort vegan food is matched by its excellent and delicious execution of the concept. Here you can find inventive takes on veghead staples such as salads and Thai-inspired noodle dishes to daring vegan versions of chili fries and hot wings (made from mushroom stems) that prove worthy rivals to the animal-involved originals. The bistro features a varied menu, bolstered by specials that change daily. Green also features a handful of prepackaged vegan specialty foods, including gelatin-free marshmallows.

Perhaps what I like best about Green is its hip, progressive vibe that has not fallen victim to the snotty hipster nonsense so prevalent in The Valley's "cool" restaurants. On the contrary, the staff at Green is always helpful and friendly.
