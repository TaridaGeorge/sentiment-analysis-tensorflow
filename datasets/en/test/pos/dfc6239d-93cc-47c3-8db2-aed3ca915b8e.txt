Ahhhh.... the fried pork chops. I hadn't been to Mrs White's in about 5 years and was pleased to see that fame hasn't gone to anyone's head in there. Still the same wonderful homemade, fresh food that it's always been, served in the same comfortable atmosphere. I was surprised when the server handed me a menu, but happy to see that my old standbys - pork chops, cabbage and black-eyed peas - were still there and just the same. Yes, it's slow, but good homemade food takes time, people! Nothing here is microwaved, frozen or pre-prepared. It's exactly what "soul food" is supposed to be... food that feeds your soul. Thank you, Mrs. White's, for keeping it real.
