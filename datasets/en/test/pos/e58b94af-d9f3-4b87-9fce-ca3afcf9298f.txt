Superb French pastries. Excellent croissants. Get the Almond or Almond/Raisin Croissants. Good macarons....Not Macaroons....lol...there is a difference...look it up....
Rustic fruit tarts are superb. This place could stand alone anywhere...NY, Chicago, etc. We are very lucky to have this in the Phoenix area.
