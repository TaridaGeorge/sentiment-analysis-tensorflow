Wow! Best "fast pizza" I have ever had in AZ. I just moved to the arcadia neighborhood and am pretty familiar with the area. I kept driving by Mama Mia and its always busy despite being a hole in the wall. The next time I drove by I couldn't resist stopping in even though I was not hungry!

 I ordered cheese with bacon, hatch green Chile, and mushroom. I took a bite and it was fantastic! The crust was crunchy and soft at the same time, the sauce was explosive, and it wasn't too greasy even though there was bacon on it! 

I will never order chain pizza again considering they deliver 7 days a week! I recommend everyone to come try Mama Mia even if you dont live the neighborhood. You wont be disappointed!
