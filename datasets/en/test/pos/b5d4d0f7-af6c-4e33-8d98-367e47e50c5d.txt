I went in on a sunday night... Most shops close around 6pm so i was really excited to find a spot open till 10. I walked into a cute little shop that had great staff and funny regulars. The woman behind the counter handed me spoon after spoon of flavors to help me find the perfect scoop. I ended up getting one scoop of the bacon brittle and a scoop of the salted caramel.... Heaven. I can guarantee this will be a staple in my list of foods i crave. bottom line: Get your a** in here
