I'm a fan of the Zipps on Greenway so, naturally, I'm a fan of this location automatically. The golden wings are so bomb dot com that we visited Zipps 3 times in one weekend when our friends were in town. They loved them just as much as we do. Plus, it's a great place to hang out and grab some drinks. Throw some shuffleboard in there and you're good to go. The night we went to this particular location we had great service and she was pleasant throughout despite our table growing in size with each new friend that arrived. Sorry sweetie...but thanks for keeping up! Great place for a casual dinner and grabbing drinks. Don't forget their awesome late night happy hour!
