After viewing Yelp for many years I finally decided to start an account of my own and enter the wonderful world of review writing. What better restaurant to start with then my absolute fav, The Cornish Pasty. I live in San Diego and every time I come to Tempe it's always an absolute stop! Their menu is large and diverse and can please anyone! My favorite part is the vegetarian options that are amazing, even if you are not vegetarian. I have gone probably 5-10 times and every time try something new and love it. I have looked for places that sell Cornish Pasties in other locations over the U.S. although have not been successful. I wish I could wrap this place up, put it in my pocket, and take it with me on all my travels! 

P.S- the PBJ dessert is AMAZING!
