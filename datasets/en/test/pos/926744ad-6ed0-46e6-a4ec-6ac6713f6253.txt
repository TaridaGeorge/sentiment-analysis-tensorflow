I found this bar to be great little gem hidden in the middle of the city.   Huge selection of (a lot of local) beers, great food from wings, shrimp, salads and unusual dishes like pea guacamole! 

Staff were friendly and quick service.   They have 2 full bars and one half bar at the back.  Seating is scarce but comfy.  Music system is great and plenty of room for dancing!
