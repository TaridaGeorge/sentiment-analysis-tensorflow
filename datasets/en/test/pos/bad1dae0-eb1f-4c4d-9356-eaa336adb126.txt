Roberts catered our sons wedding on the 24th of September 2011 and they were a hit! It was an Italian wedding on the grooms side and we the kids choose an Italian menu it was awesome! The staff worked closely with my daughter in law and the service was flawless . The cake was the best too! Affordable stayed within budget! Thanks Robert for everything!
