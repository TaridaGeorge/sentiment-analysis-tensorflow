I love this place. They know me, I know them AND they never get lost on the way to my house.

And just today the delivery dude made a special trip to get me a two-liter of Diet Coke with me asking or him charging. That ROCKS.

Their thin crust pizza fills me up while their regular crust leaves me with enough leftovers for another meal. Sure, it's not the BEST pizza in town, but it's sure as hell the quickest and most convenient.

I am upset at the loss of their five-topping, $11.99 large special. It has since been amended to $12.99 with a two-liter soda, but they DON'T CARRY DIET COKE , which annoys me all to hell.

Well-run, quick and always piping hot. Open fairly late too.
