The Coffee Shop is my favorite coffee shop in the valley, though I more often go to Coffee Rush.  There's now a plant nursery happening on the outdoor patio, which has been modestly expanded to include more seats among the plants in partial shade.  Excellent no-hassle wifi.  The Caramel Deluxe is delicious hot and iced.
