The restaurant was nearly empty when my friend and I went for dinner and wine on a Tuesday night.  It must be the recession...  We each got the suggested three dishes.  They are not at all small compared to other tapas places.  We had the fried goat cheese, butternut squash ravioli, braised short rib, sea scallops, ahi tuna, and clams.  They have a big wine list.  I am not a wine aficionado, but I enjoyed my glass.  The wait was experienced and coursed out our food for us.  For dessert, we had the creme brulee tasting spoons which was awesome.  Overall, a great meal with great service in a nicely decorated restaurant.  More people should go!
