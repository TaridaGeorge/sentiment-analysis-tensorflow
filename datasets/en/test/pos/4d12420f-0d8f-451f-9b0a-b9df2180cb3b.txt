As far as I'm concerned, this is the only place to go in the Valley for good looking, comfortable shoes at a fair price when you have hard to fit feet. I have been shopping here for over a decade, and the customer service has always been outstanding. Not only am I a teacher, but I also have MS, so wearing bad shoes during the day can mean an evening of excruciating pain. Whenever I wear shoes I got at Otherwides, I can be guaranteed a more comfortable day and decreased need for pain management at night. Don't forget to check the back room for clearance deals!
