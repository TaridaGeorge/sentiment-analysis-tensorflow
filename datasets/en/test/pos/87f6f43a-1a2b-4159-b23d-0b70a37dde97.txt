Here this afternoon to try the eggs benedict with spam! That's right SPAM! Oh yeah, it was pretty darn good.

Although my dish was good some minor improvements can be made to make it perfect; toast the muffin more, mine was hardly toasted at all and the hollidase sauce needs a little more pizzaz, it was on the bland side. 

Overall, I really like the food here, both brunch and dinner, love the location and atmosphere, great patio, and pretty decent servers. 

PS. Dog friendly patio!
