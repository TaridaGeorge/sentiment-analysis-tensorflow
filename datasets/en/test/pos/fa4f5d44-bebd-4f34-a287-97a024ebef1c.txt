So sad, so very sad...
Even with consistent 4 star reviews on Yelp, Soma Express could not survive on the Camelback Corridor!  

I went by for lunch today as I was craving their mirin soy glazed turkey salad and Soma's yummy baked sweet potato fries.  I can almost smell those fries as I am walking to the door... only to see a sign that says they are CLOSED!

Rumor has it they are building a new Soma Express somewhere in Old Town, but until then, I guess I'll just have to make the trek to the original Soma at Tatum and Shea!
