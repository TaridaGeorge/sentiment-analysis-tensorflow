Located inside Dillards at PV mall, this is the closest MAC to me and what a gem. There always has always staff available to help me out with refilling make-up I'm out of or to apply something off their new line. They have everything an actual MAC store would have so don't be shy to visit this location. Staff is very friendly and talented and the space they occupy is always clean. 
Yeah MAC!
