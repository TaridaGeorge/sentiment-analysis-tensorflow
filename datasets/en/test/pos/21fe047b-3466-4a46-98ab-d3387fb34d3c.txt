Mi Cocina was a nice change of pace from the run of the mill, wannabe authentic Mexican food dives in Phoenix.  This place serves Ecuadorian cuisine, which is so different and delicious.  The spicy carne steak was tender and flavorful and made a nice contrast to the crispy plaintains and beans on the plate.  I am normally wary of seafood here in the desert, but the ceviche was flavorful.

I urge Phoenicians to give this place a try!  It would be a shame to see such a delicious, non-chain establishment go out of business!
