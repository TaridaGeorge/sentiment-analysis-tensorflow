What a fabulous day. We arrived at the start to avoid parking chaos, long food lines and of course to get first dibs on the goodies. So much fun stuff! Terrific samples from Humble Pie, Postino, St. Francis, Pizza People and Green. It was like free lunch! Washed it down with a lovely taste of Souvia Tea while listening to live music in the sunshine. Terrific afternoon.

I came home with a whole boat load of soap from Strawberry Hedgehog, free samples for my pooch including about 6 packets of dog food and 9 different treats, plus many more coupons in the free tote to dole out during post-Fall Festival holiday shopping. This felt like such a warm and friendly community gathering. It's like Phoenix is bucking up and generating a real local scene! Love it and can't wait for next year's festival.
