Eggs scrambled with jalapenos! Need I say more! They were spicey hot and I loved them. I had the Belgian Buckwheat waffles and they were cooked to my specs ... crispy on the outside with butter to smother and it was heaven! Coffee was nice. Sun was warming us to a crisp while we waited but it was all worth the wait. You need to go to know!
