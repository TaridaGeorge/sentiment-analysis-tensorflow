I absolutely LOVE this place. Their pizza is in my top 3 as far as the selection in Arizona, and the ONLY downside is that the Tempe location (to my knowledge) still doesn't have any of the pasta dishes that some of the other locations have. The crust is always perfect, the sauce is sweet but with just the right amount of spice to it, and the cheese and toppings are flawless. On top of having some of the best pizza in town, their customer service is top-notch. If you haven't tried Spinato's yet, put it on your to-do list!
