The best. Hands down. Cash ONLY.

Pros:

-Owner is very experienced, knows his stuff. He fixed the clasp on one watch in under 5 mins and cleaned it for me. Replaced the battery in another and polished it for me too :-)
-VERY reasonable prices.
-Honest. I haven't found anyone like him in CA, and I'm super picky.

Cons:

-None. 

Verdict:

He is the only person I will have service my timepieces from now on. He is extremely knowledgable.
