In LA we had fro Yo shops everywhere.  You get to know the difference between good and bad fro Yo.  Although this place only has 8? flavors they use high quality machines and yogurt mix. None of that powder stuff.  Original Tart and fresh fruit works for me. If you want to go for the entertainment and social factor there are other places, but if you just want good yogurt this works.
