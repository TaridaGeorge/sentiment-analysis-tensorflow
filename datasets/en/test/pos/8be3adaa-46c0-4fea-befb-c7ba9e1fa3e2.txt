This is a great place to seal deals of all sorts. IE, if your lady isn't putting out, this is a great way to say "pretty pretty please" without actually having to grovel. 

I am a lady, so, you know, I know this ploy works.

I was impressed by the whole package. There were minor setbacks that were resolved above my expectations; when we couldn't locate our waiter and asked a back server to assist, he was eager to do so. This is unusual, as any type of back service (bar back, back server, et cetera) is rarely empowered to give first-hand help and are typically instead instructed to alert the server. So this was a delightful touch.

The food was wonderful and very multi-dimensional. The wine list was extensive and the drink selection was great, too. 

Great cigar selection, too!
