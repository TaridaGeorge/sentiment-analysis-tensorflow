This is an experience, more than a restaurant.  I've lived in Italy; I've taste the best pizzas of Rome and Naples, and the not so great pizzas of Bologna and Venice.  To me, the genius of the parmesan, pistacchio, rosemary, and red onion pizza captures the simplicity of Italy in a completely innovative way.  I love the wait for a table and the fact that the same woman politely answers every inquiry about how much longer it will be.  I recommend bringing home extra pizzas to eat the next day.  It is as good reheated as it is in the restaurant.
