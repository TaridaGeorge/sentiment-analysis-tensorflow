What a wonderful dining experience.  After having to cut out dairy, soy, nuts, eggs and gluten from my diet because of some allergies I thought eating out would forever be painful and tasteless.  However Atlas Bistro saved the day!  The server actually took the menu and highlighted the items that were compatible with my diet.  Then once the food arrived it was delicious!  I didn't feel like I was missing out on a thing.  I would highly recommend this restaurant to those who are looking for a vegan, or lactose free, or gluten free dining experience.  Not to mention my husband has none of these restrictions and enjoyed his food just as much.
