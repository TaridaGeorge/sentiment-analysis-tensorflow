A girlfriend came in from out of town and we decided to treat ourselves to a weekend stay at this posh resort and did we ever enjoy ourselves!
We stayed in one of the delectable suites with full living room, dining room, etc. etc.~ the only regret was that we didn't call some of our friends and had a party in our casita while we were there!
Everything was perfect, we enjoyed ourselves playing tennis, taking classes at the fitness center, dining at Elements and treating ourselves to massages at the spa.
Aaaahhhh!
