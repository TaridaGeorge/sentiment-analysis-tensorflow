I've only been here once, but what's better after a night out in old town than fried chicken?

I'm not a big gravy person, but it tasted great with the chicken and waffles.  We also got the red velvet cake to go and it was quite good.  Very moist!

I want to try some other things here too, but how can you not order their signature chicken and waffles every time?
