Our first time at BLD was tonight (11/15/11) and it was absolutely FABULOUS!  Rick was our server - everything went perfectly. Since it was our first time, I took some suggestions from him and I am very glad I did!  I had the braised short ribs with Parmesan Risotto...(if you have never tried it...it is a MUST!!)

The service was very good, the food even better!  I am glad that Chandler is starting to get some really good places to eat like BLD.  I highly suggest that you go.

Loved the decor, atmosphere, and everything about it...can't wait to go back!
