I went to The Living Room as a result of a Groupon. They had recently opened, and the reviews for the Chandler location were excellent, so I was intrigued. Plus, it's a wine bar, and my boyfriend loves wine :-)
The menu is a lot more extensive than the one on-line.
I had half of steak sandwich and the butternut squash soup: both delicious! I paired them with a glass of Grenache. I'm still a newbie when it comes to the art of wine, so I can't accurately rate it, but I thought it went well with my dinner.
The atmosphere is relaxed, they have a bar, tables and couches. The waiter was attentive and presented us with tastings of the wines we were interested in. He also made recommendations.

For the price, I thought everything was excellent. I look forward to going back.
