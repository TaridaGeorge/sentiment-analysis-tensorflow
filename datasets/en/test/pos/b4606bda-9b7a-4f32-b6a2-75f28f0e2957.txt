My favorite restaurant in Phoenix. The old ratpack style atmosphere and gathering of local business leaders along with politicos just adds to the fun. Unlike most of the new steakhouses along the Camelback/Biltmore corridor, Durant's is not pretentious. In fact, I've even walked in after golfing while still wearing shorts and a windshirt and received great service. While not inexpensive, you also won't pay an arm and a leg for a steak at Durant's like some of the newer places. Don't want dinner or by yourself, hang out at the bar and have a martini - they know how to make 'em!
