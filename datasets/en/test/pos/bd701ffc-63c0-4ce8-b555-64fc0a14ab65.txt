I can't really say enough about Liberty Market. The place is beautiful, comfortable, friendly and the service is awesome. I haven't had anything that I didn't like. From the wood fired pizza to the delectable salads, everything on the menu is worth every penny. For me though, it's all about the Cortadito (espresso drink) and the pastries. These are completely off the chart awesome! You simply MUST try them!

Another great plus to this place is that on just about any given day, you can visit and see Joe (the owner), hanging out, chatting with customers and all around having a great time. Joe is truly one of the nicest and most sincere people I have ever met. Makes Liberty Market all the more worth visiting.

Oh! As weird as it sounds, you have to check out the bathrooms, they are the best I have ever seen. (seriously)
