Umm...... Yes. If you are looking at these reviews trying to decide if you should go there, yes.

As long as you like interesting cuisines and you aren't afraid to try something new, this place is great! Everything I had was delicious but the best part was that it was so many delicious flavors all put into a dish, making it beyond delicious. I recommend the fried yucca as an appetizer, it is so interesting and unique, yet slightly similar to potatoes.
Put Mimita's on your list and make sure to try them soon, it's a great place.
