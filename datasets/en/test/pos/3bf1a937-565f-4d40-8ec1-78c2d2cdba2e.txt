What's most notable about Changing Hands is all the well known authors they've had for speaking engagements/book signings. The list is quite impressive! 

The frequent stamp cards are nice, as are the great selection of books, but I find myself drifting over to the gift section more often than not. I especially like their great selection of unique cards, hand painted wooden things, bookmarks, beautiful journals, and Solari bells. I think I've spent just as much on cute little things for myself as I have books!
