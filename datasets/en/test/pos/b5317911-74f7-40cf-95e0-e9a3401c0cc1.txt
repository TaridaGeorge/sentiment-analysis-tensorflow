I legitimately have not had such amazing waffles before. They are not super huge, thick and cake-y like some places that make waffles, which I like. The such a have a great cinnamon/vanilla flavor. The fried chicken has a great flavor. Have had lived in Louisiana for a while, I've missed some really great flavored fried chicken and Lolo's is amazing. The side of corn bread I got was really sweet and a huge portion for only $1 extra. The wait staff on the other had was sub par. It almost seemed like they were short handed. We didn't really have a consistent waitress/waiter which was annoying, just random people coming by bringing us stuff and refilling out drinks. All in all it was great food and worth the drive from Mesa.
