Owners here are great and why not support a local business.  I try to stop in here as much as possible instead of Circle K or any other gas station in the neighborhood.  It is a convenience store, not a grocery store but they have a great selection of random items you need at the last minute.  The owners are always friendly and remember what I order which is pretty impressive.  I once bought an item there that was freezer burnt and they happily offered to give me my money back and told me to pick anything in the store I wanted for the inconvenience.  Now thats good business!
