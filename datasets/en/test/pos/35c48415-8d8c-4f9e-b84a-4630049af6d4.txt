Snap, so you want to be an organic grower.

I'm a private gardner. I specialize in peppers, tomatoes, beans, onions, mint. A variety of herbs. I call this a healing garden. I cultivate. Being able to resurrect heirloom vegetables is not only trending but it's being part of the greater interest in growing and eating locally grown foods that are revolutionizing our culinary scene. Many local restaurants are buying farmers market produce. 

The real secret to growing is water and living earth. This should not be confused with hose water and dirt. Learning about modern growing techniques such as brewing tea, Alaskan compost, guano, microorganisms in the living soil and amendments will give you bigger and healthier yields.
