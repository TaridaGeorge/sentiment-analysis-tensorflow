During the recent hard freeze, our heating system didn't seem to be working properly. We called this company and they were slammed because of the weather.  They promised to come out - and they did.  It was in the evening and well past their normal hours, but the owner showed up and took care of the issue.  He had the house warming up in no time.  Excellent customer service.
