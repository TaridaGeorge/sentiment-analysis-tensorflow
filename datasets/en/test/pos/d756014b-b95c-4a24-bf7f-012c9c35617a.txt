mmmmm... perfect place for dessert.

Was looking for some dessert and a good coffee and stumbled across this place.  They have a whole case of fresh homemade dessert.   They are so tasty.  Almond cake, tiramasu, tarts, etc. etc.

They also make real Italian machiatos, and they are delicious.  The owners work there and talk with you.  They also have some imported Italian products you can buy.  I'll need to try dinner from here, but as a late night stop for dessert and a coffee.  Amazing.

My fiance gets the hot chocolate and its just as good.  Creamy not made from powder goodness.
