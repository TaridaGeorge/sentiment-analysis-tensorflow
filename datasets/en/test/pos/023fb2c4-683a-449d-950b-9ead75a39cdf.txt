Hands down the best cupcakes in the Phoenix market. Tammie Coe comes in second with the coconut but sometimes it's not as fresh as it could be at LGO. Milk chocolate is great, taste a sprinkle - it's really chocolate not wax. I had salted caramel it was wonderful. Dark chocolate is decadent. I did try the red velvet and it was good but I'm done trying to understand red velvet. I just don't get it.
