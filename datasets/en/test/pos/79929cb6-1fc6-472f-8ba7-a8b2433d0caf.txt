Amazing!!!! The best coffee I have ever tasted, and the best chai I have ever tasted.  I had been wanting to try it out, and I picked my Uncle up from the airport and he wanted some coffee, so I knew I wanted to come here... My Uncle (AKA Funkle - funny Uncle) is diabetic, so he wanted some splenda with his breve (if that is how it is spelt), and the guy said they try and make the coffee good enough that it doesn't need sugar, he was RIGHT!! I was the best coffee I have ever tasted.  You can tell they know what they are doing and are passionate about it.  I will be here ever time I'm on this side of town!!
