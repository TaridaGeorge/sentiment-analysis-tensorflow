My kind of bar! I'm not exactly sure how to describe it, but it's kind of like a classy dive bar. Eclectic crowd with a very casual but not gross feel to it. They have a wide selection of beers (always a plus) and also have live music quite often. Their patio area is very nice and I love any bar that has a rooftop portion to enjoy a beverage with a friend and look around the beauty of Scottsdale. It's a nice gem in the desert.
