This is probably the best place to get brisket in Arizona and in line quality-wise with the best places I've had in Texas. I do a lot of BBQ and eat a lot of BBQ and these guys clearly know what they're doing. The sausages (both the regular and hot) are great, creamed corn is awesome, and pecan pie is sooooo good. It's easily worth the trip down there. Just make sure you bring cash.
