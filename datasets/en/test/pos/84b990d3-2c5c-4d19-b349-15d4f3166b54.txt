This is truly some great barbecue!!!  My family and I have eaten there 4 times in the last two weeks (It has only been open since 6/21/2012).  Every item we try is wonderful!!!  I would suggest the Baked Potato Salad, waffle fries and the onion tanglers.  For the meats, go for the brisket, pulled pork, ham and turkey.  You have 3 choices of BBQ sauce, Original, sweet and spicy.  They are all good.  The meats are juicy and they come without sauce added so you can add as little or as much as you want.  With your meal you get all-you-can-eat pickles and soft-serve.

Kids eat free on Sunday when you dine in.
