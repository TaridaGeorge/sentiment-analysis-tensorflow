Finally I have found a new brow lady :)  Since my hair dresser/waxing professional did not return to work after having her second baby I have been searching for someone in Scottsdale that can do decent brow waxing...the search is over!!!

Laura is great - very professional.  Took the time to show me what she was going to do and the results couldn't have been better.  I will be booking with her regularly.

Thank you Laura from another satisfied customer.
