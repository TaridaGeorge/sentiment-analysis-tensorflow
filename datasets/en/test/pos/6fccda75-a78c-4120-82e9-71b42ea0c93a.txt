So bummed tonight was the last night~(Mike Nielsen is to blame)
They went out with a bang! Great memories and I hope more to come!
Jamie our server was fantastic! (She will now need a job) 
Hopefully the owners will find a new location and be open for breakfast! Bomberos is close to home and the only true slice of coolness to bless North Central.
