I love Ranch Market. The atmosphere is very festive and the pricing is competitive (especially produce!). The grocery area is pretty basic but there are a variety of specialty items throughout the store. The lines for meals and sweets are usually pretty packed, so next time I'm not in a rush I'd like to stop for a bite.
