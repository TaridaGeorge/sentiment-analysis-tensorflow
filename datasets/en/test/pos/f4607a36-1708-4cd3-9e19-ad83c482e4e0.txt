I have been going here for about a year to get facials. I joined the membership club for $59 a month to get my skin in shape for my wedding. I love my facialist Holly! She is great and very personable. Its a fun experience. This is the first time I have every committed to a spa to get facials. The people are nice and its a very girly atmosphere which I like.  Thanks Fuschia for the great experience! And my skin is looking alot better. Thanks Holly!
