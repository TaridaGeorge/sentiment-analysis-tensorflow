This is a wonderful gaming store. I have met so many really close friends here, and I would like to consider the owner one of them. He is awesome and really takes time to listen to his gamers. The atmosphere here is one that inspires friendship and good nature, not drama and rumors.

I spend entirely too much money here, everything is priced well ...and I love board games. Add those two together and I believe at last count our collection is over 300?

All of my kids feel welcome even my little one (almost 2). We love to come in here for Thursday Game Night and they also have it on Sundays. 

Highly recommended for anyone who loves miniature gaming, role playing, and board gaming. Manawerx right next door has all of the card games you could ever want as well!
