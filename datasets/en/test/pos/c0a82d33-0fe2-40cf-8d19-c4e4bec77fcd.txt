Wow...this place is fantastic in every way!  The atmosphere is sleek, modern, warm, and gorgeous.  The staff is very friendly.  And the food...amazing.  I've been there for lunch, happy hour, and dinner.  All the meals I've had were prepared perfectly, and every dish was outstanding.  I particularly liked the catfish dish (don't know the real name of it) and the garlic noodles with clams dish.  The signature cocktails were nice, and the Thai iced coffee was smooth and tasty!
