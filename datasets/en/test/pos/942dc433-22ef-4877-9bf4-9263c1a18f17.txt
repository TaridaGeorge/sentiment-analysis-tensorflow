Fresh fresh fresh.  And tasty!  We had oysters on the half shell with a shrimp/onions and avocado.  WOW!  My husband had a chili relleno with shrimp and I had a combination seafood cocktail.  The flavors were fresh and good.  Free cup of seafood soup, also wonderful.  I don't usually hand out 5 stars, but this one is worth it.
