Trader Joe's is one of those grocery stores that have a variety of difference foods that you can choose from.   I like shopping at Trader Joe's because the grocery store is small and the prices are great. They have the best spaghetti sauce too.  I only buy my spaghetti sauce at Trader Joe's.  The staff is great and there is never a line when I'm checking out.
