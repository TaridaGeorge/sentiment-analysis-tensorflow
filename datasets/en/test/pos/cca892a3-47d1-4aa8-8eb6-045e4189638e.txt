Lots of gems in this joint. I found a Mac-Dre-driving-a-school-bus xxl t-shirt (i'll probably never wear this, but for $3 what the hell), a hat that said "creative devotions" in old english, a native american shirt which I wear probably ever other day (dont ask why), an odd picture of a giant goldfish peering at a kitten in a goldfish bowl (the cat is in the bowl, shit is mindblowing), and a picture of an obese black woman with a hawaii tattoo on her sleeveless arm in a picture frame made of fuzzy leopard print. Its probably the best thrift store in the Phx area, I would hit this spot up for sure.
