I've followed Keli from her previous wax studio to her new location. She opened her own mini spa in Salon 3121. 

I live between Phoenix, San Francisco and  Los Angeles. It's always difficult to find a good service professional. I have found the previous professionals didn't match up to my LA and SF girls. I went through four different estheticians before luckily landing Keli. She's detailed, fast, clean and a total professional. She also uses hard wax is easier on the skin. Almost pain free. I wish I could move her to LA! 

Since she's her own boss, her prices are great too. I have finally found someone in Phoenix that I trust for my skin care.
