I love this place.  If it were up to me it would be the only place I'd ever go to happy hour.  The place has a nice atmosphere and it clean with plenty of TVs around the bar area.  They have a reasonable selection on their menu and the food is fine considering it is mostly bar food and that is all I expect.  

To really love this place though, you have to know it is all about the beer.  They have a huge selection, frequently changing it up, and throw special events when they bring in new ones.  I have not found another place that is really into their beers like the Monk and that is reason enough for me to give them my business.
