My exfiance took me to this place because he knew how much I just love Salvadorean food!  The popusas were delicious and seriously cheap! Very satisfying!  Try their horchata it's to die for!  My ex had their tamales and he said they were very good.  Everything on the menu is delicious.  If Im ever in town again this is where I will go. :)
