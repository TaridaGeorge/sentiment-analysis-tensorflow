Seriously. Modern Steak may be my new favorite place to eat. 

Ive only been for lunch so far, still need to do dinner there. 

Once again Eric was our waiter and he was just amazing and remembered us from the shower we had been to a few months prior. 

The food was just beyond perfect! 

My one "complaint" the hostesses wear very very short dresses. Like inappropriately short. Other then that this place can do no wrong in my eyes.
