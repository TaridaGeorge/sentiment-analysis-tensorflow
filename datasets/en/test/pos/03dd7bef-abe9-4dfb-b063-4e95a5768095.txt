As with all TJ locations I've patroned thus far, AZ's is no different, except for ONE thing...

They have MINI shopping carts for kids.  OMG!!!  SO freakin' cute.  I never gush over mini-monsters, but I was seriously drooling over the tikes!!!  

Discovered some MORE goodies:
* Fage Greek Yogurt, this stuff is YUM, super thick, less sugar & cals than regular yogurt
* Carrot Apple Juice, mmm...too bad the company is discontinuing the stuff
* Mango Nectarines, exotic, love that, they are mating everything these days!
* Asian Beef salad, lean beef, with cabbage, light & nutty dressing

TJ's is always consistently GREAT, and this one has an abundance of checkers!
