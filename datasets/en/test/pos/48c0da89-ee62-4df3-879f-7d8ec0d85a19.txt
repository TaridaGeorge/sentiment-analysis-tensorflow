I firmly believe they have the best hummus around. I know people love Pita Jungle's hummus, but that is nothing compared to this creamy goodness! I don't think have ever had hummus so creamy and smooth. I have eaten here a few times and it has been delicious, but honestly I prefer just stopping in on my way home and picking up a container of hummus and homemade arabic pita bread (also super delicious and soft!). I highly recommend it!
