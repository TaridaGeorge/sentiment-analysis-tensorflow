My company recently used the Rancho as an incentive trip for our outstanding employee awards. We had 14 people from the company and their guests/spouses attend and without exception everyone thought this was one of the best incentive trips we have ever done. There is truly something for everyone.  Many people golfed, almost everyone rode the horses, we had a team penning contest and a cowboy olympics event for our group that was a huge hit.  The meals were good, rooms were terrific and the staff was friendly. Several people told me that they were going to go back to the rancho with their friends and family in the future. Unfortunately our company does not repeat it's incentive destinations but if we ever decide to repeat...we'll definitely come back to the rancho.
