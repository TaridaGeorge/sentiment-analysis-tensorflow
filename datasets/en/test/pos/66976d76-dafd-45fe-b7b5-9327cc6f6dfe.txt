Yep, I heart LGO too. I have been know to drive from Tempe to satisfy my ceasar salad craving. Theirs really is the best I've had. Also, the tasty morsels they have in the front glass case are a huge hit wherever I bring them. The cupcakes from Tammie Coe (best birthday cakes .......also does wedding cakes etc and can make them look like your favorite Chanel bag or Jimmy Choos ...(WHO CAN DO IT? Tammie CAN!!) My boyfriend said that Tammie Coe is the only woman he'd leave me for.....not Jessica Alba or Gisele. (Maybe I should write a separate review of Tammie Coe Cakes) Anyway, LGO staffers, always efficient, friendly and willing to make your day!
