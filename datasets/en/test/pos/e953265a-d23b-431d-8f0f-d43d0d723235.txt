I have had Mamma Mia's pizza 3 or 4 times now and each time it is as good as the last.  This pizza reminds me of my childhood pizza place in New York.  Thin crust that is well done, light on the sauce, cheese nice and bubbly and brown, and foldable replete with dripping grease.  Just the way a slice should be.  I have yet to try any toppings or a sub, but I am a purist when it comes to pizza and love plain cheese.

Well done Mamma Mia's.  Well done!
