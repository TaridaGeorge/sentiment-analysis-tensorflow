After being disappointed going to the SAS Fabric Apache Blvd. location (disorganized and dirty), I decided to give the SAS Fabric Indian School location a chance.  I'd been there years back and think they remodeled because everything was organized, easy to find, easily priced and very friendly service.  I would highly recommend this location over the other.
