Tutti Santi is a beautiful Italian Restaurant.  one of the only true forms of what Italian should be located here in Phoenix.  I had my first experience at the restaurant on Greenway and 64th for my birthday recently.  I was surprised with the size of the restaurant. Much smaller then what i had anticipated but i loved it.  The small place provided the necessary decor and ambiance to really establish bistro as a fine dining Establishment.   I had the Veal Marsela which i had to say was fantastic.  Just the right amount of sauce to really, and the wine i had went great with the veal.  Everyone that i was with loved the food and our waiter was excellent.  I even had the host i believe its the owners mother sing me happy birthday in Italian.  I love the place 5stars. HIGHLY RECOMMEND
