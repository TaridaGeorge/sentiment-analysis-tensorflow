This review is strictly for the bar area/menu.

We went to a Yelp event here last week and decided to stick around in the bar w/ some friends afterwards.

The bar menu is pretty diverse and a LOT easier on the wallet than the actual restaurant. Our bartender Angie (who was awesome BTW) insisted we get the popovers. Holy cow! Those things were huge (thats what she said)! And oh so delicious. We also munched on the bacon salted (?) nuts and special popcorn. Also, delicious.

Loved that they also had a good selection of local beers.

Surprisly chill atmoshere and great, friendly staff. Try the HH menu.
