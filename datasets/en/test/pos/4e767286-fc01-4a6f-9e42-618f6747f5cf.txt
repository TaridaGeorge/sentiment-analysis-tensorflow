I want to make sweet love to their beans!!!!  PoaF is a very small place that is easily missed. But, take the time to find it and you will be VERY happy! The prices are reasonable and the portions are large. we have gone to Dillion's for years and like it very much, but PoaF is the real deal. The brisket has a black char on the outside- just as it should. The sweet potato fries are thick and full of flavor. And the beans.... So much flavor and large chunks of pork in them........  Go! Now! Run!! 

Update......  And now they have thick, rich, creamy mac and cheese!!!!!!  Run faster!!! Now!!
