What a great way to watch a movie!! We got to do the dinner theater, which cost $12 per ticket. Huge oversized stuffed chairs, great service. They, suprisingly, had a great well rounded menu for food and a full bar. I didn't have any drinks, but I did snag  an order of fish and chips with an ice tea that was perfect while watching a good movie. All in all, super fan!!!
