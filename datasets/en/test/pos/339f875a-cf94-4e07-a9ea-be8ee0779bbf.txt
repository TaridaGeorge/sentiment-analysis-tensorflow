The PHX legend Dan Marjerle keeps on going with another solid restaurant. Great location. Food is very good and fresh. Started out with the gorilla wings and they were good. Be sure to get the secret sauce. There was four us and two got the all-star burger and two got the Asian chicken salad. Both were very good portions and quality meals. Capped it with a nice beer from the wide selection and you can't go wrong. Many tv's so you don't miss a game with variety of music playing in the background but not too loud. Service was very good and friendly. Definitely will be coming back to this spot again!
