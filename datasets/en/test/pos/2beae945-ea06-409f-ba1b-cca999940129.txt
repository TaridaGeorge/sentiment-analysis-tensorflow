Love the ambiance of Durant's.  Like the rest of the reviews mention, think mafioso.  Think Mad Men.  Think old school Phoenix.  The lighting is dark, the wall paper is red velvet, and the entrance is through the kitchen.  Marvelous.

The food and drinks weren't bad either!  I had one cosmo that put me at just the right "level," which I'm not sure if that says more about Durant's or my ability to handle alcohol.  In any case, the drinks were great.  I also had a New York strip, which was cooked at a perfect medium as ordered.  

To sum it all up, the mood of Durant's prompted my boyfriend to propose to me at the end of the night.  Can you say romance?
