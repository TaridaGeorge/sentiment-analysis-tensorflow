I've been hearing about Don and Charlies since I was young enough to still be zipping around Scottsdale scaring the horses with my dirt bike (back when both horses and dirt bikes were common in Scottsdale).

I have been asked many times for directions to the place but never went myself, until recently.

I loved it. It has a large bar area where we sat and it had sports jerseys and other sports stuff hanging from the walls, and both the staff and patrons were friendly. For my girlfriend and I to have dinner and drinks it came to about 120 dollars and the food, of course, was great.

You better either come early, late, or make reservations though. It was busy on the Saturday around 8 when we were there but cleared out some around 9.
