Don't let the fact that this restaurant is located in a casino deter you!! There is nothing cheesy or "restaurant casino" about it! I'm talking primarily about the food. Service is good. Restaurant setting, nice. Seating, plenty. Blah Blah Blah. Anyway! The menu is very creative for Asian food. I love the pepper steak prepared with friend rice, asparugus and mushrooms. We ordered the sampler appetizer with the traditional pot stickers, crab wontons and coconut shrimp. It was delish! The menu is fun and extensive. F'in loaded sliders, the F stands for filet mignon. They have lunch portions which helps since the food is a little pricey. But I am a firm believer in you pay for what you get! This is definitely one of my favorite Chinese places ever!
