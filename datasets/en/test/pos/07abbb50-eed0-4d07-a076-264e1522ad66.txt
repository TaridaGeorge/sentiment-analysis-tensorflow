No pun intended, but this place ROCKS! This is not your average museum. This is all about musical instruments from all over the world. Upon entering the buildings grounds, you'll notice how modern this place is. Upon paying inside (Free if you carry a BofA Debit card) you are given a listening device that picks up a remote signal at each country's display so you can hear the music that is produced by those who play them. Each viewing area has video to show you the people who play these devices. It's amazing to see the craftsmanship and thought that went into so many of these devices.
This is a walking museum, so wear comfortable shoes. Also, if you have small children, please let them know that since the instruments are exposed, that touching is a no-no.
Very cool place! Very impressed.
