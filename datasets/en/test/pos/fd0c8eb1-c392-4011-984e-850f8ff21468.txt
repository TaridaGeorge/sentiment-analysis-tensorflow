Baby Kays and Pappadeaux's are the only real Cajun restaurants in the valley. All else I've tried including Cajun Seafood Corner, Voodoo Daddy's, and Ches Moneaux are posers only. They only WISH they served the quality Cajun cuisine that these restaurants serve day in and day out. My favorite item on the menu for Baby Kay's is the crawfish ettouffee. I've also had the red beans and rice. It is VERY GOOD. Couple the food with live entertainment on the weekend and you've got a recipe for a Cajun good time! Laissez Les Bon Temps Roullette!
