I love this store. We just moved to Phoenix last week and have been 3 times. I was hoping we would live near a Whole Foods or Trader Joe's, we lucked out being right around the corner from Sunflower Farmers Market. The prices are extremely reasonable and the bulk bin lets you buy just what you'll need.

Not sure why many of the reviews mentioned hippies. I don't care who shops there or who works there as long as they are polite and professional. SFM has excellent customer service.
