The decor of Greekfest was great and really gave the feeling of being in a restaurant on one of the Greek islands.  We had the Spanakopites and Arnopites for appetizers and they were wonderful.  Then for dinner we had the Ravioli dish and the stuffed chicken breast dish and they too were out of this world.  Then for dessert, we had the Baklava which is a must for any Greek restaurant and Greekfest's Baklava was really really good.  Overall we had a great experience and can't wait to go back to try other dishes on the menu.
