This is one of the best hotels I've been in - truly a magnificent entrance- the palm trees lining the driveway (and its a long one)- sprawling verdure grass, mixed with the native cacti, fountains and the grand edifice- an adobe styled palace...
The resort features a swimming pool area- that probably occupies half of the property, tennis lessons from renowned players, a spa that caters to the hollywood jet set, and dining experience that rivals any establishment (Mary Elaine's).  There's a ice cream shoppe inside the resort- make sure you stop by on one of those hot hot afternoons!
