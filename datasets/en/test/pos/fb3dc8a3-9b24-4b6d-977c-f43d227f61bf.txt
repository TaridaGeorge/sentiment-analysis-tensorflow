We celebrated our 6 year wedding anniversary last night at the Meling Pot and had a wonderful experience.  It was our first time going and they really did a great job personalizing the experience.  We had a card and flowers waiting for us at our table and the wait staff all congratulated us on our celebration.  That doesn't mean much if the food isn't good but it was deeee-lish!  We had the Big Night Out and was able to customize the menu to our liking.  Although the main entree wasn't much more than a glorified hot pot at a Chinese restuarant, it was still awesome.  You can't go wrong with dipping your appetizer in melted cheese and your desserts in chocolate.  We would definitely go there again!
