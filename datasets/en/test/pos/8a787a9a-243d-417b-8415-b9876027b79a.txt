I just moved here from SD and this is the first place Ive found with the slightest hint of authenticity or originality.

The servers are tastefully rude in a way that is amusing and contributes to the dark atmosphere. Everything inside is dark, old, and antiquely, which together with the black and white gothic portraits an candlestick lighting makes you feel like you're in an alfred hitchcock movie.

The food is outstanding. I had some kind of mexican food pasty and every bite was delicious. If you've never been here and are a fan of anything alternative or outside of the box, I highly recommend you try this restaurant.
