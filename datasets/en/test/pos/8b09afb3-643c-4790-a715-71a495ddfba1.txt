The bar gets 3.5 stars...good prices, decent atmosphere and cute bartenders who make some kick ass drinks...the full 5 stars actually goes to the Taco stand that they have, their stuff is the best, no matter how hard i try at home my stuff doesnt taste like theirs, I wish they had a bigger meat selection, but the food they do make is amazing, sober or drunk =-)
