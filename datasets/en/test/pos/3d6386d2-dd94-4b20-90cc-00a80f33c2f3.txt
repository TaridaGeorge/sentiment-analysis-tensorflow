Any grocery store I can walk into wearing a green fairy costume (wings, glitter and all) and buy nothing but a bottle of rum and 2 cans of Redi Whip and get treated with nothing but respect is awesome in my eyes.

They usually have good deals, and the staff is friendly when approached.  The store is large, but usually well stocked and clean.  I love that they have the self service checkout, I prefer to bag my own groceries, and this is often faster than standing in line for a checker.
