Of the 4 stadiums I visited this week, this one was my favorite. The Angels do run a first class organization and this stadium gives you that impression along with the staff. I made my way up here to watch my Rockies take on the Angels and with hopes of watching Vlad Guererro play, but that didnt happen. Too bad the Rockies lost and too bad the Rockies have to play at Hi Corbett after visiting this ballpark.
