I would say they have earned my business for life, but it doesn't feel like business when you're treated like a friend. The ambiance, charm and quirkiness of this place makes one feel right at home. Delicious deli items, an eclectic wine offering and top-notch service make this place my new favorite Valley staple. Great for events! Keep them in mind for your baby shower/bar mitzvah/engagement party etc.
