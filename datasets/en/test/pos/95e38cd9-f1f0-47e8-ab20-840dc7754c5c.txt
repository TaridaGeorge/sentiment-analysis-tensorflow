It's almost not fair to describe a specific meal here because the menu changes and you cannot be assured to find whatever is described; you CAN, however, be assured of finding subtle-yet-dramatic presentation and an outstanding meal. 

I've had wonderful short ribs; fantastic duck; sweet scallops; tried Jerusalem artichokes for the first time in a lovely soup; had to-die-for desserts and phenomenal cheese plates. 

The venue is small and, although attached to a brightly lit wine shop (that now sells some super cool cheeses too), offers an intimate, romantic dinning space. 

This place is in my top 5. 

Heck! Top 3. 

I can't imagine turning down a chance to go here!
