I live down the street from Joe's and eat there frequently for breakfast and lunch.  Breakfast tacos = HEAVEN.... Curry chicken salad sandwich = BLISS....and the Garlic Fries = DE-FREAKING-LICIOUS!!!  Everything on the menu showcases care and incredible flavor.  Don't forget to go next door to the Coffee Shop and try a cupcake and/or coffee!!!
