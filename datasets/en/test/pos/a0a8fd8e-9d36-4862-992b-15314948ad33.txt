My wife and I went there last night for a visit and damn it was worth it! We sat at the bar (tended by one of the best bartenders in the valley) and looked through the menu. He came and chatted with us and dropped a bomb on me. "we're running a special burger tonight, wild boar, bacon, arugula, and brandy aioli." You had me at wild boar my friend! I ordered it with Camembert cheese, medium. My first bite of that burger not only confirmed, but cemented what I already knew: this is the best burger joint in town! Beautifully charred boar was juicy and flavorful, accented with the smokey bacon, peppery arugula, slightly sweet yet balanced brandied aioli, finished with a mellow creaminess of the Camembert. Best burger I have ever, ever, EVER had! Bravo to the chef!
