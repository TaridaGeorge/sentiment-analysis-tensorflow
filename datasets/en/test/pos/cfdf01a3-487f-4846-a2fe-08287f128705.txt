I Called the shop while I was driving to work.  I told Robby that I'm on my way and I need to drop off the car and go to work right away.  He did a great job!   He came out and checked the tire size, I gave him the key and he already had the tires priced out .  I get a call an hour later stating that the car is done.  The service was spectacular, the price was better than competition, and the tires are great.  Thanks Robby and the crew.
