This place is great. Now I would like to qualify my 5 stars. These strip mall nail salons usually suck so bad that 1 star is too many. That being said, as a strip mall nail salon goes, this place is top-notch. But don't go expecting some amazing 5 star spa, you won't get it. What you will get is a clean, sanitized, friendly staff. The guy did my pedicure and it was one of the best I've ever had. My feet & calves were so sore from ballet and now - they feel great! I got gels done, and I will say they aren't really set up to do gel toes. (they are for hands). I wish they had the UV light a little more convenient for feet, I had to get up each time, but otherwise a very pleasant experience for a very stressed woman!
