I'm a huge fan of this joint.  The wine and the food is really good.  I've recently become more adventurous with my food and this has really come in handy when trying their bruschetta.  I've tried almost all of them and they are all pretty good.  I haven't been for their awesome happy hour on Monday's and Tuesday's but it sounds amazing!
