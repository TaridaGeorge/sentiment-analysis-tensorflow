Pro:  selection, quality, service, value

Con: tight on parking

1 of 2 of my 5 star yelp selection thus far.  Family run with great hustle and class.  It's a joint that never disappoints.   Doughboy, do it.  Hard to go wrong here and I've tried all of the sandwiches.  Very good value.   Call ahead or prepare for a wait.  Tight on seating.  I prefer it during off hours to avoid the masses.  Skip the national chains and try this place if you're not yet hooked.
