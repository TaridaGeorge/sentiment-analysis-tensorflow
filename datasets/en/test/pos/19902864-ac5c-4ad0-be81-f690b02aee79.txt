This is the MOST beautiful resort I have ever been to.  The lovely flowered grounds are magical.  If you are even a little stressed, go have a glass of wine in one of the gorgeous gardens...it's almost spiritual.  Very calming and peaceful.  The beauty alone will take you (mentally) somewhere else....Heaven!
