This place is bumpin on the weekends. Great  place to shop for groceries or have lunch. They grill outside, have all kinds of hot entrees inside and a delectable array of pastries. Not to mention the hot-off-the-press corn tortillas.  Know your Spanish when you go, not very many of the staff speak English.
