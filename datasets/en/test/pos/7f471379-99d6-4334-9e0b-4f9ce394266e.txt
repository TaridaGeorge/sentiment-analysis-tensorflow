I feel like I shouldn't even divulge this information, but they had one of their killer sales a couple weekends ago.... everything 40-50% off!!! I finally got the bank of old-school lockers I always dreamed of to use as a bookcase for my front room. My boyfriend was pissed because it was so freaking heavy, but it looks badass!!! LOVE!!!!
