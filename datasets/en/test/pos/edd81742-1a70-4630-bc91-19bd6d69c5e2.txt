Well, I own and operate a carpet cleaning company in the valley and was in a car accident and had a whiplash effect  with some minor annoyance and just wanted to make sure that I was able to get back to normal and not have any effects down the road and they were nothing short of professional and helpful. They took the time to answer any questions I have had, explain things to me in detail and watched out for my well being. They are a well oiled machine there, so many options to help you get back on your feet and back to normal. Dr. Genet and her crew over there is outstanding. Dr. Tom did most of my adjustments and he is great as well. Thanks guys. I will be back for normal adjustments and will refer anyone to you that I hear needs your services.
