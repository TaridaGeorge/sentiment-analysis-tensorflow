I'm sitting in this coffee shop as I write this review... I work from home and was looking for a great place to get out and get some work done.  After trying multiple coffee shops and cafes much further from home, I finally decided to check this place out.  I love it here! I can plug in my laptop in multiple locations, the coffee is excellent (although I don't drink the espressos) and the music is perfect for working, not too loud or distracting.

Great place for me to get my work done! And the baristas here are excellent... the manager remembered me after only being here once before and seems to know every other person that comes in. For Peoria, it's the best I've found.
