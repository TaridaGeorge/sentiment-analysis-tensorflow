YUM! I've heard of See's Candies before going to Scottsdale and now I see why. Delicious. I was overwhelmed by the choices. The quality is incredible. I'm a chocolate lover and have my favorites, and See's just flew to the top. Their peanut butter patties are a must have. At first, I found myself thinking I still liked my classic Reese's cups better, but I find myself craving See's patties now. Too bad I live in Kentucky (but maybe it's a good thing for my waistline). We purchased a 1/2 pound box for around $14 or so. Not too bad!
