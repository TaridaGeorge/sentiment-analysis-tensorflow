Very happy with our first trip here.  Fast, friendly service.  The food was better than expected.  I had the carne adovada breakfast.  Wow!  The meat was moist and tender and perfectly topped with the jalapeno cheese sauce.  Before this I would never have thought to have pulled pork with breakfast.  Yum-my!

Ice cold inside on a hot summer day.   Will definitely be back.
