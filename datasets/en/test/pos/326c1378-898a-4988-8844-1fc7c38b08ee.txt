Brindley's is by far the best music store in the East Valley.  My husband and I have shopped here for years and always come away smiling and talking about how great they are.  We even drove all the way here for services and purchases when we lived in Maricopa - well worth the drive!

Bruce and his staff are amazing and incredibly talented.  They have been setting up my husband's guitars for years and he is always completely happy with the results.  We even tried a different shop a couple of times and quickly returned to Brindley's.  You just can't get better service or a friendlier staff.
