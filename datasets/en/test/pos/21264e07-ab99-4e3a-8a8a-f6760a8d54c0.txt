NYPD Pizza hosted an Ale Unveil event here, and glad they did.. We got a tour of the brewery and seeing where they came up from and where they are headed to is a great story.. The owners and brewers are very hospitable and knowledged in their craft.. I will deffo be returning, and will have to try the Watermelon Ale at least once, out of curiosity..
