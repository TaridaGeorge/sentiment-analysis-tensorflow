Before I moved cross country from Phoenix to Charleston, Zinnia's was my first thought when it came to buying vintage furniture before my move. My living room has a vintage couch, two vintage chairs, coffee table, stands  and tall lamps all from 60's and 70's. I love them!! I miss phoenix, I miss shopping at Zinnia's on Saturday mornings.
