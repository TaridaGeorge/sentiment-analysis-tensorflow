Great place for Sushi, ordered the Musscles ( Caution very large order even with only four) Great wine. Ordered Eel Crunch Roll, Tuna Roll, Soft Shell Crab Roll. All of it was to die for. A little Gem.  Pricing is competitive not high or low. Environment is pleasant, service was wonderful and waitress was very helpful with suggestions and information.
