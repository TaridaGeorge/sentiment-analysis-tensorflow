I came here with a Groupon for the first time with some of my girlfriends.  We received a blow out, a scalp massage, and a glass of champagne.  I have to admit I absolutely LOVED the way my hair looked.  We had so much fun and wanted to parade around town all night.  haha

My hair is thick, long, and curly so it can be hard to manage.  It was so nice having someone else working on my hair while I got to relax. My hair held the larger curls in all night.  The girl (I can't remember her name) was so nice and easy to talk to.  

The location is perfect to go out afterwards as there are many bars/restaurants in the area to hang out.  

I highly recommend this place for a fun girls day or just to have a different style on your own!
