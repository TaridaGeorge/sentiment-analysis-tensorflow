My only bad coment about this place is "they do not accept American Express".  This place is Marshalls and TJ. Maxx on Steroids.  Heres an example a $800 pair of Salvatore Ferragamo boots on sale for $49.00, thats right $49.  

Although you may not find more than one of any item, you are sure to find some wonderful treats.  Many of the items, especially the shoes are items that Nordstorms custoumers have returned.  My only surprise is that Nordstorms takes almost anything back.  Shoes are worn, designer bags with ink stains or clothes with slight tears and its apparent that some of the items have been washed.
