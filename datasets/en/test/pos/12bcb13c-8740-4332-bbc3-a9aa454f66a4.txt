Great pizza - I always add garlic which makes every pizza even more AWESOME! I prefer to order carry out - sometimes the delivery takes too long when they get busy and you end up with cold pizza, which still tastes great (and not rubbery like those places that use cheap imitation cheese blends) but when you order fresh pizza, eating it hot is just sort of an expectation! If you keep your eyes peeled you can usually find killer deals in the coupon mailer, the Arcadian, and even on Groupon!
