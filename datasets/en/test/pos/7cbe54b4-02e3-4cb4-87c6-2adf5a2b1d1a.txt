I'll get right to it, Justin is super friendly and does an amazing job. Our carpet was clean and even (dare I say it?) fluffy after he had worked his magic. I mean, the man removed paint stains, grime, soda, all kinds of stuff I'm embarrassed to say was (what I thought) permanently grounded into the floor. His presence was comfortable, it seemed to me that he genuinely enjoys doing his job,  he wasn't just there to get in and get out and get paid. Justin exceeded all expectations, and even went the extra mile for us. This man should be a critically acclaimed carpet cleaner, exalted above all others. 

TL; DR Justin is awesome at what he does and expect great things when he comes around.
