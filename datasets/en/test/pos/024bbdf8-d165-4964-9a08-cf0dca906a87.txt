If you're looking for 100+ food choices, waterfalls, sculptures, beautiful scenery, wifi, etc.. You might wanna keep moving.

But if you want a cozy mom & pop Chinese buffet, pull up a chair here..! For a Chinese buffet, there aren't too many choices, but what they do make is excellent compared to some places I've eaten at.. Best fries in the Desert, just one of their fries looks like 5-7 fast food fries lumped together and deep fried, they are that massive and delicious!

The sesame chicken has a "shell" on it that is solid, but not rock hard.. It's more like a delicious crust on it..

The price is awesome as well, only $7.25 for Dinner buffet (drink is $1.75 extra) per person.. Less for Lunch buffet..
