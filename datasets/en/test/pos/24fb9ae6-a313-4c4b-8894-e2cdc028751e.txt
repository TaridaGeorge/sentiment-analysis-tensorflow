This place is great! On top of the huge selection and great prices on wine, beer and spirits they have complimentary wine tasting on Fri, Sat and Sun. They had many wines to taste which is always helpful when you are hesitant to buy something new. It was a bit overwhelming when we started looking at all the different types of wine they offered and the staff was very friendly and helpful. We will definitely be back.
