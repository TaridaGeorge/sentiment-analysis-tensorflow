I had the best lunch ever in the history of lunches at Da Vang today!  So many nice things have  been said about Da Vang in other reviews, so I won't repeat the details, except that it is good, fresh, and cheap.  Every time, without fail.  I've been there often, and just realized today that I hadn't reviewed it.  Atmosphere?  It's a room with some tables, no frills, but who cares?  Service is purely functional, no chit-chat or pleasantries - fine with me.  Bring on the pho, or rice stick noodles or stew, or .....drum roll please... the rice soup with fish.  That's menu item 61B.  They use lemon grass in it, and must put in a pound of lovely, perfectly cooked cod.  It's heavenly, and takes a little longer than most items to make so be prepared.
