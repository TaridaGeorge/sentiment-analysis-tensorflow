We have stayed a few times at the Wigwam and always have excellent service.  We like the elegant rooms and gorgeous lawns and flowers.  We ate for our anniversary in the Arizona Kitchen and liked the southwest flavors and open room.  We just heard about a new steakhouse they are building that will be steaks plus pool tables and a place to relax too.
