I highly recommend Dave's Metro Auto Glass to anyone who needs auto glass replacement or repairs. My car was broken into and the thief shattered my passenger side window. I called Dave's. They came out the same day I called. Not only did they provide a great service, they also cleaned up the broken glass from my previous window I did not get around to cleaning. They made my window replacement easy and no trouble at all. They even came to my work to take are of this matter, so it saved me the time I would have taken going somewhere else! Highly recommended!!!
