This hipster coffee shop should not put anyone off. Coffee was excellent! The lemon cake was a morning favorite as well. It's worth the wait if you see a long line, which moves quick anyway.
From the chill DJ beats to the great mix of young, old, artist, business persons. This coffee shop was a gem in down town.
