Even if you're not a Suns fan (which I most certainly am), these guys are just fun to watch! They're the perfect team: Nash, Marion, Stoudemire, Barbosa, Bell, Diaw, Thomas and the gang...even D'Antoni makes the team hot. They're quick, exciting and they have great sportsmanship....an extremely entertaining class act!

It's no wonder that Nash was named MVP 2 years in a row!
