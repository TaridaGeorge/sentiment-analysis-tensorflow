Under construction when I visited today, but still beautiful. Fellow botanical garden-ers were friendly. 

Bottled water is not overpriced. At 1.50 a bottle, it didn't sting that I forgot to bring my own water.

Park rangers are stern, silently watching and protecting our pic-a-nik baskets from any impending doom.

Wear your best, as there are tons of photographers running around. This could be your chance to get discovered - maybe your errant hand or part of your backpack will end up in some semi-famous hipster's Flickr!
