First of all, the service was awesome.  I will go back for that reason alone.  But, then there's also the food.  Nothing short of an excellent steak.  I got a Philly Original, "wit" and "wiz".  I also ordered fries and got a free drink.  I mean, c'mon.  Great place.  Reasonable prices.  As close as you can get to authentic in AZ.
