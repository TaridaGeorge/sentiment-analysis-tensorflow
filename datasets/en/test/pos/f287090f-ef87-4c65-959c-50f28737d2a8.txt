This place is a total find! They have tasty, unique sandwiches, the service was friendly and fast, and they aren't overpriced. Also, an adorable little patio to boot! Can't think of a better lunch place...and they have enough options for lunch every day! :) Not only is it better than Subway, but SUPPORT LOCAL! :)
