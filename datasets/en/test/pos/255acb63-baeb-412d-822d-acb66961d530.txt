I live in California and I don't have the luxury to eat at the Cracker Barrel. I recently returned to the Mesa location which I visited 3 years ago and I once again pleased my soul and body with their sublime food. This time I visited for breakfast, something I've never done before. I ordered coffee, hashbrown casserole, fried apples and a biscuit. I knew the Cracker Barrel would never let me down and this time it was great as usual. This place really deserves 5 stars all the way. The Cracker Barrel should be named the official restaurant of the Nation!
