Hands down the new place for me!!! My wife and I Yelped places to eat in our neighborhood and this place popped up. It looked super cool and right up my alley. It is! Super cool environment and great food!!! The place was hammered busy and still the service was excellent. We had a great time and the staff was super friendly. I had the Truck Stop Burger and Queso Dip and they both were awesome! I can't wait for this weekend to go back! 

PS: I one of the owners also owns One Stop Nutrition on 48th and Chandler. I didn't even realize it until one of the servers told me. That place is great too. Check out my review on One Stop.
