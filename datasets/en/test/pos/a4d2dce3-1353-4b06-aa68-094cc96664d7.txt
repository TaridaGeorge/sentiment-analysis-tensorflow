This is the best Chinese restaurant in the valley, no question. I've been here at least 10 times, and the quality of the food is flawless every time. I usually order either the Curry Chicken Fillet over Rice or the Pork and Vegetable Soup. Service is also quick and the people are friendly. The prices are very low, so the value is incredible.
