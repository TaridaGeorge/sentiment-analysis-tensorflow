I am from CA where there are many Vietnamese restaurants. Upon coming to AZ, I didn't have very high expectation for Vietnamese food. Here are reasons Maxim Restaurant deserve 5 stars.

1. Quick service
2. Friendly service--the owner was very friendly and spoke fluent English
3. The eggrolls---$2.50 for 2 rolls on a plate of salad = yummy! The price is half of what I usually pay in the Bay Area
4. Banh Canh-I had the seafood banh canh and although it wasn't out of your mind good, it was decent. I believe it was $6.50
5. just because it's a good Vietnamese restaurant in AZ, totally unexpected!

I would definitely visit again. :D
