I finally found the only place I need to go to get my hair cut. I don't have to explain what kind of cut I need because they always do it right the first time. I especially appreciate the straight shave and hot towel.They offer a great hair cut at a good price .

I spent a lot of time trying different shops and this place is trully, "The One"
