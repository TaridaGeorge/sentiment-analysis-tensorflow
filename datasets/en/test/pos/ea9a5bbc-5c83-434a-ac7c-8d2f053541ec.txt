I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE!!!

First of all, I am not a fan of buffets.  Usually you get a selection of questionable choices & over-cooked slop.

Udupi Cafe does the traditional Indian buffet lunch perfectly.  At least on weekends & holidays.  The week-day lunch is a little disappointing, not in quality but in variety.  The weekend/holiday lunch buffet is full of variety.

Being vegetarian, its nice to have a buffet full of tasty options without worry.  The majority of dishes are vegan & clearly marked.  Everything is tasty & well seasoned.  

You wont find any Tandoori options here, so no Naan.  But, the Dosa is absolutely delicious & don't hesitate to ask for more.  I have even witnessed a 4 foot long Dosa being served to a family, so bring your 
friends & maybe get lucky.
