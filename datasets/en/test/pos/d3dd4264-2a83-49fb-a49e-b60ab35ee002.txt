Have been coming here for years and love, Love, LOVE NYPD Pizza.  

Generally very good service with friendly staff and excellent menu.  Favorites are the Chelesa salad, pizza blanca and more recently margherita pizza - yum!!  Occasionally we splurge with a baked cookie (pizookie?).  Always go home with leftovers and enjoy as much the next day.

We usually eat in but take-out works well and so does delivery.  Check out their email specials and Mon/Tues specials too.  NYPD's got it covered.
