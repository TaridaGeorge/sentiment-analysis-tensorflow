What can I say that hasn't been said already?  Get the bruschetta and wine.  If you're going on a Monday or Tuesday night, opt for their $20 bruschetta and wine special.  It's good anytime after 8pm.  Any bruschetta (4 choices per order) and any bottle of wine on the menu for $20.  We shared a glass of the carminere/cabernet blend since it was before 8, and then upon our server's recommendation, opted for a bottle of the ganacha when the time struck.  Good choice!

Get there early because it tends to get packed.  We got there around 6:45, and by 8, there were people waiting outside for a table.  They waited a long time.

Great atmosphere (though it can get a little noisy at times) + great food + great wine + friendly servers = a nice evening out any day of the week.

Umm, yes please?
