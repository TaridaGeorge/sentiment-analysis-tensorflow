I really enjoy this place! From the eclectic beer and wine list to the amazing staff and good tunes, this place is great. The staff is super friendly and always on top of it. I operate a restaurant and looking at this place I love so many things about it. If you have not been this is the one to go to. Central is also good, but not quite as good as this one and Windsor if you are in search of the cocktails! Always a pleasant experience and simple, but delicious food..  The Italian picnic salad is one of my favorites!
Thanks Postino and thanks for hiring good people.
