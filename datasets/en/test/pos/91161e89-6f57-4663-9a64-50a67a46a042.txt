Ok this place has potential to be my favorite work week lunch spot  

Heard about the good burgers but decided to try their Fish Taco Friday deal and wasn't disappointed.

I give them tons of props for their generous portions of the fish and loved how they cooked it in very light tempura mixture, which made the fish very crispy, tasty, and not heavy. The cabbage was fresh and the wasabi aioli they added took it to the next level.  One last thing to add is the price..$3 a pop.  2 tacos filled me up and I was happy the rest of the day.    

It's a burger joint by name but don't discount it.  They know fish tacos as well so check 'em out.
