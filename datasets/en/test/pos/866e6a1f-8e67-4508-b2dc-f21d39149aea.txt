This is my second time there. Both times were great. Last time, we showed up at sunset and had an awesome view of the Fountain Hills Vallley and the mountains. The four of use ordered different plates. All we great and the presentation was outstanding. I had the duck breast and really enjoyed it. Our sever was excellent. Love this place.
