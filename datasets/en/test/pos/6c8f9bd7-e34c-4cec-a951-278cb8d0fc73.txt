OHMYGOODNESS!!!  I LOVE YO LOVE!
This place has the BEST frozen yogurt I have ever had.  The flavors are so true and original.  They use all natural ingredients.
My favorite flavors to date are peanut butter and oatmeal cookie.  I could eat Oatmeal Cookie every day, it's SO good!  And the selection of toppings is wide.
On average, my family and/or I go about 3x per week.  It's my daughter's favorite after-school snack!
