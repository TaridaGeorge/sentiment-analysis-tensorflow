$5 for an amazingly delicious taste explosion in my mouth? Yes please. : )
I finally was able to try SLD out today (thanks testing break!). I got up to the window and said, "I'm so excited to be here right now!" The owner just laughed at me. I don't blame him. I'm completely ridiculous!

Anyhow, I ordered the Lady and added green chilis and sriracha with a chicken dog. The owner asked if I liked spicy things, and I gave him a resounding "Yes!" He suggested next time I order a Devil Dog. I cannot wait for that day!

Super friendly service, amazingly tastetastic food, yeah, that just about sums it up. Yep.
