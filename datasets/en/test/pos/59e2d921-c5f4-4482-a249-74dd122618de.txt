We are so glad we found Express Solar Protection on yelp. After being frustrated by 3 other companies we turned to yelp and found this company. Within 5 minutes of making our phone call and speaking to Kevin we had an estimate and an appointment for the next evening. 
Both Kevin and Sean are very friendly, knowledgeable and professional. During our appointment they did an awesome job in listening to what we wanted then providing samples, demonstrations and upfront pricing for the products. We just placed our first of three orders and could not be any more happy with the whole process! If you need blinds/shutters, screens or film call them to see how they can help. Thanks guys!
