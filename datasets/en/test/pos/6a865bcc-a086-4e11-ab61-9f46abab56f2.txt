We've needed a convenient local urgent care facility rather than using large emergency rooms in this part of town. We got the chance to use it yesterday when my wife fell and thought she broke her ankle. We got in, saw the doctor, had four x-rays taken, casual conversation with the doctor, and abrasions wrapped and out the door in one hour. The staff was casually professional, quick, and friendly. Without this facility, we would have had to use the hospital or wait until the next day. One hour-----if we had to use the hospital, we'd still be there.
