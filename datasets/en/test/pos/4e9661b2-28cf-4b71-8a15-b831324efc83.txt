If I want to go see a movie, this is the first theater I check. It usually has limited release and foreign movies. I don't usually go for the huge "blockbuster" movies so this is one of the few theaters that will show them. I have seen many movies here that have had a lot of people talking about them later. 

It's not the nicest theater but it is clean and well kept. The only thing I would change is about Harkins as a whole, I wish they would show more of the type of movies that they show here because it's quite a drive for me to get there.
