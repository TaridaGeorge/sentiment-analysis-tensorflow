Absolutely delicious.  Quality materials, phenomenal flavors - everything to love.  It has a nice mom & pop feel despite being in a strip shopping center in Scottsdale.  It's hard to decide between the beef noodle dish with eggrolls and the sandwiches - so I rarely choose - I just get both and take it home.  This is the kind of place where you order extra to have for later!
