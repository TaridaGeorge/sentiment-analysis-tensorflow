This is probably my favorite of all the Starbucks in town when it comes to the look and feel of what a Starbucks should be.  

Years ago this was a typical Starbucks, but recently they remodeled it and the look is just perfect for what SB is.  

The staff is great and insanely nice.  If you need anything, they are more than happy to help and assist.  Of course making sure the drinks taste great is important too and I've never been disappointed.

I work close to this location, so its on my way to work.  Love it here.
