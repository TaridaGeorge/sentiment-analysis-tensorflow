Get your old watches out of your drawer! This place is just perfect. I've had 4 watch batteries replaced and one watch polished.  

You walk in. The owner asks you what you need. You say watch battery. He says OK. Five minutes and $5 later he hands you your working watch. $5 is also the charge to get all those scratchs off of the face of your watch.

Bring cash. No cards accepted. 

Do not pay attention to the first reviewer. Same name then but different owner.
