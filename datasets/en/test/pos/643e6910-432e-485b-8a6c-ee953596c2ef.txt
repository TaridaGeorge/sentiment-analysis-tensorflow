This place is awesome!! It has a great vibe and all the people that eat and work here are very friendly and welcoming.  It was the first place I went when I came to the neighborhood and everyone welcomed me to the area and the employees gave me tips about restaurants, activities, and really anything else I asked about.  It was a great welcome to the neighborhood!  Also every time I have had "buffalo" anything it has been phenomenal.  

Ask monty about the "brojito" which is a delicious take on the mojito and ask Kristina for her take on the gin and tonic sometimes called a "sneakers o'toole".  Enjoy!
