An old time Valley treat! I'm on a quest to try good meat markets and sausage places around the Valley, so I finally stopped by Schreiner's.  It's one of those kinds of places you drive by a million times wondering what it might be like.  It's small, but the selection is great and the people are great too.

Caveat: if you're planning to get something small, bring cash.  I think they have a debit or credit card minimum purchase.  Sausages here run from around $3-$6 a pound or so, a very good price for tasty stuff that's made on site.

Nice to be able to finally visit another great Phoenix business that's been here a long time!
