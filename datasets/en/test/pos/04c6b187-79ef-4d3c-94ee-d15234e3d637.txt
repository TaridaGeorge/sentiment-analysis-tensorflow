I'm going to sum up Arlecchino using an anecdote regaled to me by the person who recommended it:

"I went with my friend and we each got a scoop, and traded off to try each other's. We didn't say anything, but I could tell we were both thinking the exact same thing, which was: 'How can I keep this person's, eat all of it, and then get mine back?'" 

That sounds about right. The guy behind the counter was a sweetheart, and my Vesuvio was deliciously Grand Marnier-y. I also enjoy the convenient gateway through LGO so that I may excuse myself and sneak a treat incognito. The thought of gaining weight from eating this in excess actually makes me terribly excited. Arlecchino Gelato ASAP, if you haven't.
