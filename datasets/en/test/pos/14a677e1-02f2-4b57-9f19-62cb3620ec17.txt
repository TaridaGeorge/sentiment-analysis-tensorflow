We absolutely love going here prior to a Rattler's or D-Backs game!  Location is great, burgers are fresh,hot & yummy!!  A small order of fries is more than enough for 2 people to share...especially if you get the double patty burger.  Fries are cut fresh there.  We feel it's a great deal for the money!
