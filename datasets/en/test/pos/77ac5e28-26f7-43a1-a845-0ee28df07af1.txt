I cannot believe this is Fry's! I remember what it looked like years ago, old and gritty. I haven't been in this store in years, until this week. The remodel looks amazing! As soon as you walk in, there are a ton of flowers and plants to welcome you. To the right, are the shopping carts, to the left... a real cold stone ice cream shop! The entire store looks so much better. 

There's even a walk in wine section, sit down wine area. This is now my grocery store. Love that I'm just a 5 min drive!
