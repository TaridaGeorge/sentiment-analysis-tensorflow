We've been to the Phoenix Art Museum several times, but this was the first time we had attended a film (of sorts). It was held in Whiteman Hall and it was a simulcast from the National Theatre in London of "One Man, Two Guvnors".  Terrific seating and accoustics and just the cost of admission to the museum.  Highly recommend for viewing of films and theatre.
