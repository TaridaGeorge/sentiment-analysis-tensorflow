While your visiting the Phoenix, Arizona area you may want to stop by the Biltmore Mall and checkout all the shops and restaurants in the center. There are many restaurants to meet up at. I met an old friend at Hillstone in Phoenix. My burger was very good but was also $14. Whew this place was pricey with a strict dress code. If you are entertaining and trying to impress someone this is the place. A little pricey for my tastes but wonderful food! Make sure you dress to impress and if need be there is also a valet at the restaurant!
