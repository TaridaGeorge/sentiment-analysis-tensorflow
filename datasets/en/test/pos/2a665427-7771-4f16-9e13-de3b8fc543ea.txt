the bf and i stopped in for a late lunch with a Groupon. we ordered paninis that took no more than 10 minutes to make and they were SO GOOD! the ingredients were fresh and flavorful. we also sampled a couple flavors of gelato before deciding on raspberry cheesecake & choco/peanut butter. everything we had was amazing and we will be returning to try all the flavors (and some pizza)!
