It is a little on the expensive side but it is well worth it.  The presentation was very colorful and creative.  They even offered us more springs rolls since there were 3 of us.  We ordered 3 appetizers, two special drinks (Che), one Pho which is seasoned perfectly, combo plate offered everything I can imagine that I can get with all the fixings plus she gave me of bowl of soup which accompany with any rice plate (only Asians ask for a bowl of soup with the meal and they did that as well.  It is an upscale Asian dining experience not to be missed.  Great place to take a nice date.
