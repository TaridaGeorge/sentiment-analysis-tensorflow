My doctor recommended me to Karri after I asked her about her glowing skin.  That was about six years ago and I have been happily getting treatments ever since.  Karri is professional, conscientious and very straightforward and up-to-date about skincare.  I rarely have a skin issue now, and when I do, it's amazing how she can get in there and take care of it.  I seriously wish I had known her years earlier.  As others mention, she is also fun and energetic, and I get great advice from her about products and other treatments.  I wholeheartedly recommend her to anyone seeking serious, clinical skincare.
