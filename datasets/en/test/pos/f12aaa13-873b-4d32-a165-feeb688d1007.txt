I'm no expert on gardening, but this was the most impressive nursery I've ever been to... in the middle of a desert no less.  The selection is plentiful and the specimens seem very well taken care of.

We purchased a healthy golden torch cactus and a small japonica boxwood.  They are both doing well, after relocating to L.A.

At the Arizona/CA border, an agriculture agent actually stopped us and started inspecting the cactus at length.  "What is this?" he asks.  I'm thinking "wtf does it look like?"  I explain that the plant - the cactus was purchased at a nursery.  He's not convinced and tells us to pull over by the border crossing.

After 10 minutes of waiting and wondering if this poor plant will be dumped by the Arizona/California border, the agent returns and tells us we're ok.

I didn't know cactus smuggling, liberation was a crime.
