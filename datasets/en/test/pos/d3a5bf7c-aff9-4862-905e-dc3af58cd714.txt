I have been here about 20 times and never had a bad burger. The buns are always fresh. The meat cooked perfectly and it has a real backyard BBQ style to its presentation. Simple but very effective. The fries are a very large portion so a small fry  will probably feed two just FYI. 
Definitely a good choice in the mall for quick lunch.
