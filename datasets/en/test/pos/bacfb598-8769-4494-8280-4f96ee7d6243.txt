In my opinion, this is by far the best Sushi and Japanese joint in town!  This place is as authentic as you can get for Phoenix, AZ.  My husband and I are addicted to the Chirachi bowl which is packed full of rice, seaweed, and piled high with the chef's selection of the freshest raw fish.  This incredible bowl of deliciousness is $20!  You couldn't find this much fresh raw fish at a restaurant for this price anywhere else in Phoenix.  

If I get the Chirachi bowl idea stuck in my head, I have to have it and nothing else will satisfy my craving.  Speaking of...I think I'll order one for take out right now!  ;)

I rate Sushi Ken at the highest rating possible: 5 Noms: "Nom, Nom, Nom, Nom, & NOM!" :D
