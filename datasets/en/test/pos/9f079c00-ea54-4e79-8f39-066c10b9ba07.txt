BEST PIZZA i have ever tasted. Couple things you must understand about this place. DO NOT COME HERE HUNGRY. Why. You will be waiting a couple hours. Me recommendation is to arrive 2.5 hours before they open and make sure you make the first cut off, if not you will be waiting for another 3 hours. They also have my favorite drink you cant find anywhere these days. Bubble Up. 

My recommendations: 

Capresse 
sonny boy 
margarita
