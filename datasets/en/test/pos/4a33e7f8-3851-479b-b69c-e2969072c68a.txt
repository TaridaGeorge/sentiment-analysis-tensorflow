FYI, I lived for PGP when I was studying at ACI in NYC. Cuz it's so YUM E! Couldn't believe when I lived at DCRanch, there was one right on Market Street. OK, so I haven't had the world famous, controversially long-lined, downtown Pizzeria Bianco yet. But, you know what? I don't think I need to. Cuz Patsy's my pizza passion. Thin crust, tangy sauce and simple and fresh toppings.The staff here is fantastic. Great bar to shoot a couple Patrons while waiting for your to go za. And to think you can get a meal at DCRanch for $15 and be drooling about the next day. Way cool!
