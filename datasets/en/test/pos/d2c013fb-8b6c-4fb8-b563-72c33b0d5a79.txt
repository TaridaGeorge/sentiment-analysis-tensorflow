Very professional office staff and they are open on Saturdays!  Ultrasound Lifting Facials by Priscilla are INCREDIBLE- my skin looks great.  They also offer Laser Hair Removal, Botox, & Vitamin B shots at a discounted price. Looking forward to my next appointment.  Update:  I just had my second appointment with Ginny for vein sclerotherapy. (Only $250) My ugly leg veins literally vanished in front of my eyes. I am so pleased with the results!
