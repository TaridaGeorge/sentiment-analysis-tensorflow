This shop was recommended by Ric's Auto Body, who had done really good work for me in the past (via USAA). 

Very friendly, prompt on email and the phone, took me on short notice, gave me a very fair quote and charged me exactly what they quoted. 

Told me to expect it complete at 2pm (dropped off at 8:15 for a driver's seat), they called me at exactly 1:58pm and 15 seconds. 

Also, without any additional charge, completed fresh leather dye on the seat pan of the seat. 

The seat looks literally brand new. Great craftsmanship, very fair price, very courteous and professional!
