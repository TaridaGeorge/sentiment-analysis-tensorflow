Amazing place! I'd lived in AZ for 30 years prior to the northwest. Now, after 19 years up north, I'm back "home" for a visit and went out here for the first time EVER. The gardens are fabulous & the shop is incredible. (They ship too, which is nice for a shopper like me...got a gorgeous clay windchime!) No tax charged, because they are non-profit! (So...shop, shop, shop!)

They have a fabulous Chihuly art display out front where he did 3 huge cacti in blown glass. That was a lovely sight! 

And, the topper, I saw baby birds in a cactus! Too cute for words. And, a mama quail and her babies racing across the parking lot. :)
