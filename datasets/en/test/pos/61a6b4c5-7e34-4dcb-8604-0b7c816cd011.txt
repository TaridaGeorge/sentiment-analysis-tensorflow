Pane Bianco doesn't offer a crazy-big menu, but you won't care about a huge selection after you take the first bite of your sandwich or salad. A brick oven in the center of the restaurant ensures fresh bread on a daily basis. It's crispy, chewy and delicious. 

The Market Sandwich varies on availability and price depending on what's fresh for whatever time of year you choose to dine there. You can purchase entire loaves of their famous sandwich bread to share with others or greedily scarf it down in a dark corner somewhere in a manner not unlike that of a starving badger.

Be prepared for a bit of a wait during the lunch time hours of the Monday - Friday white collar work week. The secret is out, but it's definitely worth the wait.
