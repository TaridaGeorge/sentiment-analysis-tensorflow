The French Toast at Crackers is absolutely sensational and flat-out delicious. I liked it so much when I stopped in Mesa while enroute to Tucson that I came back three days later, had it again, and it was just as wonderful as the first time.

 The wait staff is extremely polite and very cordial, and the hostess (Chris) is an absolute riot with a superb sense of humor and a really sassy attitude.

This has become my can't-go-wrong spot for breakfast whenever I visit Phoenix or Tucson.
