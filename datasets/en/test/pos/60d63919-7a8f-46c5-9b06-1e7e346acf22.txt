We went with friends and their two little kids.  While the food was okay, a little bland for my taste.  I've been to Benihana's before and this was probably a little below expectations.  However, our chef is what inspired me to give this one five stars.  It was the two kids first experience to a teppan restaurant and our chef definitely played to them.  It was an awesome experience for the kids which made all the adults happy.

My favorite part was when our chef asked the little boy in our group to cook the chicken gave him a spatula and kept asking if he remembered to flip the chicken.  Priceless moments!  Thanks Benihana!
