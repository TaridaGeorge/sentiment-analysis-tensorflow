Oldest. Bar. In. Old. Town. (yeah we know Rusty Spur claims the title too, but we are biased). What The Coach House lacks in sophistication it makes up for in character. This is where all the locals can be found. No frills though, this is a real Old Town bar. See those hitching rails up front, yeah occasionally you will actually see horses tied up there right next to the Harley's. Everyone is welcome here. Often the start of Pub Crawls and Bachelor parties, The Coach House has a real diverse crowd, but that is the charm. Did we mention that you can smoke on the patio? Look for The Coach House to have live bands for special events and we will keep you informed via Facebook of when they do. Every Sunday at 2pm, they also offer a FREE BBQ to guests... yep it's yummy!
