Now this is a restaurant that you want to tell everybody about! Problem is, so does everyone else who comes here! It's packed, so either get in early or just expect to be awhile, which considering, it's a great way to spend some time with friends! Food is phenomal. The deep dish Chicago style pizza is good as it get, west of the mississippi! And, one the most impressive things about Oregano's is their service! Staff is well trained and looks out for the smallest detail to make your evening enjoyable, very refreshing!
