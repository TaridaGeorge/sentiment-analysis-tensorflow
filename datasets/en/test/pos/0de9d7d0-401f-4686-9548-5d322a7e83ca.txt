Ben B. and I visited Al-Hana after a tiresome IKEA outing and BABA-GODDAMN this stuff is YUMMY AS HELL. We nearly stuffed ourselves to capacity on the smoky babaganoush and hummus. We had the chicken shawarma and Ben had something with spiced beef in it... the name lasted on my tongue about as long as the food, can't remember it, so sorry.

Nothing over 3.99. Seriously. You must.
