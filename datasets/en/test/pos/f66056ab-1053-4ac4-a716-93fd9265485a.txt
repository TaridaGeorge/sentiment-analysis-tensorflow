we just cant get enough of jason's deli!!
their beef eater has soooo much meat on it, that i only order half with their amzing salad bar!!
salad bar is sooooooo fresh and has everything imaginable!!
pastrami sandwich is amazing and order half unless your really hungry!!
even humus, chocolate muisse, pudding and slef-serve ice-cream!!
you won't go away hungry!!
we eat there more then once monthly and luv it!!!
healthy to boot when you eat their salad!!
