It's such a beautiful day to eat outside at Taylor's Cafe!  The view of Camelback mountain is gorgeous!  

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my server JC.  He always remembers my name and calls me the cutest pet names.  Always happy to freshly squeeze my OJ (what a man haha) and knows I need my huge cup of hot brimming coffee.  

Today, I was craving an egg/bacon/jalape√±o/salsa with no cheese burrito.  It was perfectly cooked and juicy (yum)! Instead of their perfectly browned hash browns (the longing can you feel it lol); I had fresh fruit which was great.  

Once again, love JC for his attentiveness & always feeling he looks forward to seeing me.  Rest of staff and the food is always fab!
