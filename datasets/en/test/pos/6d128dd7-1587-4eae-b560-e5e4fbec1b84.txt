Was extremely pleased with their service! They fixed my brakes (from problems I was having from the previous techs who installed it recently) I got a new battery for a decent price.  The manager was extremely nice and helpful and did an excellent job with customer service!  This team was friendly, courteous, and professional.  And the wait time was excellent.  Less than an hour!
