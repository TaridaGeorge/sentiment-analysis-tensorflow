This place is amazing. I'm a frequent Total & More visitor, always walking up and down the aisles, picking up and putting down 6-packs in search for a favorite to enjoy that evening, or pondering what the new brew will taste like. 

The prices are unbeatable and by far beat out those of BevMo and the surrounding grocery stores. 

Nice staff too!
