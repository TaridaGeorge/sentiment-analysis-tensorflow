FIVE STAR DIVE BAR! I love this place. The regulars are friendly, the staff is great and I love that there is a good menu to help keep your tummy full. The drinks are CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP and poured to be powerful. A handful of pool tables and plenty of TVs to catch up on sports. and A+ dive bar. I have driven past it for years (it's just south of the Phoenix Baptist Hospital) and FINALLY stopped in.... now I am starting to become a regular, especially since it doesn't hurt your pocket book at all!
