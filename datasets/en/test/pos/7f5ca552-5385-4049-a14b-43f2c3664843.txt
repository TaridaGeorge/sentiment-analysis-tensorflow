This CVS has turned into the place where I buy most everything. The staff is super nice. The pharmacy staff is super competent, patient and accomodating. I haven't had nearly as good of an experience with a pharmacy anywhere else in the valley, so I try not to go anywhere else. The only criticism I have is a CVS policy that is not exclusive to the store--if you need to transfer an RX they will make you wait 24 hours to fill it.
