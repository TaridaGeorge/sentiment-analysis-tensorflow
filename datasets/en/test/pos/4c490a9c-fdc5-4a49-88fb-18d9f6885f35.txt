This is the bf and my "spot" every Saturday morning when I'm in town. We roll out of bed, take a 10 minute drive, order our respective drinks and/or snacks, and sit in the outside patio. 

It's extremely peaceful and when it's sunny, it's even better. I can't complain! It's quality coffee and quality time =]
