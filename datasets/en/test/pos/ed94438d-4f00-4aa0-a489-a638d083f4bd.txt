I ordered a gyro and is was very tasty. The pita was soft and warm, the meat seasoned well and was tender. The season fries were perfectly seasoned and were thicker than I expected. I also ordered a small greek salad. I got the dressing on the side since I don't like too much dressing and others mentioned they put a lot of dressing on it- the salad was great with a good amount of feta cheese (didn't really even need dressing because all the yummy feta).  The tzatziki sauce had thin strips of cucumber in it and was made with Greek yogurt (not mayo). The staff was very friendly.  I would go back again for sure!
