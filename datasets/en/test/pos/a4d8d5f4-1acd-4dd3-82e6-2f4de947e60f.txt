All Hail the Dutchess of Total Wine, AMber W!

Total Wine is probably my favourite (For Nathan S.) place on the planet. For reals, yo.  You can waste a whole entire afternoon walking around looking at new wines, spirits, and beers. It never gets old!

They have such a huge variety, and in every price range... single beers, 6-12-24-30 packs... single serving bottles up to kegs... they even have multiple gluten free beers and ciders for me! 

Excellent customer service, great prices (generally $1-2 cheaper than walmart or the grocery store, on average), perfectly located next to Chipotle, and they always have the product I need readily available. 

I tried asking once if they would let me bring a cot and just move in, but I got denied. Perhaps one day my fantasy will come true!
