Roy's is never a disappointment. And everytime I go there (any location) I eat and eat and eat. I mean everything is excellent. This time I tried their Jalapeno margartia and it was excellet. I need to learn how to make that! Had the boat of appetizers which includes the shrimp, short ribs, lobster pot stickers and dim sum. It was all perfcet of corse. I mean seriously I may get flagged for this review because it might sound like I work here I like it so much. But I DONT, its just that good. Got the Ahi tuna which was awesome, the mustard sause was too spicy for me (and I like spicy hence the jalepeno marg) but I think it had wasabi in it. Then for desert the coconut cheesecake was devoured in 3 mins. Went away full, happy and wanting more.
