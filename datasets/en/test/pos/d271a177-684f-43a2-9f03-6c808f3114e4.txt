This is the original weigh-n-pay fro-yo in the neighborhood. Yes, we were all amazed by the concept and braved the crowds in the early days. We had a tacit agreement between us all. Take care of us and we will take care of you.  Then things changed...

Other shops opened up with rapid aplomb. They had glitz and glamor. They had flavors heretofore unheard. And, without warning we left our first love. Slowly, though, the flaws showed up in the others. Inching prices. A lack of community.

Then, this week, I returned. Like an old friend the builderz were still there. The prices were reasonable and the yogurt was wonderful. 

Please, yogurt builderz, accept my profound apologies for cheating on you.
