What a fun place!  The staff is absolutely incredible and anticipated my every need before I even knew I had it!  Wonderfully accommodating, fun, funky and kitschy - I just loved all of the attention to detail!

I stayed in the Chaparral Gardenview Patio Suite, which has a huge furnished patio with loungers and a walkway to the pool area!  Lots of space in the room and even a separate living room area for entertaining friends.  

Distrito - Great food! (Try the Queso Fundido with duck barbacoa!)
Old Town Whiskey - Great selection! (Try the Commodore!)
Pool - Great DJ's and vibe on weekends! (Get a cabana!)
