We had breakfast there recently.  I had the iron skillet and it was such a cool dish.  Such a creative presentation, if nothing else.  Two years ago we had dinner there and I remember it really knocked our socks off, though I don't remember enough of that meal to provide details.  The view at this place is second to none, to say the least, whether on a clear day, at sunset, or at night.  As someone else already said, it is a nice crowd there, and the decor is very tastefully done.
