I love Discount Tire- what a great concept- they will fix your tire for free on the assumption you will return to buy tires. This is great corporate strategy at its best. I got a blow out, limped my way to the Pima store- staff was wonderful, Kevin was professional, quick- store is clean, FREE bottled water

Great Great Great
