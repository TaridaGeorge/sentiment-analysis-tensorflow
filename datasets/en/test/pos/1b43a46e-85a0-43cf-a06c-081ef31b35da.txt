I called Cookies In Bloom around 10 AM this morning to place and order for a cookie cake asking my cousin to be my maid of honor.  The phone experience was wonderful!  The woman I spoke with was very helpful and patient (as I had no idea what I really wanted on the cookie cake)  She said the cookie cake would be delivered around 2PM that same day, and sure enough, I had a text from my cousin accepting my request for her to be my Maid of Honor!  She was very pleased with the cake! I was very pleased with the service!  Thank you for making this so special for us!
