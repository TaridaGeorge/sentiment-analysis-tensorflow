Not sure what it is about Japanese food - but I seriously love it - Sushi, Teriyaki... yum.   I come here to get the Bento boxes that are made everyday.  There are fish, chicken, and combination Bento boxes.  It's a relatively cheap lunch - like $4 for a small Bento and $6 for a large one.  It's high quality food for the price.
