Love the quiet ambience and simplicity of this place.  

Beautiful but once again, simplistic refined Asian cuisine.  What's great about this place is you could go in with a friend on a budget and just get a few bites and drinks and leave happy with still a few bucks in your wallet.  

My favorite item were the perfectly fried squash blossoms.  The wine list is extensive for such a small place and the cocktails are clean and elegant, fitting the focus of Nobuo's food. 

Nobuo is also an incredible guy.  What you see is what you get and he truly cares about what he creates and the visitor's experience.
