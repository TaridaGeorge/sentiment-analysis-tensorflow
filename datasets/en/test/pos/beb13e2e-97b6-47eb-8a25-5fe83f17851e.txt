Amazingly cheap and great Middle Eastern food. Warm homemade pita bread. Buckets of feta. Trays and trays of bakhlava. There's really nothing not to love here. Do be wary of the lunch crowd though, as on weekdays, the place can get pretty busy, especially if you're dining in (though you can always takeout and it's just as easy and fast).
