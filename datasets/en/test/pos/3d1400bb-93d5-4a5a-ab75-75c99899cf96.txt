Husband and I have been here a number of times and always enjoyed ourselves thoroughly.  The best part about this place is the atmosphere.  I always feel like I am in an episode of Mad Men and that I need to order a gimlet and smoke a cigarette (nevermind the fact that I don't know what a Gimlet is, and I don't smoke).

Last night, we met some friends here for drinks before heading over to watch a show at the Phoenix Theater.  It was a great meeting place.  We all had martinis (delicious) and then walked over to the theater.  This is not only an excellent dinner place, but also wonderful for your pre or after show drinks!
