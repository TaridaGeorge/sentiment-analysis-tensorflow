What's better than a smoothie in 100 degree weather? Yum :)

Cool, clean location with friendly and efficient service.

Husband got the Power Pro which came with options of protein, fruit, and juice types (he chose whey, blueberries, and mango juice). Kids each chose pina cooladas, and I grabbed a dairy free ginger mango tango. All came with a free boost and all were delectable :D
