Awesome bar! One of the first bars I actually went to after turning 21 and now I constantly wanna go back. No matter what kind of mood I'm in I always feel comfortable and relaxed once I'm there. 

They play good music and at a decent volume so I don't have to shout at the person sitting next to me. Some nights they have specials like $2 shots and what not. 

Love going to Seamus with my friends, sitting in my usual seat, and hanging out for a good hour or five. I like that it's not crowded with a bunch of woo girls but is a much more mellow place.
