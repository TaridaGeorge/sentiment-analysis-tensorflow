I've been up to Tryst Cafe a few times now and I am a huge fan! Food it great, veggie options that make my mouth water and yummy drinks! They seem to specialize in organic options, even from behind the bar. They have sweet potato tater tots for a wonderful side to sandwiches and such. Extra special in my book! The staff is super friendly and helpful with suggestions.  Get yourself up to Tryst soon and enjoy!
