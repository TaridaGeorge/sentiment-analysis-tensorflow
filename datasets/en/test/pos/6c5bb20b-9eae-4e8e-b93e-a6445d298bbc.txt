Went there twice this week alone. 

Service is great, the owner actually thanked us for our business and was really helpful when trying to order. Cucumber salad was great both times. Went with a group of 3 today and had to sit outside because there are only 2 tables that hold more than 2 people inside.

Great place to eat, I'd go back.
