This is the best place ever for a family reunion. Since 1959, the Nordstrom family (not the store - we are the Midwest Farmer Nordstroms) have gathered every 2 years all over the country at tourist destinations during high season. This group knows value when we find it (airport shuttle, full breakfast, happy hour, pleasant - flexible - accommodating staff), and Hospitality Suites in Scottsdale has it all to the point that we wonder "How do you do it?"  Word of mouth among the family will net many future guests.
