Dave is awesome. He works in electric and helped us out with absolutely everything, even out of his section. We had several home projects we have been working on and he made sure we had the right tools for everything AND was concerned about us saving money, even when I just shrugged it off and didn't really care about the price, he explained the specifics of exactly what I needed and why. Always greeted with a friendly hello by every single employee! The customer service in this store is a shining example of how it should be! 

They now also accept paypal.
