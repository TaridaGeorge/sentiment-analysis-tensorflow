One of the best experiences I have ever had at a restaurant. Free food for my daughter and ketchup smiley faces for everyone. The food was great and the server commendable. Definitely recommending this spot to others. I had a bad experience at the west gate location but I'm really glad we gave the arrowhead location a chance. If you see a male server with big curly hair he's the one you want.
