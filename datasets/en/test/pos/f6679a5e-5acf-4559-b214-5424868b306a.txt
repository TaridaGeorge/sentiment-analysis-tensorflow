I will never go back to any supermarket spices again. Seriously! Their spices are incrediable and every time I come into town, its the first place I want to go to stock up. Once you buy their containers all you have to do is buy refill packets. Cheap once you get started and prices are even better then supermarkets. It just doesn't make sense to get your spices anywhere else unless they don't have the product.
