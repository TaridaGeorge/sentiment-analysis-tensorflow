"As good as it gets" for a chain family restaurant. I give it 5 stars because for what it is, it does it well. Food is good, service is very good. I eat here several times a month and have never had a bad experience. Servers are always attentive every time I've been there. It does get busy at times but I've never waited more than 10 minutes for a table.
