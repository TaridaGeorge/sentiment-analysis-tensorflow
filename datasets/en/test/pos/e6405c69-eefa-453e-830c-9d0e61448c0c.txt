I decided to try Texas BBQ House after seeing a menu that was dropped off at my work. First impression is it is a small place in a not so good location. A couple previous restaraunts were in the same location and had to close shop. To put it simply, I hope this place does not go anywhere. The beef brisket is great. Worth 5 stars itself. Barbecue sauce is on the sweet side but very tasty. Most meats are sold by weight. You have to arrive early if you want the moist brisket as it sells out early. The sides are not too much to brag about. Simple cream corn and baked beans are good, coleslaw is made fresh as I saw them preparing it in the kitchen, potato salad tastes as if it is purchased pre made.
