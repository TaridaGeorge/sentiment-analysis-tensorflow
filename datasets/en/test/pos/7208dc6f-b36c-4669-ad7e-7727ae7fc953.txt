I can't say enough good things about Stinkweeds.

As an indie music nut, it really is the best place to find limited release CD's, EP's and albums that I couldn't find anywhere else.  If they don't have it, they'll order it.

Walking in, you really get the sense that this is a shrine for music.  The staff is knowledgable and helpful.  It's like you're talking to one of your friends who listened to way too much music in high school.

I'd hate to think what the lightrail construction is doing for their business.  I do my part by buying all my music there.  And, hey, you should too.
