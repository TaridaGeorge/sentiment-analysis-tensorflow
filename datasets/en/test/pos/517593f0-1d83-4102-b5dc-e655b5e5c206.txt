I really like this place. It's close to home and the staff here is pretty cool. Great specials on drinks and I have been impressed with their food. I either order chicken fingers with honey mustard because it's kinda spicy or the rueben and neither let me down. 

I feel like I'm in Cheers- same people here everytime I come and the vibe is very chill.  I want to recommend this place, but I feel like it is a secret spot so don't tell your friends ;)  if you are in the area looking for a drink then definitely stop by.
