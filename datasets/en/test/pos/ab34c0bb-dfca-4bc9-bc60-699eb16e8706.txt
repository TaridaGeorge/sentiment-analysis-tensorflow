Great shop! It's so much fun to hear shoppers say the name "happy hippie"; it makes me happy just to hear it! Very helpful, attentive staff. They do consignment now- ladies, bring them your clothes, shoes and accessories!!! Watch them on Facebook for evening events: promotions, open mic nights, etc. It's wonderful!
