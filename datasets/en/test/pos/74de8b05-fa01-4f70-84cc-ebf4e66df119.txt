Visited Indulge Burgers over the 4th of July weekend. This place ROCKS! Wish they had one in Seattle. 
- Ambiance was classy/nice, but casual. (I forgot that I was actually in a strip mall.) 
- Staff was professional, friendly, and attentive - service was great. 
- The burgers were amazing and you can't beat the fact that they use Certified Humane beef! 

Will definitely be back on my next trip to the area.
