We stayed here during our first visit to Arizona. It was a great place, very spacious, though a little dated. It was so big and spaced out with all the amenities that the resort have workers constantly driving around in golf carts to shuttle guests back and forth from their rooms. The staff was friendly and extremely helpful. They were always there to lend a hand. They have an efficient shuttle service to/from the airport. 

Staff was also very accommodating when it came to requesting a later check-out time. Check-out is at noon but when we requested a later check-out, we were granted 1:30pm without any extra charges or fees. 

The holiday decoration here was lovely. Put me right in the Christmas spirit.
