Came here on a free pass.  Eric, the owner was eager to accommodate; asked me my workout goals, showed me the appropriate machines, the free-weights, etc. and no corporate sales pitch!  Loved the elliptical - not only because it is a "green" machine adding a righteous feeling to my workout, but it has its own fan that I could adjust and direct on myself - a definite cool factor.  Stayed for the mat pilates class.  Being an older gym user I am reluctant to try new classes for fear of being the slow one who will hold the class back.  No problem here.  Stefanie was able to keep the pace of the class and still give me the attention I needed  - was that the left or right foot?!  An awesome row of new red spin bikes also "green" machines, makes me eager to come to a spin class.
