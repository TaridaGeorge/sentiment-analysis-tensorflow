I love the new look. I love the new covered parking. I hate though how the downsized their inventory. Yes, there is tons to buy, but with particular brands, one might not find a full line of the product forcing one to go elsewhere to buy. This use to be my one stop shop, but now I have to go hunting elsewhere for simple everyday items such as onion powder. Minced onion  I can find from small to large volume, but onion powder is only found in a small volume.  This is my one complaint for this location. Other than that, Fry's is my grocery of choice.
