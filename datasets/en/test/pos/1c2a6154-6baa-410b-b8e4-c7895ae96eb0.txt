Went to see "The Butterfly Garden" presented by the Italian traveling group TPO.  This was such a treat!  It was basically aimed towards a very young audience, so I took my 9 year old.  She absolutely loved it.  

Very unique presentation preformed with amazing display of light, sound, touch and music.  They interacted with the children in the small and intimate setting, (we sat on cushions, on the stage, around their set), to assist them in their presentation of the life of a caterpillar/butterfly.  The technology on the sensitive mat responed to the actors movements & their actions were picked up with an over-head light projection sensor as well.  

It's too bad they were only in town for a few days because I think anyone who missed bringing their minion to this specail treat really missed out on a very cool production!
