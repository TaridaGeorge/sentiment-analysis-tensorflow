We haven't been here in a while, too far, but, tonight decided to make the drive.

This is an extremely comfortable place to eat, the booths and the lighting have been redone since my last visit.

The quality of the food and the service are both really great here.  The house crispy chicken and the Chinese broccoli in oyster sauce are my favorites.  The others had beef chow fun and pho 19.  The spring rolls here are somehow better than all the other spots with what seems to be the SAME ingredients.  

Laurie still remembered us and what we  like after almost a year.  We will be back soon.
