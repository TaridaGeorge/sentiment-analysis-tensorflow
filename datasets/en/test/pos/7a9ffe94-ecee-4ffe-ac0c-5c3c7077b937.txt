I had one of their numerous specials.  Very reasonably priced for the midwest portions that arrive piping hot to my table.  I chose one of the dishesthey are known for, biscuits and gravy.  For $3.99 I chowed down on one over easy egg and a single biscuit with scrumptious gravy.  By no means was it visually appealing but was it good!!! The bisciut was buttery and the gravy had just the perfect ratio of pepper to sausage.  The clientele was mostly of the older generation, great place to read the paper and shoot the bull with strong coffee in hand.  The waitresses were what I expected, like talking to an old friend.  I took a piece of their bread pudding home, something else they're known for.  Great place!! Wish I lived closer to this little gem, perfect place for a stop when we're out on our motorcycles!
