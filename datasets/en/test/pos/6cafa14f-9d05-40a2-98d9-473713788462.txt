So in love with Lux! Trendy doesn't quit cover it. People watching is priceless. Chill environment. Great, food coffee and wine. Mac and cheese with jalapenos and bacon is unreal! Sport (football, basketball, ect...) in the back room on a huge screen entertains my son and boyfriend so I can get some chill time in. Staff is so friendly and personable. Thoroughly impressed!
