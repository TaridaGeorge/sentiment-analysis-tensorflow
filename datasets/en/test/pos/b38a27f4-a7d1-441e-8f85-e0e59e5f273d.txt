Vanessa Fierro has been my stylist since 1999, when I met her at a charity cut-a-thon. Her and Angie founded Angessa 4 years ago. It is by far one of the best  full-scale salons, and offers everything from superior hair cuts and color from multiple product lines. Other services that are offered include airbrush Tans (Jen is the best), make up application, and an aesthetician for massage therapy and facials and a nail technician. I love Vanessa, and am fortunate to have found such a fantastic salon!
