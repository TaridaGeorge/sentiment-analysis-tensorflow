This is the neatest shop!  Southwest Gardener has lots of wonderful gardening products.  In addition they have affordable gift ideas.  Amy and Lynn own Southwest Gardener and they are both wonderful women.  To me it is always great supporting a local business - especially one that is owned by women.  My favorite part of Southwest Gardener is the terrific array of classes offered on weekends.  So far I have made a clock and a mosaic tile table.  I have absolutely no experience in making items such as these however my end products looked like masterpieces thanks to the great instructors!  My husband has taken the gardening classes.  These include classes on tomatoes, vegetables and composting.  I really cannot praise this place enough.  It has become one of my favorite spots in Phoenix.
