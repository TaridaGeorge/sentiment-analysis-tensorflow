This is our watering hole in Mesa.  They are good because:  a.) wide beer selection and they serve copious amounts if you so choose; b.) they have pasties AND good salads which is a rare find in Mesa; c.) they place just as copious amounts of Iron Maiden and have a free jukebox for that matter; and d.) consistent, friendly wait staff.  

Any given night you will see an odd combination of young and aged East Valley hipsters; parental types and the working happy hour crowd.  They all get along and there is always a fair amount of seating available.  At night they light candles which gives some unique ambiance that can't really be found in Az.
