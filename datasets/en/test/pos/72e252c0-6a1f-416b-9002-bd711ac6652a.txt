This place transformed our life!  We are vegetarian, but wanted to give the raw thing a try.  I was very impressed with the creative, delicious meals and desserts!  My kids were even impressed (ages 6 and 8).  The dishes are a little pricey, but I am willing to pay because I know that a lot of effort, time and quality ingredients go into making this type of food.  I love the food, the atmosphere and the nice people that work there.  I will always try to work in a visit here when I come to Phoenix!
