With that name, they're not exactly serving corned beef and cabbage... the food is excellent, one of the best Italian restaurants I've been to in Phoenix.  The two story eatery is well laid out, the staff is friendly, cheerful and attentive.  I've been there with small parties, large parties, and never been dissappointed.
