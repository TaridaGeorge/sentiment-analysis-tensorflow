It's wonderful to once again have excellent BBQ in South Phoenix :-D

We had the moist brisket, sausage, sweet corn, and pinto beans.  The brisket had a wonderful mild flavor and doesn't need sauce unless you want a bolder flavor.  The sausage was delicious and made a great sandwich in the white bread with onions and sauce.  The corn and beans were delicious!

The setting is cozy and casual and the staff were great.  One minor complaint was that the unsweetened tea was over-brewed to the point of being bitter.  That aside, we loved it and we'll be back!
