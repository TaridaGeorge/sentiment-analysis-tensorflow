This place is great!

My girlfriend and I came here for the first time to check it out since we had a gift card.  We came in later on a Friday and were seated right away.  Our server, Bri, was awesome and very attentive.  Being in the service industry myself, I appreciated the good service.

We tried a couple of the appetizers.  The meatball trio was delicious and the caprese stack was excellent.  We then built our own thin crust pizza which was amazing.  They have daily specials and I tried one of the expresso after dinner drinks that was pretty good.

Overall, we had a great experience and will definitely go back again soon.  i recommend checking this place out if you are in the area.
