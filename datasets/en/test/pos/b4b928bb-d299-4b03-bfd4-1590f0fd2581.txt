I'm tempted not to write about this place because I don't want everyone to know about the little gem I discovered just a little north of Fashion Square. Mandy's has THE cutest selection of clothes and is so reasonable for being an independent boutique in Scottsdale. I found this store while I was desperately searching for a dress to wear to my friends wedding. I was ready to spend $150, ended up with the cutest dress for $88. Since I had already been prepared to spend $150, I didn't feel so bad buying another dress for the evening before! Although I was on a mission for a dress, I did peep out some cute shirts and jeans on the rack that will most likely be in my closet after I get my next pay check.
