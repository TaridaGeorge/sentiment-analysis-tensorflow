AWESOME!
This place is located in a nice cozy corner in the plaza on the SE corner of Thomas and Hayden.  They do such a great job on your nails and they last forever!  Not sure f they use some special serum to make them stay but-by god-it stays.  Plus, they have a movie playing every time, not just muted TV so you can actually sit back and enjoy your service with some entertainment.  I always end up watching something new as the owner goes to Blockbuster twice a week to have the newest releases there for everyone.
Even cooler-they have tanning beds there, do waxing and eye brow shaping.  This place is 'da bomb (and you know it's true because i never use that term ;) 

Hope this review helps put it on the map some more because they are so friendly and affordable. You'll love it.
