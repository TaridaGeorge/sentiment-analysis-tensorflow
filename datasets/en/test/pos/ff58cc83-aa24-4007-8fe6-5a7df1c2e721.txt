I don't say this lightly: Top Design Nails is my favorite business in a shady strip mall in Phoenix.  $25 for a thorough yet efficient manicure and pedicure.  I've been about 4 times, and have yet to have a mediocre experience.  The women are friendly, the place is very clean, the color selection looks solid, and the service is quick (except for the leisurely leg massage - dream).
