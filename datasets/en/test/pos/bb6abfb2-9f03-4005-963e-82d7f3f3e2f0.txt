This review corresponds to my first Check-In to Oregano's. 

Outside of the wait times, I've not had a bad experience @ Oreganos. The food was good, the people were friendly and I had a good time. This visit was no exception. Even when my wife got meat in her minestrone soup, the situation was handled impressively well. I've known for years that my wife is a VERY picky eater when dining out, she left all smiles and so did I.

It's one of few places I go to with "stuff" on the walls that I don't find obnoxious.  

Keep up the good work.
