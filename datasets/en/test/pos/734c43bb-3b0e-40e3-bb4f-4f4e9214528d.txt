Don't let the negative reviews about "Methode Bistro" affect your decision to dine there. The restaurant is off the charts!!! The cuisine is exquisite and the service is impeccable. I had the squab and foie gras appetizer (by the way, methode is one of the few places in town that actually serves foie gras now that Mary Elaine's and Marquesa are closed). 

The Paella entree was so robust in flavor - and by far the best and most well seasoned dish I haved had in any restaurant. Presentation was stunning and the flavors were amazing.

My only complaint, which does not even fault the restaurant is that the serving of foie gras are too small. Keep up the good work and best wishes for continued success.
