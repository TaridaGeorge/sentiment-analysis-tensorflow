I love this joint. The teriyaki chicken plate/bowl is superb. Prices are a tad high for a fast food-type format, but they deliver with HUGE portions of good food. They even have a teriyaki tap near the utensils for those of us who want to add a bit more.. cool. I've also tried & like the yakisoba noodles, and I've heard good reviews on the sushi items from friends. Good stuff, highly recommended.
