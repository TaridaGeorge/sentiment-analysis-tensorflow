Just had an amazing even at Zoe's Kitchen and was off the charts!!!  Our guest loved the food, the atmosphere and the friendly staff!  Even our the staff at our office eats there twice a week.  The food is fresh and healthy and the price meets the quaility.  Would recommend Zoe's to anyone.  My favorite so far is there Chicken pita pizza. Yum!!!
