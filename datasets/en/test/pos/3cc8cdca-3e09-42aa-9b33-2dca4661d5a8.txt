Changing Hands rocks! Their staff is very knowledgeable, the prices are fair, they offer more than just books (lots of fun trinkets), they bring in some great authors (I've met Hillary Clinton and John McCain for example), and for writers, they offer some great writer's workshops. Oh, and the children's section is well stocked. If they don't have it or can't get it, it doesn't exist!
