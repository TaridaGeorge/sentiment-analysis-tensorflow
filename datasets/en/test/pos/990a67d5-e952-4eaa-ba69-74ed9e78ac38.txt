This place is absolutely amazing.  If you are looking for a quick sweet treat this is the place to go.  It a little hole-in-the-wall looking place, but once you take a bite into one of their homemade ice cream sandwiches, your mind will change.  I usually go for the mint ice cream with chocolate chip cookie, but when it's fall, I can't pass up the pumpkin ice cream with snicker doodle cookie. I've never found anything like it since.
