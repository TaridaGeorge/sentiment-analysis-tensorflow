This is a beautiful, modern library. It lets in a lot of natural light for reading. It was built to reflect Arizona's geology (sun, canyon formations, etc.) and you will notice the "canyon walls" feel in the atrium. The outside resembles a mesa from the side. There is a large collection of books (though you will find a more scholarly/academic selection at Hayden Library at ASU Main) and plenty of space for reading. Floor-to-roof windows cover the north and south ends of the building and whether or not you wish to do any reading you will get great views of Downtown and Midtown Phoenix from the top floor.
