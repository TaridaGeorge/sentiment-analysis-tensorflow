A wonderful experience.   Extremely well done, and well worth the admission.   Young children will be bored, but older kids will get some great lessons in cultural understanding and geography.  The musical instruments are arranged by country, and the exhibits include sound and video via an excellent system.  Plan at least 3-4 hours (or more).   Even then, you'll not have enough time to take it all in.
