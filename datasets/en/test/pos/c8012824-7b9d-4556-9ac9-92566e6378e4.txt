This place rocks!  What a great find!!!  The menu is wonderful and interesting.  Ask to sit in Sam's section- you won't be disappointed by the fabulous service he gives.  He adds to the experience.  Try the avocado margarita, avocado soup and table side guacamole.  Everything our table ordered was wonderful.  Can't wait to go back next time we are in the area!
