If you're a fan of Macy's INC brand, this is the Macy's you need to hit up.  Confirmed by a manager there, this location at Fiesta Mall has the largest inventory and highest sales volume.  I adore this brand because my entire wardrobe consists mainly of brightly colored retro-looking dresses made by INC that I can throw in the washing machine.  Also, Macy's merchandise is constantly on sale and if you find something you like but don't want to pay full price for, just come back a few weeks later and you can get it 25-65% off.
