Absolutely fantastic pizza! I can't eat gluten and so I don't get to eat pizza very often, but Spinatos' gluten free pizzas are absolutely gourmet! The nice thing too is that they deliver in Tempe, so if I get a craving for pizza (or everyone else is eating gluten-filled pizza and I can't stand it:-),  I can order pizza to go (or to be delivered). Awesome!!!
