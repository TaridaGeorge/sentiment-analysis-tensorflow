So I've been looking for a good place to smoke hookah since I moved out here from California. I've tried other places but always left disappointed.  My friends and I were hesitant to try this place because it wasn't on Yelp.  Shortly after we realized that was a damn shame because these guys are awesome. 

Their hookah is amazing. No burning and always hits strong. The environment is dark but not too dark.  They have an awesome selection with 45 flavors. There was music playing at a perfect level. They offered world class customer service. From my experience at hookah lounges, that is a rarity. Its conveniently located right across from the Tempe Improv and right behind Devil's Advocate Bar. They also stay open late so if you get kicked from Devil's Advocate at 2am roll on over and smoke some fine shisha.
