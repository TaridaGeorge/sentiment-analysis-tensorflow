This is the best bar atmosphere in The Valley and the best barfood I've ever had.  It's actually an insult to even call it barfood.  The service is great too - Kim's my favorite but this other guy that looks like Jesus is also really good.

If you don't try the pretzels (share) and check out the daily-specials menu, you're missing out.  2 meals + 7 drinks = $41.  Nice.
