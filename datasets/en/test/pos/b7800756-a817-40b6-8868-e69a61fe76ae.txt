Over the past few weeks Becketts Table came up in conversations with friends and clients. I had to try it. Date night with my wife. 
We started with the Grilled Cheese Sandwich with Tomato/ Red Pepper soup.It was as good as people told me it was. 
My wife had the OsoBuco. It was so tender and flavorful. 
I had the Sheperds Pie. The beef melted in my mouth while the mashed potatos gave me comfort.
We finished with the Bacon Smor's with a nice Tani Port. Great combo. 
The entire staff was very friendly and helpful especially Our waiter. On our way out we spoke to Chef Justin Beckett. He was not only talented but a very nice host.
