I went during their happy hour and really enjoyed it.  They have a a ton of different varieties, the sushi is fresh and light tasting.  The ambiance is inviting, the happy hour prices are very reasonable, and the servers are attentive.  This will definitely become one of my new favorite dinner spots.
