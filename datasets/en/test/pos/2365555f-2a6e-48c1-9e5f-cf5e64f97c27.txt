Checked this place out the other night, and I must say I was impressed. Their happy hour was ridiculously cheap. I got the pork sliders and they were definitely a meal on their own. They had those packed with so much meat I was stuffed after one (but that didn't stop me from eating the other and the chili fries)!

Cool atmosphere, friendly staff, good prices and food.
