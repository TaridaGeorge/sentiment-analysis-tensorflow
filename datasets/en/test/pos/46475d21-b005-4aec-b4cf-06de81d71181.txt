We went here for the Slow Food Phoenix wine tasting with Eric Glomski from Arizona Stronghold/Paige Springs Vineyards.  The food they served with the wine tasting was insane.  It was fig, apple and brie bruschetta, and the most gorgeous local tomato, basil and pomegranate salad.  Anyway, after the wine tasting, we got a table and ordered their 20 dollar bottle and bruschetta special, which is a selection of 4 bruschettas and a bottle of anything on the menu.   First of all its a smokin deal, and the bruschetta is great, and there are like, 10 to choose from.  I highly recommend it!
