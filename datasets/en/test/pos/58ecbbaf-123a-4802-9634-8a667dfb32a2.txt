This place has authentic Szechwan cuisine.  People who are used to pseudo-Szechwan cuisine from other restaurants will find some differences.  Be sure to try their Water Boiled Fish Filet with Chili pepers.  This dish comes in a bowl (as it looks more like a soup) and is topped with cilantro.  I tried it for lunch and will definately return for dinner.  They don't have alcohol yet but have applied for their permit.
