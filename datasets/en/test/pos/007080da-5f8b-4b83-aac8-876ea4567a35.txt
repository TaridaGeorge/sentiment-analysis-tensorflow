The food is amazing. The price is amazing for what you get.
I mean think about it. It is cooked in front of you, it is quality. You are surrounded by positive energy. I rarely have a bad experience at Benihana. They always make you feel welcome.

It is definitely worth the price in my opinion. And in Benihanas defense. People say that $35 for a plate is expensive.. Remember. for $35 you usually get some seafood. Shrimp, Hibachi rice. veggies a salad and greentea. So you get lots and lots with there $35 meal.

If you haven't gone there yet. Go!!!!!!!!! You will love it.
