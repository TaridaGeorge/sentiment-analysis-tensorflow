Wow! Awesome place. Soo cute and unbelievable service. Brought my dog in. The owners were in the front. They walked me though their options. I chose to wash my own dog. They have the best smelling shampoos and sprays. Even a pet dryer. We cleaned ears and brushed  teeth!!!  They had aprons so I could look clean when I left too! Ha ha

Best is they have top food and it's way cheaper than PetsMart and I can get a free bag!! I LOVE this place!!! Kinda didn't want to leave. They need chairs for people to sit and visit! Lol
