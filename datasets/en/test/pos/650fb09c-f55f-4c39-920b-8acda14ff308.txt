I wanted a quick dinner to bring back home and stopped here. I got their gyro combo and substituted a side salad for fries. To start - gyro was awesome. Filled with a good mix of beef and lamb. The sauce was great on it too. Side salad - perfect sized cut up green peppers and cucumbers.  Dressing came on side and was just right. Grabbed baklava for dessert - get it. They use slightly cut up candied pistachios for part of the filling. 

I'll go back for sure. One of my favorite Greek places in town.
