Wow! What an awesome experience.... I bought my treadmill here a week and a half ago and got a used one for about half the price of the exact same new one I saw at another store. It is in really good shape and the salesperson showed me how to use it. Very knowledgable, clean store, and great prices. I will definitely go there first when I need something else sports related. They have a lot of items related to softball and hockey for my kids. Would highly recommend:)
