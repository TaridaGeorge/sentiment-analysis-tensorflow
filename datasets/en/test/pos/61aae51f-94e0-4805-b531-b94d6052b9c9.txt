Whether it is Art Walk or just any day I love shopping or looking at the galleries in Downtown Scottsdale. I cannot yet say I have even been to most of them because there are so many! All of the galleries I have been to have been really cool with amazing one of a kind pieces. All of the owners have been very nice to me which is cool. I guess I have this stereotype that all people who work in galleries will see I'm young and can't afford anything and will be snooty to me. Not the case though! Great way to kill a day, and really fun to do the art walk at night which has a great energy!
