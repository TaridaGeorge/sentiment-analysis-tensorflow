The list of Tuck Shop awesomeness keeps growing. Three words: "ginger ale" and "dessert." 

Each are worth every calorie! 

I had always skipped dessert here because the novel cookie dough bite was enough to satisfy; but, then, I had a bite of someone's cake here and it was fantastic! 

So fantastic, the memory of it compelled me to encourage a dinner companion to pass on dessert at a northeast Scottsdale (we're talking practically Fountain Hills) restaurant and make the trek to Tuck Shop JUST for dessert! 

Unfortunately, it was a Monday and they were closed so I had to go with an alternate. Point remains: the dessert inspired the drive. Keep sharing your food and save room for dessert!
