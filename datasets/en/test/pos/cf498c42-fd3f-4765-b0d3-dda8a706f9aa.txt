I really like the casual cool atmosphere of the Oregano's locations. I know you shouldn't like the wait but here it feels like you're at a backyard bbq. It's like you're just chilling waiting in your Adirondack chair or sitting on the retaining wall with your friends/family. Just a very kick back chill pizza place.  Can't beat the lunch time deals at this Tempe location. The service is quick the pizza always de-lish. Love me some thin crispy pizza & frosty Four Peaks beer. The golden wings are the best wings on the menu. Love these little fried devils. The sauce is perfection it's sweet, tangy, spicey just awesomeness. I'm trying to figure out how I can rationalize eating some for dinner right now & i't's not even noon yet. Mmm mmm good.
