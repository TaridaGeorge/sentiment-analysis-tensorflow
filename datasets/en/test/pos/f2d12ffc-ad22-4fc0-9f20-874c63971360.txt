Soft opening, so still working out the kinks. Food was deelish. 
Scallop poppers- crispy and spicy; not at all greasy
Honey chicken-a little sticky but so good
Teriyaki chicken-subtler than other places' teriyaki, but much better flavor and chicken was tender
"tootzi" roll- bursting with flavor and rolled perfectly
Nice touches with cucumber water, upscale Asian decor, unique glasses, menus, plates, etc.
Will definitely be back.
