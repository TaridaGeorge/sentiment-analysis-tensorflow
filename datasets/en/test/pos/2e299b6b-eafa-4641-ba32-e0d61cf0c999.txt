Why anyone goes to regular movie theatres, I don't know. After going to a place with comfortable seats, food and alcohol, I just can't go back.
I love the healthy food being available--but ordered the korean tacos and their pizzas are worth trying. The drinks are good- cocktails are just the right amount of strong and their beer has never been stale. Tuesday night special (at least I think its Tuesday) is All You Can Eat pizza, couple that with a pitcher of beer and a good movie and it's a great weekday night.
