I don't care how much it costs. I'll never see another movie in anything other than their cinema suites again. Ever.

I love their leather recliners! They are just as comfortable as the one at your grandparents house. Plus, you get beer delivered to you at the touch of a button and prices are surprisingly reasonable (4 for a pint of domestic, 5 for imports). Plus, you get a sample of specialty popcorn, a warm towel, and a Ghirardelli chocolate on your way out. 

It can get crowded in the evenings, so you might want to consider purchasing your tickets ahead of time.

Don't go expecting AMC to serve you a gourmet meal unless you think Applebee's is a real treat.
