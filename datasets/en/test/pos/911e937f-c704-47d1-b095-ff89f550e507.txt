Love Love Love this place. I always take visitors here and they also love it. You simply can't go wrong. Some of my favorites are the portebello mushroom burger, veggie pizza, tuna sandwich, and sweet potato fries. You should def come here on your birthday because you get a $10 credit toward your meal.
