I walked in the door and was greeted by some sweet little honey whose name I can't recall right now. And then after by Allison who did a photo op with my flat Stanley that I was taking around town to do this and that. This shop has a little of this and a little of that. A really cool Phoenix gift shop with unique and interesting little gifts that you're not going to find just anywhere. The people that work there are friendly and wonderful and are part of the eclectic little neighborhood that you find just east of third Street and just south of Roosevelt. A great find...! Go check it out and spend some money.
