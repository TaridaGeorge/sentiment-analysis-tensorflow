This is VERY authentic Scandinavian food!
We have been to Sweden multiple times and, since moving to Phoenix, have bemoaned the fact that there is no Scandinavian food (unless you count IKEA).  I was thrilled to discover this place.

The pytt i panna and Laxpudding both were seasoned very similar to dishes we've ate in Sweden.  Delicious!

Let us also say that we've ate at very posh Scandinavian restaurants in New York City and this is, by far, the most authentic Swedish food we've tried.  The family who runs Beaver Choice is warm, helpful, and accommodating.  We will be going back frequently.
