If you've spent time in China before, GO!  This is the real deal and not for the "Orange Chicken/Panda Express" crowd.  It doesn't get any more authentic than this place and you can easily forget you're in the US upon walking inside.  I can see where it would be a turn off if you're seeking Mongolian Beef and an Egg Roll.  But if you know what real Chinese food is and enjoy that, you will be in heaven here.  Definitely ask for the Chinese menu.  That's where all the good stuff is.  This is probably my favorite Chinese restaurant around.
