The $5 wine by the glass every afternoon is such a total win I still can't get over it. Went there before a flight last week to kill time and it was an awesome vibe--pretty full at 1pm on a Wednesday. Friendly bartenders--and did I mention wine is $5 a glass every afternoon? (Beer is also $5 per pitcher.) Try the sparkling sauvignon blanc. 

Made me want to buy a house in walking distance and move in.
