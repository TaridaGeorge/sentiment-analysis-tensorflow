after another 2 weekends of somewhat gluttonous living, we had to come here to get our greens fix. 

i just love this place. the greens and fixins are so fresh. and they try to update every now and then so that you have squash or beets or jicama. 

the soups for the november selection were delicious and tasty, but mostly non-vegetarian. the pumpkin dessert for november was so delicious. 

of course we'll be back. but they do keep raising the prices...not long ago, it was only 7.99., then 9.99, now 10.99. one funny caveat, if you don't like kids or old people, then stay away. it's full of em.
