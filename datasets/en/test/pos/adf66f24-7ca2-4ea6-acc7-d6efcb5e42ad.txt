A little island of sanity in the Scottsdale club scene! This small bar is located a few block east of Suede and has no cover (at the time). Furnished with a combination of tables an bar chairs and coffee tables and couches, it is a relaxing yet sophisticated. It has a rap for being too upscale, but it doesnt feel that way when your there. Its just not a meat market!! Lots of singles there, but its more of a laid back feel rather than high pressure selling (translation: expect to talk to lots of people, but leave your cheezeball lines at home)
