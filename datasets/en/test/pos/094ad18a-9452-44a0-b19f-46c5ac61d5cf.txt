Alright you got me- FLW is one of my favorite artists- his materials are just different from most- but the influence and experience is the same!  This place was named after the first he built- in WI (but its demise led to his wife's death)- fueled by this grief- led him not to rebuild on the same site-but  chose this one- a sanctuary and a teaching institution for his apprentices- also to be his stepping stone to eternity. 
I love the incongruities that equalizes the symmetry- its allure of Fallingwater and the furnishing he designed himself...A DEFINITE MUST!
