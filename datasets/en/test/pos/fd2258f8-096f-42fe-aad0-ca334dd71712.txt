I went and had some cavities filled today plus my teeth cleaned. Normally, I loathe going to the dentist. I was praying this would not be very painful. I am so pleased to say, it was over lickety split! It did not hurt a bit! The dentist was great and his dental hygienist was so nice and entertaining. It made the time go by so quickly!
