Okay, I'm a little biased because I met the exec chef and visited CCiao with him last weekend when I was in Phoenix, so I was a little like "wheeee!" The bartender mixed some drinks to jive with what I'd been previously imbibing at a previous bar (tasty), and the kitchen sent out CCiao's signature dish - the exotic mushroom pan fry. Delicious and totally filling. Followed by buffalo carpaccio (any kind of carpaccio is my weakness - this is rubbed in espresso and cumin), a sampling of pork belly (delicious), seared scallops (my god, yum), and a dessert of fig cookies and a dense flan that I simply wish I could have eaten more of. The atmosphere is cozy, stylish, comforting. Sit at the bar, grab a drink and catch out what's happening in the kitchen. If only there were a Cowboy Ciao in Denver!
