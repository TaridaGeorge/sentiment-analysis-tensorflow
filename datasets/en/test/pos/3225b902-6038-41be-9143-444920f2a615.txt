Their burgers are great but I've never been one to go out of my way for one. I get the double double with cheese protein AND animal style. YUM!
Now, I normally wouldn't review a chain like this but I was so impressed the last time we went I had to share.
There was 5 of us, all ordering something just SLIGHTLY different than anyone else, all different drinks and sizes, some combo meals some just the burger, some protein style others just animal or (like mine) both. It was a Thursday and the line was long. LONG.
I mean like really lllllllllllooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnggggggggggg.
It was almost as long as when the chain first came to AZ.
But they kept it moving quickly and got our order PERFECT.
I just wish they'd do something about their fries already!
