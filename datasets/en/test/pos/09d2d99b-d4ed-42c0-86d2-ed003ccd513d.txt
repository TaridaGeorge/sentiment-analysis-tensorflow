The best steak I have eaten in the US.

We ate there twice while we were in town for a training class. Both times the filet was like butter, you didnt even need a knife. 

The cheesecake was very yummy as well. 

I dont remember which sides I had with my steak, that could be due to the fact that they weren't all that great or it was because I was so focused on my delicious steak. 

If I ever travel to AZ again, I will make sure I stop here to eat.
