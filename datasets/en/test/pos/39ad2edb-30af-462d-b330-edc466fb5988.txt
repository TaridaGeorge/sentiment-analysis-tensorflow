Sprouts is a great place to shop. Such a good selection of all healthy foods. I love the Rice Bread here. That i would say is my favorite. Oh of course the Buffalo Meat as well. 
The vitamins and herbs are really great. They may have the best selection I have ever seen.   The food prices are a bit high i have to say . Though you can go here and get everything that you need at once rather than shop around all the time.
They do give you .5 cents off for each bag you use that is your own. Which is something and 1 or2 times a year they will give you i think 40% the supplements.
 Big Parking lot with lots of room. Nice and clean as well inside the store.
