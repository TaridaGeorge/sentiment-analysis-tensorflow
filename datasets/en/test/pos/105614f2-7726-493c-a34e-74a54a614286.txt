For me this place is perfect for lunch.  

Cheap, good food and lunchtime portions of sushi on the side.  Clean, quick and friendly staff.  Can get hot during lunch because of the angle of the glass windows. 

They have a steamed vegetable dish with brown rice for very little money which makes a perfect everyday fast meal which is ideal if you want to stay away from fried and burgers.   

The fact that they have quick small cheap portions of sushi to go on the side if fantastic. 

THANKS FOR ALSO PLAYING KLOVE loud and proud which is unusual for a business these days, extra star cause of that.
