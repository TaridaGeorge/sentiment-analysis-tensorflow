Their food is great, both dine-in and take out.  Speedy service for the people that have a short lunch break.  I really enjoy their sweet nut curry.  Their kung pao, cashew nut, yellow curry are good too.  Look forward to going thru the rest of their menu.  Very nice people working there too.  Keep up the great work!
