It's time to rewind and dine!!!  I used to hit this place up on a regular basis for the sheer amount of food and drink you can down on the happy hour..  After a short visit back the memories started pouring back just as a clear and heavy as the drinks they dish out!!!!  Any of the appetizers are amazing during the happy hour and the crowds whether they are there or not doesn't even matter because the bartenders are awesome conversationalists.  I LOVE the feel of the restaurant.  Its kind of a dungeon when you first come in with a distinct scent but mehhhh it's damn good once you get down and grubbin'.
