This is the best Thai food that we have eaten in Arizona, California, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, and Arkansas. Whenever we go somewhere (we used to travel between 280 and 300 days a year) we eat Thai food and usually try as many different restaurants as we can. 

The spicy basil pumpkin is excellent as is the sweet sausage fried rice. Their coconut ice cream is amazing and so are the fried bananas. We normally don't eat dessert but tried one and now could easily crave it.
