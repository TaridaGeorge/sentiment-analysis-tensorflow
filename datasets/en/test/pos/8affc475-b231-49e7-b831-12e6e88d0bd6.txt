A Michael Mina Classic. I have wanted to try a Mina restaurant for a long time and thanks to friends Bil and Lorita I got my chance last week. All I can say is this..duck fat fried french fries with white truffle dipping sauce, warm rosemary and truffle bread, fillet mignon, awesome Pinot and great service. The menu even included a variety of specialty steaks including Kobe Fillet Mignon $175. We had a great time the decor and service rocked. Great place for business or romantic dinner
