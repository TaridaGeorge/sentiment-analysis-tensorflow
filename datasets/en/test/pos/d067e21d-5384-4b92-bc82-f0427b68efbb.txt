Tell you the truth I was extremely nervous to try a Cornish Pasty, but boy am I glad I did. I have never been to the University location but I can tell you that this one is awesome! It is interesting to learn about where the Pasty originated and that story is told in all of the menus. 

My meal of choice is the Cajan Chicken and a ice cold english hard cider to wash it down.
