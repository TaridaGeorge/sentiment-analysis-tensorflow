I'm from Chicago and a friend recommended this place. In a word WOW. 

We made reservations so had no problem being seated. Christine our waitress was incredibly attentive, and knowledgeable and suggested items due to my food allergies. 

I loved all the memorabilia, felt like I was back home the minute I walked through the door. 

Both my friend and I had steaks. We agreed it was probably the best steak we've had in a long time. Cooked to perfection everything from beginning to end was delicious. Portions are large and I could not finish my meal. 

I will definitely be back next time I'm in Scottsdale.
