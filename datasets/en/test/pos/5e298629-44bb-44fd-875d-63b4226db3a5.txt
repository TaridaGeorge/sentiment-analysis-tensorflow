Great little spot.  Very calm and inviting just walking in, with the high ceilings and old wood floors.  Nan is always welcoming as well.  Space is small, but not in a negative way, feels like a perfect size for its purpose.  Twice I've done the Friday night yoga nidra taught by Elise, and it was wonderful.  Planning to come back also on Tuesdays for the kids yoga for my daughter.
