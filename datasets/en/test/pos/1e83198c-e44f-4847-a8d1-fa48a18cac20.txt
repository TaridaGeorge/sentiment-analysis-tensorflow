Excellent customer service mixed with amazing clothes!  

I love it when I go shopping and the owner of the store assists you with a smile, let's you shop without hovering over you and makes excellent recommendations that you missed!!

I found so many cute clothes - - it was hard to restrain myself from spending all my money!!  Items are moderately priced but worth it when you consider you are supporting a local entrepreneur and the independent, local designers that sell their clothes there on consignment.  

I'll definitely be back soon!  I hope they still have this cute jacket I didn't buy . . .yikes!
