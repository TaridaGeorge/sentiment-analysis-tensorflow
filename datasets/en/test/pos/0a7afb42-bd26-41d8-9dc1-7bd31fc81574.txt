Switch is awesome. The reviews are true. Really cool place. Was in town on business looking for something close to my hotel and lucked out with Switch.
Staff is incredible. Every time I am in Phoenix I am coming here!
Believe me on this one, its not on the menu so you have to ask for the Southwest Hanger Steak. Best thing I have ever eaten.
