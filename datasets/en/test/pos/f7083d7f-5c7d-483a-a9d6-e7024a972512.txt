After a delightful experience at Windsor, we decided to walk the 20 steps next door and check out Churn.

Glad we did, it was fantastic! Two scoops of Coffee ice cream in a waffle cone was the perfect conclusion to a great meal! Great coffee flavor and the ice cream was the perfect consistency, yum! We also ordered an ice cream cookie, snickerdoodle cookie with coffee ice cream, which was equally splendid. 

Its Windsor and Churn for the one-two-punch of dining :)
