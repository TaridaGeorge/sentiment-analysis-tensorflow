I spent the entire weekend at the rink for the turkey shoot tournament. This is our third year at the tournament and each year, 18 degrees proves to be such a great additive to the ice rink. 

Throughout the weekend, we had our team pizza party, happy hour in the bar, the breakfast buffet and football on the couch.

All the service I experienced was amazing. The feel of the restaurant is warm and homey. Each booth has their own TV for whatever sport, or cartoon, you want. The quality of food is good. Nothing to write home about but amazing for an ice rink. The prices are affordable. 

I recommend visiting 18 degrees if you have time to spare at the rink.
