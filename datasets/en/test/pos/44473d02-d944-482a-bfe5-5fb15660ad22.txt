I love strolling through the market kind of reminds me some of the ones in California.  The vegetables are fresh and the roses are lovely.  I wish there were more flower vendors though but I get the fact that we live in a desert.  I have yet to try a roach coach or truck vendor at this market.  hmm maybe next visit.
