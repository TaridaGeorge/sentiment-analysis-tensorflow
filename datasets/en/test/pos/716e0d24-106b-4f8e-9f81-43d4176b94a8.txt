Man, I was really excited to give your shop another go. I was very impressed that someone came outside to see how our food was, you don't always see that at what we like to call a quick serve resto... I call this my "thank you, baby jesus" restaurant when my head is still in my hands from other restaurants that miss the mark. I had the Arizona burger, and it fell apart on me... I wanted to bust out the knife and fork... Then there was the smash fries, too, oh yeah... I love you guys, and yes, I am a fan for sure...
