They have a better than most in-stock flooring selection.  Drove all over Gilbert and Mesa to find that out.  The man in the flooring section was so very helpful.  I found what I wanted a week ago, but came in last night and it was gone.  He went to check a few places and was willing to pull out a brand new roll if he had it.
