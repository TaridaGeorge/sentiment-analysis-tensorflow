Not really much for me say hear...fresh doughnuts....great prices....you can get 6 doughnuts of your choice for under 5 bucks....WOW. Pretty good service....indoor and outdoor seating to enjoy your dougnuts...but they are only open from 4am to 3pm so if you want the best doughnuts get there early or before 2pm or they will be generally out of what you want....because I don't believe they make any more fresh doughnuts after 2pm. No doubt these are the best Doughnuts in the valley...maybe in the entire state of Arizona.  Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!! This is review number 200 for me...I am so happy....wohoo!!!
