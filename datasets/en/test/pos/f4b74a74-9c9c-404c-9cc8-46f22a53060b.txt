I did like this place a lot. Given that it wasn't crowded when we went there we also received some good service and great recommendation from the chef. We ordered their garlic bread, the special pizza and the tiramisu topped off with the house wine.

All came out perfect. If i wanted to quibble, I would suggest a bit more seasoning (and roasting of garlic) on their garlic concoction. I wouldn't rank this above Bianco's but given that the wait time and service overall a much better experience here. Sometimes the wait times at Bianco's really get to me.
