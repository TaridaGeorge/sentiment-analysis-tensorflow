SMEEEKS! I do love this place. It's a great place to find fun knick-knack toys and it has lots of fun candy to choose from. It's great because a lot of the candy is more old fashioned - it feels like you're in an old-school candy store.

The staff is nice and they always have lots of sodas to choose from to go along with your candy.

They are a little more expensive than going to walmart to pick up some candy, but they are a local store! I  love to support local and recommend you do too!
