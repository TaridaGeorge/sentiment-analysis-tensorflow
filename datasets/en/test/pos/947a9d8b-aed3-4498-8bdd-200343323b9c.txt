I love Michael Mina, and I love steakhouses - independently of each other.  Mr. Mina's iteration of the classic steakhouse was superb. Cocktails, alone, occupy their own separate binder (awesome), and BS has the most comprehensive wine list that I encountered while in AZ.  I had the 10 oz filet, which was pretty close to perfect, asparagus and broccolini.  The most awesome part of the meal was, by far, dessert.  The beignets should win some kind of award.  Waitstaff was lovely, as well.  Only thing I hated, and didn't really understand? Decor of the main dining room....it's tragic and confused.

Bottom line: If you're in Scottsdale, you need to experience Bourbon Steak.
