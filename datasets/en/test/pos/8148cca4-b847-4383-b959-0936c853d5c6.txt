I can't comment on the actual location, but I have to say they had the BEST tacos today at the AZ Taco Festival.  I tried 5 different tacos from various restaurants and Blanco's short rib tacos were the best of the fest by far: juicy, succulent beef on a warm, fresh corn tortilla with a spicy salsa and a little squiggle of cream = YUM. The girls serving the tacos were very nice too and I got a little card for free guac - bonus!
