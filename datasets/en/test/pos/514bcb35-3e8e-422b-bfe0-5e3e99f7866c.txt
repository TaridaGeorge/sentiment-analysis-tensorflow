Awesome!  The best run Paradise in the Valley.  Everyone that works here is so helpful and courteous.   The menu is super diverse and not too pricey.

I've ate lunch there several times....love the 1/2 sandwich and soup combo.   Great value and just right amount of food.   The cheese broccoli soup is super.
