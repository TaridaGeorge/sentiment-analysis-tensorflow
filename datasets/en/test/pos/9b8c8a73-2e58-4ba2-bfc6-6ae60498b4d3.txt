Loved it. We had the mediterrenean pizza and added artichokes. Added a bottle of pinot grigio and it was just devine.The 12" was perfect for us (both light eaters) I come from having a Northern Italian grandmother who owned a pizzaria. Piazza Al forno is the real deal. Very friendly and casual. I will be back and bring friends.
