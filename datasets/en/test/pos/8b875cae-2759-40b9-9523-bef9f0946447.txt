Galo Blanco is right down the street from my house so I frequent here quite a bit.  It is a simple straight forward menu but the flavors blend beautifully together.  The prices you simply can't beat.   The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is upbeat.  I love the roasted corn, simple but delicious!
