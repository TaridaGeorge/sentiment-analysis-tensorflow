Great old school steak house.

Awesome ambience and atmosphere!

Food was great. I had the 18oz ribeye, and it was delicious and perfectly cooked (Pittsburgh style - charred on outside and rare inside). My girlfriend had the scallops which were also excellent.

The wine list is reasonably priced and extensive. The martinis are awesome.

I've been to many high end steak houses, and Durant's is as good as it gets.
