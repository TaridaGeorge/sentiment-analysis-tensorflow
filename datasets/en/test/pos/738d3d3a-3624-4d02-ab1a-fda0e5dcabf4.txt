Place is bomb.. had the grilled Frog Legs, Lobster sushi Roll, and the seafood cobb salad for lunch.. sooooo good.. 

Been here once before and had the aligator appetizer, which was really good and also the crab stuffed shrimp.. everything was great.

Tiffany, the girl that waited on us, was really nice and very helpful as well.

Will definitely go back again !
