OMG!

THE BEST Health Food store in Phoenix, without a doubt.

Came down with the worst cough I have ever had, went in and bought the 2 items recommended by the doctor who owns the store, and my cough went away.

The doctor is VERY helpful and has restored my health several times.

I HIGHLY recommend this place and is the only place I go to get my health food vitamins and minerals.
