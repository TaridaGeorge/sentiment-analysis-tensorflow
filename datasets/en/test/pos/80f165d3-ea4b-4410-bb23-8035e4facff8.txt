We began with a drink at the bar. What a great way to start off the evening, but the best was yet to come.  We were seated at a table for dinner with a spectacular view and were able to watch a beautiful sunset. The service was outstanding and the food was some of the best we have ever had anywhere.  It was a perfect dining experience from start to finish.
