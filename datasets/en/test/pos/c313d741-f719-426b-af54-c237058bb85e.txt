I was recently married at the Windmill Winery and could not have been happier with the overall experience!  I have been in and witnessed a lot of weddings lately, and I've seen the good and the bad when it comes to wedding venues.  The Windmill Winery is absolutely at the top of the list for superior customer service, the amazing and unique experience they offer, and the value.  I would highly recommend using this venue if you want a beautiful and unforgettable experience.  The staff (Katie, Harold, Karen, Jenny) went far and above the call of duty to ensure we were pleased with our wedding.  I can't say enough about The Windmill Winery!  Also, they do wine tastings and seasonal events so even if you're not getting married, you should sign up for their emails and attend one of their fun events!!!
