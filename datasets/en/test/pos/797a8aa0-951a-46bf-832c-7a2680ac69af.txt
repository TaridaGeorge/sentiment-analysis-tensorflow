We had such an amazing meal at this place!  Everything was so fresh and delicious.  We sat at the bar and was able to watch the chefs do their thing.  It was really cool.  Our server was also amazing!  Extremely knowledgeable.  Made great suggestions!

Everything thing that we tried was great and I am still dreaming about the butterscotch pudding :)
