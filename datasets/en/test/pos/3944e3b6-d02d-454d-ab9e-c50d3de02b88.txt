This place is so cute and shabby! I am already a huge fan of vintage stuff and now I am happy to have found a new paper arts resource that satisfies my vintage shopping urges in my area of town.

Not only are the prices cheap, but I always find so many different scrapbook and artsy things when I shop here. It's not a big place, but it's in a small area of the Brass Armadillo and so worth the visit when I don't get to visit Mystic Paper in Mesa.

I already love shopping at the Brass Armadillo, so this scrapbook shop inside of it is a total bonus!
