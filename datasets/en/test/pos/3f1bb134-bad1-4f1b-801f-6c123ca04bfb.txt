i really truly respect this place as a legitimate and sanitary body modification place.
unlike most places, they don't try to mix tattoos and body piercing in one studio, and i think that adds to a facility's integrity. 
they won't pierce you if you smell like alcohol or act intoxicated or are underage. i know plenty of people who've had their holes stretched here, gotten everything you can imagine pierced, or done that implant under the skin thing and have never heard a complaint. 
there are ALWAYS peoples inside, but whether they're customers or teenagers just milling around their shop, i don't know.
