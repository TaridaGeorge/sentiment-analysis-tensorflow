Lux is my favorite, everything here is fantastic. All the barista's know your drink and have a welcome smile to see you. Pastries are made on site, ample in selection and are delicious. If you think you're too chubby for cake there's usually fresh fruit hanging around and yogurt in the mornings. Free wi-fi and free people watching are a bonus to this dimly lit and cozy atmosphere.
