I LOVE LOVE LOVE this boutique!! If you are a boutique lover and don't like to pay boutique prices this is the place.  Their collection of earrings are the most impressive.  They also have a lot of cute clothes which are unique and very cute for a night out.  The website has a handful of what they have but visiting the store is a must.  Check out the prices too...you can get a cute dress or top for a night out for under $50!!! Enjoy. Oh I forgot this store is good for little knick knack gifts.  Mostly girly stuff so guys its great for females you need to get a gift for.
