I purchased my 09 MDX at another valley Acura dealer but I like taking it here for service.  It's closer to home and I get in and out quickly.  I appreciate that they stick with Acura recommended service items, no additional "locally recommended" jobs that add into my bill.  The waiting area couldn't be much nicer; free food, coffee, pop, juice and bottled water.  So far all my service bills have been reasonable and my car is sparkling clean when they are done with it.
