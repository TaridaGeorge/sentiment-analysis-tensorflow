I went on a Tuesday around 2 pm and we didnt have any problems with parking (though I can see why one might, at a busier time), nor did we have to wait for service at all. The staff was nice, and prompt. I went with a bunch of foodie friends and they ooh'd and ahh'd over how excellent everything was, and I agreed with them. The guac was tasty (maybe not the best ever, but I'd order it again). I took a bite of the conchita pibil and I was in love with it. All of our food was really great, and we topped it off with the caramel churros (OH MY GOD, go for that alone!) and oh yea, their drinks are friggin excellent.
