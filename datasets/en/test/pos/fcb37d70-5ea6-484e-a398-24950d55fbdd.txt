It's not the greatest Chinese food in the country but for Arizona, it's definitely one of the best! I'd say the food is worth a good 4 stars but the friendly owners and the amazing wait staff make this a five star joint! I love the egg foo young, pepper steak, the chicken fruit salad, and pan fried noodles. My husband, who suffers from severe white guy syndrome, prefers the cream cheese wontons, lemon chicken, and sizzling rice soup. I never call in my take-out orders, I just walk in and within 10 minutes it's usually ready to go, no matter how big the order is! I wish they were open Sundays but the owner says if she didn't close at least one day a week she'd never get her husband out of the kitchen, lol!
