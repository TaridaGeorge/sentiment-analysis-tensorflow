this place is just amazing! the owners are sweet and always remember our order. as someone from seattle, i'm thankful to have found a place with character and community that i can make a part of my daily rounds. i have yet to be disappointed.  

top notch items to order: 
san diegan
california club
lemon whoopie

they have great wi-fi, cozy leather couch and oversized chairs plus a dreamland garden in the back to hang out in. to top off the experience, their playlists are always impressive set with death cab, minus the bear, and the like.
