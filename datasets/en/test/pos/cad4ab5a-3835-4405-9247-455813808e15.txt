I love Souvia! I have tried 20 different teas, and love them all! There are always a couple different samples to try, rotating. If I am feeling under the weather, it's like second best to Mom's. "I don't feel good balllalalffj can you help me with a soothing tea?"  Done! Pear Helene (Iced) is a favorite of my for taste, and Green Leaf Tulsi with just a pinch Morrocan Mint (iced)is like taking a trip to nirvana. Red Raspberry Leaf (hot) is another favorite, but really, I am just going to end up listing everything I have tried! I could write for another 10 minutes of all the reasons why I love Souvia, but I don't want to ruin it's enchantment! Stop by for yourself, and let's put the corporate tea store out of business!
