Good place, good people... Me and my girl go here all the time and here you will find all kinds of people and I do mean all kinds of people. Which is a good thing, I love there chowda and clams, still haven't found a damn pearl though ha... The bartenders are cool I don't really order from any anyone else but the bartenders, no reason it just happens that way skip Zuma's and the Tavern Go there! just to step outside your box for once
