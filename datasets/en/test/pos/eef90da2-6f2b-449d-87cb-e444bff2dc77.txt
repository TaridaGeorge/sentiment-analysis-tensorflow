I go here at least once a week...mostly for wine and beer. They have pretty good deals and carry some brands that even total wine or bevmo don't have.  They also have little chocolates and foods from around the world.

The layout is organized and clean. The stuff they carry will defiantly add a little somethin' somethin' to any house. I'm all for knick knacks, too. I've bought coffee cups, salad bowls and utensils, my big budda for good luck who've i've named kingston, some artwork, curtains, and more bar glasses then I need. My Bf hated me when i came home with a world market bag. Then I would pull out a a beer sampler for him and a bottle of wine for me, all smiles!
