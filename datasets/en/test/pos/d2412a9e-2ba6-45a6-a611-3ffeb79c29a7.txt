While I did not run in this event... (officially) I was happy as a clam and just as wet (IT RAINED) to show up and support all the amazing runners. 
And though I'm not really ready for my first Half Marathon just yet... I did manage to run a little towards the end...  I HAVE WITNESSES!
Maybe soon I will enter...   But Congratulations to all the runners!
