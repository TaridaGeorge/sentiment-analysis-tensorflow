This place beats Starbucks any day! Their coffee is delightful. The people are very welcoming. For the people that stop in on a daily basis, the baristas know their drink and name. To me that is the most important in developing great customer service and relationships. Free wi-fi makes this place even better. Friendly customers and just great ambiance.

Yelp can't seem to change the correct address of this place. this place, if you don't know already, it's located on NE corner of Val Vista and Guadalupe where the McDonalds is.
