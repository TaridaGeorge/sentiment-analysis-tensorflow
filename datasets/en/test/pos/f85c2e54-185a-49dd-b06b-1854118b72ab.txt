I live in the area and have been going to Joe's BBQ since they opened 10+ years ago. So... I guess I should review it, but this mainly a Me, Too Review.

Great meat, fun place, tasty sides, good for lunch and dinner, are there drawbacks? Even when the line is long, it moves quickly. This place runs like a well-oiled machine... a tasty, tasty machine...

Best Texas style BBQ in the Valley, INMTBHO.
