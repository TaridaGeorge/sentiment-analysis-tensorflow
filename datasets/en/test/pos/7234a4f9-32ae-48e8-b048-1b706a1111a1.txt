I love love love this place. I was born in Chicago, but was raised pretty much in Phoenix, but my family always talks about Chicago Hot Dogs, Italian Beef, you name it. Since I haven't been to Chicago as an adult, I figured checking out the local Chicago-ish places will have to do (for now at least)
I brought my Grandma who lived in Chicago for many years and she gave this place a stamp of approval too. She ordered the Italian Beef and it was scrumptious.  
I ordered the Chicago Dog and a basket of fried zuchinni and it was divine.
I would have ordered two more Chicago Dogs if I would have worn my "fat pants" that day. (Mental Note for next time)
