Spoiler alert--- It's a Chain Restaurant!!!!
But this might just be the best run chain restaurant company in America. It seems nothing has been forgotten, a solid well rounded menu, tasty well seasond meals, attracive well kept salad bar, better then very clean restrooms, well trained and informed service staff, prices from fair to great, great beverage program, and nice tastefull decor.
I really like this place and it has been my go to restaurant for a few years. I am not big on chains, but this particular one is great. 
For what it is, it's a solid 5 star place.
