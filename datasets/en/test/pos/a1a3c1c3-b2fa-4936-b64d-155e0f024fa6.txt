I love Sunridge Canyon Golf Club. I had my wedding here on a Sunday morning. We had the brunch buffet as my wedding recepetion. It was perfect. The food was fantastic. The staff was so nice an accomediating. They kept up with my family and friends requests. I could not have asked for more. The location is so beautiful.
