The ONLY bad thing about this place is the location - it's hidden in a gem of a patio locale in the middle of north central phoenix.  You won't find it if you don't know where to go...so call ahead and ask for specific directions.

That being said, I was STUNNED at how goo this place was.  I love the Sangria, and the shrip cocktail is so unique I hate that I just called it a cocktail.

I want my VIP card...how does that work?  I would go all the time...if it was open later and on Monday (divorced single mom who goes on dates on Monday nights.)
