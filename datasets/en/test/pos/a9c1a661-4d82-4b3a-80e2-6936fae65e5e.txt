If you want a great steak without having to worry if your steak is going to be cooked correctly, go here. My boyfriend took me here for graduation dinner and it was very nice. Our server was great. He was knowledgeable about the wine menu and recommended an awesome bottle to go with our seafood tower. The tower was good, I love that you can order exactly how much of what you want (1 prawn, 4 king crab legs, whatever you choose). The steak was absolutely perfect. Definitely order the butter cake. It might just be the best cake I've ever had, and the strawberries that came with it surprisingly had that garden fresh taste that is hard to find anymore.
