Just enjoyed one of the best meals of my life at the Phoenician , a hotel which I love, whose restaurants always left something to be desired. My husband ordered the tasting menu which covered all the bases, and featured an outstanding tuna tartar, and great asparagus risotto, followed by an outstanding halibut dish, and then a petite fillet, again done beautifully. Our waiter, Anthony and wait staff, kindly put up with moving tables, twice, pleasant, entertaining and completely knowledgeable about the recipes. Pineapple Mojito -yum!! Also the molten chocolate cake with homemade carmel ice cream- delicious !!
