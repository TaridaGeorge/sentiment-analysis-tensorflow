Wow! Shocked that I was able to call in for a last minute check-up as a new patient and they were able to see me in 15 min...

This vet is very close to where we live, so I think we found our new vet. All the staff was super friendly - - which is typically the case of any vet office. 

But yes, I agree with the other reviews - - nice, organized, clean, and large open environment.

Lucy had a nice first visit today. :)
