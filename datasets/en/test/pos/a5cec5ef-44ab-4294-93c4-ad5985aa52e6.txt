To die for.  Really.  This is by far best gelato I've ever had.  It is DELISH!  And the flavors are awesome!  Most recently, I've had the blackberry cabernet and the spicy chocolate.  Sooo yummy.  The spicy chocolate was perfect - just chocolatey enough with a little kick.  The blackberry cabernet paired with it couldn't have been better.  I'm not a gelato expert, but I have had it before and I generally don't/can't eat a lot of this.  The density on this is perfect and I don't know...it was just like a party in your mount.  ;)  LOL.  The staff is friendly and I can't wait to go back and try some of the other flavors.  I'm pretty sure you won't be disappointed if you give it a try!
