This is the best Paradise bakery in the valley due to the inclusion of Panera items. If you're from back east you will love having access to your Panera favorites.

It has the best of both worlds with the great Panera bagels, best entrees from both restaurants, and cookies from Paradise. You will not be sorry you chose to eat here.
