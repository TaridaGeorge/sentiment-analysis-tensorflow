After two weeks in Thailand this is one of the few places in the valley that are still good.  Great food with a hint of Lao for those who would know the difference.  And as a note to the one two star review they're Thai they aren't exactly the most vegetarian friendly of genres and having to choose between service and good food I choose good authentic food every time.
