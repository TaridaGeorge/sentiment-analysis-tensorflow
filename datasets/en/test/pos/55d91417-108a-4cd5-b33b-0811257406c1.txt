I give this McDonald's 5 stars because of how fast and effecient they are. I often come here before work for coffee or a McMuffin and the line can get quite long, but it has never taken longer than few minutes to get through the drive thru. Perhaps it is because they utilize both drive thru windows. Doesn't it seem like most fast food places make you go straight to the second window, making it less efficient?
