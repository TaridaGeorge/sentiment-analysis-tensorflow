I love Nagasaki Grill Toh Zan!  The owners are very friendly and almost always available.  The food is delicious and always fresh.  It's a short drive from Fiesta Mall on Southern, and it's definitely better than the McDonald's eyesore next to it.  I recommend the sushi, and my boyfriend loves the chicken katsu.  I like the big windows and friendly vibe.
