I love this place! I've eaten here quite a few times and love going. The food is always fresh and tasty. I love their spring rolls, pho, and banh mis. My family is Vietnamese so I thought I'd be daring and bring my grandma here one day. She liked it, but said it wasnt as good as hers....and I do agree.....BUT its a great substitute if grandma is taking the day off :)
