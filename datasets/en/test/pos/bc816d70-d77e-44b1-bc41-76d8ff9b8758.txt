This is hands down my favorite steakhouse.  Great service, great atmosphere.  I was a regular customer of this place, at least once a month until I moved away.  I always requested to be in Allan's section.  He is a great server.

Seating can be tight, especially during peak hours.  

Everything on the menu is a la carte, but the serving size is generous.  

There are so many things on the menu (and not on the menu) that I would recommend......splurge on the lobster mashed potato dish....the shrimp cocktail is always a favorite....(their atomic horseradish is ridiculous, but I can't stay away from it).....and they have a great Riesling by Kuhl.  (Jacked up price as always but difficult to find in stores).

If you've been to Morton's or Flemings, try this place.  It's waaaay better.
