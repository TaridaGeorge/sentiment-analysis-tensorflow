Carrie was INCREDIBLE. I stopped in here just to check out their Brooks selection because these shoes are my absolute favorite to run in. What I anticipated to be just a quick conversation with Carrie about if I should stick with the Ghosts or try a new pair, turned into nearly an hour of examining my feet and getting tips from Carrie about my first ever marathon this upcoming January.

This is the best service I've ever gotten in a shoe store. Prices are on point with any other athetic shoe dealer. Go here. I loved it!
