my husband and i ate here thursday night. i had chicken skewers and veggies, and lemon roasted potatoes. the dish was amazing. my husband had the gyro meat platter with rice and veggies, and it was also incredible and full of flavor. the service provided by hannah was excellent. we are from out of town and highly recommend this restaurant. a+ thursday 6:30 pm
