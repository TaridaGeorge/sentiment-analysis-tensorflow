First it was a specail night but we wanter to go someplace new.. Remember hearing the place... but Thought it was called Truck stop... many after many Google and yelp minutes used on my cell phone got nothing... then a round of txted got us the Adress...

the Night being great its always hard to remove that from the Equation... but for now I just love this place...well woth the Cell phone bill...

untill I investigate more...
