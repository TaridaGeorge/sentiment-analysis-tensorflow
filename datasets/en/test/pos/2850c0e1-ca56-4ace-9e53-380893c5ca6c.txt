I definitely recommend this Place! Great food, great service and awesome price. Paid less than $150 for 6 people and we got the yelp discount. My father and fiance both got the  Ribeye and the rest of us ordered their Sunday Meal Deals, which was so much food. I loved their cornbread and their roasted corn side dish is a must try item.  I will go back next time in phoenix!
