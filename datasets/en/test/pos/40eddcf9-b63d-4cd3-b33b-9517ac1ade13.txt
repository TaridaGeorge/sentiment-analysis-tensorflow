I have been going to Eric at the Gemsetter for years.  I bought my wife's engagement ring there.  I told him what I wanted it to look like and he made it happen.  I have purchased anniversary gifts there, diamond earrings there, and the gift I gave my wife when she had our first baby.

In short, the Gemsetter is the place I go whenever I need to get any jewlery of any kind.

Another added bonus is that since we got our wedding rings there, they will always clean them for free for us, and I've even taken in watches that I didn't buy there and they worked on them.  Customer service is personal and genuine and the prices are good.
