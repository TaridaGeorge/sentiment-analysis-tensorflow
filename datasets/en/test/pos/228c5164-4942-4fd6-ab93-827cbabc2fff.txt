I have been coming here for many many years. The food is always excellent and fresh very authentic cajun. They have 1 of the best crawfish Étouffée that I have ever had including in the new orleans. Friendly's helpful stuff is there to make your meal perfect. Great jumbalaya dirty rice and there garlic bread.
