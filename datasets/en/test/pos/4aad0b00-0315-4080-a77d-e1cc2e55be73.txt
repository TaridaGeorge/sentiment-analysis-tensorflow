The Camelback Barber Shop has really good service complete with clipper and/or scissors cut, a hot towel, shoulder massage, and straight razor trim. All for under $20 (plus tip). They're one of the best barber shops that I have ever used -- and they are very nice people too!  Can be a little hard to find, but it is in the breezeway between the two buildings, just to the right of Fry's... and across the sidewalk from NYPD Pizza. Great haircut at a great price!
