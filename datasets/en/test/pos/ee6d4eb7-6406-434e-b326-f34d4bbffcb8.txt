Dr. Irene and the front office staff are excellent. The guys that work there are AWESOME! My wife, my daughter, my son, my mother, and I are all happy patients of Dr. Irene. I made the mistake of going to America's Best and after that experience I was hesitant to see ANY optometrists. 

Dr. Irene is professional, courteous, and on top of the latest technologies and research regarding optometry. I recommend him to anyone looking for a true professional that genuinely cares about his patients.
