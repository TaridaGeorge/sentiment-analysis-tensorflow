Guava is my favorite but they only have it once a year, get you hooked and then take it away...
Birthday cake is strangely addicting
Pistachio is buttery goodness
Ferrero Rocher is my current addiction
My husband loves salted Carmel and tiramusu 

They will let you taste as many flavors as you'd like so you can't go wrong. The kids working there are very nice. Prices run between 5.00-15.00.
