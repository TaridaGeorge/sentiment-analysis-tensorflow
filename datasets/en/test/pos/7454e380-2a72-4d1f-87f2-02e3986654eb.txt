The only way our experience could have been better is if it was free! 

Seriously though, the prices were excellent and it was much more affordable than we were expecting sun screens to be. Express Solar was one of three companies we had work up quotes for our house and not only were they the lowest price, they were clearly the highest quality product. That is a winning combination.

Kevin did an outstanding job of educating us on sun screen products and what made his different and better than the others. He was a very personable and friendly owner/operator - the kind of person you want to see have great success.

We could not be more pleased with the looks, installation and performance of our new solar screens.
