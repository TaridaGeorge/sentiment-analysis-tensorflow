I absolutely love this place.  When you pull up and valet, does not feel like you are in AZ anymore.  It feels like you are somewhere exotic (Mediterranean).  The rich earthy colors are just so warm and welcoming.  Love it!  I ordered the Pan roasted halibut for dinner.  It is served with a fine herb potato gallette, saut√©ed mushrooms & vegetables with red wine butter sauce.  Too yummy for words to explains.  You need to try it out for yourself.  Just too terrific!!  I picked the Chocolate Fantasy (French chocolate silk on a decadent chocolate cake with chocolate sauce served with vanilla gelato) for my after dinner pleasure.  Again, too yummy for words.  This is the perfect place for the perfect date, anniversary dinners, and any romantic event.  Just one of the best dinner experiences that I have had.
