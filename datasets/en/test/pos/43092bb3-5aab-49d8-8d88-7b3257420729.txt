Yet ANOTHER hidden CenPho gem in the middle of stripmall-nowhereland to slap anyone who complains about Phoenix with upside the head. Outside, you see crappy doors to shady looking establishments and maybe a crackhead or two. Inside, you're whisked away to up-scale Santa Fe cooking with a roaring fire to your left. A Southwestern food lover's paradise. 

I tried the green chile stew, priced at $14. It was the most delicious stew/chile thingie I've ever had, period. I almost wanted to lick the bowl when I was done. Our service, during a busy lunchtime, was outstanding. 

Open til midnight every night of the week. How the hell did I not discover this place sooner?
