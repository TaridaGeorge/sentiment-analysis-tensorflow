I have got to say that the portions are huge.  I had the roast beef sandwich and the bread was thick and fresh.  It came with fries and an awesome horseradish dressing on it.

It is one of the few restaurants actually open downtown at night.  A fun atmosphere.  The restaurant is actual inside/outside of an old house - quite cool!

The food is good and the prices are modest.  

Enjoy!
