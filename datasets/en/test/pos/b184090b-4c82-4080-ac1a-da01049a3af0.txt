I am fairly new to Yelp, and the restaurant reviews, and it is more than a bit confusing.
When I looked at reviews for this restaurant, I was thinking that perhaps we should not go - there were so many negative comments about the, staff and/or the food.  But we went anyway.
And, I've got to tell you that the entire evening was terrific!  We chose the full 6 course dinner with wine paring.  Not only was the food fantastic, but the staff could not have been more professional, caring, and just plain terrific.  
There were 8 of us for dinner, yet the kitchen turned out the food on a perfectly timed basis, and was overall an awesome evening.
In the future, if I use Yelp, I will only read the positive comments, those with negative comments are probably just not too happy generally......
