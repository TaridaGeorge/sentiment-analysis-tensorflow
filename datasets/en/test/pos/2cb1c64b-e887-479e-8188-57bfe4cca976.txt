Dear Lo-Lo's why do you have to be so damn good!?  I really wish that when I had you last weekend you had been dry and tasteless so that I wouldn't have to come back and eat Fried Chicken and Waffles again... but now you have made me an addict to your delicious mouth-watering juicy breasts & thighs... Woah where is this going?! LOL Thank goodness you do takeout for now my husband will have to do his husbandly duty and pick me up a piece or two on his way home from work.... 

Truly wonderful... I never had waffles with fried chicken before and I'm not sure why I was so surprised at how great this pairing would be but I was... Great service, everyone was friendly and upbeat and seemed to actually enjoy working there which is definitely a PLUS! ;-) I love you Lo-lo's!
