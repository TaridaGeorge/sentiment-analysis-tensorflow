Easily the BEST beer bar in the valley. They have excellent beers on tap from all over the nation/world and is definitely a great place to hang out and explore and enjoy beers. 

It's also awesome that they are connected to the liquor store next door, and you can pickup whatever you need to take home too. 

I'll say it again, BEST BEER BAR IN THE VALLEY
