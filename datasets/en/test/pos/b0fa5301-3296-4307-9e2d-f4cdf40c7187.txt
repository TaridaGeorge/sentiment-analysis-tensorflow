Phenomenal!!  We went to Italy 2 years ago for our Honeymoon and I felt like I was there again!  Authentic Italian food, we had friends coming in from Chicago and I came on here to find a good Italian Restaurant, just by reviews!  Sooo happy we went here.  Homemade and fresh ingredients.  We had the Gnocci for an appitizer and it just melted in your mouth.  We also had a fablous tortillini soup in a tomato broth, so fresh and tasty.  The Eggplant Parm wrapped in spinach and 4 cheeses was amazing and so was the homemade pistachio ice cream with drizzled truffle chocoate.  Cute, cozy, authentic, reasonable pricing and exceptional portions...can't wait to go back!!!  A must try!!
