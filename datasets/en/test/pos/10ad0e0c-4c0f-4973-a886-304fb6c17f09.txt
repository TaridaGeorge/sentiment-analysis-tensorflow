After a yummy pho lunch I decided to grab some boba tea... Yelp to the rescue! The walls are covered with artwork, writings, and graffiti. I thought it was pretty cool. I ordered a Mango smoothie with boba and was surprised to see them use REAL fruit and not syrup or powder to make it. It was delicious! My cousin had a blueberry smoothie with boba and hers was really good too. I'll defiantly be back
