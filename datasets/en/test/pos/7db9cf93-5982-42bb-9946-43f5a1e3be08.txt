I love this store. It's colorful, warm and inviting. They have food, wine, soda, bracelets, furniture, etc. I could literally spend several hours here.

Yesterday we stopped by hoping to find a non-traditional coffee table. We walked out with chipotle chocolate, silverware, ice cube trays and a bench that we are using as a coffee table. Their prices are very reasonable, I think they could charge more and people would still shop there.

Did I mention that I love this store?
