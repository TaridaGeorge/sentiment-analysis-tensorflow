I just bought a used MINI Cooper S and a friend told me to visit Eurotechs for great service and prices with dealer quality repairs. He couldn't have been more right. 

The topper is the customer service you get from Jerry, the owner. Something that is too often overlooked these days, he seems to treat each customer the way he'd like to be treated. Honest, knowledgeable and a plain ol' nice guy. 

I highly recommend Eurotechs to anyone looking for quality work, great prices and an enjoyable experience. Let's help keep local businesses like this alive and flourishing.
