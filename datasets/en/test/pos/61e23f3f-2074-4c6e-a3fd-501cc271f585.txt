I ate at El Chorro during restaurant week back in the fall! It was absolutely amazing! Just the right size portions as well! I was excited to try some new restaurants during Restaurant Week and I cant wait til next year so I can try some more new ones! I loved the cinnamon sticky buns as well! It was quite a surprise to get that before our meal as well, and they were super tasty! I loved the ambiance of the restaurant as well and the patio seemed very nice too.
