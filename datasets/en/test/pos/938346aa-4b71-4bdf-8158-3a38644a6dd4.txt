What can I say.....I love, love Sephora with other than being highly expensive its one of the only places I get all my makeup. From eye shadows to foundations and anything I may need to get dolled up on a night out of town. I break out horribly if I use cheap inexpensive makeup....so I have to go the expensive route..plus I get better results. I love the different selections that they have.
