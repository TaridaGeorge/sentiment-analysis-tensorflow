One of the best things about golfing in the Phoenix area is that there are many great high end courses where the general public is welcome. Here in the Boston area, most of the best courses are snooty private clubs.

Raven is one of the best golf courses I have played in Phoenix.  It can be pricey, especially during the peak season in the spring, but the course is beautiful and challenging, and since the desert golf motif is my personal favorite, it ranks high up there for me.  For a little less $$, Legacy and Vistal are nearby, and are also nice courses with great views of South Mountain.
