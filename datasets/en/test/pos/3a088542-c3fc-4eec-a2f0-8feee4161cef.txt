I brought my 93 year old grandmother to Dr. Karawi to get her teeth cleaned and checked and he did an absolutely wonderful job!  He went way above and beyond to make sure she was comfortable, even offering to turn the air conditioning down if she was too cold.  He was super patient and gentle with her, and as her caregiver I really appreciated how he told us what her dental problems were without pressuring us to get any work done. He explained all of our options, including the pros and cons of each procedure. He is definitely very knowledgeable! I can't recommend him enough, and I couldn't have asked for a better dentist for grandma.
