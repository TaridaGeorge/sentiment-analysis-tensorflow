Just got my first piercing in eight years and the staff made me feel completely at ease even though I'm normally very anxious. A clean environment - my piercer changed her gloves about five or more times. I was given a thorough explanation of how to take care of my cartilage piercing, what to do if it gets infected, and they offer free consultations any time you may have a problem. My piercer was Kat and I'm very grateful that she was personable and completely understanding of my questions. I wouldn't say it's pricey, it only ended up 33 bucks after using the coupon on their website. I'm going back to get the rest of my piercings so I would suggest this place to anyone, plus it hardly hurt.
