As an Emerald Club member, I got to bypass the counter and head straight to their Emerald Aisle to select the car of my choosing.  Lots of cars were available, mostly Dodge Avengers and Chevy Malibus, but I was lucky enough to snag the lone Dodge Charger and then went to check out.

When dropping off the car, they simply did a quick walk around and printed my receipt for me on the spot.  Whole process took about a minute.

I was charged the exact amount that I was quoted when I booked online. 

National Car Rental operates a very professional and straightforward operation that is super customer friendly.  No underhanded tactics!  I would not hesitate to rent from them at this location again.
