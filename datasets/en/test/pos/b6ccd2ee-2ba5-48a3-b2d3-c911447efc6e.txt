Yen is by far in my top 3 sushi bars. The staff are always friendly and chef Paul makes some tasty rolls. Happy hour rolls are a bit limited (I hope they add more), but they are delicious. My favorite is their Philly roll. Most places put cucumber or carrot, but Yen uses asparagus instead and wow what a difference. The calamari roll is very good (texture is not rubbery like other places I've been too *cough* Kabuki). If you want a roll without rice I recommend the rock and roll. This roll has salmon/tuna/avocado wrapped in cucumber. The chef uses skewers to hold them in place which makes for an interesting plating. This is a great little place and with amazing quality sushi.
