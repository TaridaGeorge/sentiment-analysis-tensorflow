Give your muscles some Love and avoid the corporate gym B.S.!!  

How can you not LOVE a gym that streams Metallica????  The equipment is well maintained and the gym is open and fresh, and the vibe is for serious health conscious work-outs.

I have hired the proprietor "Josh" many times as a personal trainer and he is an expert at body-building and athletic style physical conditioning.

This a NO-B.S. gym and it is THEE place to go to on the West-Side if you desire a serious place to develop your physique!
