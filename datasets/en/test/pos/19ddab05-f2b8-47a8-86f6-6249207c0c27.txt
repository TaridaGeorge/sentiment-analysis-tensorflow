This is our DEFAULT happy hour.
I won't be reviewing their dinner as I have never had an actual meal there.

I'm not really a beer drinker, but they have such a big selection, I always find something i like. And I've been told they have a martini specials, but you don't go to a beer place and get martinis... come on.

Pretty much their entire appetizer selection (which is what, 20 items?) is on the half price happy hour menu. You know what that means? Four sliders and fries for FOUR dollars. (Also recommended... Hawaiian Poke Stack).

In summary, I can wrap up Yard House in two words.
Heck. Yes.
