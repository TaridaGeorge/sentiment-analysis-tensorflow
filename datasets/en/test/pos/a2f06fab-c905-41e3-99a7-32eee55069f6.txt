I swear I hear angels sing as I walk through the doors, as if I have arrived in my own personal heaven. Who doesn't love wall to wall libations and pretty much anything you would need to throw a BA house party! All the alcohol and mixers you could want, snacks, glass wear, and even little umbrellas! I just love this place and am so glad we have our very own here in QC!
