really hip coffee joint with cool music. Vintage yet modern I think it's a hispers dream. Coffee is fresh and the staff is friendly. The location of sola is right in the middle of the creepy part of old town scottsdale, but don't let that detour you from visiting. It is also a great place to just sit and surf the we with their free wifi.
