It's about time I review the Elephant Bar. This place is reasonably priced and has excellent food. I love their Wok Kitchen creations. Who would have thunked it, but the Elephant Bar has the best Chinese food around. As many times as I contemplate trying something different, I always default back to the Shanghai Cashew Chicken ($11.75). The portion is huge and served with white or brown rice. My wife usually devours the Kung Pao Shrimp. 

Their happy hour food is reasonably priced, I recommend the Sliders. They have plenty of TV's to catch the game. Although service in the bar area can be unpredictible, the restaurant service is always excellent. Be prepared for the crowds on the weekend.
