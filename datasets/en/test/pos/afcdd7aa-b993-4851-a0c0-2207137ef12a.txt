If you want a specialty brat, come here!  They have Rabbit, rattlesnake, and regular brats too!  The staff is welcoming, friendly and passionate about what they serve.  That passion translated into the delicious food the served.

The roasted pork was absolutely amazing.  I didn't try the chicken and waffles since my plate was full and I didn't want to take food I wouldn't  be able finish.  I left stuffed full of great food.
  
The date-cake was mind blowing.  I am not the biggest fan of dates, but this cake completely caught me off guard.

They have a very nice outdoor seating area, there was a fire going and a giant sized Jenga. They also have cornhole outside. A great place to go if you want to get out.
