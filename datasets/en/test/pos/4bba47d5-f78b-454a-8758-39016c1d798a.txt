Yum, can you say great steak?

This is another of my father's favorite haunts after the car races at Manzanita.  Back in his day they did not serve alcohol and he and his racing cronies would bring their own bottles.
My first trip here was over 40 years ago when they still had the stockyards next door.  Worst imaginable smell in the world greeted my nostrils when we got out of the car and rushed inside.  Once inside the only aroma was that of sizzling steak.

The stockyards are long gone but the steaks are still there.
