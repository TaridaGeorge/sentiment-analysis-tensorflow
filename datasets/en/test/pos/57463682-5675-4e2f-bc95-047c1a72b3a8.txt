It was love at first bite! I ordered the fried noodles with beef in the xo sauce. The sauce was spicy and savory. I don't like sweet and savory so it was the perfect sauce for me. There was a nice balance of noodles, beef, and vegetables and the portion size was very generous (only 7.95!). We ordered egg rolls for an appetizer and they were your standard egg rolls with pork. The only thing I could give constructive feedback on was that the egg rolls came out after the noodles. The service was friendly and attentive and it was so much fun to watch the noodles being made in the kitchen. I think this will be my new go to carry out restaurant when I am craving chinese food. I definitely want to try the soup next time.
