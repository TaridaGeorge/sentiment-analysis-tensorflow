Casey's is awesome. It's the neighborhood bar of Tempe. On any given night you'll see 10 people you know here - that guy from chem lab, your gynecologist, your favorite local band, your neighbor, your best friend and your mom. Casey's is popular because they have a beautiful patio setup with lots of seating so groups can sit and talk, delicious food, reasonably priced booze and super friendly awesome staff. Personally, I prefer to go on off nights or in the early evening because Friday and Saturday nights get really packed and it's hard to find somewhere to sit.
