I have a rental home in Gilbert and needed to get the windows cleaned for the next tenant.  I saw their ad and immediately came over to YELP to check them out.  I sent an email to them since I live out of state and Aymee emailed me back right away giving me a ballpark figure.  I decided to go with them as they were running a special and after reading the couple reviews here.  I just felt really at ease with them being so prompt in replying to my email and then calling me.   What a pleasure working with them.  Their prices are very reasonable too.  I would highly recommend this company.   I will be keeping their information in my folder as the ONLY window cleaning company I will use at both our rental homes in Arizona.
