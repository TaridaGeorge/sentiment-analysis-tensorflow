We have been meaning to come here for awhile and we are so glad we finally did! The service was amazing, it was my first date night with my husband sans wine (im pregnant), and the server had the bartender make me a grapefruit "faux"ijito. It tasted great and helped me feel like celebrating!  The food was amazing, we had the short rib pasta and the the chicken.  It was mouthwatering but not so heavy we coukdnt enjoy the homeade donut dessert! We will be back very soon!
