I always make a point to stop by Buffalo Bill's when I am in Cave Creek.  It is a bonanza of unique items and good deals.  I was looking for a set of 3 decorative pots.  If you cannot find them at Buffalo Bill's then you are helpless.  They do not ship out of state so you'll have to hit up the UPS store on Tom Darlington Rd. to ship your wares.  Friendly and helpful employees.  Lots of great finds here.
