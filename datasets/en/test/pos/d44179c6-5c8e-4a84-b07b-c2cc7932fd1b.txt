We've been using Dr. McComb for many years, at least since 2002 I believe. He's been an awesome vet from the very beginning. He knows his stuff, cares about his patients, is fair in pricing, and definitely is passionate about his profession and his clients! We went to him when he was at McQueen Veterinary Clinic, and we'll continue seeing him at his new expanded clinic, Crossroads Veterinary Hospital. Congratulations to him on his expansion! That says something about how great he is, doesn't it?

Thank you Dr. McComb! Our Pack (River, Charlie, Yasha, Marley, and soon-to-be-new-addition Timber) thanks you as well :)
