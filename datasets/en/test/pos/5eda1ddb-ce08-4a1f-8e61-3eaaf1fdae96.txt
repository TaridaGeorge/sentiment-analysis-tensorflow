A unique and interesting restaurant which embrases the charm of an old home and gives it a modern and urban touch.  This restaurant boasts a large variety of unique pizza combinations.  Our group of 14 tested 6 of these and all six were fabulous...leaving even the most non-adventerous food eaters in our group shocked that they enjoyed each one.  I'd highly recommend the the pizza with asian pears... it was fabulous!!
