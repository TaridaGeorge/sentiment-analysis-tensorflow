I've been to a lot of libraries - LA libraries, NYC libraries.  I love libraries.  Burton Barr rocks!  

Yes, it's cool-looking or interesting or whatever but the best thing is the huge array of books.  One thing the Phoenix public library system gets right is the book collection.  They always have the latest titles and they aren't afraid to collect both recent Christian lit and Gay/Lesbian lit.  Any place that provides both for its patrons is a damn good library indeed!
