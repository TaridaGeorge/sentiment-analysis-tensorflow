I am always reading reviews on restaurants, stores, products, everything, so I thought I'd start writing some of my own since I go out to eat almost every day. 

I went to this restaurant for the first time a few weeks ago and have been back 4 times already! I never would have noticed it as it's tucked away in the corner of a small shopping center. Being a meat lover my entire life I was a little hesitant about trying anything with "mock" chicken, but was pleasantly surprised on how tasty it was. I've tried a few of the rice/noodle bowls (thai peanut is my favorite) and haven't been disappointed yet. The price is right (under $10), the staff is friendly and the food was at our table in less than 10 minutes. Highly recommended!
