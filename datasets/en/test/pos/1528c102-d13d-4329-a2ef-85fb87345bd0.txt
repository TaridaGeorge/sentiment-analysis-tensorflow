$3 dollar sliders from 3-6pm daily!

I have been a loyal customer of Stax since it first opened.  I love that as time as gone on they have expanded and developed their wonderful menu.

You must try one of their many gourmet burgers which are the size of a slider.  My favorite is the turkey topped with a pineapple slice and guacomole. Since the burgers are small I suggest you either get two or try out their crispy tater tots with a side of spicy aioli, mac-n-cheese, or a wedge salad.

While the interior is stark and modern the food is comforting.  
A great place to grab a casual quick lunch in Old Town!
