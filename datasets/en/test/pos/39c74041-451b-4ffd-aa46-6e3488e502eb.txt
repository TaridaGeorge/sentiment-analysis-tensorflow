I had the pleasure of eating at Pizzeria Bianco while in town for an aviation convention this past January. Yes, there was a long wait = a two hour wait to be exact. While waiting, we sat on the picnic tables outside and ordered wine and cheese from Bar Bianco's next door.
Yummy!

The pizzeria is VERY small and quaint. I thought the pizza was well worth the wait. The fresh mozzarella (made in-house daily) and tomato appetizer was oh so delish. Don't expect to find typical pizza toppings here. Oh, and the pizza crust is thin and crispy - just the way I LOVE it. My favorite pizza was the Bianconverde and Rosa. Again, loved the fresh mozzarella on the pizza. Loved, loved it!

I'd definitely go back if I'm in Phoenix again.
