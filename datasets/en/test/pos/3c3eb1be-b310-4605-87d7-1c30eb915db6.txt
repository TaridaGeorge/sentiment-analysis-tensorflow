Okay, I gave them four stars on my last review, but I simply can't do it again.  It's five-star coffee, through and through.  

After sampling their location at Kierland I decided to drive 14 miles and have coffee at their location up north.  I asked what they had in a light to medium roast, and I swear she brought ten bags of coffee for me to sniff.  They roast all of it, and not one bag had even the slightest burnt smell, but overwhelmed me with complex aromas.  Nothing else in Phoenix can compare.  

I have now cleaned out our casita and am ready to open up a clandestine and illegal coffee speakeasy in central Phoenix.
