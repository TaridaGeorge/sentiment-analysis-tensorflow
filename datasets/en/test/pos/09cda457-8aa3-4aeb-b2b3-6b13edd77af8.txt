(Testing out this new iPhone app!) Carry the world's problems on my shoulders has been a pain in the neck, so I began investigating my AZ State health insurance plan to see what I could get, before I get canned or before AZ decides to discard all benefits and lower wages so McCain and Sheriff Joe can buy bigger guns.  Coworker recommended this place, Dr. Genet is great, staff friendly, low copay. Weight of the world...still there, but body (and mind) is better able to deal!
