I went to this place for the first time today and I loved it! The restaurant was so cute, and the food was delicious! This way the first pasty I've ever had and it was great. The service was fantastic, our waitress was actually british so that definitely helped. I hadn't heard of the place before but it was really crowded. I will definitely be going back here multiple times
