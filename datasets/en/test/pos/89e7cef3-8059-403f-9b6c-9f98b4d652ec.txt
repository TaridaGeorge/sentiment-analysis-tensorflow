Love this place, my favorite thai restaurant in Arizona.  Great interior with many teak wood carvings. Friendly owners. The red and green curries are excellent.  I wasn't impressed with the pad thai, it was greasy. A word of advice, dine in instead of ordering carryout. They tend to skimp on the meat and vegetables if you order carryout.
