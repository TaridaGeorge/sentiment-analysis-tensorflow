Oh yeah Maizie's! I have been back a handful of times and I must say the service has improved and the food is consistently delicious! Yes, I've had their buffalo chicken appetizer - to die for and their steak sandwich with a small ceaser - Yummy!

The wine list is pretty good and when the glasses are on special that is even better! Maizie's is my go to place in the 602.
