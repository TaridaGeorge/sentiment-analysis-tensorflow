Always a favorite. That's why it was my first choice when thinking of a place to invite all my friends to while I was visiting from San Francisco. Great service on a busy Saturday night. They have great happy hour specials, as well as, daily specials. The drinks and food is outstanding and the prices are reasonable. Pertfect for pre or post event gatherings.
