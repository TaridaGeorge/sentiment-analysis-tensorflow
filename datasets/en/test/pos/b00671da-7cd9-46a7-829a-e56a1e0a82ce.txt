If you need space for just about any event, this should be the first place you look into. Mostly it's a workspace, but my daughter's Girl Scout troop hosted a literacy/writing event in February, and it was a huge success! As long as you plan it well in advance, you can hold any meeting or gathering. They also host talks and workshops, and have Gangplank Jr. to get those kiddos interested in science and technology. Again- your first place to look when you need a space for an event, or just need to get some work done, is Gangplank. Go take a tour- because you can't truly grasp the awesome until you see it for yourself.
