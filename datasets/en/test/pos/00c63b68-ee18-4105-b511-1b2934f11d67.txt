It's hard to find a good latte in Phoenix. So we were thrilled to find good reviews on Yelp and happened to be in the area. As others have posted, he roasts beans on site. The barista happily reported that she had run out of beans earlier in the morning so we were enjoying beans that had just been roasted about an hour earlier. The cookies were yummy too.

The guy who owns Lola apparently started in Seattle with a shop by the same name, then came to Phoenix to start Lux. He then left Lux to open Lola.
