I have been to this location at least 3 times. Every experience has been wonderful. I have had their steaks (which are melt-in-you-mouth-goodness), salads, every side imaginable (Mmm twice-baked potatoes) and their creme brulee (which is to die for!) - I went once with my friend and his son and they brought us a fruit plat for his kiddo. Really great service, friendly people and a wonderful menu.
