Quality stuff. This is not your americanized chinese food, and the previous reviews reflect that. This is real chinese food and the staff is not rude, its just that they dont know much english. 

My party of 3 went here last night and we had the chefs family dinner for 3.

That was a TON of great food for $10.95 each! It was awesome. They have wor wonton soup, which i have never had before and was better than just wonton soup with all the veggies. I do kinda want more meat in it though.

The sweet and sour chicken was great, mongolian beef was spicy, and the fried rice was excellent.

A great deal for some real chinese.
