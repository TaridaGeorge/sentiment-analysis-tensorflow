I love anything the Aiello's do in the culinary world (awesome folks in every other way too).  Love the restaurant on Central but a tad bit far and expensive for frequent consumption so this smaller different twist on classic Italian is just right for me.  I usually get the eggplant parm cause it is the best in the Valley, but wandered off the traditional path and had the featured sandwich, Aiello's House Salumeria.  All the ingredients complimented each other so nicely that the result is a masterpiece of a sang-which!!!
