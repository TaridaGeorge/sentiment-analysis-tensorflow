I've been a member at Lifetime in Scottsdale for 8 months now and I love it.  Great pick up games (best are Saturday and Sunday morning), plenty of weights and machines so you never are waiting around, lots of TVs with an array of programming, good food and a great spa even for guys.  There are a few kids running around but not enough to bother a normal person.  I don't do classes so can't advise there but the outdoor pool, lap pool and hot tubs make me want to stay rather than bail.  The spa is a huge help too - easy to get your hair cut on the same trip and the girls do a great job.  It's not cheap but the whole package makes it worth the money.
