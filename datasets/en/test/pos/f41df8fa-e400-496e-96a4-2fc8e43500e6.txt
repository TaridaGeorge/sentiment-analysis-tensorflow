This is the real deal! GREAT food! The owner/chef grows her own Thai chilies and other ingredients, like lemongrass. Warning though: it IS fiery! I totally suggest going with the "3-star" heat if you like it spicy. You can always make it hotter, but you can't make it more mild... a lesson learned with the papaya salad that had me licked about 5-bites in!
