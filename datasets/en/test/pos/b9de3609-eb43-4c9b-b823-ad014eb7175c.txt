Number 100!! I'll keep it short and sweet.

It's rare that I get out to the farmers market these days, but when I do, I head straight for McClendon's.  I love their huge selection of organic produce with lots of heirloom varieties.  There are always employees around to chat with, and I LOVE that Chef Payton Curry hangs out to answer questions about food and how to prepare, etc.  Bob McClendon is a super nice man who really does care about the food he produces and won't send out sub-par ingredients.  Their prices are very reasonable and their fruits and veggies are delicious!  

During the summer heat, McClendon farm doesn't come to the farmer's market, so I guess I'll have to find someone else to use for my local veggie obsession.  

Thanks McClendon family for all that you do, and the lovely food you provide!
