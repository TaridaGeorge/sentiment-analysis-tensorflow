You are what you eat and this cow ate well. :) (I was referring to the actual moo-cow that is - haha!)  Burgers & wine, some beer and some fries; have a toast with milkshakes and some zucchini breaded and fried - yum!  Zucchini in the fryer?  Why not it tastes just as good as some yam fries.  The ambience was chill, but I can do without the pictures on the walls.  I don't want my farmer to wear any sort of bio-suit - I want him or her in overalls or if she's, hot dazy dukes :)  Service was good, I always enjoy my server able to take a joke or two and come back with some :)  - Enjoy!
