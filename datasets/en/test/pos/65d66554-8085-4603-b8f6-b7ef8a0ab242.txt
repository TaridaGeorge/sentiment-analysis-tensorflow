they have stuff that's been on fire,  they have burritos,  they have sopes and cow heads and big ass bags of roasted hatch peppers and 60 kinds of mexican cheese,   and giant cauldrons of aguas frescas,  and MY FACE IS MELTING RIGHT NOW WHEN I THINK OF HOW GOOD IT ALL IS.  

Plus their prices on produce are damn affordable.     

So I'm going to get really fat soon apparently,  and it's all Phoenix Ranch Market's fault.
