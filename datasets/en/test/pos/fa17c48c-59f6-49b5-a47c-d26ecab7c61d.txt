First time at this wash. I was always curious about the place since i pass this business a few times a week. Took it in for a wash @ $20. That price included armor all on the tires, vacuum, clean all windows (inside and out), armor all the inside dash and where ever else needed, and an air freshner of your choice, all under 20 minutes. I was really amazed with how my car really sparkled and was super clean on the inside as well. lol...Im now there new customer and will be as long as there here. I would recommend this place, they did a great job for a good round price and all under 20 min. Keep up the good work!
