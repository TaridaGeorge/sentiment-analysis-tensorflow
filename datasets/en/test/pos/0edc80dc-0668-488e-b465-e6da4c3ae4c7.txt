If you live in AZ or just visiting... you have to go to the House of Tricks!
In an old house surrounded by  lots of trees and  is in a house and has an amazing patio and bar outside. Food is amazing and service is great! This is a great restaurant for a date or a special occasion. The setting is amazing..  and so wonderful! I have recommended this place already to numberous people. I will definitley go back!
