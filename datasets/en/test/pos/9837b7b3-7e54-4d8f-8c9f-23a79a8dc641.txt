It's In N Out........what more really needs to be said??? If you haven't been to In N Out you're obviously not from The West Coast where In N Out is a staple of burger life.  All of the food is prepared fresh and I love the tomatoes and lettuce they use. 
The service has always been friendly and enthusiastic. God forbid I ever move somewhere where they don't have In N Out.
