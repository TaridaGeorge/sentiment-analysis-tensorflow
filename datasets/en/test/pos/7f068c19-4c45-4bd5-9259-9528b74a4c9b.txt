Shangri La. My Happy Place. Heaven on Earth. Twirl is the best frozen yogurt shop I've ever eaten at. And I consider myself somewhat of an authority on the subject, because it is my favorite dessert in the entire world. Their flavors are delicious, the yogurt is creamy, and the topping options are wonderful. They have the BEST fresh blueberries I've ever had at any yogurt shop, and I love that they have mochi!

And the price is really reasonable. SO much so, that my honey and I went twice in just a few days, and we don't really live right in the area. I know we'll be back really, really soon.
