Fantastic food. Great prices. Nice locale.  Every time I go in, I always feel like they're making food special for me. Oh wait, they are !  I'm a picky eater, so I always deviate a little from the regular menu ingredients. I love that they can cook to suit my needs.  It proves difficult sometimes at other restaurants. But not at Asian Cafe.
