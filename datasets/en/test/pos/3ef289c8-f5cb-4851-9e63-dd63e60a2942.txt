I thought this place was fantastic!  I was like a kid in a toy store looking at all of the instruments & hearing music from all around the world.  Phoenix is incredibly lucky to have been chosen for a museum of this caliber.  I hope it stays busy enough that it will keep open for many years to come.  I just wish the admission wasn't as high.  At $15, it's a little high.
