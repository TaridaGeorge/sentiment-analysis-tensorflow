I have been going to Casey At The Bat since I was 13 years old.  I am now pushing 30.

It has changed an itsy bitsy, but really... it's stayed the same in the last 15 years.  Still the same old ratty nets for the batting cage... still the creaky pitching machines, still the same crappy doors that swing open into the main room with the snack area... 

But you know what.  

It's home... and it's not supposed to be glitzy... 

It's sports, silly.  You're supposed to get dirty!
