I love Picazzo's. Not only do they make and succeed with an effort at organic and earth friendly on the menu, the menu itself is printed on recycled paper with soy based ink. 
The wine list is pretty good, but if you are a BIG Italian red fan you will have to settle for their milder organic wines. 
The crust on the pizzas are delicious and don't forget to try the cookie/ice cream desserts. 
If you love salads- their Greek one is terrific. 
If you need wheat free or other special food needs, this is a great place to go. 
This place may not be appropriate for people who want salty, run of the mill cheap food. If you want a step above, this place is perfect.
