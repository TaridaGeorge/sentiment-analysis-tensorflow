I LOVE the brussel sprout salad, fresh made tortillas and the prime rib hash here (wait, that's also everything I've ever had here!). The prices are kind of steep, but the brussel sprout salad is a HUGE serving.   

Don't forget to pick up a mini cookie on your way out! 

+1 extra star because Chelsea's Kitchen is one of the food sponsors at my volunteer organization's annual major fundraiser. (I experienced the aforementioned food a paying guest in the restaurant.)
