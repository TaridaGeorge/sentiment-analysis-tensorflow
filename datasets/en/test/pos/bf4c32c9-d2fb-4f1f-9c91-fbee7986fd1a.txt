I have met the owners husband and wife. They are from France and such a lovely couple. Their kids are even working there sometimes. The crossiants are to die for! I have had the leek and goat cheese tart so yummy! It is a little pricey but the quality is always great. Its not affordable for me to return everyday but its also not good for me to eat a crossiant every day either lol. This is a great place to stop and pick up a bunch of amazing desserts for after dinner. They are made fresh daily by the owners and they are not only delicious but beautiful like art!
