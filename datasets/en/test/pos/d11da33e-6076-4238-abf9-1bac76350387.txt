Get there early like by 1130 if you are going for lunch as it gets busy and if you only have so much time at lunch you might miss out!
Start with some sweet potato fries and zuchini fries.  Follow it by the Buffalo chicken sandwich which is nice and spicy with a little ranch...or the Kobe Burger Medium...it is so juicy you will have to lean over to eat it...but save room for the kit kat shake!  It's a fun atmosphere bustling and busy but not too loud or crazy.  It will be nice to sit outside and people watch when the weather is cooler.  Easy to park at with a close lot with available parking.
