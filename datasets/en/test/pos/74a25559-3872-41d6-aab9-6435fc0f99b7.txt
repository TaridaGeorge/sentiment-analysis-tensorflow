When I renovated my kitchen not too long ago...I did my homework!!
I replaced my fridge, range, sink, counters, fixtures, and exhaust hood.
DID I EVER DO SOME HOMEWORK here!!!
It came down to 2 places - Home Depot and Best Home Appliances.
Best Home Appliances won the bid for some of the specialty items that Home Depot didnt stock -  like my exhaust hood. They also were the only ones in the city that could find the light bulbs for it-  next time I will FLY to Italy to get them!!! They were timely and well-priced . It was a great experience and if I can help anyone have a positive experience in renovating or replacing applicances - I would highly recommend them.
