I love Sephora.  The associates are always friendly, knowledgeable,  and very helpful.  They know the perfect colors for my skin type and for any occasion I am attending.  They explain how to put on the product and what makes the product special.  The products are expensive, but they last for a very long time.  I always get compliments on my make-up and I always buy from Sephora.
