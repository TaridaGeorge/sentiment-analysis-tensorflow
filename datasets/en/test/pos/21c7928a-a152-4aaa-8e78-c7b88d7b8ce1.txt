This place has been one of my favorite indian food restaurants since 2002-2003.  Their food is excellent, and the service is great.  During lunchtime they have a buffet with tasty food as well.  (I've done it once or twice)
I like this place because the prices are not outrageous, and the staff is not pretentious.  I love their indian flatbread too!
