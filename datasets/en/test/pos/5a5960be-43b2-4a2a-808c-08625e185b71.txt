After spending the last 24 hours dealing with a different unscrupulous company (read my review of Just Plumbing Services), I'm very happy I found Jim at Water Heaters 4 less. 

He was able to come out early this morning to replace my broken water heater. He did this with a smile on his face and a with a price I couldn't find lower. He also includes extra's that other companies were charging over the top prices on. 

Would highly recommend Jim and his company to anyone in the valley who is in need of having their water heater replaced. Nice to know some companies still have respect for their customers.
