Excellent! Everything they have is excellent! Luckily when I went I was with a large group so I was able to try many different items. It is hard to say anything that stood out because each dish was so unique in it's own way. It is an expensive restaurant, but you know that going in and it is well worth it. Not only is their food great, but they have the best mojitos I have had anywhere I have been in the state. 

Deseo has a very nice decor, the service is excellent and the staff is very helpful with explaining their menu.
