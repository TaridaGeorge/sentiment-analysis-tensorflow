Just a little update to say I indulged in a massage here yesterday and absolutely must rave about the pummeling and ass-kicking I got from a deceivingly compact  and smiley girl named Andrea.

Upon complimenting her, she simply shrugged and replied that she used to work on pro athletes until she wrecked her shoulder. That explains it. When I left, I looked like I got ridden hard and put away wet -- makeup all smeared away, hair frizzy and askew, dazed look in eyes. So. Worth. It. I already prebooked another massage for my next day off...
