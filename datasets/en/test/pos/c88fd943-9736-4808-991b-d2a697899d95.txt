I cannot say enough wonderful things about carey's auto service.  He has been my mechanic for years and has never been anything but fair, honest, affordable, reliable, quick , knowledge, informative, and friendly.  He is the reason I am driving my 02 pt cruiser at 190000 plus miles , and I look forward to many more.
