What a great place to have pizza and pasta. 
You will get surprised by the size of the restaurant. 
However, you will get more surprised by the taste of their pizza. 

but,, as a date place? well.. I am not sure about that.
when you don't care about the "intimate" mood.. 
Or if s/he is a gourmet, the taste of food will provide the "intimacy" that you want. lol
