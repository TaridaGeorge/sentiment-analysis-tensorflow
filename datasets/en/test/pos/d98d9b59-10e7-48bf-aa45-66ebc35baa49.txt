My favorite burger joint in az.  I don't throw that statement around, so try it for yourself.  The burger is cooked fresh, not frozen, over an open flame.  The onion rings are fresh and you can truly make it your way at the condiment bar.  Only bummer is that it's cash only, but nothing will keep me away from a chuckbox burger.  I wish they had drivethru.
