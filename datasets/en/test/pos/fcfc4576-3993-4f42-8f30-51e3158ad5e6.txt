Ahhhhhh-mazing.  Took my wife here for her first time ever at a Ruths...she said it was the best steak she ever had in her life!  As always mine was so good words can't describe.  They even hooked us up with Free banana pie for our anniversary .... they had anniversary confetti and everything.  We felt like a king and queen ... Cant wait to go back!

I had the filet and my wife had the bone in rib eye .... and WOW I think I have a new favorite over there!  If you have never been to a Ruth Chris ... go ... it will be the ONLY time in your life you spend so much on a steak, but don't even care!!  I promise!!
