This place gets high marks for value!  I can take my girlfriend and we can both get full off $12-15 with tip.  The place is run by a husband and wife pair who are always there.  This place is no frills dinning, which is fine by me.  My girlfriend and I love the spring rolls and the noodle dishes with whatever meat we are feeling like that day.  This stays in the regular rotation.
