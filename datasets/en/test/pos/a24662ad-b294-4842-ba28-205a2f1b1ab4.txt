I LOVE Noca! It is my favorite place to go in the valley. It is so amazing just thinking about it makes my mouth water. The food is always fresh, they use the best ingredients possible and it is obvious.  I am a vegetarian and there is always a veg option on the menu.  Everything from the wine pairing to the background music has been perfected to the finest detail.  My favorite is dessert though... Salted Butter Gelato, it's orgasmic!  So satisfying, if I were a smoker I'd need a cigarette when I am done.
