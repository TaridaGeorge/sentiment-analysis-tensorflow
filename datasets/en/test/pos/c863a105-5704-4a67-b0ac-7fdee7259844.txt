This may be the best breakfast place I have ever been to. The biscuits and gravy is to die for. Its has this crazy chowder taste, that is so different, but unbelievable. The buiscuits have jalepenos, which are so good. The fried egg sandwich with sausage is amazing as well. I really dont know how they do it, but it is truly amazing.
