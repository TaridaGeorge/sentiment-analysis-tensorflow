This is by far the best tanning salon I have ever been a member of!

The staff is friendly and helpful and their salon is beautiful and totally customer oriented.  They REALLY don't skip out on anything with their customers.

You'll be happy to find some Hempz lotion in the bathroom for your convenience to use after you tan - complimentary!

They're prices are incredibly reasonable and they don't try to screw you over like a lot of tanning places do.  I have nothing but great things to say about this place.  I moved from Chandler 2 years ago and have been to 4 other salons in Tempe and now Los Angeles where I live and never have any of them met the same standards I experienced here.

Very very sad to have left.
