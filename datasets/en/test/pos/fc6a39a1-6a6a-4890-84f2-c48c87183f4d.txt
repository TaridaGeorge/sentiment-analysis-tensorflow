OMG. There are only pros to this place.
I was in town for work, and we booked this room the same day @ $129/night (ish) via AAA rate. What a steal!!!!

Free valet (until 11pm), beautiful lobby, lazy river, eucalyptus cooled towels in the gym, new work out area (well lit w/ natural light), lotion that makes you lose 10 years, great service, dessert bar in the lobby in the evening, beds made out of clouds, comforter made out of kittens and candy, free wifi, 5-star restaurants and shopping within walking distance, 2 shower heads, walk-in closet.....the list goes on.

FYI, there's a $25 resort fee (well worth it) and if you forget your workout clothes, they rent you New Balance apparel & shoes for $5!!!
