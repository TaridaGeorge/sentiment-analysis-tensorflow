Absolutely love this place!  Came here with a girlfriend of mine for lunch on Saturday, and can't rave about this place enough.  Decor is awesome, very sheik and modern.  Service was awesome, and food was tasty.  

They have a great little menu here, and you get good food for a great price.   I went with a parlor burger, and they have a few nontraditonal toppings to choose from.  I cant remember what I got on top, but dang, its good!  Have I mentioned how much I love the decor here?  Service was AWESOME too.  Will return in a heartbeat.
