I love this park!  Very clean!  It has a huge lake and with walk way/ bike road that goes around it.  

I love to come here with y kids and let them ride their bikes around the lake and play at the nicely shaded playground. I believe that you can rent out the picnic areas as well for parties.  I just really love this park, it doesn't have all the nastiness that other parks have.
