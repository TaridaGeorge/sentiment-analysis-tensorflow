Cornish Pasty is a pretty amazing place.  I don't like how the building is kind of a shotgun, which is a bit picky but whatever, the food is great.

I'm vegetarian and they have fake chicken and a whole vegetarian menu that has the same amazing dishes that they have for meat eaters.  And by dishes I mean pasties.  

Ok, so while the Pasties are basically hot pockets, they are really quite a full meal.  I've been more than once, and each time the food and service (people have talked about lax service, which I haven't ever seen) have been amazing.

It's super delicious and it feels neat to be eating something so historic.
