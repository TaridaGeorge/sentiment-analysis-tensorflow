When you get the right server, this place is the perfect trifecta...  Service, food, and atmosphere.  Food is better than typical bar food, but not fancy.  They have enough tv's in the place that you can watch every game without being taken over by them.  Golden wings are great.  Monaco Foccacia is my personal favorite. Kids always enjoy their dinner with mom and dad, maybe because of the chocolate chip cookie skillet with ice cream.  Good food, great service, perfect prices.
