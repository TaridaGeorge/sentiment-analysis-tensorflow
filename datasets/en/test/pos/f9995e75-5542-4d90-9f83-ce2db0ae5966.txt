I would first like to strongly reiterate how clean this store is. It was literally the first thing I noticed when I walked in. Holy shit! It's perfectly organised and practically sparkling. 

The only other Korean market I've been to in AZ is in Tucson and that one is tiiiiiny, so in comparison I think Paldo is a moderately sized store with great variety/selection to boot. I actually think they're about equal in price if not slightly cheaper than Lee Lee (err, at least the things I bought were?). Anyway, I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for somewhere to buy Korean groceries.
