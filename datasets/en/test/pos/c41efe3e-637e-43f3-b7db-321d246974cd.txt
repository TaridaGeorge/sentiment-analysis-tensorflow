Great food and service! I really liked the eclectic menu. I had the briket crisp with mashed cauliflower which was delightful. The mixed drink selection is fantastic too. I really like their naked  (read: healthier) cocktail menu. Just remember naked drinks = healthy. Naked food = plain. So their macaroni and cheese is not healthy, but delicious! Ha!

The ambiance is very charming and comfortable. reBAR has a great patio. The whole set up of Bliss/reBAR is great.
