It took 15 f***in' years for real barbecue to make it to Phoenix. I've suffered the chains and the boiled gray attrocities that some chumps around town kiss with fire and then slather in spicy ketchup. Thank you guys. The meat eats rock and service is good 'ol, unmistakable Texan hospitality. It was good food made by people in a good mood, which makes it taste and feel that much better.

Shiner available but no Lone Star. All good. Also, I could use some type of green veg next time, even if it is fried. Perhaps some green beans with bacon and onion?

P.S. I'm a born and raised Texan. If you don't like that, **** you. I'm kidding. Bring on the jokes. Let's see what you got or if you just serve up the clich√©s you've heard in movies.
