Dr. Ellis is compasionate, caring, and really demonstrates his passion for what he does. The entire staff made us feel comfortable from the moment we walked in to the time we left the office. They went the extra step to make sure my 5 year old was having fun at the dentist! I would recommend this office to anyone who has children. Dr. Ellis and his team are the best!
