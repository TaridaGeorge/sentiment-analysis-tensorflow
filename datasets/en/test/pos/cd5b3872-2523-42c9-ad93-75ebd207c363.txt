The Food? Only if you have to.

The Bathroom?  Only if you have to.  

So why the five stars?  Because it does what it's supposed to extremely well.  The second I walk in I hear "hey Dante" from the bartender as he pours me a Guinness.  Can you say that about a bar in town?  I can sit with friends on the patio and people watch.  You'll likely hear Bob Barker or see Cliff.  You'll notice the alley or like to call it "narnia" for the fact that no one who walks down it ever walks out as the same person.  You can sit on the patio of Seamus and judge the people at Ghost Lounge.  You see life walking around and can do it with a cigarette in one hand and beer in the other.
