I have grown up on ethnic food and spicy food. This is the best of both of these worlds, with the added atmosphere and awesome service, it's become one of my favorite restaurants of all time! That is saying something, especially since I hail from Oregon, where Thai food is all over the place. The spice is always right for those who order it. I typically get a 4 and have tried a 5, and it was just as spicy as advertised, which I am so thankful for! Palee's Crown is the best authenic Thai you'll find in the Valley, hands down.
