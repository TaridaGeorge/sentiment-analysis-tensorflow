By far...the absolute best place to be on a Sunday. Yes, it does get busy, especially if you go right at peak hours. Unfortunately, I work early on Mondays now so I can't par take in the festivities quite as much, but as far as a place to do some day drinking and enjoy AZ weather on the patio, it is golden. The half price bottles of wine are key...my friends and I will go there and get a bottle of wine for $12!! And we get to listen to live music too! Also, the smoked salmon plate is super yummy with capers, rye toast points and cheese... MMMM. I also love the guacamole and salsa which is a great finger food for a group.
