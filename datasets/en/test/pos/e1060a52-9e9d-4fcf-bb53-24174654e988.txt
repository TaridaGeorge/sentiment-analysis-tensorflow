I picked Miguel from Flores Air Conditioning solely on his feedback on Yelp and I'm glad I did.  He showed up when he said he would (I know, he's supposed to but not everyone does!), was very courteous and fixed what was a little issue without trying to sell me anything that I didn't need.

I highly recommend this company, from the service to the professional appearance, it was a great experience.  I will be doing all of my servicing with Mr. Flores from now on!
