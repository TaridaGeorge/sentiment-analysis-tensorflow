Finally got here for Brunch, which negates none of my previous review, in fact it solidifies it!

This brunch is phenomenal! From the Mimosa Flight to the Egg-White Frittata to the gigantic sausage patty on the sausage and egg sandwich...just excellently done!

Dogs are allowed, so bring your pup. Expect to see dusty people having hiked North Mountain as well as hungover hipsters et al. 

Timo is so good that we left athletic gear there and they got in touch and got it back to us! This place is awesome!!!!! Go!!!
