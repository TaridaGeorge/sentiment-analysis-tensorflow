Some days all you want is a good bowl of noodles...covered with a great sauce...mixed with flavorful veggies...tossed with tender meat...served piping hot...priced for a college student's wallet. Thankfully this place delivers and delivers and delivers on all fronts. I have yet to have a dish here that didn't instantly become the standard by which I judged all that followed it. The dizzying array of choices range from the American standards to the adventurous surprises and yet I have yet to dine here with anyone (raised on chicken feet to Asian food novice) who didn't go away satisfied.

Service can be slow, but you'll forget the wait by the end of your first mouthful.
