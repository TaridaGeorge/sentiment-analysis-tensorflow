I have never been a wine drinker but i totally am now thanks to this place!! reasonably priced by the glass you can try anything before you bye it. The staff is incredibly knowledgeable and friendly this is not a snobby joint. I highly reccomend the bruschetta they have some great combinations. The cucumber lemonade is absolutely delicious. The atmosphere is suprisingly intamate but also great for a group!!!
