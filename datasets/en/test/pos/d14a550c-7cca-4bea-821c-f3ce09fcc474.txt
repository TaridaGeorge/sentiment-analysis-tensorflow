The first restaurant I've ever been in when I visited Phoenix. IT IS AWESOME. First of all...cinnamon sweet potato frieds. Delicious. Second thing? That FEZ burger...wooof!!! I only had a bite of my boyfriend's meal and I was tempted to eat the whole thing (he wouldn't let me). Anyways, I ordered a salad, which was also really tasty and satisfying...but times like this I wish I opted for the burger.

I promise to come back one day. The desert wasn't half bad either.
