Okay, I'll start with the most important thing, but you should only take it as a negative comment if you LOVE McDonald's:

Don't go on an empty stomach. The portions are very small.

Okay, on with how great this place is. The cuisine is almost like an Iron Chef episode, where the secret ingredient is always the same: AWESOME. You are never really positive how the chef works his magic like he does, but it's so efficiently amazing that I have abandoned my love for his art and now admit to loving a CULINARY ROBOT.

It's foodie friendly, so do bring gastronomically adventurous dining partners.
