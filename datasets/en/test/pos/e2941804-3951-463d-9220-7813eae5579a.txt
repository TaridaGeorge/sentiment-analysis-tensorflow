I adore Carly's. I love that our favorite Aussie waiter remembers us when we come in. I love that we can walk there. I love that they have more than a few vegetarian options. I love that they have Terra chips. 

But I especially love that the menu has some innovation and creativity. Yay for not having to order a grilled cheese every time!  Yay for having a vegetarian soup! Yay for having great salads that aren't iceberg lettuce with some dressing slopped on top! Yay for having fantastic hummus and olive tapenade!  Yay for NOT having french fries!

So, I say, Yay for Carly's. Keep it up.
