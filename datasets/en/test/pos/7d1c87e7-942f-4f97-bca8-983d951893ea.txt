This place is a home-run to win the world series! The menu is unique and robust. Everything I had was perfect. The kale salad and sashimi were perfect. Great setting and interior. They have fresh nutrient rich juices, too! Wish I could eat here regularly and will make it a point to eat at True Food whenever I'm in Phoenix.
