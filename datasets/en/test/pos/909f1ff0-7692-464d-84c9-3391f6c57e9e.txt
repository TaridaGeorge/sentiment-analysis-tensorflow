As anyone with a pet knows, vets are a dime a dozen. However, based on my recent experience(s) I hope this place is the exception rather than the rule.

We stopped by here--on a whim--after a miserable experience at another vet. They saw us on the spot! We even got to see the vet and he discussed our concerns with knowledgeable ease in the lobby and explained everything going on with my kitten with even greater patience.

The place looks stellar on the inside and has everything you could want in a vet. In addition, during our visit, a rescue dog came in extremely underweight. The compassion the staff had for the dog (and my kitten) was above and beyond. 

I am extremely grateful for this impromptu visit and am confident I have found a new vet.
