I love this place!! The food is excellent. I'm hooked on the Bubba Chicken sandwich w/lettuce wedge for lunch . They have great appetizers and steaks. My Dad loves their chili. The staff are all super friendly, fast service and always remember you. They also have a lunch punch card where every 6th meal is free. I would recommend this place to everyone.
