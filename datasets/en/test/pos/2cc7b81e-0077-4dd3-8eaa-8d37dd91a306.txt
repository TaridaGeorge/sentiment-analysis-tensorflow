Best spot in Tempe to get breakfast! Family owned and operated, Harlow's is the place to go for some good breakfast food, and an excellent lunch menu too. They have great daily specials, and a fun staff of local college students. I would recommend it to anyone, especially after a night on Mill Avenue.
