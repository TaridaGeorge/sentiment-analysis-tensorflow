Again, this is one of those unfortunate situations when a place I love is also loved by many, many others. It's ridiculously busy, but it definitely did not disappoint. Because of the numerous other patrons, it will probably be a little noisy, but it's worth it for the food and wine.

The service was great and I LOVED the bruschetta. I sampled a few wines, including the wine "on tap" and they were all wonderful. There's an eclectic mix of people, ranging from young hipsters to classy elders. It's a nice place without being overpriced and pretentiously intimidating.
