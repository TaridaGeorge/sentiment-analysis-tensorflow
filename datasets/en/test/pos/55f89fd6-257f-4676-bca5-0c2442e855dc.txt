Found this place a couple weeks ago and decided 'why not?'  We weren't disappointed. Ordered and got delivery within 25 mins of the call on a Saturday night at 8pm. We ordered a generic pizza (mushroom and sausage) to test it out along with the bbq chicken salad. It was delicious AND filling plus they weren't shy on the chicken in the salad. We'll definitely try this place again, maybe try a specialty pizza.
