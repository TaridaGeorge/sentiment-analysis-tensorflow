The greenbelt is one of the top few reasons why I love visiting Scottsdale.  From the open spaces for team sports, to the parks along the way with cool activity spaces (like the horseshoe pits at Indian School Park), this is a special place!

This is one of the best recreation areas in the Valley, if not the best, and a great example of the kind of planning we need in Phoenix as the city continues to grow!
