I lived here for a month when I was transitioning to Arizona; I also had extended stays at Biltmore, Westin Kierland, and some other resorts. The Hyatt Scottsdale has a unique blend of being just the right size, with just the right atmosphere.

The architecture and decor are splendid, the service is top notch, and the food in the restaurants is top-notch. And the onsite spa, Spa Avania, is a sanctuary of relaxation and rejuvenation. The lounge area offers a full-service bar, a coffee shop, plenty of indoor/outdoor seating, great mountain views, and a steady stream of diverse entertainment nightly.

It is also situated in a really great location, very central, with easy access to all of Scottsdale, good destinations in Phoenix, the nearby desert playground, and more.
