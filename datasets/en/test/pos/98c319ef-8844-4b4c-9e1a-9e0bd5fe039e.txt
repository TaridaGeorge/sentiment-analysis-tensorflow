I haven't been in Phoenix all that long, but the fish here is first rate and I eat a lot of sushi

Admittedly, the place isn't much on ambience but every single roll and piece of sashimi was out of site. Try the white tuna and giant clam & asparagus dish. Hell, even the sea urchin which I normally am not a fan of was pretty damn good.

A couple of caveats: I did not pay for the meal or participate in ordering of the food (we ordered omakase) so I'm not sure how much what we were eating cost. I recognize that this fact could make a big difference, but at least on this one night, Hana Sushi achieved baller status.
