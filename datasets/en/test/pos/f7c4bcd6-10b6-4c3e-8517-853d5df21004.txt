Last Exit is a great place to see some of Arizona's finest local talent perform. You'll find bands like Violet Wild, Let Go, Source Victoria, Authority Zero and Ghetto Cowgirl rocking out at this super intimate live music venue, which features a small patio with misters. Up-and-coming national acts also grace the stage and you'll see the local music celebrity from time to time such as Robin Wilson of the Gin Blossoms or Roger Clyne of Roger Clyne & The Peacemakers. The beer is very cheap here and the bartenders are awesome.
