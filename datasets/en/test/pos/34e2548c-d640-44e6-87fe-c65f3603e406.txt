YUMMY is the perfect word to describe this place!! Alana is always so nice and has great customer service!! So many selections to choose from and the prices are not bad at all. Just suck it up cuz the smoothies are a wonderful relief, especially during the summer time when its soo hot out! This is my go to place for any time of the day!!
