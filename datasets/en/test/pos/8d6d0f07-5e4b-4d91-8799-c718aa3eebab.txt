I am a pretty huge fan of coffee. I have work at multiple shops and at one point started my own. It's a pretty significant part of my life to say the least.  It is hard to find VERY good coffee in Phoenix. I would say there are probably only two or three places where you can even get a drink prepared properly, and Cartel is hands down one of the best.  I have been there almost every single business day since the first time i tried it a few months ago.  I get a traditional cappuccino every day and it is always delicious. Super friendly, very comfortable place to sit (if the music isn't too loud), and some of the best coffee i have ever had in any part of the world. The only coffee shop that i really promote.
