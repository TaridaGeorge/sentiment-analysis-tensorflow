My parents took me here, I've taken my kids here, and they will likely take their kids here. Pinnacle Peak Patio is an Arizona classic! The BBQ is great and so are the fixin's, especially the cowboy beans and the bead. The 32 oz Porterhouse is simply the best -- although I could never finish by myself (at least I'd never admit to it...).

When I first ate here, Pinnacle Peak was in the middle of the desert. Now it's surrounded by some of the Valley's poshest suburbs. No matter. Once indie the real world is miles away. Your in the Wild Wild West now.

Kids, nostalgia lovers and history buffs will have a heyday here, for the walls and ceilings are filled with all sorts of interesting items. Stay for the staged "gunfights" and superior live bands.
