If you are from  NY  and love NY style pizza this is hands down the best place! 
I'm from the NYC area and live off of pizza. This place gets five stars  for the quality of their food. It is just a bonus that it is open late night as well. The owner is amazing and takes care of everyone that comes in. I feel like family here!
