SCRUMPTIOUS! Their summer deal of a pizza, appetizer, and two glasses of wine for $20 or $25 (I forget) was an awesome deal. Every pizza I've has been delicioso, the wine was great, the caprese was wonderful, and their caesar salad is fantastic. I'm a fan! 

When the weather is nice, I love sitting on the patio and people watching. It's a great combo between a full-service restaurant and a fast-food place.
