My favorite bar in Arizona. Great outdoor seating, great food, great beer, great staff. The bathroom line can be annoying sometimes, but it's never that bad. If you are a guy, you could be peeing on a fountain. The only thing to be weary about is that you'll probably end up running into someone you don't want to see.
