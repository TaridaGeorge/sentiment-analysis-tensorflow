Today was my first time tanning EVER. The girl I spoke to at the front was super friendly and gave me advice on what I should expect and how long of a time I should start with. I'm glad that she wasn't pushy with trying to sell me tanning lotion. The room was clean and it was nice that they offered music to listen to. I'll be going back tomorrow because I got 3 tans for a great deal. I recommend it.
