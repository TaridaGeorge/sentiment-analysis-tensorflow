I had been to Liberty Market before but it just didn't stick out to me.  

I preferred Joe's BBQ across the street. 
Well just this past week we ended up going to both Liberty Market and Joe's Farm Grill and all I can say is..."Why didn't I come back to  both of them earlier?"  

The staff was beyond pleasant.  Exceedingly nice and helpful.  When I got my meal it wasn't what I ordered (or so I thought) but they cheerfully brought me what I actually wanted and offered to package the incorrect food as well and didn't charge me the difference between the two items ($5).  The Pressed Rancher sandwich was great!  And of course my wife said to me that I had ordered the wrong thing to begin with.  

Our server delighted in telling us about their specials, his favorite foods and deserts.  A great experience.
