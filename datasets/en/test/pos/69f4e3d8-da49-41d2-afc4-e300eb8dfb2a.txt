I have been here twice and both times I liked it. 1st sat at the bar and just had drinks with a friend, the staff was nice and quick.

The 2nd time I went I had lunch it was a little pricey because I went to early on a tuesday and had the honey hot -hot wings if it would have been wensday they would have been half the price. They were really good though and I plan on going in on a wed. for lunch.
