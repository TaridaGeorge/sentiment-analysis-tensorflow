After going to a FABULOUS Yelp event (OYE at The Q /Quiessence) I waited for the opportunity to revisit The Farm at South Mountain. With out-of-town guests wanting to meet for breakfast the perfect timing arose. 

Just pulling onto The Farm I felt transposed into another place and time. With a farmers market and artists exhibits surrounding me I headed for The Morning Glory Cafe'. The staff was so accommodating (giving driving directions to my lost party), friendly and engaging. 

The menu selections ranging from Omelette's, Eggs Benedict and glorious muffins my taste buds were perked. Whether it's breakfast, lunch or dinner try this haven - you will be so happy you did.
