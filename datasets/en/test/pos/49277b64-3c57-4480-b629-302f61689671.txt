I have a rescue dog who would race out the door if it was even cracked a little bit, (forget ordering pizza, or receiving a UPS pkg!) It was just  an impossible situation, and I was at my wits end. Then along came Leah. In just a few sessions, my little Moxie now sits and waits at the door. I can leave it wide open and walk all the way across the yard to the curb and she will just sit and wait until I tell her "Okay!" Then, instead of bounding down the street -- she will bound right to me!
Leah created a small miracle for me and my little rescued baby. A small miracle, but huge results.
I can't recommend Leah enough. And I cannot thank her enough.
