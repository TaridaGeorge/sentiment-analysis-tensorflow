LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS STUDIO! The teachers are very welcoming and friendly, and the classes they offer are great. It definitely has a sense of community, but not the community where new people aren't welcome, but where new friends are encouraged, so don't be afraid to go by yourself. The studio is very clean and very although its an intense workout, the breathing and meditation that they teach you is very calming as well. I highly recommend this place.
