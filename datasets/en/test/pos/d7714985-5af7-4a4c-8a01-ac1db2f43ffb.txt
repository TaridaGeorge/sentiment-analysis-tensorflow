Reliable wireless internet is hard to come by. But great wireless that is FREE, plus plenty of outlets, enough seating, cozy atmosphere and good coffee? Too good to be true. 

The coffee is cheaper than Starbucks, with bigger containers. It's relatively quiet, yet crowded -- the laptop crowd have definitely  discovered this gem. 

Even better, there is a big open sliding glass door that connects Hava Java to The Gelato Spot -- a truly delicious place with tons of great flavors! So you can enjoy a bit of gelato if you get bored with coffee. 

As someone who works from coffee shops a lot, this place really caters to people with laptops -- and most coffee shops don't. 

I'd recommend this to anyone.
