I never give 5 stars but I must stay this was a great surprise! And I am one to usually write bad reviews on yelp. Just the other day I told a new cafe they remind me of a subway that was shut down so they painted the walls green and started serving coffee. Anyway, I took my fiance at lunch time to Thai'd Up and I loved getting seated quickly, and the bowl of coconut milk soup that was given to us right away. Nice touch! The menus are easy to order from. I loved the garlic and black pepper chicken dish! I love the decor. Well done. The name is even kind of fun. I even saw a 12 news broadcaster eating there..got to like celebrity sightings! Service was super friendly even though they were packed in there. Yes..we will be back!
