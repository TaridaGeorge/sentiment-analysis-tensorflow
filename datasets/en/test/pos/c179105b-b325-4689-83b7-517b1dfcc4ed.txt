I highly recommend this place! 

Service was phenomenal! everyone was super friendly and gave good food recommendations! 

I went here with a girlfriend, we order some bruschetta appetizers, Riesling, and I was so glad that they offer Frambroise Lambic Fruit Beer because I am not a typical "beer" fan in anyway shape or form. 

Food is tasty, Drinks come in great assortment, & Vibes are slightly intimate, but very chill!
