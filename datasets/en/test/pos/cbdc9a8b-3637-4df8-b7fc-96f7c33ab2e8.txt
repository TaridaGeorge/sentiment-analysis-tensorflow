This was my third time at Daily Dose and I have to say each time has been remarkable. The first time I went, I shared the breakfast nachos with a friend and jeez are they dangerously delectable. The nachos along with the bacon Bloody Mary should be a prescription for a hangover.   

The next two times I got the Strawberry Mint Salad with Grilled chicken. The balance of Salad , goat cheese and strawberries are perfect. Not overly dressed , but each bite is flavorful and refreshing. I think I found my latest addiction. I will be back soon to get my daily dose.
