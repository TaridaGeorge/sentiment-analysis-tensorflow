I am on the last day of a three day seminar at this lovely retro 50's styled Hotel. The conference rooms Soho 1&2 were standard fare full service from a pleasant staff. I don't know what the cost of that end was but it was high quality and likely expensive. The restaurant ZUZU was Moderately expensive but VERY Tasty! The bread was AWSOME Lightly salted sorta like a pretzel ... Hot and soft reminiscent of Hawaiian Sweet bread. Ohhh Yeah! Although I didn't stay in the hotel It was a great hotel Im sure. Thats All Folks!
