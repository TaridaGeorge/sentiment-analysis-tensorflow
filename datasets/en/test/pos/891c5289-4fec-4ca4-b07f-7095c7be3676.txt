The sign reads "Lounge" above the door. I knew I found a gem some 4 years ago. This is what it's all about. Truly dope. It's tasteful to the likes of going in to relax by yourself for a quick drink or poppin it off with friends..... Yea, it comes with a pricetag, but you get what you pay for.

It's not try-hard by all means. It's consistent and reliable for every visit.

Cheers!
