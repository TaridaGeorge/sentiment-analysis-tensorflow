I knew I was in trouble when I was told I needed to dress up for our anniversary dinner. Hubby set up a wonderful surprise, which turned out excellent for both of us since neither of us had been to Donovan's before. It was obvious to me we have been married for 18 years, we both ordered the exact same meal- the filet mignon with shrimp scampi. Wow. Steak that melts in your mouth. Fresh veggies, and delish au gratin potatoes. I wanted to lick my plate clean, but figured in this upscale setting it probably wouldn't have been appropriate. Service was also excellent, we weren't kept waiting for anything. Great way to celebrate!
