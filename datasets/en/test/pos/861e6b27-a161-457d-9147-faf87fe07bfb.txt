We had a bad traveling experience (partially due to the crappy airport car service arranged by the W with ExecuCars or something) but as soon as we got here they made it better.  Very friendly a d accommodating.  The corner suite (301) is huge with a great view a d amazing layout.  
The downstairs and upstairs bars are tasty (though the raspberry lemonade is too sour and the drinks have a lot of ice) and priced in line with most other places.  Room service is prompt and well done.
This is clearly the jump off for the area so worth staying here to avoid lines and get great service.
