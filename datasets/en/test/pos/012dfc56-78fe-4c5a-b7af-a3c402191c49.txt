I was in the mall, and as I looked to my right, something caught my eye. Could it be?! the color was right, I was excited, and I was chatting to my friend but in midsentence I stopped and I couldn't contain my excitement. My friend was like, WTF?! and I was... OMG i Must buy!!! Dear reader, it was the red skinny jeans I always yearned for, and for years I would look at store windows I would pine to wear a pair. And with my recent weight loss, the time was ripe, I had to have this gorgeous, eye-numbing, eye-loving, ass-showing, leg-hugging jeans. So, I tried, loved, and bought. it was caveman easy. and from that day forward my wardrobe has forever been dazzled!
