Right in parent's backyard, the perfect rescue for the holiday suburban blahs.  Very nice, new facility with mutiple intersection spaces and loops, a really fun design.  Big rock climbing structure in the middle of the elevated jogging tracks, which also encircles a basketball court and shoots off to the weights and other courts.   Great community resource, 5$/day for guests.  Strangest thing: sauna rooms are practically sitting in the middle of the gym all exposed, rather then discourage wouldn't this encourage the exhibitionists?  You just can't win with steam rooms!
