The Coronado is awesome.  Caramelized onions, Red Bell Peppers, Provolone Cheese and homemade Horseradish cole slaw.  Topped with fried onion ring and roasted chile mayo.  It is cheesesteak goodness.  The place looks sketchy from the outside, but inside is VERY clean and nice.  Staff are very friendly and attentive.  I have been here a dozen times since I started the draft of this review, and they are still worth every bit of the 5 stars.  The rib-eye meat they use is so good and makes for great sandwiches, my family has taken to calling it 'dragon meat'...(we already call the Capistromi @ Capriotti's 'unicorn meat')...they are so good it's mythical.
