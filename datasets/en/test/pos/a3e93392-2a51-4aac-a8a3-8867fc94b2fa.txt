Anyone comparing this place to Joes needs to have their head examined.  BBQ in the valley Texas BBQ, Pork On a Fork, Haps, The Pits Again, Q to U BBQ, and in that order (all are very good).  Joes is cafateria food with sauce on it.  Sorry east valley folk but you don't even travel out of your neighborhood let alone to other parts of the city.  Texas BBQ stands tall.  They also just added a BBQ tater which is very good as well.
