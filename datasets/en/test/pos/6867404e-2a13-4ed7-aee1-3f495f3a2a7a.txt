I went in to find a cocktail dress. The dresses were located all over the store, sorted by brand. The tricky part was I also needed something modest, with sleeves. I wasn't finding anything. I asked customer service rep Tracey for help. She took me all over the store and showed me about 20 different options that met my criteria!  She was sooooo helpful!  I tried about 1/2 of them on, and in the end found the perfect dress. I will definitely be shopping at Kohl's again!
