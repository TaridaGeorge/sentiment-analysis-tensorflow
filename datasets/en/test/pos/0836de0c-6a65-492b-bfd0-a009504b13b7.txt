This place is too good to pass up. There is a great atmosphere inside and on the patio. 

We started with the the fritto misto, which offered fried calamari, shrimp, and zucchini. The batter was so flavorful..loved it. 

For dinner I had the margherita flatbread and my boyfriend had the bacon wrapped pork tenderloins. The pork was so amazing, I wish I had ordered it!  We split the ice cream bar for dessert which was a great pick. 

Bottom line: Cool place, rockstar service, yummm.
