I would have never thought of chicken and banana as a good combination until I had their signature Jerk Chicken sandwich today. It was different, but good!

I work downtown and look forward to trying some of their other menu selections. The owner, Charlie, does stand up comedy at the Ice House Tavern from time to time. 

As other reviewers have mentioned, the restaurant is in an odd location. However, the decor inside is nice, and the food is good. I hope this place does well!
