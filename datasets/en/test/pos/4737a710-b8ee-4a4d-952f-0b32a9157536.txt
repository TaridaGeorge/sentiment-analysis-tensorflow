Great lunch specials! Had the sweet/sour shrimp and my guest tried the sweet/sour pork.  Each came with fried rice, choice of egg drop or hot/sour soup (he got egg drop, I tried the hot/sour, which was fabulous) and a crab puff.  We also ordered appetizers of crab puffs and potstickers.  The crab puffs were really cheesy, but with extra sweet/sour, who cares?!  The potstickers came with a wonderful soy-ish sauce that my guest added to his fried rice.  The overall meal was delicious!  We will be back!!
