This. place. is the bomb.  Great happy hour, bartenders are always friendly and helpful, and if you go enough they'll remember who you are.  Chef Rob does an amazing job with the food on just about everything - some of my favorites are the Arcadian pizza and the California Chicken.  Oh - and if you like sweet potato, you have got to try the sweet potato tots.  You can die happy after you have these.  

Crowd is pretty diverse, but everyone always, always gets along.  That, coupled with the great drink deals and awesome food, makes the Tavern a regular hang-out spot for sure.
