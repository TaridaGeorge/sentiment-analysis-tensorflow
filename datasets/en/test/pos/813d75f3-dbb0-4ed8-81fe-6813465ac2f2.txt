Nice little coffee shop right here on Central. It has been here quite a while now.
It has everything you could want in a Coffee Shop. Great coffe, really good Tea. Nice things to eat. They even serve alclohol.
With the weather being so nice outside it is really nice to sit on Central and watch the cars go by. 
If you have never been here it is nice to stop in every once and a while.
Nice place to pass some time!
