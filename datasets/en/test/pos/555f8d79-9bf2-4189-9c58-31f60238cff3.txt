Suzanne is both a talented and wonderful nail tech and a joy to deal with!  I've enjoyed having my acrylics done by her for years and they are always exactly what I want!  Her pedicure is not to be missed.  She is so fun to talk to during your appointment, I always enjoy my little break with her every couple of weeks.  I can go in and just relax and chat for a while which as a mom and a business owner is like a mini vacation!  

Also it's worth mentioning she is also extremely talented in natural nail care if acrylics are not your thing.  I always enjoy seeing the manicures and pedicures of the clients leaving as I'm coming in.
