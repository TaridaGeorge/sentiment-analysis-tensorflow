We had a group of 12 of us on a Saturday night.  We told them it was a farewell party.  They arranged so we were all seating together in the back of the place behind the bar.  It was perfect for us to chat, get pics, and share food up and down the long tables they lined up for us.  

I think we ordered almost everything off the menu (appetizers, drinks, sides, sushi, rice, main dishes, desserts, etc).  Everything I tasted was FABULOUS!  

I will be suggestion this place to my husband to celebrate our wedding anniversary.
