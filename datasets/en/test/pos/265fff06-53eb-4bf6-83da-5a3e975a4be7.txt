This is the best pizza in Tempe!  Make no mistakes.  I lived there for a year about 2 years ago and I still miss Tessio's.  It is just a carry out & delivery place.  I think they got a few plastic chairs and maybe a table with some NewTimes on it, but not really a place to dine in.  Tessio's also tends to have good deals if you want to throw in some wings or whatever.  You can also pick up some beer right next door to go with your pizza.
