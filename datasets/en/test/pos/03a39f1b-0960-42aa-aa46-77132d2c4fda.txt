Incredible coffee. Roasted by the folks over at Cartel, it is a great place in the art district of Scottsdale, so we will usually go out there on date night and have a coffee and walk around. 

Staff is always fantastic. Chalkboard menu wall is nice. I don't work on that end of town, but if I did, I would hang there a lot more. Prices are good.
