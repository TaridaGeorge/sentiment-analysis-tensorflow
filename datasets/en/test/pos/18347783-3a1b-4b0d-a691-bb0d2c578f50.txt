I'm a flight attendant and was out exploring PHX on a layover and stumbled upon this place.  OMFG!  The food here is insanely good!  I used to go to this Korean-Hawaiian BBQ while on my layovers in Honolulu, but have never seen it here on the Mainland.  This place is just amazing!  I tried the Dinner Combo and am still dreaming about it 3 days later!
