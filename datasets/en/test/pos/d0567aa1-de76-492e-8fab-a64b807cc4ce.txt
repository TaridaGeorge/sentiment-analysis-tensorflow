Okay so a sports bar is the LAST place I expect to find mouthwatering deliciousness. But this place is undeniably a must eat. Ive been here a few times and I have never been disappointed, but what prompts me to write about it is the Acapulco Shrimp Quesadillas. They are out of this world, the spicy jalapeno creme sauce is genius! My coworker ordered the pesto pasta and it smelled heavenly. The smell is that smell that even though you're stuffed beyond belief you still want to keep eating because it smells so good smell. Does that make sense.  Other than that its a great place to people watch..off track betting spot.. need I elaborate? You will NOT be disappointed by the food in fact it will trump any bad service experience you may have.
