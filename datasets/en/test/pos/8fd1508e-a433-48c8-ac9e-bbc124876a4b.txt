My search for the perfect plate of General Tso's chicken has taken me to dozens of Chinese food restaurants, large and small, all over the country.  I can say with confidence that this place is one of the better Chinese food restaurants out there.

I was not familiar with "New York style" Chinese food before, but apparently it means dingy restaurant, ugly chairs and tables, the same generic menu that you've seen dozens of times before, flimsy plastic eating utensils, and damn good food.  

I will overlook all of the meh that is on the exterior of this place for the fact that they serve what I consider to be the best General Tso's chicken in Arizona that I have found so far.
