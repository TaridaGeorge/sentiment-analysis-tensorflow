Lets start with dessert - best I have ever tasted. I had the Butter Cake - which is served with a huge VAT of fresh whipped cream- wow! Second the cake is warm and moist and salty - yes SALTY! Surrounded with strawberries and orange slices - this dessert surely made me smile. 
The live music was amazing! I rocked out all night to a lovely mix of great tunes!
The martinis were cold and awesome, the crab cocktail was superb and the Blackened Salmon from the Columbia River was perfect. 

Overall a pretty good experience. I will certainly go again. 

I was purposely not going here because they don't do a happy hour - but I was drug there by a date (I know, poor me...lol) and have since become a fan!
