Go Kat Go has been a great staple for me throughout the years.  The owner always stocks up on great antiques, vintage wear and great greaser t-shirts.  The highlight of the shop for me is the featured local artists and hand-crafters that peddle their wares there.  Very engaged in their community, Go Kat Go have been known to participate in many art walks, festivals and other local events.  The owners are friendly and helpful, and the overall shopping experience is a very nice one!
