Been there twice-once for breakfast and the other time for a coffee and gluten-free treat. Both experiences were wonderful! I recommend the Crabby Pant omelette and gluten free flapjacks! Nice vibe and great open indoor/outdoor patio. Nice selection of snacks and love the organic coffee! Parking is challenging if busy!
