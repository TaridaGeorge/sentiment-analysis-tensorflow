This is one of the best chain restaraunts you can go to here.  My kids absolutely love this place for the atmosphere, peanuts, and those warm rolls with cinna-butter they bring to your table as your seated.

Staff here is always pleasant, and attentive.  The ribs here are pretty good and it is usually all I order when we go, went last night and decided to try something different.  I went with the sirloin tips served over sauteed mushrooms and onions. WOW!!!!  Absolutely delicious, much better than the ribs!!!  And for what you get, the pricing is right.  Portions are big and very satisfying.

We just enjoy this place, great for families!
