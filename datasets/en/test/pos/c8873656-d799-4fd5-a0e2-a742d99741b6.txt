Great authentic Chinese menu.  Thank you Helen for translating the menu!  My significant other will be able to go there & order off the Chinese menu now!

I like the rice cakes.  Also a vegetarian dish with lima beans in it.  Not quite sure of exact translation to English what it is.

The staff is always friendly.
