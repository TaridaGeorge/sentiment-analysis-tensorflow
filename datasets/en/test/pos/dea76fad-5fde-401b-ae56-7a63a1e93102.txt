Before I went to Dave's Doghouse I was the kind of person who stuck my nose up at hot dogs. To me it was just backyard grilling food not worthy to pay a premium for. Then I finally went to Dave's. The hot dogs are down right delicious and the options are extraordinary. The thing that really brings these little guys together is that delicious roll that the dogs are put in. This place is probably my favorite place to eat on campus and I recommend it to everyone. Especially try the Barbecue Dog and the Mac 'n Cheese dog.
