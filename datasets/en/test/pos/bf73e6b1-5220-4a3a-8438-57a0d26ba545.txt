Wow...where to start...right when you enter the eatery, the environment is very friendly as well as the staff! The food was great! And being half Ethiopian, I know quality Ethiopian food. Their injera had a doughy texture and was amazing and I really recommend the Lalibela Exclusive if you're coming with a group or with the family. You can even also add other entrees with it and I really recommend their shiro wat too. Price was also reasonable and you will leave stuffed and satisfied!! Lalibela won't disappoint you! Great Ethiopian restaurant overall!!
