love this little hole in the wall speakeasy. I'd been there before but last nite was the first time I ordered food. absolutely amazing. their cheese fondue and bread are a must. I will be getting that everytime from now on. the antipasto platter was wonderful. the whole grouped loved it. our server was absolutely amazing. we definitely added more on top of the gratuity.
