I love this place! I've been eating pizza from Spinato's for about five years now! And I've been to them all (this one, scottsdale, tempe, glendale -- except I don't frequent Ahwatukee, so I haven't been there yet) - they're all great!

The sauce is what sets it apart from other places. Also, I usually don't like pizza that is cut into square/rectangular shapes (weird, i know) but with their pizza, that's not a factor.

You can't go wrong with whatever you order. Perfect for dining in or take out!
