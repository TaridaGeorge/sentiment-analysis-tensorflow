With all the new businesses opening up nationwide who would have ever thought that a frozen yogurt shop would have blown up! I was very pleased with the overall atmosphere of the shop and really enjoyed the frozen yogurt selection. This is an excellent self serve yogurt shop in Arizona offering many different toppings. This will probably go nationwide soon so get a scoop before this company explodes into the successful business chain! If your ever in the area let me know because this is my neighborhood yogurt store and I would be happy to meet with over a bowl!
