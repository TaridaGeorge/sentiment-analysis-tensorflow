LOVE the chandler location!

Parking is definitely easier than the Tempe location!

The lady at the counter was super helpful. I kept forgetting the flavors and she went over everything with me...even twice! 

I wanted to bring some paletas home (I live 15 minutes away) and she was super helpful in packing them for me. They give you ice when you take home the yummy popiscles, delicious!!

I love this location and the paletas - they are delicious, unique and full of fresh fruit/flavors. LOVE IT! BRING IT TO CALIFORNIA! 

Cali needs some of this!
