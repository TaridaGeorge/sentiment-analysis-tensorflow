F&E is definitely a staple part of my weekly grocery shopping.  I keep going back for three real reasons:

1. The prices are enough to get me to buy a lot of staples there.
2. The portions enough to fit my lifestyle (if you are single, a couple, or have a fairly small family, this is a great place to get your groceries).  
3. The staff at this location are awesome.  They really care to see their regulars and have a good time at work, whenever possible. (I'd like to think that this spills over to the customer).

if you live in the area, it is definitely to drop by this market.
