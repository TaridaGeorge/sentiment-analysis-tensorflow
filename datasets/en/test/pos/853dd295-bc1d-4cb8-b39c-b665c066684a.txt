I am extremely happy with the level of service provided and price charged at Sear's Auto Center in Chandler, AZ.  I ran over a nail and air was leaking from my tire.  I got two new tires plus an oil change and other minor things fixed for a grand total of $225 (taxes included).  
Sue, the woman who took care of me, was extremely nice, friendly, honest, and took her time explaining all the options I had.  
The job was finished relatively quick - about 3 hours.  They had to do a maintenance check to make sure I wasn't leaking oil and because there were no problems,  I was comped the fee.  
I will definitely be recommending Sears to others and will be back here.
