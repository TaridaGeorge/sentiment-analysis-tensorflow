I can't wait to come back!  I was here for the yelp event also and was so impressed with Roka Akor.  I won't go into much detail about the food since everyone else has described them quite well.  My favorite was the butterfish tataki... my mouth is watering just thinking about it.   The food was excellent, the service was flawless... you would have never guessed that it has only been open a month.
