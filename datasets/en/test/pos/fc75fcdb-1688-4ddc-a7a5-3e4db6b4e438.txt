Like the other reviewers said, this place is difficult to find.  I was going to go there for breakfast but could not find the place. Went to my doctor's office and on the way back, decided to look for the restaurant again and found it. Finally saw the "Bertha's Cafe" sign. It is right next to a pilates place and a consignment shop. I decided to order the aspargus havarti sandwich and it was great! I ordered China Mist iced tea and a malted chocolate mini cupcake. Sandwich does come with a cookie too! Now that I know where the place is, I'll go again and try it for breakfast. Definitely a must place to go for a declicious sandwich.  Oh their desserts looked good..brownies, muffins, etc.
