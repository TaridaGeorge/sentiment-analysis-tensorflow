Awsome first experience! We had breakfast at Chase's Diner for the first time yesterday. The service was exceptional! Thank you, Jen. The food was great! I had the French Toast with eggs and sausage and the misses had the Green Chile Breakfast Skillet. Mine was perfect. The misses raved about the Green Chile so I tried some of hers and it was delicious. 

We have found our new breakfast joint!
