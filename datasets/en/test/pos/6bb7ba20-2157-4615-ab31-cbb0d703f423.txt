AWESOME Front Desk Staff - We LOVE Kenneth!!! Everyone was super nice, very accommodating, and friendly. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone going through the Phoenix area. They take security seriously, and the room was divine. Way to go Team Sheraton! (and Kenneth, did we mention Kenneth? fantastic, wonderful Kenneth!)
