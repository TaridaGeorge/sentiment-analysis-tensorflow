This is the best pizza in the world.  Seriously.  I feel like that's all I have to say.


But I will say more.
As far as the pizza goes, I've only tried the Mama Spinato's pizza because it's so good that I can't get myself to try anything else... probably because it's just perfect.  The flavor... the texture... oh God.  Salads, breadsticks, cheesesticks, and calzones are also amazing.  And TRY the pumpkin gelato that's seasonal--it's TO DIE for.
Also, great, quick, friendly service.  They box everything up for you, and offer you giant to-go cups for your drinks even.

My mouth is watering right now.
