Their pizza and salads are some of the best that I have ever had. I have had their pepperoni pizza, the margarita pizza, tomato and italian sausage pizza. I have tried all of their salads and they awesome! I make a stop into this tasty terrific joint ever few months. Best time to go is a little before 5 to avoid the dinner crowd which can give a wait upwards of 25 minutes. I do not recommend the Sangria as it has no flavor! There is a small gelato parlor that is connected to the restaurant for a sweet treat after dinner if you have space in your belly.
