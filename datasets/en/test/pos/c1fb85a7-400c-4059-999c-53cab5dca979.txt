I dig this place. They give you a decent sized salad and these dangerous fried chips with a sweet sauce I pretty much drown anything I order in. The prices are great and they give you a decent amount of food. I don't go for the atmosphere because there really isn't one but the prices are cheap the food is good and the service is quick. They get a thumbs up.
