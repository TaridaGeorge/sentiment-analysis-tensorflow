My hubby and I came here for lunch yesterday afternoon.  We had been wanting to try the place out for awhile.  When it came up on Groupon-- we thought it was perfect time to give it a try.  

I was pleasantly surprised by their menu.  Most wine bars have a limited menu when it comes to food.  I ordered their egg sandwich (sounds weird but it was sooo good!) and my husband had the chicken pesto pasta.  Both were so amazing!!  Waitress was super sweet and very attentive.  

I like the atmosphere.  Comfy and cozy....  and they have great wine specials.  I will def have to bring my girlfriends here for a glass or two in the future!
