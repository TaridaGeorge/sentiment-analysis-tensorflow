Cibo is actually a house that's been converted to a restaurant. There is seating and a small bar area inside, as well as outside patio seating in the front yard. The outdoor area has white lights strung up among the trees, very cute. This all makes for a wonderful atmosphere: charming during the day and romantic at night! 

The service is also great. Our waiter was friendly, knowledgable about the menu and made some solid recommendations for us.

On to the food: The pizza is AMAZING! I think Cibo is way better than Pizzeria Bianco. The crust is thin, but it's still doughy and a little chewy. We ordered the Salciccia (tomato sauce, sausage and cheese) and the De Notte (4 cheeses, spicy salame, no sauce). The sausage tastes like it has rosemary in it and the salame is indeed quite spicy. 

Delicious!
