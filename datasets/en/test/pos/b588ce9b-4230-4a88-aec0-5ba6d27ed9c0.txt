ABSOLUTE MIRACLE WORKER and a WONDERFUL WOMAN!!! 
A local dry cleaner destroyed my girlfriends bridesmaids dress the day before the wedding!! I quickly looked up a tailor near by. I drove like mad to  Seams To Be at 1pm when I explained the hazard I was in. Chuy responded with "Don't worry- be back by 5."  When I arrive back at 5 five, it was done and more beautiful that when my lady originally bought it! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! THANK YOU CHUY! We owe you big and thanks for the hug! We will be back!
