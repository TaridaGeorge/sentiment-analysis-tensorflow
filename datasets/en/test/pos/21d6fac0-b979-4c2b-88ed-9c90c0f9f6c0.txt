Dear lord. This is where all my childhood "No... you can't have that" turns into an instant "Yes" -- on a sugar fueled steroid style high.

Loud music.
Awesome presents from baby to way, way grown up.

Jolly Rancher candles.
Fruit scented nail polish.
Umbrellas.
GIANT sized candies.
Bulk candy.

Hello kitty goodness, oh my.
