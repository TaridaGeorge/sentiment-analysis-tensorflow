The best little music store in Phoenix.  Central Music has been a fixture on Central Avenue (just north of Camelback) for years.  The staff here is seasoned and will help you find whatever you need.  If they don't have it, they will order it.  You can pretty much find any sheet music you need in this store.  They also rent instruments, and sell some accessories.  They are "sheet music central" though so if you are looking to shop for instruments, you need to go some where else.  This is a tiny little store, and the best parking can be had around the back and next to Dairy Queen.
