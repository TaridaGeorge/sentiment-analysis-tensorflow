I wrote a really long review for mellow mushroom once before but I'm not seeing it anymore for some reason so I'll state the quick pointers.

1.  The pizza is awesome.  Yes, it takes longer than 10 minutes to cook a GOOD pizza... so sit tight.

2.  The meatballs are amazing.... try them.

3.  Their beer selection is by far the best selection in the North Valley HANDS DOWN.

4.  The wait staff / management is super-friendly so don't be afraid to losen up and meet some new people while they are serving you.

5.  Happy hour is 1/2 all alcohol and appetizers... need I say more?
