I love Firehouse Subs.  Soooo delicious!

I'm a regular here because it's close by.  Even if I wasn't close, I'd still be a regular.  I haven't had a bad sub or bad service here yet (knock on wood).  Love the sub card they have, too.  I always enjoy it when a place rewards me for eating there on a regular basis.

They just added a touch screen fountain pop machine, too, which I thought was cool since I'm a computer nerd.

It's not the cheapest place on earth, but that's my only gripe.
