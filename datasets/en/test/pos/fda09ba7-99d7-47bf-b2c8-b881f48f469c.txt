What a great place this is! The mixologist encouraged me to try the portobello burger and it was to die for! I usually prefer veggie burgers over mushroom, but it was ridiculously good. I also had the best bloody mary there.  Mind you, I've never liked them but whatever yummy deliciousness he put in my glass converted me! Great vibe, cool staff. Oh and definitely try the mini donuts...
