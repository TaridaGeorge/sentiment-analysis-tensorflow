I recently moved to the area and have found my new hangout.  The crew @ Cupz N' Crepes are fantastic and their coffee is to die for!  They offer incredible caffeinated drinks as well as unloaded ones, delicious crepes and an atmosphere that draws you in.  Highly recommended, I usually stop in there 4-5 times a week.
