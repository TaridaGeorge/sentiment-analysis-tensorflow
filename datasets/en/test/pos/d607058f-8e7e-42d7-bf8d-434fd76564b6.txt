This review is actually for Leah the dog trainer at Petsmart.  Although the store is great, and has most things that you need (the usual generic stuff - if you want something super cute you need to go to a dog boutique).....anyways, Leah is a fantastic trainer.  She has puppy classes, intermediate classes and she has a class for tricks, which I may take next.   She is patient, funny, and she can get any dog to do just about anything.
