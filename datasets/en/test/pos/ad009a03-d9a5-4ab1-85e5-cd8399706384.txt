My new favorite coffee shop! The baristas are friendly and really seem to enjoy their work. The shop has comfy couch and chair seating, as well as tables for eating or working. 

The coffee is the perfect blend of strong and smooth...none of the bitterness that sometimes comes with bold coffee house blends. Both times that I have gone in during the evening they have brewed a fresh pot for me without my having to ask.

The dessert treats are in perfect portions for a little taste of sweetness.  Loved the pumpkin buttercake!

Elevate offers live music on select nights, which I look forward to experiencing soon. They have both indoor and outdoor seating, and a separate area which can be closed of and reserved for meetings and other events.

Overall, this is a great coffee place with a casual vibe.
