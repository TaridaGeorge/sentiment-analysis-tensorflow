I have just began going to this nail salon on a regular basis. I have been there 3 times now. They are always very nice and happy to see me. They do a great job on the nails and their customer service is amazing. They always have something to watch on TV and even go so far as to ask what I want to watch. They also offer water or soda every time I'm in there. Additionally, like the other reviewer mention they have a reward program. For every dollar you spend you get a point. After a certain amount of points you get credit (Ex 100pts = 5$).  This is a great nail place- as I have been to many, I think this place is one of the best!
