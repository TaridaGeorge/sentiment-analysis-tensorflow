Stopped in for lunch with a friend the other day and I can't believe I didn't check this place out sooner.  I remember when this location used to be a Wendy's while it still has some Wendy's-esque features, they gave it a very nice look:)  I ordered the Thai Lemonade (Thai iced tea with lemonade) and gulped it down in five seconds, it was super delicious.  For food I ordered the CoCo Soup (coconut milk soup) with no meat sub extra veggies and a side of rice.  It was so flavorful, and the soup was just was I was looking for!  My friend was equally pleased with his garlic shrimp dish and side salad.  I can't wait to hit this joint up again when I'm in the mood of tasty Thai cuisine!
