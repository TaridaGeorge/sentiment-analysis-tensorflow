After years of spending hundreds of dollars a week in dry cleaning, I discovered Montecarlo Cleaners about 5 years ago.  I love this place.  I was a little hesitant at the beginning, I couldn't believe they were charging only 1.99 per piece, no matter what piece.  I gave it a try and I was impressed.  In five years I  have only had one incident with a piece being damaged, however the owner himself, Frank, gave me a call and paid for my husband's shirt.  They raised the price to 2.25 a piece now, but it is still an awesome deal compare to other places.  I don't understand why you have to charge almost $10 for a dress to be dry cleaned.  I will gladly recommend this place to anyone.
