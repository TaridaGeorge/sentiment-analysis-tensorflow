I'm not a huge meat eater but my first bite of that tasty, juicy, scrumptious burger triggered me to attack the rest cave man carnivore style.

The burger was super fresh and you can put any of the fixins you want at no extra charge. I also ordered the fries which are natural cut and salted to perfection. They give you a generous portion, plenty to share. I'd never tried fries with malt vinegar but my lunch mate insisted and oh boy was it delish! Wayyyy better than ketchup. 

The restaurant was well kept  and the staff was friendly. We sat outside because the weather was especially nice, but the seating wasn't so comfortable, so I'd probably opt for inside next time. 

I will definitely be back next time I'm craving a fix for my meat eating side.
