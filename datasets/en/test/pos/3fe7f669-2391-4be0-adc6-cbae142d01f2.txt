Came here specifically in search of a good lobster tail and wasn't disappointed, but the highlight was my husband's steak au poivre with cracked black peppercorn cognac sauce! It was the best steak au poivre either of us have ever tasted, which is my husband's favorite we get all over town so we're becoming experts. I believe we also tried the truffled mac and cheese and a spicy ahi tuna roll which were very good! 

I would eat this stuff every day if it didn't cost an arm and a leg. We'll definitely be back.
