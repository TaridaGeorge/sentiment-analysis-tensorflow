Stopped here before a show at Phoenix Theatre. Easy rail access. Saturday night menu includes a fixed price $25 three course meal. Food was very tasty. Five stars for food, service (hugs to John), Martini's, ambiance and location.  The martinis were tasty, food well portioned (not too much) and left just enough room for flourless chocolate cake or tiramisu.  I'm a fan of Saturday night dinners here.
