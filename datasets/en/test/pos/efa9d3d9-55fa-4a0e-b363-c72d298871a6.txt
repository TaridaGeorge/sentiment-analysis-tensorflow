Twangy tart + fresh mangoes = crazy delicious. 

(Throwback to the adorable Andy Samberg :)  )

The twangy tart tastes like plain yogurt, which I never eat, but as a frozen yogurt it's delicious.  And it only has 22 calories per ounce??!!   Sounds to good to be true but that's the official word from their website.  

Although they only post 3 sizes (small-med-large) there is actually also a kids size, which is 4 ounces.  88 calories well spent -- much better than a 100 calorie pack.
