I love Chloe's. I almost make a daily appearance, whether it's for coffee, baked goodies, my favorite smoked turkey sandwich or a quick afternoon snack. A great place for morning coffee meetings with tables in a nice open space and decent patio as far as patios in downtown Phoenix go. SUPER friendly staff and still fairly speedy service even during lunch rush hour. There's a Starbucks a few doors down, but if you choose them over Chloe's, I will be personally offended.
