Outrageously good thai food in Scottsdale with great service to match.  Our waiter went out of his way to make our large group feel welcome.  He even had a dish made that was not on the menu. 

Try the Jalapeno fried rice, pad thai,and special fried fish. The fish is fried with a tast coconut spicy chili sauce.  The chicken dish that is fried and then a dark garlicky sauce on top is sublime.  Coconut shrimp appetizer and tom yum soup was a hit with the group as well.

They have a thai beer in a large bottle that is pretty good.  

As for spice level we had mild to hot at our table based on the spice level that we asked for.  The waiter did not miss a beat and we were so glad we went to this place.
