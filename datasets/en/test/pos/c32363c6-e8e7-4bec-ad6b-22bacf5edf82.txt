Been to C Fu many times.  Figured I may as well write a review now. 

I've only been to C Fu for dim sum.  Since leaving my comfort zones of the Bay Area and Las Vegas, I was dying for dim sum.  What a gem this place is.

It's loud, crazy and over crowded on the weekends, but service is fast, nice and friendly.

I love the dim sum.  Dare I say I've found my all time favorite dim sum place ever?  I think I am going to!

We've taken some of my husband's co-workers to dim sum -- we think it may have been a bit too exotic and overwhelming for them.  We didn't care, we still ate.

A definite place to be for cheap group eats.
