I love The Parlor. I have been there many times and everything I have ordered has been great. The pizzas are awesome. The salads are fresh and flavorful. I've tried a few delicious wines. 
Service is good without being obtrusive. I'm the sort who likes my server to be my server, not my best friend. They're there when you need them. No more, no less. This scores big points for me. 
It is so rare to find a place that is all hits and no misses, and The Parlor is that place for me so far. You must go if you haven't yet.
