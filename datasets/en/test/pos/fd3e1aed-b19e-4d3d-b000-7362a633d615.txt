Best Irish bar in town.

We frequent their back bar. The bartenders are always helpful, fun and attentive.

The best overall: April. She works inside 5-6 nights a week.

Their food is fantastic. I havent tried a bad thing yet. Beware the Boxty though, its HUGE. 

Best shepherds pie in town (most places put cheese on it, and but put i mean stack 3 layers of greasy cheddar on top of the mashed potatoes).
