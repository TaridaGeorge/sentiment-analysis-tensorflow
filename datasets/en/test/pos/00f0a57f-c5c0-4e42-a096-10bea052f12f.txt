Can't say enough good things - I am from out of state and wanted to send something nice to my dad for Christmas. Needless to say, I waited until the last minute and came across Pie Snob. Friday before Christmas Eve they delivered him a beautiful Apple pie (for a small fee). I couldn't believe how helpful and accommodating they were.

In fairness, I didn't get to taste the pie myself but it was RAVED about by my dad and his company. Hoping to grab one the next time I am in AZ!
