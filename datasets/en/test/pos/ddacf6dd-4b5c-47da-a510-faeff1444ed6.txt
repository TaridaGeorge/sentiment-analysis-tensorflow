I have a cool boss.  Yep, she took me (and the work team) to FEZ for a holiday lunch, and I fell in love.  I have a penchant for juicy, RARE burgers.  But our obsession with protecting ourselves from ourselves means I can rarely get a rare burger.  Rare steak, yes...burger no. Isn't it all cow?

So happy as a pig in mud with my burger, I soon developed an addiction.  I am not a fan of sweet potatoes.  Something about the color (good for decorating, not eating), texture and taste.  Basically all parts of a sweet potato.  Yet, I found myself ordering more.. 

and finding excuses to drag my husband there to undo his weight loss success.  *evil laugh*
