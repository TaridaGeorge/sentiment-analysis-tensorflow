I work in downtown Tempe, so among all the places to eat within walking distance, this is by far one of the best in the Mill Ave District. It's a comparable price point to the other healthier locations but I appreciate the creativity put into the daily rotating menu and the quaint courtyard to eat in, away from the street. If you need it to go, you've got it within 5 minutes. My kind of place!
