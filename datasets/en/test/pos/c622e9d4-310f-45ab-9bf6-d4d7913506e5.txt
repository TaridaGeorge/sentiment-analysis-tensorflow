I had a "giant" New York combo slice.  The food tasted great, however was not as large as the name implied. I did not mind the price so much, but had it not implied a larger size I would have ordered more. I am not a big eater, but I recommended two slices if you there too eat lunch.

The service was fast and friendly.
