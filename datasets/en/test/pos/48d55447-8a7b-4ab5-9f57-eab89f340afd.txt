When I get a bit of spare money I order the assortment of Woobie's Cookies. They are delicious little gems - soft snickerdoodle style cookies full of flavor and all natural. I especially love the ones filled with cocoa ganache and creme brulee. If cookies are your weakness you should definitely try these.
