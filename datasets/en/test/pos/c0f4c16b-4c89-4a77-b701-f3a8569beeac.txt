Five stars is definitely tough to give but this place gets it. The ambiance, food, and service were all amazing. For me,it is definitely a special occasion type of place. Great romantic spot, but guys I wouldn't take a crap shoot first or second date here. A dinner for two will run 200 bucks easily, especially if you do the 75 dollar a head six coarse meal, which is what we ordered and it was organic food porn heaven, every coarse. Set aside about two hours for this meal, they space it out perfectly between courses, so when that six coarse dessert hits the table I still was able to fit it in my belly and not feel disgustingly bloated and did not need a "I'm too overweight to walk scooter" when I left.
