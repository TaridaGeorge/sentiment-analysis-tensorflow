This is a fantastic little bar/restaurant.  I love any place that has good food and a real bar.

Wings - very very good

Gyros - Super deal, and super tasty, $5 for Gyro and Fries!

Other Greek food - Amazing

Desserts - Yum!

This is the perfect spot to have lunch if you are in South Tempe.  I have a hard time not stopping here when I go to Lowes on Baseline and Rural.
