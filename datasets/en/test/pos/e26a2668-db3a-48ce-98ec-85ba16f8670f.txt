Being from England, I am used to bread made freshly in the local bakers... Balkan Bakery makes the bread daily on the premises (you can actually see them doing it), and it is AWESOME! They make from several flours, white, whole wheat, rye, seven grain, etc... In various shapes & sizes. They also offer some ethnic food items that are bakery based, some savory and some sweet, including the best tiramisu I have ever had. HIGHLY recommend them, need to get there in the early AM though as they sell out fast.
