Wow. This is the best breakfast pre-race, post-race and remembering I used to race place! We were in town for that Ironman and ate here no less than 3 times in about 5 days. Delicious and hearty breakfasts. The servers were all really fast and friendly and i even saw one of them volunteering on race day! I think my husband would consider this the best pancake he's put in his mouth. I think they were called Power Pancakes or something.  The eggs/omelets are also very tasty. The only downfall I see is that we don't have this place at home.
