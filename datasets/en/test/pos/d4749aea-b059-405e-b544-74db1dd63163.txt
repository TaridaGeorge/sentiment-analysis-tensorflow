I agree with Raymond, place must be under new management because the service and food was amazing! My only complaint is the same as Nakama, which is in the same shopping center, I ordered Sushi, my husband ordered a cooked dish and my food came out about 10 minutes before my husbands and I really wish they would time it better, I think I'll request they bring them out together next time. We will absolutely be back!
