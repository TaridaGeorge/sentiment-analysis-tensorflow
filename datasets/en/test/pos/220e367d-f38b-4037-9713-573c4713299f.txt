I love thai house! Their thai tea is the best, must try! I am so spoiled by them. I always get the pad thai or the spicy basil chicken. The girls usually know my order so i feel special. Service is quick, and lunch special is reasonably priced for what you get!
Not much decor, tiny place but great food and service. 

ps - I wish they had free refills though.
