I love this salon! It feels like home everyone is so friendly.  The decor is adorable, I always find something new to check out.  The receptionists are all lovely.  I personally go to Bethany because she is amazing but I have used Karen before and found her to be a consumate professional.  I feel like the previous poster should really give her a second chance, everyone is late sometimes and I wouldnt fault her for going out of her way for a regular client.  She did my make up for an event and I absolutley loved it!  Top notch.  Becca's nails are second to none and there are lots of other amenities I cant wait to try!  I would definetly recomend this place of business to anyone I know.
