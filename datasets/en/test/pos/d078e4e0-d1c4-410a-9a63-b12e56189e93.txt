Great food for low price. Try the Italian Beef sandwich and you gotta have the fries. When I first wanted to try it my boyfriend said it was going to be awful but once we went inside and tried their food he change his mind and said I am coming here more often. This place is just what Arizona needed an east coast taste. Arizona needs more of the east coast food over here.
