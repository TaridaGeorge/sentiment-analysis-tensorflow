This place is well worth the drive from Phoenix or Scottsdale. The food was excellent, the atmosphere was rustic elegance and the service was the best. If you are lucky enough to get Anthony as your waiter your in for a great experience. Our party of six ordered beef and seafood and everyone was totally satisfied. The prices aren't cheap but they are not bad. Like I said well worth the drive to Cave Creek.
