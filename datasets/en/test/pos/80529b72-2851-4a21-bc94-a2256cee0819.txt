Another gem in this concrete desert-within-a-desert. Trumps Lola on seating/chilling space, although the coffee is not clearly better (or worse). 

P.S. (to the management): I'm not sure that the coffee bar is the best place for having emotionally charged job-performance conversations with your employees. Not that it really bothered me personally, I just felt bad for the dude getting called out in public.
