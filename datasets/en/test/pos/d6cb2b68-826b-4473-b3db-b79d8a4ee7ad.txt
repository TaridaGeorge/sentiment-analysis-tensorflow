Looking for the perfect pizza for a lazy night in? Mamma Mia is where it's at. A tiny little storefront in a shopping center that reminds you of a traditional slice shot in a big city, you walk-in, grab your pizza and go. The pizza is AMAZING. Not too greasy and the price is just right. We're partial to the cheese, hawaiian and feta/onion/tomato combo. Plus, the slice & soda deal is perfect for a quick fix. We're pizza whores and this is hard to beat for fast, casual pizza to-go. It's been our go-to for years. 

Be sure to scan the local coupon envelopes for deals or check online. Always $3-$5 off online orders.
