WOW!! Amazing creative and delicious food, great service.  Buying as much of their food as possible locally and daily really makes a difference in the quality of the food. Atlas Bistro is small and has a very personal feeling unlike some of these huge noisy restaurants in Scottsdale. I went with my wife for our 1st anniversary and it was just perfect. The staff met all my special requests perfectly. Some people bitch about a corkage fee, but if your buying the wine next door its still cheaper than if the restaurant marked up the bottle themselves. Atlas made the best, most tender and still very large mussels I have ever had! Also tried sweet breads for the first time and they were just amazing and tender. The food is not cheap but it is a great value for the quality of food.  We will be back again soon.
