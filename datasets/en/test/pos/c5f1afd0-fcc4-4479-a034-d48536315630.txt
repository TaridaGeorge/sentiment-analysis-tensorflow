This. Place is awesome! They always update the flavors and keep the popular ones. I almost gave a 4 start review due to the fact that they are very pricey, but I like them too much t do that. I actually live in the apartments next door and my daughter, fianc√©, and I love walking over there on a Sunday night and grabbing a good snack. We really love this place, but then again, I have NEVER tried a different frozen yogurt place. Definitely a great and fun place!
