This place Kicks ASS!!! It's the perfect place to find birthday and Christmas gifts. Besides all of the cool t-shirts there are plenty of rock accessories and memorabilia as well. Bullet belts, patches, flags, incense, studded armbands and belts, watches, belt buckles, posters, cutouts, and buttons are among some of the things you can find. I've been buying shirts here for years. The staff and ownership is second to none! The selection is as eclectic as it is diverse. Not once in all of the years that I've been a customer here have I not been able to find the shirt that I desire. Shirts 'n' things puts the special in special order, whether you're looking for Van Halen or Discharge, Mayhem or Boy George, this crew will track it down just for you. If t-shirts are your game, Shirts 'n' Things is the name.
