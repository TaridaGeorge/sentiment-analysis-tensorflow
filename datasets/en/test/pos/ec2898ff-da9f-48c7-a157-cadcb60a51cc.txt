I used Calin as he was referred to me from my friends at Worldmotors. He fixed a ding in my Lexus that was fairly large and 3 different body shops quoted over 2k. He spent about 4 hours and the car looked like new. 

If you have a ding, even a large one give Calin a call. I would trust him 100% with any car.
