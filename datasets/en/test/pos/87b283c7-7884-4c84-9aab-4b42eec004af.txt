Flo's is a role model for other restaurants and this one is sure no exception. The service and the food  are consistently excellent. You can tell that the staff has been extensively trained in customer service so you leave as a happy customer. 

My favourite item on the menu is the shrimp pad thai.   I also like the fact that they have lunch and dinner portions.

Some other reviews mention that this location will close within twelve months.  I strongly doubt it!
