I love coming here for lunch. It's fun to get the bruschetta and a cheese board to share. The panini's are my favorite around. I usually order half a panini and a salad or soup, depending on what the soup of the day is. The Italian Picnic salad is really good. You really can't go wrong with anything you order. Everything is fresh and delicious. The atmosphere is cool and you can chill out, have some wine and enjoy the food. It's a great place to meet friends and hang out for awhile.
