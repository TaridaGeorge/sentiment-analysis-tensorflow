Jeanne's new store is fantastic. I stopped in last Saturday just to see her new digs, and ended up leaving with two new-to-me bracelets and a spoon ring made by a new local artist. Pearls has a great selection of vintage clothes (for women AND men), jewelry, handbags, and housewares. And the space is open, organized, and easy to browse through. When I was in, Jeanne's mother was working, and she's just as fun to chat with as her daughter. 

Great stuff, great atmosphere, and great people working there = 5 stars from me!
