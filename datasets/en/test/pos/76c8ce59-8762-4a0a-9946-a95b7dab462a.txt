I'm a bit of a coffee snob so my first order of business was to find a good coffee shop on our trip. This was by far one of the best coffee shops I've been to. It rivals Old Soul Coffee in Sacramento, CA. 

The staff was very friendly, helpful and knowledgable with the coffee they roast themselves. 

The coffee was awesome; definitely spend the extra $$ for the Clover Machine coffee. We also had the omlette for breakfast and tuna salad for lunch. Both of which were spectacular. 

We enjoyed the atmosphere as well. The space had a lot of character with their metal/industrial feel without being too corporate (SB) or trashy (like a lot od local coffee shops can be). There was plenty of seating as well.
