Let's get this out there now:  I'm a huuuge fan of NYPD Pizza.  I love the Chandler location, the Avondale location... it's all the same!

Anyways, this place is as good as it gets in Arizona.  Their pizzas are always delicious, fresh, and hot from the oven!  The garlic knots are truly the best.

The atmosphere is super cute.  It's just an overall great place to dine with some friends or your significant other.
