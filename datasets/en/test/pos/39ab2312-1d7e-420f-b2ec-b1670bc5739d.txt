Ssshhhh! Don't tell anyone....China King is NOT a buffet. This place it as authentic as it gets! The food is amazing, the staff is great and they are always good for recommending something new and different. But, like I said...Don't tell anyone about this little gem. We don't want to ever have to wait for a table!
