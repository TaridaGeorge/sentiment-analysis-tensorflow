David and his staff did a great job on our home energy assessment. David was clear and precise when he found areas of our home that we could change to increase our energy efficiency, and even took digital photos of hard to see areas. He is very knowledgeable and we have recommended him to friends and neighbors because he has helped us to save money on our monthly SRP bills.
