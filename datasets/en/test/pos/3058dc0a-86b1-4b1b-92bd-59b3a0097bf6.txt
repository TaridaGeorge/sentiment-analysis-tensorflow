CPC is a fantastic niche restaurant that will put your grandma's pot pies to shame.  I've ordered the majority of their pasty menu over the years and haven't gotten something I didn't like...  The only drawback is the time it takes to prepare the food.  Busy or not, if you didn't call your order in, you'll wait 20-30 minutes for your food.

This place is both meat-eater and vegetarian friendly, so it's a safe place to bring your group of hipster friends who disagree about diets.  Pricing is more than fair at about $10 per pasty.
