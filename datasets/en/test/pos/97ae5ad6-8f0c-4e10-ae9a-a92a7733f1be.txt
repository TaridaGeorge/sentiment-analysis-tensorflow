Now that I actually do live in the hood, it's time to revise. What's up neighbor?! That's how I feel now when I stop by for a glass of vino. Maybe they don't know me that well, but they do seem to recognize my dog. She's actually why this place gets an extra star - super dog friendly patio. Bowl of water and constant affection from the staff every time my hound comes along. She's spoiled here and it make me happy.

Food is still fabulous and the wine...Oh the wine. How I crave that Garnacha when I'm anywhere else. There really is no time that's not good to be here, but I love lounging outside on week nights when it's not quite as busy. I always meet fun people here that are also soaking up the good vibes. I officially can never move away from Arcadia.
