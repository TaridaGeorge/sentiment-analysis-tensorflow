Yes, it's an Apple store and they are all very similar. I love this one because of how close it is for me and who doesn't love the Biltmore area and it's beautiful shops. Today it was very crowded, but I've never not been in this store when it's empty. I did have to wait about 5 minutes longer than my scheduled appointment, but they did get to me and I was helped by a very nice young man.
