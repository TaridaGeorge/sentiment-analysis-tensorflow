Now this...THIS is a sushi restaurant!

It was amazing. I went there one night with a couple of guy friends (in ended up raining, but even though we were outside, we didn't get wet from the coverage of the outdoor seating). The miso was incredible, and every item we ordered tasted SO fresh! I remember having a bite of my friend's Vegetarian roll...they made me like ginger because they CANDIED it! Delicious! This place also got my ex boyfriend to LOVE sushi...which is something he thought he'd never like!

All in all, when I can find the time to come back, I am DEFINITELY bringing my other friends along! This place is friendly, well-lit, personable...and my compliments to the sushi chef on a job well done!
