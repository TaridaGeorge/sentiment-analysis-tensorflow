Ok, apparently I'm the one breaking ranks here.

After I bought my house, I had a housewarming party and I bought a cake from Tammie Coe. It was 50 bucks and people said I was crazy for spending that kind of money on a cake. That was almost 2 years ago, and people still remember how awesome freaking good that cake was. My grandma sat on the back patio with a slice, a glass of wine and a cigarette and looked like she had died and gone to heaven. I don't remember if this location is like a caf√©. I don't think so. But she has a location on Roosevelt and 7th St. in downtown Phoenix and that one I believe does. All great cities need great desert shops, and Phoenix has one of the best.
