With several Orthodontics offices in the valley, we found it difficult to quickly decide who to use for our daughter's braces. After meeting with several Doctors to discuss braces , we chose Dr. Serrano & Kyger. We are extremely pleased with our experience.  Save your time and take it from someone who did the research- this is where you want to be!
