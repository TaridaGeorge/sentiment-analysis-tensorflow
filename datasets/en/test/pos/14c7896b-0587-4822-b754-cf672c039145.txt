I really don't know what's not to like about mojo. You can sample flavors before you buy, and they have a great variety of toppings. There's everything from fresh fruit to candy. I prefer fruity and lighter toppings, but my boyfriend loves all things chocolate and candy. Mojo is perfect because we can both get something we are happy with.
Just be careful when you are building your creation. I've definitely witnessed some people who are surprised by how much their creation cost after it gets weighed.

My only dislike is they don't have any in NorCal!
