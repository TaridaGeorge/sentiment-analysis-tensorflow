This place is DELICIOUS!

It's super cute and you get full service anywhere you are sitting, whether it'd be outside or at the bar. Service is super friendly! The BF and I got the ceasar salad with chicken, tomato soup, a slice of pizza, and pastrami sandwich. Everything was great! Very satisfying. I especially enjoyed the Pizza and it was the pizza of the day too. It had bacon bits on it and it was oh so satisfying! Yummy!!!!

Service was great with refills and very attentive staff. I would definitely come back if it were only to get the pizza.
