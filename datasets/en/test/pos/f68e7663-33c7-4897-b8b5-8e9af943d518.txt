I must say it is a great place to go when your craving some good authentic Soul Food and waffles..... The atmosphere is very friendly and relaxing.... Their is always help walking around ready to serve you and answer any questions you have.... 

I had the 3 piece fried chicken with a side of collard greens and mac and cheese it also came with a buttery corn muffin.... The food was hot, fast, tasty, and fresh.... 

I love the gospel sunday.... It makes me feel at home.... And the fact that you can order kool aid makes this place feel even more like home..... 

Whether you have room for desert or not you have to order it...
 The banana pudding, red velvet cake, or sock it to me cake.... They all taste great.... 

I most definitly will say that you should give this place a try.... 
Mmmmmm.....Mmmmm..... Good.....!!!
