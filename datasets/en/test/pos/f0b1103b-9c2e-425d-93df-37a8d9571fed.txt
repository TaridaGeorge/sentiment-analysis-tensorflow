We just moved into the area and found this place driving around. It is indeed the best quick Japanese bowls we've ever had. You can tell that they don't get the sauces out of a can like most places. The chicken was quite well done, seared and juicy at the same time. I'd also add that the vegetables were about as perfectly cooked as I've ever had--each one seemed separately steamed to ensure it all came out the right way. Aside from that, I don't believe I've ever had a crab puff that actually tasted of crab at all at comparatively priced places. We will definitely be going back; I can't wait until my mom comes up to visit because I've got a delight for her.
