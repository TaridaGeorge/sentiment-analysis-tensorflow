Love this place! Domenic's is my local bike shop, although I'm equidistant to Tempe Bicycle, but I'd much rather come here. The folks are very friendly, and the prices are reasonable. I've been in to the repair shop in the back for a multiple of silly reasons on my part -- my chains fell off, crooked handlebars, seat adjustment, flats, bad brakes -- and they found for me a back reflector and installed it -- and they've never charged me. Just super nice guys all around who are happy to help and appreciate a good bike.
