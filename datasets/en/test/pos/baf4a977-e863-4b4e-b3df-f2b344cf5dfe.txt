Having a vet I trust is really important.  We've been going to this clinic for about 4 years now.  They are always able to do last minute appointments and with a sick pet on your hands, this is invaluable.  Our cat was diagnosed last year with diabetes and they've been great with helping us adjust and learn.  The doctors and the techs are great.  Highly recommend.
