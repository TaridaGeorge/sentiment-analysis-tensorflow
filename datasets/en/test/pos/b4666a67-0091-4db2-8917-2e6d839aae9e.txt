I just moved here from San Francisco.  I LOVE Sprouts, I shop there every Wednesday. Their fresh produce are great and affordable.  I love their chicken sausages, cole slaw and bulk items like almonds and walnuts.  My favourite is chocolate covered cherries!!!  I used to go to Trader Joe's but they don't have weekly sales like Sprouts. Don't forget to bring some shopping bags, you will get 5 cents credit a bag.
