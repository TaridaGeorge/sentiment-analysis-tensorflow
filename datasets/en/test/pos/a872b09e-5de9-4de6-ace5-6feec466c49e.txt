Food City? Are you kidding?

Yelpers, it's been a while since I've felt like had to edumacte you on something, but instead of driving by, stop and look. Certain Food cities, such as the on listed here, have Tortillareias (dining areas). Food City has the best store bought chips in town at any location, but the tortillerias will blow you away. Excellent, affordable Mexican dishes are available cafetieria style, the beans are kick butt, The Salsas in the store are completely fresh an tasty, Give it a try! 

BTW, It's a good place to practice your Spanish.
