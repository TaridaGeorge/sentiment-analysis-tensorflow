Papusas!  This is one of the few places that I actually have cravings for.  You can't go wrong with any of the papusa flavors (carne asada is my favorite followed by loroco flower) and the fried plantains are an excellent treat.  Eat the papusas topped with the curtido (coleslaw) and salsa, it really pushes the flavor over the top.
