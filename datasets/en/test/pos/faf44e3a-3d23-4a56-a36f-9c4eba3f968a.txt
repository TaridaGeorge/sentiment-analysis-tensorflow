All I can say is excellent in every aspect.  The fried chicken is mouth watering, the waffles are the best I have had, and the red kool aid is so damn good!  I don't know how they make the red kool aid like they do, but it's the best.  The service is always friendly and fast, and I have ate here numerous times.  I have never once had bad food or a bad experience.  Thank god I found this place in phoenix.
