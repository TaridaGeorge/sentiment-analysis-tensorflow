I am a new pet owner and was very skeptical about taking my toy poodle to the vet to get a health certificate because I didn't want to be taken advantage of. I went to the Family Vet Care in Ahwatukee and was extremely impressed. All the ladies there made us feel super special and took pictures of Sandie my toy poodle. They took great care of us. I loved the office, the service, and the price. It was very affordable and top quality. They also offer grooming and boarding. I normally take Sandie to Petsmart but because I loved FVC so much I will be bringing my grooming business to them from now on.
