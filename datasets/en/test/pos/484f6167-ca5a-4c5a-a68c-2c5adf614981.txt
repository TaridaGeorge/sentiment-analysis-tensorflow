It's refreshing to find a restaurant concept that features natural produce and healthy fare in truly remarkable flavor combinations. I adore True Food, particularly the local vegetable crudit√©s with tzatziki and olive dip. The heirloom carrots, crunchy radishes, baby bell peppers and other earthly treats are fabulous. I also highly recommend the steelhead salmon or turkey bolognese. The servers are respectful of food allergies or preferences, and they are happy to customize drinks if your palate is being particular.
