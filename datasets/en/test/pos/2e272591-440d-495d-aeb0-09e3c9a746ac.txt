This is some of the best sushi I have ever had, obviously fresh and made to perfection. The taste was rivaled only by the presentation, the Caterpillar Rolls looked like a caterpillar, complete with sprout antenna and octopus sucker eyes. My Calamari looked like a little squid was so fresh and tender it nearly melted in my mouth.
The menu has a lot to offer for non-sushi lovers, too.
The service was great, four servers despite the place being small and having only about 10 or 12 tables.
Highly recommended!
