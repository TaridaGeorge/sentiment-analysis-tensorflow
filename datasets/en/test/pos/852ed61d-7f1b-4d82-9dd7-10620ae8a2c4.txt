Is it a restaurant is it a Deli? Not sure one thing I am sure of the ham is winner winner pork's for dinner. 

I like to go and get slices for sammies during the week. The croissants there are really tasty. Put the ham on the croissant omg there's a party in your mouth. Delish

If you have never had Honey Baked Ham you aint had ham dang this is good stuff!
