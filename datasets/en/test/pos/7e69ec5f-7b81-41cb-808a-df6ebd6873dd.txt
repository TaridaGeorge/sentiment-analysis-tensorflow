Wayne from Az Cold Air met with me and gave an estimate for replacing our heat pump this past July.  It wasn't the highest or lowest, but he took the time to explain the whole procedure and exactly what was included as well as what options were available so I felt best going with his company.

The work crew that came out started around 7am, and had the old unit completely removed and the new one installed and blowing cold air within just a few hours.  Everything went exactly as was explained during the original estimate.

The followup with rebates was great too, and customer service at all levels was excellent.

As a side bonus after analyzing my power bill from the past couple months, I'm saving $142/month and it's about 8-10 degrees cooler at all times!
