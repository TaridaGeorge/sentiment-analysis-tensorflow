By far best pizza in Chandler, AZ.  I love the thin crust and the coal ovens give the pizza a great taste.  My boys and I love the pizza here.  My wife thinks the pizza is a little salty.

However - I wouldn't order pizza from anywhere else given a choice.

They never have coupons- and that is because its worth every penny.

Pizza is thin and ingredients are fresh.
