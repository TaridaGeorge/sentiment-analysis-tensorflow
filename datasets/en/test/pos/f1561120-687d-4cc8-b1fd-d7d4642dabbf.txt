I trusted the Yelp community and found yet another hidden gem. 

Mi Comida is tucked away behind a Taco Bell in a strip mall. When you walk in it's a little shocking how small the place is. The service was a bit slow. As other have said there is only one older gentleman that seems to do all the serving. He was very friendly but moved at his own pace. The food makes up for any other shortfalls this place might have. We were a party of 5 and ALL of us enjoyed our food immensely. I know nothing of the South American authenticity but I know taste and this meal was plain great. 

Bookmark this place now and give it a try next time you're felling adventurous. You'll thank me later.
