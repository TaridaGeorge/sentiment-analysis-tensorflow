I've been to Postinos in Arcadia several times and I always seem to forget how wonderful the food is. Last night was my first time at the Central location. I loved the atmosphere. It was comfortable, elegant and was a great space to hang out with hipsters. We ordered our usual Bruchetta and the mediterranean  salad. The salad was so amazing , I wish I new how to make the dressing.  I have had every Bruchetta they make and there isn't one I don't like. I hope it isn't too long before we go back again. It amazing how something so simple can taste so amazing.
