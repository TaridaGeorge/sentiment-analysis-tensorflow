Everything is delicious!! I always could not decide which one to have for the day. If you love bread, this is the place for it. If you love cake, this is the place for it. If you love love sweet/dessert, this is the place for it.

At the Masuri Festival, they were so nice....they made the beef teriyaki sandwich for me even though they already started to pack up their stuff to end the festival. Thanks a lot and it was yummy.
