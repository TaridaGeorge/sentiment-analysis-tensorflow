This place is perfect.  I would much rather give my money to these guys than a big chain.

Sandwiches are amazing.  They use high quality meats and cheeses, you can tell.  I like the Stacked Philly, but ask for pepper jack cheese instead.  

And if you're really nice, they might give you hummus as a side.

Great coffee and drinks, and really nice owners.  Seriously check it out.
