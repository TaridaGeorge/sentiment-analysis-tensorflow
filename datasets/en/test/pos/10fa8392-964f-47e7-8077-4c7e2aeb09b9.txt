I've been going to Lifequest for several years now. I went in because I had carpal tunnel so bad it was debilitating. I could barely work. Even brushing my hair could shoot pain down my arms. I didn't even consider the neck and back pain that I had when I went in. Just thought that was normal.
After an initial period of frequent visits to fix everything, I now just go there every other week for maintenance. It feels so good to take care of myself. The staff is great, and they also have a few massage therapists in office.
