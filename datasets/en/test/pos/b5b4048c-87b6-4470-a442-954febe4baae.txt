Our family loves Liberty Market for breakfast.  My husband and I  split the breakfast quesadilla, which makes the portion perfect for us.  The salsa is tasty.  The potatoes are a little heavy on the onions, but I don't like onions at all.  So, the onion thing is more a personal problem than Liberty's recipe because my daughter LOVES the potatoes.  We have only had lunch/dinner items a time or two.  I remember the burger being pretty tasty and again, we something we were able to split. 

The atmosphere is nice and fits the quaint area of old town Gilbert.  The outside seating is very pleasant.  This is going to sound weird, but go to the bathroom, even if you don't have to actually "go".
