I love My Sister's Closet and was thrilled to discover it on a recent trip to Trader Joe's.  It is packed with amazing bargains on really cool clothes, bags, etc.  Most of the stuff I looked at was near brand new...cast off by a Scottsdale chickadee with a budget bigger than mine.  I have no shame!

I always check out the handbags first because you can find some amazing bargains.  And lets face it, if you want nice high quality bags, who can afford to have one for every outfit or season.  

Love this place!  Thanks Trader Joe's for being strategically located!
