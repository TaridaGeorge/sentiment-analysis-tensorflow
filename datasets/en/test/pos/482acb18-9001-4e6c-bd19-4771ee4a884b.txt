This spa is located in a very nice hospital. I have had various manicures and pedicures here as well as a facial and a prenatal massage. All were lovely experiences, I would certainly return. The staff is warm and friendly, and the place is very clean. If you are in the hospital say having a baby or recovering from surgery of some kind you can even get an in room service. 

The nice thing about this spa is their prices are very reasonable, and they are not allowed to receive tips. I was told on one of my visits that this is beacuse the profits of the spa go to the Women's center in the hospital.

The hospital also has complimentary valet parking during the week (tips are welcome there though). The parking lot gets pretty crowded.
