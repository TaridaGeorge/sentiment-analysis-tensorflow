I highly recommend going to this church! It is Bible Based and to the point! The kids program is great my 5 year old loves going to Sunday School. The welcome is warm but not in your face. If you haven't been to church ever or in quite awhile this is a great place to get back into it! This Church really lives by their motto "Love God, Love People"
