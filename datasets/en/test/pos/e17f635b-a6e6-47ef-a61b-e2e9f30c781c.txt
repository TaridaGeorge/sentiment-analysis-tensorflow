I love Grazie's. Franco is like another uncle in my Fiance's family. We go there everytime we visit his parents. He always hooks us up with unique family style meals that are off the menu and really gives us a true family experience. Hard to find that personal attention from where we are from (Southern CA). Any questions about his foods are fully explained and its obvious that Franco does care about his customers and treats them like family. Its always a treat to go here when we are in town.
