Just had a wonderful dinner experience at Hula's. Our server name was Ginger (like the movie-star from Gilligan's Island!!) she was AWESOME. The food, wine atmosphere, staff were all great. My partner and I owned a restaurant in San Diego, so we know food and this was a great food experience. I had the pork and cole slaw sandwich and he had the coconut crusted chicken. We couldn't decide which was best. Total tab was $40 and change with 2 glasses of wine. You really must try Hula's it will be the best favor you do for your taste buds!!
