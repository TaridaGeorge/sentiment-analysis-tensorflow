AMAZING!

That about sums it all up.
AWESOME service from every staff member.  Authentic sweet tea (my sister from tennessee gave the approval!).  Love the mason jars for the drinks. and the food...........wow.  I never knew Fried chicken and waffles could be so amazing.
I'm in love.  : )

This was my second time there and i will most definitely be back!
