I love Lulus cupcakes! They always have a perfect amount of frosting and alot of their cupcakes are better than the ones at sprinkles. This is because they seem to be moister and hold themselves together better. 
I love the raven! The Sales people are nice.
 So yummy! And I love that the place is pink!
