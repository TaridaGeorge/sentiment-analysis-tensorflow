We were going to the movies today and did a Yelp search for resturants. This place was at the top of the list and for good reason. Its fantasitc! 

Apon entering i was taken by the great decor and cleaness. We ordered Spicy Edemime and Potstickers to start off. Then i got the Arizona Sushi Roll and my wife got a noodle dish. 

We will back! Loved it.
