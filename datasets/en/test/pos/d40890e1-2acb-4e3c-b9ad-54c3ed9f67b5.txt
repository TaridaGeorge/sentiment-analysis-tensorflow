Bomb a$$ waffles. White meat is a tad dry. Superb service. I haven't gotten good service like this in ages. Manager visited every table and was so sweet- thats what a MOD is suppose to do! Fiance has been in Thailand for a month, I asked what he wants to eat when he gets back...and he said lolo's!!!
