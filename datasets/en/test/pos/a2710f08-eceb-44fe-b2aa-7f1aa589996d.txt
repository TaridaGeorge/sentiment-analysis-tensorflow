I was there on Valentine's day so it was busy. Still our waiter was attentive and friendly. The food was great - I was expecting less because was a busy night. We have to order 4 courses and I must say that my duck confit risotto and braised short ribs were amazing. Tried my gf's lobster bisque (ok) and ribeyes (nicely prepared but not extraordinary). Overall we had a great time- will definitely go back again.
