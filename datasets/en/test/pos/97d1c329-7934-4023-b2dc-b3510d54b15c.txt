my favorite restaurant in the valley, no questions asked. everything is so carefully prepared, lovingly delivered to your table and so delicious. you can't go wrong, really. eat here. eat everything, eat it all. chef charlene badman has a way with vegetables. it's really pure magic. all my meat-eating companions have nothing but good things to say. 

go here. you won't be disappointed.
