The people at LTD are honest, hard-working and great to work with! I've used their services on multiple occasions and have always been impressed with their reasonable prices, great service and professionalism. I highy recommend them for all your wedding or party needs, and will use them again with total confidence! 

I've attended and hosted events at their Studio 5C venue which is a great location that's perfect for parties and events. I held my rehearsal dinner here last April and my guests were very impressed; the views of Tempe are pretty awesome from the patio...I think this place has way more appeal than all the other generic event venues out there that I've seen :-)
