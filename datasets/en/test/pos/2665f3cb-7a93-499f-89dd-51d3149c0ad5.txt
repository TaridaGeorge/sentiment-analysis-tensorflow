I was early for a hair appointment in the same strip mall so I stopped in for a quick order of vegetable fried rice to go.  It was the best I've ever had!! the veggies were generous and delicious- saute'd in a secret sauce perhaps and not over-cooked either, perfectly al dente' pieces of muchroom, squash, broccoli, baby corn & snow peas. I can't wait to go back and have a full meal.
