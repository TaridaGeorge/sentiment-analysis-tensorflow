The space is cozy, the drinks are cheap, and the food is homemade. 

Short Version: Hot Pockets!

Long Version: Hand-crafted dinners of seasoned, good-quality meats and veggies (or vegetarian options) wrapped in a flaky, buttery, baked, melt-in-your-mouth carbo-load of a crust. The menu runs the full spectrum and includes the standard list of limey choices plus salmon, mexican choices, indian, vegetarian, and even a cheeseburger complete with french fries - IN the crust! Food is hot and fast, service is outstanding (anyone can and will help you), and the soups are to DIE for - chunky yet smooth, appropriate levels of salt, and fresh ingredients with flavor that really pops. 
They also have $3 Irish Car Bombs. Boo-YEAH!
