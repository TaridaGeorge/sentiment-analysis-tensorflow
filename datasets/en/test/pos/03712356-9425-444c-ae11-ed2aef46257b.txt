I am going to echo the previous reviewer (Margeret). The staff at this location has been very honest and fair with us. We have taken 3 cars to this location over the last 2 years and have had a similar experience. When my wife dropped her car off, she was treated the same way I was, which sadly isn't always the case at auto-repair shops. 

I have purchased a couple of sets of tires and, to my knowledge, the pricing is middle-of-the-road. I took advantage of their buy 3, get 1 sale, which was a huge help since my tires run upwards $200/each.
