Stumbled upon this 'hip' - as only a 40yr old can say... coffee lab... And was rewarded with the most beautiful tasting vanilla latte I've ever had.... These folks take their coffee seriously... And they don't burn the beans to death like other ppl we all know! 

Thank u for setting up in the southwest gate area! 

Just don't be in a rush... Really Good coffee apparently takes a bit longer! But it's worth it...
