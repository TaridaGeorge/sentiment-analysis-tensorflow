I love Lucky Boy.  I love Lucky Boy.  I love Lucky Boy.

Don't go inside, it's not very flattering.  Drive thru.  If you order a 1/4 lb burger it's one patty.  If you order a 1/2 lb burger it's two patties, a double whammy.  

They have three or four custom choices for the style in which they'll prepare you burger.  Basically it's like a ranch burger, a thousand island burger, a bbq burger or a mustard and ketchup burger.  Choose one.  

Peanut butter-anything shakes are good.  I've had it with Butterfinger and butterscotch and chocolate.  It's all good.  Their fries are good as well.

It's super cheap like $5 for a burger and fries.  Go here.  Call me when you're on your way.
