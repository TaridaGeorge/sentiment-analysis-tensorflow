Casey Moore oh how I love thee.   You helped me through college even more than all my classes and prof's combined.   

You taught me that day drinking was an acceptable practice.   

You taught me on many a nights that drinking and biking don't mix.

You even clean up nice enough that I brought my family and grandma here for dinner once.   

Happy hours with co-workers you're into that too.  First date, yup, you're on it.

Thanks Casey!
