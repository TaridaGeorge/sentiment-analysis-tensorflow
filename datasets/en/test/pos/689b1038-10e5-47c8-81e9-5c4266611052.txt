OK, the food really pretty good.  But the staff are friendly and it is quaint.  It is hard to find good Mexican food anyways.  This is always the go to place for a nice time and some killer albondigas soup.
The good: $1.95 margaritas, tasty and refreshing.  The shots they sometimes bring to your table if you are a regular, like Hawaiian punch with a tequila.  Samantha's Healthy burrito, pretty darn good.  

Fun place to hang out and not expensive.

Always ask for the really hot sauce with the chips.  I love Mi Patio and have been going there since 2000.  Love it.  One of my favorites in town.

Its a keeper.
