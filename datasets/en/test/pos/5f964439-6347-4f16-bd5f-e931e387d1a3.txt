NOT a place to go every day unless you are taking some pretty serious heart/cholesterol medication because they feed your soul and your cardiologist will not approve.  It's a place to go for meat.  If you're a veggie head, go someplace else for a salad, there isn't anything green here that isn't fried.

Hint, go to the bar and have Michael or Michelle take your order, this will save you from carrying the pager and fetching your own food.
