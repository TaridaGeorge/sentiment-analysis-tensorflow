I was referred here after asking for a fun out of the way place. Had a friendly, knowledgeable waiter who made some great recommendations.  Moscow mules and very dirty martinis provided more than enough lubrication for the evening.  He even brought out a shot of a liquor I'd never heard of on the house! We had a burger and chicken sandwich, both of which were very tasty. Fun people watching, cool decor and slightly hidden bathrooms all add up to a quirky but solid evening out. Check this place out for sure!
