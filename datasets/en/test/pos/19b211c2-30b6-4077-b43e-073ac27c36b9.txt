I sit here, bored, reading reviews of places I want to go, and realized that I haven't reviewed Tuck Shop myself.  It's Monday, and the only thing I can think of is having dinner at Tuck Shop again.  But alas, they are closed on Mondays!  Argh!   Regardless, visions of cheese curds dance in my head, and the smell and taste of the fragrant and fresh salads tickle my fancy still.  The service is unparalleled in the central Phoenix area, parking is ample, and OMG, the desserts are to die for.  If you want a treat, you have to dine here.  Take your time and enjoy your servers recommendations and fine wine list.  You shouldn't be disappointed.
