Come hungry! The food is delicious! The atmosphere is cozy but chic. The serve is exceptional. We split the green chile pork stew wrapped in flour tortillas as an appetizer. The meat was so tender it just falls apart in your mouth. The pork is cooked to perfection but I have enjoyed other dishes like this better. I had Bob's Big Burger with shoe string fries for my meal. I could only eat half the burger even though it was absolutely delicious! I left there stuffed and with plenty of left overs to savor for another meal time. I highly recommend going!
