I've had In-N-Out in Vegas and LA and this location does not disappoint. This place is guaranteed to actually get your order right unlike most fast food places in the area... and imagine, YOU CAN ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PERSON WHO WORKS THE DRIVE THROUGH IS SAYING because English is their first language!
