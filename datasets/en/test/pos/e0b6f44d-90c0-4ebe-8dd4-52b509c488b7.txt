Love this place.  Family owned since 1991 it says on the menu, and a nice clean place with some outdoor seating too.  Almost too clean, but I guess it's better to be that way than too dirty.

I had the Texas Omlette with Chili that was a good option.  Add a bit of Tabasco for kick and it's perfect.  Sitting outside under the deck and read the New York Times - was not rushed, but service was also attentive.

Good local joint for breakfast!
