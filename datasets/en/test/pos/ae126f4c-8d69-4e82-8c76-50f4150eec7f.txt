So there are two reasons why I come here.  I come here about once a week to the driving range to hit balls, and LOVE it.  You need to be sure to get the specials that are advertised, otherwise it can be expensive.  There is always a place to play, and I've never had to wait.  Also, my niece was in town and we took her to the go-karts. Super Fun!  They say that you get five minutes, but it was at least ten, and a huge course.  Once again, look on-line, they have coupons.  This is a great place to take kids, or as adults, the driving range is awesome.
