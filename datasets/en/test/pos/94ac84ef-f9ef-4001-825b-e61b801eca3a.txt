DELISH!!   My first time in AZ and our family brought us here for our farewell meal before we headed back to CA.  The food was awesome!  We had the BBQ sampler, brisket, corn, mac&cheese, and some potato thing.  The sides were a big bland, but the BBQ was good as well as their sauce.  I mixed in some onions with my pulled pork, added extra sauce and it was delish!  Great way to end our trip down south!
