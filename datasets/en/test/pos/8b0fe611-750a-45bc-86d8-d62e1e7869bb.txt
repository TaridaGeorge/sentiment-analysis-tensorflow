Ok, I tried to update this again, but I couldn't figure out how to today. So I want to say I went to see Dr Allen today. He really is an awesome and caring doctor. I can deal with the staff there to have him care for my medical needs. I want to change my "star" rating to 5 stars. He's honest. He's empathic. He listens. And he hands you tissue when your crying like a baby over test results. Great bedside manners. I wouldn't see anyone but him for my primary care needs. He's the best.
