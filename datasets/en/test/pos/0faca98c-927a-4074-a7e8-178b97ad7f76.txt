Service Master cleans my floors in my restaurant and I have to tell you that Joe's attention to detail is OUTSTANDING!!!!!! My floors have never looked better. He had allot of work ahead of him when he started a year ago. He always called the next day to make sure the floors were to my expectation. I have to say I never had to call Joe out to do a retouch. I would reccomend Joe. If you want it done right the first time Joe is your man!!!! Thanks Joe for making my floors look wonderful!!!!
