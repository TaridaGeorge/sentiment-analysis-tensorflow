This is a great place to meet someone for work or just to hang out in on weekends.  It's a little bit loud, but I actually think the coffees are quite good.  They make great Christmas coffees.  

I've never had a problem finding a seat either.  Tip, if you go during the week during mid-morning and mid-afternoon, you won't have any noise problems.  Now that the kids are back in school, it's awesome!

If it's too loud inside, and not too hot outside, you can grab a seat on the patio.  And you can't beat the free Wi-Fi.  This saved my butt during one recent meeting.

I have noticed on the weekend that the patio turns into a see and be seen scene, but what part of Scottsdale (Phoenix really in this case) isn't?
