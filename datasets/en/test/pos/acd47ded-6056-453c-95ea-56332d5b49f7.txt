Holy Thai Food!!!  This place was amazing.  Quick turn around after we called in our to-go order was topped by the delicious food.  We ordered the Eggplant Garlic with tofu (no meat) and the Red Curry with chicken!  Both were amazing and so different in flavors.  My meal (the Eggplant Garlic) had gigantic, luscious pieces of  Japanese Eggplant.  I will be going back for sure.  Next time it will be the Red Curry (hot) with Tofu.  Can't wait!!
