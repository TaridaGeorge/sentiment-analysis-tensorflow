Happy hour at Cheesecake is the best!  (So that is purely what my review is based on!)  Super friendly servers, great drinks and excellent food!  Compared to the normal prices (which are pricey) happy hour is a great time to come in and get all the best appetizers for excellent deals!  Go and enjoy!
