NOTE: this is also listed in yelp as "Rancho Grande Motel" Very biker friendly, they even gave us a "biker bag" that consisted of  towels to wipe down the bike & candy. Great place to stay while in Wickenburg!  Great location, within walking distance to shops, restaurants & taverns.  We stayed here on a Saturday night.  Front desk staff (Pat & Bruce) were both very friendly and accommodating.  Our room was extremely clean, bed was comfortable.  Will stay here again.
