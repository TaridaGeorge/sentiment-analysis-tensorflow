I knew something was wrong with our dog when he quit eating and then vomitted a few times.  I called Dr. Pruden who was doing surgery all afternoon, but she told me to being Rocky in and she would look at him.  Thank goodness I did because he had eaten a leather wallet and could have died.  Dr. Pruden operated immediately and she and her staff staying beyond closing time to male sure Rocky was stable enough to transfer to an overnight hospital.  Dr Pruden is the BEST vet we have ever had.  She genuinely cares about her patients, spends as much time as needed explaining things to the owners and always makes time to see Rocky was I call.  I would highly recommend Hopi to anyone looking for an excellent vet!!!!
