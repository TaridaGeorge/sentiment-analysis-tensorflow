Home of my insatiable craving: #4 red chili beef w/an extra tortilla.  Do not ask me about the rest of the food, I haven't tried any of it.  Every time that I come here, it's the same thing.  

I don't care that it's dirty, the line is often outrageous, the employees are dumb...blah blah. They could call me fat, tell me I'm ugly, and call me a douche for wearing white shoes, I do not care - give me the #4, extra tortilla.  Muchas gracias.
