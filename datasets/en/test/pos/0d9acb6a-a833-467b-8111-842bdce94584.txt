The most friendly Chinese restaurant I have ever eaten at! They are a very nice family that will customize your meal they way You want it to be. My husband wanted to try them out right after they opened. We were so pleased with the food that we have to go back almost every week since than. Two weeks ago I decided to try their Sushi and was very impressed. You will not be disappointed.
