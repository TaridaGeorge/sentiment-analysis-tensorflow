Despite trying to find the place and the neighborhood this place is awesome... there menu is not big, however they have great salads, sandwiches and desserts.  The thing I noticed the most about it was how fresh everything was... I had there special that had ham, fresh mozzarella and arugula... it was EXCELLENT!!!

While it was not the quickest lunch place in the area I loved the food... it is also a cool place to look around.  In the back they have a book store and if you walk through the book store you will find a pretty cool art gallery...

I hope that you get out and try this place...
