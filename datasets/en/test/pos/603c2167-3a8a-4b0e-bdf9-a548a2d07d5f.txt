Much more organized than the last time I was there, and I noticed more price systems vs having to ask. The even had the new Color Club halo hues I have been hunting for!!! They had 5 of the 6 colors and they were the highest priced polished in the store at 6.50 a pop!! Still MUCH cheaper that the 11$ everywhere else. No striping tape!!! Although the owner did say he had ordered it before and it didn't sell well...... I just went down the street and got some...:)) yay candy cane nails!!!
