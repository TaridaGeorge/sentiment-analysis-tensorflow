Ippei is the best Sushi place I have found in Arizona.  The cucumber mint martini has me coming back, time and time again!  The sashimi is outstanding and the sushi chefs have some very creative rolls which I have never tried (Blackjack & Southwest roll).  The dinner menu is much more extensive, and I suggest first-time dinners to come by for dinner. The owner, Michael, is very nice.  When he recognizes you as a regular you will typically end up with something special from the kitchen (his treat).  It is important to mention that Ippei offers an extensive non-fish menu too, which allows you to bring sushi lovers and non-sushi eaters alike to this great establishment.  Do not miss the pot-stickers.  A note on decor: Ippei has a very welcoming modern interior making it an excellent environment to unwind or bring a client.
