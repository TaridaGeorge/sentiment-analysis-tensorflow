I've been going to Fantastic Sams for 5 years now--every 4-6 weeks so that's a LOT of hair cuts. In all those years I've only had 2 bad haircuts.

I've had most of the stylists there, but my favorite may be Kinsey. She is one of the managers and very meticulous!

I speak for a living so a great haircut (at a fair price) is very important to me. I highly recommend Fantastic Sams. Just be sure you get someone experienced like Kinsey or Shea (the other reviewer recommended her as well. I've had Shea cut my hair and she did a great job).
