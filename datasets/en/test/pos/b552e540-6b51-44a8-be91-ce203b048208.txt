The raw, organic milk you get here is as fresh as it gets. There're times when the milk I picked up was still warm. Other times, they're still labeling the bottles. Because the milk is unpasteurized, it needs to be refrigerated at 42 degree F, and lasts only 2 weeks. I don't have a problem w/ that as my boys chugs down a gallon of this stuff in 4 days! Thankfully I live close to SYD, so I'm always getting it fresh.
