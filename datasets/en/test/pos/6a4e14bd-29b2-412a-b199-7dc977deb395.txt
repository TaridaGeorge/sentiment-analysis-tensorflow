There is a reason YCs is better than a place like Genghis Grill. The reason isnt the meat or the vegetables. Its the fact that you can take it to go. And some say oh you only get to go up once. But that only makes it better, half of the fun is making your plate as big and high as possible. And lets be honest going up many times you are still not getting as much as you do when you get to take it to go. Its smart marketing by Genghis Grill but you really arent getting the same amount as you would at YCs. YCs does taste great and It is the only place that I consistently go on a weekly basis. Even if it is a little expensive it is totally worth it.
