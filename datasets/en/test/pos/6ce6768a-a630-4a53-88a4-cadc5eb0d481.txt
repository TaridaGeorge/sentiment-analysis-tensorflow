Easy access to the Scottsdale Green Belt is one of the reasons we purchased our home in Gainey Ranch. This is by far the most beautiful and peaceful places to walk or bike in the Phoenix area. You pass beautiful homes, golf courses, parks, mountain views and a few restaurants that you can stop in at for a quick bite to eat. I feel completely safe on it. Beautiful sunrise and sunset views.
