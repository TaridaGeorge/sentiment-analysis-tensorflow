The best brick-oven pizza I have ever eaten in my life.  The antipasto was out of this world as well.

The downside is the long wait but it's really not that bad considering you can go next door to the bar, get some wine and appetizers, and picnic on the lawn or sit on the benches.  The staff is incredibly friendly and professional.  The whole experience is just really marvelous.

The crust is so ridiculously thin.  All of the ingredients are super fresh.  The sauce is ideal.  The place is charming, almost romantic.  

If I lived in the Phoenix area, I'd be a regular.  The wait is well worth the experience, ESPECIALLY if you're a "foodie."
