There is no other reason I go to Black Bear Diner than the chicken fried steak.  Each time we are near this diner, but thankfully not too often, this is the one and only thing that pops off the page.  It is so good.  The larger serving is enough for two, easily.  Pounded, hand breaded with a cracker crust, then fried to a wonderful crispy crunch.  And a great cream gravy. The fixins are great too.  Biscuits are light and short.  Service is always good, the atmosphere is pleasant.

It is nice to know that there are a string of BBDs up the Central Valley of California.  We frequent that route and always need a meal stop.  This is always a great breakfast while on  "vacation" for us.
