BEST PIZZA IN PHOENIX!  I've searched this town far and wide and Grimaldis is the best around.  Original New York pie.  Fresh mozzarella, coal fired crust, and a delicious, sweet sauce.  My family is from the East Coast and this is the place I take them when they are in town.  It won't disappoint.  I also checked out the Pizzeria Bianco.  Don't get me wrong, it's a great pie, but it doesn't stand up to Grimaldis.  Oprah, stick your book list.
