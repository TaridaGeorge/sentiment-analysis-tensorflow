We stopped in Le Chalet for dessert because my friend wanted to check it out. I am SO happy we did! I'd very highly recommend Le Chalet to anyone who wants delicious food, excellent service and a unique atmosphere. 

When you go, sit at the crepe bar. We did and quite enjoyed learning all about the dishes from two of the chefs, Kyle and Emily. They were quite welcoming as was our server. 

Their homemade caramel is to die for! I'm excited to go back for dinner very soon. Le Chalet is one of those restaurants that's worth telling the whole world about, or at least the whole Valley!
