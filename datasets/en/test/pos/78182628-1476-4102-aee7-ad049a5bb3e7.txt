My favorite restaurant for a perfect steak..
this is where I come for my birthday and for any time I feel like some comfort food..
From the moment you walk in, you have a feeling that all is well and that life is good.. 

try the kona crusted steak with the lobster mac n cheese and layonaise potatoes on the side!!!

heaven!!!!
