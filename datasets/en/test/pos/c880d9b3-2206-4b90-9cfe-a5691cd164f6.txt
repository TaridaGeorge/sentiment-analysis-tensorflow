I've been here twice with my girlfriends and every time I've ordered the same thing...b/c it's delicious!  The crab dip is cheesy and delicious on top of their citrus tortilla chips and the Farm Salad is worth every penny (especially with the chicken).  

I am excited to bring the rest of my family to this cute little place...my favorite little place...on the corner!
