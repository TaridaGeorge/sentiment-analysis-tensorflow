Let me start by saying that I am partial to staying in CenPho for food. This place is right up the street from me so that I love. 

Its got an amazing hipster ambiance. And little touches of pizazz like the cassette tape wall and the boom box wall paper in the bathroom. 


The patio is comfy at night or in the cooler months, and probably better for a larger group.  

Yes, yes, I'm getting to the food. I have been here with friends, with a dude, with my kid, by myself, cuz that is how I roll, and I have tried a lot of the menu. Burger=BOMB. pork was amazing, mac n cheese to die for, dang! I can't remember what else I've eaten here but I have yet to have a bad experience. Let me know what you think when you go!
