This place was a great find for breakfast! The food was so delicious.  I had a southwest burrito and my boyfriend had the Santa Fe Eggs Benedict, we shared a brizza (breakfast pizza) - The Toluca.  Everything, including the coffee, was fantastic.  The staff was super friendly.  The restaurant is cool, clean, and roomy.  The egg-inspired artwork was super cute! I was in Phoenix for a business trip and this was a recommendation by the hotel staff - 100% spot on! I can't wait to get back to Phoenix.
