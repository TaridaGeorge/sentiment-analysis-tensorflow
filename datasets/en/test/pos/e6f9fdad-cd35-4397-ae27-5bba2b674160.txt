Love love love this grocery -- only wish it was closer to my home.

They have ridiculously fresh produce for an incredibly cheap price (better than Safeway or Frys), and their employees are always so friendly and full of info about anything you might need.

Are their organic/all natural products a bit high priced? Some of them, yes, but their tofu, soy milk, etc, is on par with any traditional store. I also appreciate them being willing to order things in if they don't have it.

I love their potted herbs, their fresh bread, their bulk section (including delicious granola), their fresh coffee...I mean, what's not to love about your friendly neighborhood Sunflower?
