WOW, I am in love with this place! I have had some very expensive dry cleaning bills, so I was very pleased when my total bill was $16.75 for 7 pieces of clothing! 

I took 4 dresses (3 silk, 1 cashmere), 1 pair of linen pants, 1 blazer, and 1 silk blouse to be dry cleaned on a Wednesday afternoon. I would expect to pay upwards of $50 for all 7 pieces at another dry cleaners, but not at Seville! The garments were ready for me on Friday, and they looked amazing! I believe they are able to get your clothes ready by 4pm if you drop them off by 8 or 9am that day.

Not only were the prices amazing, but the service was also great - very friendly and fast. I will definitely be switching to Seville for all my dry cleaning needs!
