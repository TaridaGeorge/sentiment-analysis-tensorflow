I love this place!!! I lived in miami for five years and ate at every authentic cuban restaurant in town, so trust me when I tell you that Sabor Cubano is authentic home cooking.  The lady who owns the place is the chef and she makes the food with a lot of care and love... Great service and a fun, relaxed atmosphere make this my go to place for tasty cuban food.
