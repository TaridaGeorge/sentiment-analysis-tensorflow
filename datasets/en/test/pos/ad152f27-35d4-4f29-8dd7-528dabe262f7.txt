Ate lunch here today.  I love Indian food, but i'm GF so it's sometimes hard, though much indian food is gf you have to watch the sauces... They say theirs are gf! and their menu is certainly GFriendly.  Also the first time i saw an option for white vs. brown rice, this too is nice.  Food was good.  Definately would come back and recommend.
