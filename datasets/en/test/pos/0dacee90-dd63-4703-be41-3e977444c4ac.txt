i'm more of a motel 6/super 8 kind of guy. a place to sleep and shower. plus, when we had a dog, those were 2 of the only reasonable chains to accept dogs. 
since the dog is no longer with us, i "splurged" for an evening after taking the wife to tanger outlets. 
it's only a short walk from the outlet mall and situated right off the freeway. that being said, it was so quiet. peacefully quiet. the bed was soft and comfy. the bathroom had a giant shower, plenty of shower, and blissful hot water, as well as nice soaps and shampoos. 
the free breakfast was well-rounded. waffles, omelettes, hard boiled eggs, bagesl, muffins, fresh fruit, oatmeal, and good coffee. excellent free breakfast. 
a very nice hotel, within walking distance to the arena, shops, and restaurants of the area.
