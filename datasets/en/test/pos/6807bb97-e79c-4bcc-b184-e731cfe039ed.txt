This was the best feast i have ever had for $4.99 Rand H. and I got there at 10:40am and they were still serving breakfast so we went in anyway. Well the breakfast was great 4 different sausages ,scrambled eggs ,bacon,shit on a shingle,omelets made to order, ham;pancakes,waffles,3 different types of hashbrowns,3 kinds of juice,corned beef hash and the list goes on. At 11:00am they brought out all the lunch stuff which was all the typical golden corral fare. The grill was cooking ribs and they were really good.We both agreed the lunch was 5 stars and well worth the drive to Casa Grande so if your real hungry and don`t mined a drive to Casa Grande then you will love this place.
