Seriously simple and good.  We went on a saturday for some straightforward diner breakfast.  What we got was exactly that and good service: a bunch of hard-working ladies.  The pancakes were fabulous (tall stack) plus a side of eggs over easy.  Just go, it's simple and don't expect more than what it is . .. a dine opened 7-3.
