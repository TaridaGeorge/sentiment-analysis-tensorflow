I think IKEA is the coolest store in the world. They've pretty much conquered the globe and managed to bring much-needed style to the far reaches of the planet. Almost everyone can find something that fits their interior design objectives. Selection is incredible, staff is usually always helpful, and their Swedish restaurant and grocery store make the trip all the way out to the middle-of-nowhere worth it.
