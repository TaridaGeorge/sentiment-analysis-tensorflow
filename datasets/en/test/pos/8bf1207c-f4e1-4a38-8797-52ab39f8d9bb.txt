Wow, we sat in the patio outside for lunch and it was gorgeous. The fresh bread and butter was an excellent start, the chicken-cilentro and boston cowder soups are great. And where do you buy those small All-clad pots that they serve the soups in??? 

The sliders and Kobe brugers hit the spot..

Next time your in Scottsdale, you must stop by Fashion Square mall and check this place out..  I will definately check out the other Fox locations next time..
