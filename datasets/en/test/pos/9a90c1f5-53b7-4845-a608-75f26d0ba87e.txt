For $10 you really get a lot of food and the staff is usually very pleasant.  I've been here numerous times and the food is always fresh and tastes great!  There are so many options here.  You can add as much meat and vegetables to your bowl as you want along with pastas and sauce.  I change it up almost every time I come here.
