This is a franchised location not far from my house...the food is great and reasonably healthy and they don't charge extra for extra sauce at this location...the only other location I've been to does charge extra.  Kudos in my book for a place that doesn't charge extra for a sauce they are known for!!  I just wish they were open longer hours on weekends but I'm sure their weekend hours are due to the fact that they are located in a commercial area.
