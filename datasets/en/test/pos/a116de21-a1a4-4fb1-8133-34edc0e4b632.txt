Discount tire is My favorite place to get my car serviced.  The people are ALWAYS nice and down to earth. They aren't pushy and don't try to up sell tires when you don't need them... They give free air checks and rotate your tires for free if you bought them there. I'm a loyal customer, keep up the good work Discount!
