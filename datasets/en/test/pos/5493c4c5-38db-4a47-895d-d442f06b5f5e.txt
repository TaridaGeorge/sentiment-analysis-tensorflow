Was invited to have dinner with some friends.  Located at the Sanctuary Resort, this elegant restaurant provided an awesome dining experience!  The decor is very modern and the service was excellent!  Now, on to the food....

I ordered:

Local Organic Greens (Chinese Long Beans, Toasted Nori, Soy Sesame Vinaigrette, $10)
Pan Roasted Free Range Chicken (Garlic Mashed Potatoes, Chinese Broccoli, Lemongrass Pan Jus, $28)
Glass of Orin Swift "Prisoner" Red Blend Zinfandel (Napa, $17)

The Organic Greens were very tasty.  The Soy Sesame Vinaigrette was tangy and went very well with the Greens.  The Chicken was amazing, so tasty and juicy!

Overall, it was a great night.....good food and good times!
