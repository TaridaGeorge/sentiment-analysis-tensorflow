Great sandwiches-staff remembers your name-fast service-cozy little place should you want to stay and eat.  I saw one of my co-workers eating this huge sandwich in our lunch room...FINALLY a place where you don't have to order double meat just to be able to 'see' what meat you DID order!  Will go back again.  Right down the street from US Airways
