Just had dinner at this Outback Steakhouse, what a great place, I love their food, and the service is just great.  This is a wonderful restaurant,  Last year, we went to the OBS in Surprise, AZ, and what a disappointment, the owner was very rude, and the service, just okay, so, I really didn't want to try another OBS, in AZ, but, what a surprise, the food was wonderful and the service was great.  Our waiter, Aaron, was incredible and so personable.  Penny, the Mgr. on Duty, so, lovely.  We will go back, what a wonderful way to celebrate New Years Day.  When in AZ, you should all go.
