I LOVE this resort!  I have stayed there many times and never been disappointed. Truly a paradise in Paradise Valley...beautiful rooms, friendly staff, fun bar (and funny bartenders) yummy cocktails and food, not to mention the amazing views.  Can't wait to stay there again.    
Oh...and the Spa Suites have outdoor soaking tubs, perfect way to end the day.
