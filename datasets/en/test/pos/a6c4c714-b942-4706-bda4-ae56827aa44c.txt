I NEVER give anything the full set of stars: Cartel is the art of coffee, exceptional coffee knowledge (and so good, nonetheless), generous service in the absence of attitude, quaint location, surprisingly delicious light breakfast.  We are in Sedona and unhappy with our options.  We want to beam ourselves back to Cartel.
