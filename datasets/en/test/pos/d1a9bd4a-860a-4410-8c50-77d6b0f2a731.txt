Love Dutch Bros.  They don't serve drip coffee, just the espresso based concoctions.  I love Americanos, for one, so this serves me perfectly.

Their staff could be a little less friendly and energetic (no -- I don't want to have a cheery-peppy conversation right now, thanks), that would be my only complaint.  But, considering they're probably snorting coffee grounds, shooting-up espresso between their toes, and having coffee orgies when nobody is around, I figure I can let this small detraction slide.
