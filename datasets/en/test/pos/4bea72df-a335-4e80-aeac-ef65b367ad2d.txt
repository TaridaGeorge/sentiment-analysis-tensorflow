I signed up for the 2-week unlimited trial and have been going to different classes just trying to figure out what teacher and class best fits my needs. So far I love them all and every single one of the teachers is amazing! The studio of cozy and the staff is very friendly and definitly not salesy like some other studios in the valley.
