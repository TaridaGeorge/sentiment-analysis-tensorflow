It takes alot for me to frequent a restaurant numerous times, I believe that there are great places all over the city so why not take the time to try out new places. But LoLo's seems to be my cyptonite. It's an interesting blend of tastes, fried chicken and waffles on the same plate at the same time? 

However, do your taste buds a solid and check this place out.  The fried chicken is great, and the waffles are amazing. Red beans and rice, grits, and red velvet cake are great too. Still not satisfied...LoLo's has red kool-aid, not the kind mom made, but the kind you always wanted to make as a kid, remember, half sugar half water and a packet of kool-aid, served in a mason jar. How can you go wrong. Ch..Ch..Ch..Check it Out.
