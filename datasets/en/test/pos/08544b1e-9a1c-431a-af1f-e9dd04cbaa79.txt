I absolutely love Pizzeria Bianco!  The menu is limited, but it works for me!  For appetizers we get the Spiedini, for salad their caprese salad, and Wiseguy pizza!  Its all so savory, delicious, overall the best pizza around.  Wait time can be lengthy, so good to show up as early as possible, wait at Bar Bianco, where they have amazing wines and snacks, enjoy the bar that is a renovated historic home, its a great experience!
