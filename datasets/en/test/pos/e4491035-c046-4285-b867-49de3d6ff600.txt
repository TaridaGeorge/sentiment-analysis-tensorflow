We found ourselves stranded in Phoenix on our way to Dallas for Christmas, and instead of waiting 4 hours on hold, I dialed up Marriott, my favorite hotel chain (well, other than the Four Seasons, but let's be reasonable).  Phil was super friendly, gave me a great rate, even got the shuttle driver to head our way immediately.  He was kind and upgraded us, even though we were only there for a few hours to sleep.  

The hotel was clean and comfortable, and it was just what we weary travelers needed.  Marriott never disappoints me!
