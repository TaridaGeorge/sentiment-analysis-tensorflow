MMMMMMMMMMDilly's!    I meet my son and his work crew here every Thursday for lunch. What a treat!  Chris goes for the enchilada soup, that's their soup of the day. The way it's served is awesome, in a huge bread bowl. What's not to love? I crave the 'Gobbler' sandwich, sliced turkey,with cranberry sauce, cream cheese and other goodies. MMMMMM, you also get a choice of side with it , and they are all good. Price is right for what you get, huge portions of fresh baked bread and fresh ingredients. Always a delicious meal!
