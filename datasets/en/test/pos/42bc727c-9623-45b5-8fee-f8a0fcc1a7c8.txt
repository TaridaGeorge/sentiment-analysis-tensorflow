I love this place. They will substitute grilled tofu for any fish plate and unlike most places they do a great job of it. When I was disappointed at the menu at Los Dos Molinos, I left the group there and went here by myself to make sure I got a good dinner. It is my fav place to eat so far in Phoenix.
