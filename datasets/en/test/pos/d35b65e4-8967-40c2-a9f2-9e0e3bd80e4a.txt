Since my previous review I have been to Short Leash several times and each time it is just wonderful! I recommend trying their specials from week to week...they are often way better than their standard menu items. The food here is great, but the more impressive thing is the service! The owners of the truck are friendly and genuine people. Who wouldn't like this place??!!?! well...obviously no one, look at the reviews.
