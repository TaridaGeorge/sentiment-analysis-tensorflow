This is what my mom said when we brought her here, "I have to be honest, when we pulled up I thought 'W-T-F,' but now I'm mad you've never brought me here before!"

My favorite things are the Date Shakes and the seared ahi tuna sandwich. Everything here is so fresh- the produce, the atmosphere, the decor. I love that they use produce from their backyard! There are always rotating specials too.

This is something else I appreciate about the staff- they always offer HELPFUL advice. I feel like they're honest and sincere with their suggestions and have not steered me wrong yet!
