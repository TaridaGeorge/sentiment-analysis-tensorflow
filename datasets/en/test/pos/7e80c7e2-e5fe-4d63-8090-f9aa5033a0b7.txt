I was here one time, for about a half hour before it closed, and in that thirty minutes I deemed it the best bar in Tempe.  I consulted with friends from that area since then, and I have heard that I am correct.  One of my friends said that Casey Moore's was the only cool thing about Tempe.  I'm happy to be going back to AZ to experience this awesome bar again.  It doesn't even scare me that I'm going alone, as I feel like I will make friends right after I walk in.
