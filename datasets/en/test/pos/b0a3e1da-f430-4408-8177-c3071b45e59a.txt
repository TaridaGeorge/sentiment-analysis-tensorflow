Here is some of the best pizza in the Valley.  It is done in a traditional Brooklyn thin crust with mixed cheese and some fine tomato sauce.  The pizza was ready within ten minutes and we ate in about twenty minutes.

The place is located on Indian School Road around 8th Street.

It is intimate and the decor is NYC related with a television in back.  No soda on tap, only cans.

The specials are reasonable in price.

The quality shows.
