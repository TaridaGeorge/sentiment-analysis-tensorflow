This place is great!  The dentist has an awesome 'bed side' manor and I just love the staff. Friendly and fun makes visiting the dentist a LOT easier. I have had some really bad experiences with previous dentists so I really appreciate when I find one that doesn't hurt me or push me through like a number. Finally found an office I can stay with!
