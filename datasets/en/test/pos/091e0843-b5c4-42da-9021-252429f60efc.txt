This place is awesome. Cheap and just as good as yogurtland! I had some french vanilla, cookies and cream, and chocolate yogurt and they were all tasty. They have a massive selection of toppings including candy, fruit, and cereal. Inside its relaxing and modern. 

I had a big cup of froyo with yummy toppings for just over 3 bucks. The only thing I thought was a bit odd was that they use LCD digital picture frames with memory cards as the labels for the different flavors. Not sure how well they will hold up in the long term but a interesting idea. 

Service was friendly and it was very clean. Overall : Awesome
