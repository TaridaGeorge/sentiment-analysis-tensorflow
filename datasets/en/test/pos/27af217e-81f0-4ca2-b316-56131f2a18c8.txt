I really enjoyed this restaurant while on vacation this Summer!  My family had its reunion in Phoenix and this was the location of our banquet.  We had a private banquet area outside where we were able to have a fashion show, dancing etc.  Now to the meal, we had a whole half of a chicken, a whole steak, corn on the cobb, baked beans, bread and cake! And it was all delicious.  It's a shame the amount of food that was probably wasted because people were getting steak and chicken just because they could.  If I'm ever in Arizona again I will definitely be back.  There was also a live bull outside!
