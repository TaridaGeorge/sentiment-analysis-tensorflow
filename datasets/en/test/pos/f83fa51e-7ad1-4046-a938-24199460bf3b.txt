This Museum is AMAZING! I have never seen anything like it before. 

I love the mock grocery store and pizzeria. It seemed to be my kids favorite too. We had such a great time that both kids (18 months and 4 years) had a sensory overload. 

Everything is adult friendly too, so parents can have a lot of fun pretending with their kids. What an amazing time! 

I wish that the prices were a bit cheaper, but understand due to the complexity of all the exhibit as well as the maintenance it must take to keep everything in working order. I would love to see a membership program with more reasonable rates.
