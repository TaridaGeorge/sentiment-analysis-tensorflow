Its one of the first places started going to when I came to Phoenix five years ago and Ive never had a bad meal. Sometimes the servers get busy, sometimes its loud but overall its awesome. Noticed a couple of wanna be clown restaurant critics gave weak reviews based on their warped version of a Thai Restaurant. If they wanted 100% Thai then write one from Thailand where you can get it off the street or down to Thai Hut on McDowell which are both awesome. I like fusion and hot. Half these people would be calling an ambulance after dinner if they new authentic Thai. 

If you want a great fusion of what works in Scottsdale and sometimes requires reservation because it works so well then head on over to Malee's. 

Ginger Broccoli, Cashew Chicken..its all good. 

I love this place and it gets five stars.
