great food... HUGE wine list (same as Kashmere)...  whatever you do make sure to get there cob salad thing (stedson chopped salad)... I substituted the salmon for chicken, but it is still out of this world... i know people that have brought in chefs from out-of-town to figure out what is in it so they can bring it home to their city... don't remember much else... but i remember i have never had anything bad since i have been going there.
