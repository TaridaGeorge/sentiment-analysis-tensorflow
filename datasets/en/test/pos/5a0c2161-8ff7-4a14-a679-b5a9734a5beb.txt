I used Pro Check when I moved to Scottsdale. I used a Realtor to rent out a house and since I was unsure of what I was getting into, the landlord allowed me get the home inspected to make sure there were no issues. 

The person who lived in the home before me died many years ago, and the house was vacant...I wanted to make sure nothing weird was going on.

They showed up on time, were pretty thorough, and were pretty friendly. It's not as as exciting as some of my other reviews, but then again, getting your house inspected isn't as exciting as grabbing a bite to eat, now is it?
