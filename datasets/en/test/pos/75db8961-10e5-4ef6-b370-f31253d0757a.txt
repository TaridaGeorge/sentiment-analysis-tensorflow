We schedule happy hours for our high school classes here and we are always so well taken care of.  We reserve the upstairs area and there is plenty of room for everyone to be comfortable, eat, play pool or darts, or just hang out.  The waitresses are always great and the food is good too.  It's a great place to have any kind of get together for a large party or just to hang out with friends.
