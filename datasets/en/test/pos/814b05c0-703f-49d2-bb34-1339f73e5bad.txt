This is definitely my favorite of any Chinese Buffet I have been to in the East Valley.  People seem to have a hard time giving a buffet 5 stars but shouldn't one consider that it is simply a 5 star version of...a buffet. 

The service is fast and friendly.  The food looks good and tastes fresh.  I don't even feel leery about eating the sushi, of which they have a few different types of rolls and sashimi and nirigi available (mostly variations of tuna, salmon, and eel).

The bill for a Saturday dinner came to $15 each(with beverage) though I did notice this last trip that the drink was tacked on for around $2.  I am not sure if the separate charge is new but I thought it was worth mentioning.
