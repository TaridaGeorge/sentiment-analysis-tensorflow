Wow, I love this place. Being an architectural fanatic, I'm in loveee with the building. So much. It's an oasis in the lifeless desert that is North Scottsdale. The resources here are phenomenal, and finding a table to sit down and do some homework is NEVER a problem. Seriously! Props to SPL for building yet another fabulous library. This place has so much to offer. Check it out if you're ever in the area.
