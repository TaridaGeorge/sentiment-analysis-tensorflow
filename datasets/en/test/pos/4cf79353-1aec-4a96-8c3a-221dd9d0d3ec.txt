I just tried Liberty Market for breakfast. I had the Sicilian scramble with a biscuit, potatoes, and a latte. Everything was outstanding. The latte was flavorful with a good roast, not the charcoal used in espresso drinks at some famous coffee shops. The scramble was savory, delicious, and had some great sausage in it. The surprise star, though, was the humble biscuit. I'm very harsh on biscuits. They're always too dry, too tough, not crusty enough, or otherwise compromised in some way. This one was absolutely perfect and probably the best I've ever had.

I recently moved to Gilbert, and Liberty Market is fast becoming my favorite place to eat out.
