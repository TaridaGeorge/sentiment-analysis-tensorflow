Sean S's review pretty much covered it all, but I had to reaffirm the goodness of this food truck.  I had the spicy one with the green chile, and it was very tasty.  Though I'd only give my dog about a 4 out of 5, there were so many different permutations that I could have chosen; there are potentially limitless 5-star combinations possible.  

Oh, did I mention that the service was great?  Really nice people and they really aimed to please.  Just ask and they'll walk you through all the dogs and help come up something extra special just for you.  

All in all, I really liked eating here.
