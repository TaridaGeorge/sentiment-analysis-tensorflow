Went w/ the hubby today & we both LOVED what we ordered. If you're Vietnamese, you'll like this place for serving authentic Vietnamese food w/o watering down anything. He ordered the bun bo hue & I had the bo kho. Both dishes rocked!!! Friendly staff, clean, good prices. We'll definitely be back for more!
