Delicious food (The Chet! The Game On! The Chocolate Chip Cookies!), an outstanding beer selection, and a very friendly staff.  Unlike some of the other Yelpers, I found the beer selection process intuitive and the staff knowledgeable.  I'd recommend the tasting flight so you can sample 6 beers - for $9 a great deal.  

The only thing I would change would be some sort of noise insulation as when it is busy, it can get really loud.  But an excellent place over all. 

Go for weekend brunch!
