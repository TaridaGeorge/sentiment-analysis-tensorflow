I am surprised at the 3 star reviews. I have always had great food and great service here. I love the pot roast, it is served topped with fried onions YUM! I think the prices fall in line with the quality and the portions. I'm not sure where the Luby comment came from unless he is 18 or even younger. The crowd whenever I have eaten there has been a wide variety but usually a high concentration in the 26 or so to 40 range. This little gem doesn't disappoint. Good eats and good prices.
