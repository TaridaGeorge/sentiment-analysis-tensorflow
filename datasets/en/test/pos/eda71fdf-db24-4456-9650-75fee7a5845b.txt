Talk about comfort food! Its not the kind you get at home, but definitely makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside. I had the pork cordon bleu schnitzel with dill mashed potatoes, tomato basil salad, sauerkraut and spinach salad. The pork was thin with a delicate, slightly golden, crispy batter. Once you cut into it, there is just a slight ooze of cheese, not too much, but just enough. You can't go wrong with mash potatoes, but these were uber good with the dill. All of the salads were just "okay" to me and they balance out the creamy pork and potatoes. I still give it a 5 because the specialty is the main dish.
