Sunland Auto is without a doubt the best automotive service center I have ever dealt with.
Bob and Scott have consistently provided me with the honest evaluations that I sought when requesting service on my cars. If something was uncovered when they started the service that they did not expect, they call and ask for permission to proceed.
It is a pleasure doing business with them.
No nickel and dime operation - very professional and honest
