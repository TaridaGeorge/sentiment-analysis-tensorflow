Jodi is amaze-balls!  

Such a hard worker, and totally fun to work with.  She worked within by budget and didn't try to pull anything shady cost wise.  (I had been burned at a previous consultation with another florist when I told the girl my vision and budget and she sent me a quote for double what I could afford... ugh.)  But not Jodi.  She does gorgeous work and is extremely talented.  Search no further brides, Jodi is your gal!
