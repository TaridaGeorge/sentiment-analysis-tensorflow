Hidden Jem just off the old Scottsdale "strip"...  

Great food, fast service with a smile and pretty nice atmosphere too.

My first bite of yellow chicken curry with noodles 'HOT' made me smile.   I said right away to my friends with me..."It is hard to get spicy food right, they did it.  It is the spicy that tastes good, not that just burns your mouth."  

I love these smaller restaurants that really make you feel special and welcome as soon as you come in.  They take pride in their food and it shows.  I feel like they actually enjoyed their work and took pride in it. 

Great place I strongly recommend
