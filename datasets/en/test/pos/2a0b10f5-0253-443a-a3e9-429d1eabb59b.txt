Great food and BEST service in the business!   Plus everyone has a different experience at the same restaurant each day.  So reviews are actually pointless.  Go find out for yourself.  But dont write something bad about a restaurant because maybe the server is having a bad day.... do you not have bad days at your jobs.?.... and im sure old employees of businesses write bad things about the business on here as well... just something to think about.
