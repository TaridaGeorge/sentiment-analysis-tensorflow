Oh yes yelpers, it's time for a Mabel's update from yours truly. The menu has been re-vamped with some new items! I had the cheese plate and the olives with a good friend this past saturday night and it was delish! There was a white cheddar, creamy may tag blue and gruyere, accompanied by proscuitto and salami. You definitely want to give that a whirl. I'm heading back on thursday to try out the Mac and Cheese they added to the menu, see you there!
