Had an emergency clogged kitchen drain that required a power auger. Called Rooter hero at 11:00 PM the night before Thanksgiving. I was told I would I receive a call from the dispatcher before 7:30 AM on Thanksgiving Day and a technician would be out by 9:00 AM. Being a holiday I was a little sceptical. I was very pleasantly suprised when the phone rang right at 7:30 AM and was told a technician would be out between 8:00 AM  8:30 AM.  The techincian arrive around 8:15 AM, his name is Ryan Lewis. Ryan was a master at determing the problem and how to fix it. He was very professional, cleaned up afetr himself and without asking put the show covers on his shoes. I would highly recommend Rooter Hero and be sure to ask for Ryan Lewis!!!! He dersves a 5 star rating hinself.
