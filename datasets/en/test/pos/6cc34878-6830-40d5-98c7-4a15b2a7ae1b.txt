Grimaldi's Grimaldi's.. You have changed the way I view pizzerias forever! 

I walk into this location for the first time, I can honestly say it's a mixture of ambiance between The Olive Garden and a typical pizzeria. The moment I walked in I was greeted and seated. The service may be described as polite and respectable. 

The food items ordered were a small pizza and a Mediterranean salad. The pizza had a THIN crust with mostly ingredients being the key volume piece in the pizza. The salad was delicious, fresh and filling. 

Thank you Grimaldi's for making pizza an eatable food once again without the fear of endless bread enhancers! I no longer feel guilty for eating pizza and PREFER Grimaldi's thin crust over any other pizzeria's pizzas. 

Great service, beautiful location and delicious food, five stars without a doubt :)
