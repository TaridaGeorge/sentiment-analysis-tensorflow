We tried this place do to my looking up a place to eat while we were in the area, having our staycation at the Arizona Grand Resort
Hong Kong has to be the best Chinese Buffet I've ever been and I have eaten plenty. Everything was delicious.  We went for dinner so it was 15 and change for adults and our kids were 10 basically.   

The sushi bar was awesome. Instead of having a chef put out 5 or so different kinds of typical sushi. There is a chef making sushi to order. the menu to order off of is pretty extensive. 

My kids and had quite a few crab legs. The crab legs were also not your typical buffet grade. They were cooked perfectly and the meat was easy to remove and there was a lot of it.

we didn't try the Mongolian BBq but, we be back.
