I had a living social coupon to use at this coffee shop. I had never been here before and was pleseantly surprised by my experience. I loved the inside decor and the free wi-fi with purchase. 

I ended up ordering an iced coffee of some sort and a buffalo chicken wrap ( i know a strange combo) Both were really deliciious. 

I'm excited to go back this place!
