I've been here twice for dates and had a great meal, with great service each time, along with great company. The first time here i had the green chile pork, it was a bit spicy, very flavorful and the pork was tender. The cornbrread along side was great too. it was also he perfect portion size. The second time i had a burger and it was SO delicious. I usually would order something that i can't make myself but im glad i ordered it! The ketchup which is made in house (i think) alongside was also really good and had a slight kick to it.
