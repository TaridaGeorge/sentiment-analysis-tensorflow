We love the Irish inspired pub themes, and Rula Bula is a great place to get that. My husband and I usually order a salad each and 1 Fish and Chips plate then split it because the portion is very large. The Fish and Chips comes with tartar sauce and malted vinegar if you like it that way. It is a great dish to drink with a Guiness!

Nestled in the heart of Tempe, when you feel like getting a little culture down on Mill, Rula Bula fits the bill for both food and fun.
