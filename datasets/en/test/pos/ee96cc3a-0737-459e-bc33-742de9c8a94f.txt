Simply put, this place rocks. The only way it could get better would be for them to open a location in downtown Phoenix.

Amazing food, perfect service, and a great value make this place a home run. I've only been here two times, but was already made to feel like a regular, which is awesome. Perk has great ambiance, is very clean- and the service is wonderful.

In addition to great dine-in food, they have take-out which is fast and accurate. 

Keep up the great work Perk, I look forward to many more tasty breakfasts!
