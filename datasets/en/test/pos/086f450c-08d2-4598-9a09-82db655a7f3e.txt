Another review I forgot to finish... Brad had a lot a lot of attention to detail and did a super job on the windows and screens and the exterior window trim... as in they looked new and they're at least 5+ years old. Definitely something we put off for far too long. 

Just to note... Brads a really nice guy and was very personable and the cool thing that he did.... he took in my recycling bin from the road and put it away for me... who does that? that's just awesome! again... attention to detail and nice guy just sums it all up.

I've sent a couple people his way already and they're happy as well. I have no problem recommending Brad or using his services again.
