I have been coming to this practice for years. It is a true family practice, however, they are progressive and they do everything in-house, they have their own x-rays, labs, chiropractor and physical therapy. I have used almost all of their services without any complaints. They are thorough and take the time to discuss all your needs. I personal use Dr. Becky, the PA, but I have also seen Bruce.
