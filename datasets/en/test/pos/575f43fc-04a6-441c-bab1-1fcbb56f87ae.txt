We went here a few nights ago and it was amazing. The drinks were cheap and so was the food. 

Everyone's burgers were top notch. Being able to get Tater tits for a side just makes it even more awesome. 

We were very upset Victor didn't get the Sasquatch - it ruined Tony's vacation - but the Lodge is top notch!
