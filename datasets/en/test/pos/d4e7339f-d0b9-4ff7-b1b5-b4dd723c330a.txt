Amazing, plain and simple.

I don't quite have the experience that my girlfriend does when it comes to Pho (she grew up back east), but this place has the best Pho that I have tasted.  I took my girlfriend here to try it out because I saw the reviews here on yelp and I am glad that I did.  The food we had was amazing and we will definitely be going back for more.  

If you are in the mood for great Vietnamese food, Khai Hoan is the place to go.
