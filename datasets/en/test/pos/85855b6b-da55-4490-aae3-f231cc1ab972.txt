Quality!!!

Ingenious!!!

Awesomeness!!!!

This place needs to get closer to civilization.  Not that there isn't any in Queen Creek, but come on, they have more cows than stop lights.

Despite it being waaaayyyyyy out of the way, for me at least, it is worth it.  100\% of the time it is worth the drive.

They make their own mozzarella, fresh every day.  So of course I have to have the Caprese salad.  

I really like their Ruben where the sauerkrat is home made.

My brother cannot get enough of their meatball sandwich full of tangy red sauce and cheese.

If you like ice cream they actually make their own here.  Different flavors that you cannot find anywhere else.
