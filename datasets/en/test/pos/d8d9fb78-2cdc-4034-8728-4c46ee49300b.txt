Great BBQ exists in Mesa, AZ because of Famous Dave's. The service was great, and the food was even greater. I ordered the St. Louis Ribs Combo with the Georgia chopped pork. Both were delicious! For the sides, I had the beans and the mac & cheese. No complaints here. Just come with an empty stomache, so that it can be made FULL!
