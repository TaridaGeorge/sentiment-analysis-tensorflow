I love this place!  So many high points - the breakfast is great - fresh squeezed orange juice, delicious scones.  I love a good Americano and they definitely do a great job.  Parking is a bit sketchy, but if you pull around to the back there are more spots.  I love that the owner is always working and actually seems genuinely excited to see me (and everyone who comes in!)  I love it - I need to come here more often.  I do wish they were open a little later, sometimes I like a late afternoon pick me up and they're always closed around 3pm.
