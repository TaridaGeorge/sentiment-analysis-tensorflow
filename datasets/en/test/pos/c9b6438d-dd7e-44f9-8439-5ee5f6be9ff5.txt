My family stayed here last year over Thanksgiving. The rooms were large and clean. The view from our rooms over the golf course was lovely. The pools were nice and the facilities great.

And they were very helpful in helping us plan our outings which included hot air ballooning, a wonderful day trip through Sedona and to the Grand Canyon, and a desert jeep excursion. All were better than I expected and planned after getting information through guest services. I would love staying here again.
