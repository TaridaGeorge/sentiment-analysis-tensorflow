I have been going to Terry for over 20 years and I am only 22! My parents started going to him a long time ago and we haven't used anyone since. He is very reliable and trusting, and honestly if I were to move to another state I would want to take him with me because it is very hard to find a good mechanic. You can't go wrong with Terry's Tire and Auto!!
