I was told a while back to try Bombay Spice. My husband and I are changing our lifestyle by eating healthy. This is a great option for anyone looking for a healthy alternative. I liked the option to have brown rice or lettuce wraps. They also have tofu, which is difficult to find at most places. We tried the sauce sampler, seared salmon, chicken tikka masala, veggie curry, and chicken curry. Everything was very good. Was a great change from the usual chain restaurants.
