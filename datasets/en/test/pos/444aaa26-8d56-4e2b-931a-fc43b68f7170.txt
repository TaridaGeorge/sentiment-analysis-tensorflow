The Hero Factory is one of my favorite lunch spots in downtown Phoenix.  The sandwiches are generous to say the least, especially at the $7.95 price point.  Jay and Nicole are always friendly and know me by name, a testament to their service skills.

My favorites include anything with a chicken cutlet and how could I not mention Jay's homemade meatballs.  The roles are nice and soft and when toasted offer a nice crunch to accompany any of the tasty fillings.  Another suggestion is the chicken salad wrap with bacon.  Yum!  

I used to visit quite often, even for breakfast where Nicole would always make me a turkey wrap, a little oddity for breakfast foods.  

Overall the Hero Factory is a great place for lunch and totally outshines most of the mediocre downtown lunch spots.  If you haven't stopped in do so.
