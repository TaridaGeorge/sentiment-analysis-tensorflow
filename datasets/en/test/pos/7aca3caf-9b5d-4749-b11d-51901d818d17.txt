This place is so cool...and the people who work there are awesome.  I came in today to look for a Camelback (some people are not talented enough to ride and drink at the same time)  They explained to me that I would be dependent on the thing and actually talked me out of the purchase.  The sales guy even said "I can't believe I am going to talk you out of a sale..."  He told me about these great water bottles instead...which I do own.  I think I need to practice with the water bottles more.
While I am a Tribe girl at heart...Kevin at Tribe actually told me to go there...if I needed an alternative place to go, I would pick them in a second.  And I thought that the store was really cool.  Very laid back and they didn't make me feel like an idiot.
