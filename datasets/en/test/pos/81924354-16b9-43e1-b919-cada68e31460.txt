How can you not like COSTCO! ...We love Costco, we go 2-3 times a month! They have everything there, and you save so much money by buying in large sizes! We buy tons of eggs there, olive oil, canned tuna & salmon, sliced turkey, blueberries, oranges, apples, saline solution, books, etc, etc... You gotta think long-term when you shop at Costco. Gas is even cheaper there, too!  :)
