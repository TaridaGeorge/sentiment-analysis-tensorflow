What a gem of a restaurant! I knew something was up when there was a wait for a table for lunch after 1 pm!!-sat at the bar and tried the flatbread pizza(capicola and artichoke) which was amazingly good. Returned the next day for dinner with 5 others-loved the grilled salmon with curried chickpeas and cauliflower. The hummus/tzatziki appetizer with olives was delicious and large enough to share with all! My friends meals included roasted chicken, Thai BBQ ribs, pork chops and squash enchiladas which were all excellent. Friendly service and great atmosphere-one of my new favorites...I highly recommend this restaurant.
