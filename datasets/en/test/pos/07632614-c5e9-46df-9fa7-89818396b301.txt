Amazing Salmon sandwich - ask for extra side of sauce, Awesome breakfast - their pancakes are unique and so FULL of flavor! Even their honey yogurt was amazing.  Have not had a single bad dish EVER at this restaraunt.  

The chef has even come out and asked how things were going! Super friendly staff, and if ever a long line it is worth the wait!  Just got noted one of the best restaraunts in the Phoenix magazine.
