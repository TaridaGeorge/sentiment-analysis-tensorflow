Love hiking in Spur Cross Ranch! If you are looking for a place that feels completely disconnected from the normal world with only the sound of nature, and very few people around, this is the place. It is a bit of a drive once you turn off the main street but it's a very pretty drive. The amount of cactus and greenery here is outstanding and the views are beautiful. There are easy trails and hard trails, and it's easy to get lost in a nice sort of way (aka it's not that hard to find your way back to the trail). Some of the trails go by a creek, which actually does have a good amount of water after a rain. 

After hiking in Spur Cross its easy to get a bite, a cup of coffee, or some beers in the quaint town of Cave Creek.
