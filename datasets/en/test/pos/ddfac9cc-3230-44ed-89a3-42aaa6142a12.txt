I was visiting a friend in Phoenix and she recommended Pane Bianco. In short (which is appropriate because this place has few things on the menu, but does them all well), Love it.  The outdoor seating is totally fitting for the atmosphere, the bread is delicious and rustic and the panini are really delicious. The coffee shop is still urban but less utilitarian than Pane.  The sandwiches and salads are very reasonably priced IMO.
