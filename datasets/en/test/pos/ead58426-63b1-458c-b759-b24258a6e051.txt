This was our third time at FEZ and I was debating whether to give it a 4, due to our last experience, but the sweet potato fries alone deserve the 5.  I think it was a little hectic this past Saturday, so I am going to overlook the service.  My husband had the Tangiers burger, it was awesome.  I had the Phyllo chicken pockets, yummy.  Our friends had the FEZ burger.  I can't wait to come for lunch and have my own burger.  We love the ambiance and how cool this place is.  It is such a pity that we have to drive so far to find gems.  Phoenix has some awesome restaurants!
