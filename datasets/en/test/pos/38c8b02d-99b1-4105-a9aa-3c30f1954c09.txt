I'm not a breakfast person. It takes a lot to get my lazy ass out of bed so breakfast never was my thing. Joe's is one of those dining experiences that is an exception to that rule. The bacon and sausage are hearty, they know how to poach an egg and their coffee is great-really a rarity for a breakfast and lunch place.
Everyone who works there is friendly and cheerful and the owner himself asked how my meal was.This is another place that I would encourage all Yelpers to go patronize because they serve up great food with a smile and a lot of heart and are more than worthy of our hard earned dollars. Definitely worth getting out of bed early for.
