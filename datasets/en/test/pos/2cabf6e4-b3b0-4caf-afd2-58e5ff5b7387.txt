Falafel sandwiches here are tasty, filling, and cheap. Really, it is the best value in all of Tempe. Super affordable, and the falafel are quite tasty. I've had better falafel other places, but this place comes pretty close to being the best. 

Also, I love their different varieties of baklava. Almond is my favorite!
