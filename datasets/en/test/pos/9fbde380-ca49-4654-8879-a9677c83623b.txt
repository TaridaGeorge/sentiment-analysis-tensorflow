The Sonoran Hot Dog is my favorite type of hot dog! 
I ate so many as a kid on trips to Mexico, which is why every hot dog I've eaten has always been compared to the Sonoran dog.

The actual dog is bacon-wrapped, has a special bun, which is very soft and sweet, to hold all of the toppings such as beans, onions, tomatoes and mayonnaise. I added the creamy, green, guac-type sauce and cotija cheese. 
It was amazing!
The hardest part is holding the hot dog at the right angle so you won't spill your toppings and YOU MUST wash it down with a Mexican soda.

Nogales is located in a parking lot on the corner of Indian School Rd and 20th St, across from 7-Eleven.
Don't be discouraged by the location, cart, van or folding tables/chairs. 
Service is quick and friendly. Take cash!
