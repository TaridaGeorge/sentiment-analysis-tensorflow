Amazing customer service! My husband and I told them it was our anniversary and not only did they send over a compimentary bottle of champagne, but the sushi chef came out and introduced himself and asked if he could prepare a special 5- course meal for us!?  This is very uncommon these days and we were beyond happy! We ended up staying there for almost 3 1/2 hours!  Wonderful Wonderful! Food was fantastic as well!
