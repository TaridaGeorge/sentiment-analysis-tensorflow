This store prides itself on cleanliness, and you can see it. It doesn't have that weird, dirty-feeling sensation that some grocery stores have. Parking can be a nightmare, but it was much worse a few months back when there was construction. This location recently went under a face-lift, and it feels like the store became ten times bigger because of that. They now also have a gas station in the same parking lot, and a drive thru pharmacy which they didn't have before.  Haven't had an issue with what I've bought here yet, so definitely a plus!
Staff is always nice and kind too!
