Fantastic kennel! I am so lucky to have found this wonderful group of people that care for my dogs! Rocky and Adrian are normally pretty skittish and shy, but they LOVE going for 2-3 day overnight trips...they are always SO happy when I pick them up!
Peggie, JJ and Jimmy actually KNOW my dogs - and that is comforting. 
I literally drive across town to take my dogs here...and I would would not have it any other way.
