This place was AWESOME!!! I went in solo for lunch the other day.  I sat at the bar and was greeted immediately with water, chips, and salsa.  The green salsa was super spicy and delicious while the red was more mild but still delicious.  I order the chile relleno and an enchilada.  The green chili sauce was fantastic, just enough kick to it. The cheese that they use there was some of the creamiest cheese I have ever had at a Mexican restaurant.  I would recommend this place to everyone!!! Great service, great food, and great people.
