Everything was perfect!  There are so many courses and surprises, no one couldn't be pleased.  The food is terrific, and there is something for everyone.   The staff is also terrific, and one can tell these people seem to like what they do.  Make no mistake, this is an expensive restaurant (over 250 per person with tax and tip) but I feel it was sowrth every penny.  Can't wait to go back.
