It's all in the name.  A few of my work colleagues and I had some gelato and a Parma here and it was AMAZING.  The overall feel of the establishment is accomodating and family kitchen style.  You can taste everything, customer service was great and speedy and overall best gelato I've had in quite some time.  The flavors are tongue acrobatics and sensory soothing.  Loved it and I'll be back for sure!
