Dutchman's Hideout is an addition built within the space available in the Mining Camp Restaurant.  They have a very welcoming atmosphere and a very warm decor.  

Their menu is very good and the prices are excellent.  The food is well prepared and worth the trip.  They have their own baking facilities so all of the bread products are fresh.  The dynamite shrimp is an excellent start and I recommend the bread pudding to finish.  Good luck having room for both.

For the meals, I have had the burger, the NY strip and the ribs.  All are on par with any of these that you can get throughout the valley.
