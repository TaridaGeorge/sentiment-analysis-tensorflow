After trying several of the other bbq joints in the valley, I might have finally found the "ONE"! Had the 4 bone rib meal with sweet corn medley and potato salad, and it was all delicious. The ribs literaly melted in my mouth and weren't smothered in sauce like some other places. The service was super warm and friendly as well. I will definitely be back! 

This place is only open Mon-Fri 10:30-3:00. The place gets crowded for lunch. Get here right when they open or after the lunch hour.
