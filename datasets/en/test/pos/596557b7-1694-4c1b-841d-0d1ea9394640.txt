This is our favorite Thai restaurant in the valley.  Their curry is so flavorful and rich, it beats all others I've had.

We usually get  the Chicken Satay appetizer a couple of curries.  My wife always gets the Panang, which is amazing.  I get the yellow quite often, but I've not had anything on the menu which wasn't excellent.

Their Thai Tea is good, service is always friendly and attentive, and the owner is usually hanging around making sure everything is as good as it should be.

Good for takeout, although not as good as eating there.
