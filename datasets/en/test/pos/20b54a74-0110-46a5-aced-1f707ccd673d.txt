Wow!  Yes a great yet the best Ribeye!  GO for the beef.  You won't be asking where's the beef here.  Really really good.  So if your having a special occasion, this is your place.   THe service is the best.  I really recommend the beef here.  It is  little hard to find.  But worth it.  you won't be disappointed.  I have been here several times and love it every time. 
I highly recommend this place.  I will be back!
