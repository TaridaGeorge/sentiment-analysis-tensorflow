I'm very pleased with PVOBGYN! I was referred there by someone my husband works with at Scottsdale Healthcare. We were told to see Dr. Deka and I'm so thankful I went with her. She's super friendly, answers questions with thoughtful answers and doesn't make you feel rushed. She's an experienced mother herself so I feel like she knows what I'm going through (being pregnant) and empathizes with me. I have nothing but great things to say about her and the staff.
