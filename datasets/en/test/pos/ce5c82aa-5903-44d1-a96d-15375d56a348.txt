Best place to eat breakfast in Phoenix, bold but well deserved. I stumbled across this fine establishment one Sunday morning and wasn't disappointed one bit after eating at local breeze. 

The fire island eggs were amazing and complimented with a little green Tabasco sauce added the perfect touch.  The patio is huge and open creating the perfect setting for some sangria or mimosa whichever you prefer. They also offer a "going green incentive" with 15% off for bike riders on Sundays. 

Keep doing what your doing, because its right!
