I'd heard great things about this place so my husband and I finally gave it a try this weekend. Atmosphere was cool and fun with live music on the patio. I was pleasantly surprised by the affordability of this place -wines from $5 to $10 and bruschetta prices that were incredible. Plus, the food was great! We tried 6 of the bruschetta combinations - favorites were the apple/brie, prosciutto, and tomato/mozzarella. We can't wait to go back and try more.
