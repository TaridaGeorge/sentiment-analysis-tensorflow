Ok, Yes there are lot's of rules, but some of the rules are totally fine in my book.. The no cell phone policy is spot on.. The cash thing sucks.. The wait time is completely out of their hands.. The service is always prompt, and yes if you order anything that is not on your plate(ie:blueberry syrup or peanut butter) you will be charged extra for it. But there is one reason to put up with all of their rules.. And that is in the formation of the 49er flapjacks.. I have mine with syrup and Peanut Butter, and it is the single best breakfast item I have ever put in my mouth, I go to OPH during the week, I never wait, and I bring cash, and life is good... IMO stick to the pancakes.. This isn't Original Omelet House..
