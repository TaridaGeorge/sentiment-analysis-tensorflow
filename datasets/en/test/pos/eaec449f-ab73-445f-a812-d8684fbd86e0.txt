We love it here !
Nice ambiance,patio and stellar service ! and for those who imbibe they have Tequila flights -and flaming coffee .

App high-light:
Mahi-Mahi Ceviche is very good ..we live in a land locked state so finding a decent Ceviche can be trying.

Entrees;
Pork belly and Scallop entree for Mr.Man ,and I enjoyed a Fabulous Pork shoulder in a pumpkin seed sauce .Both presented well and were tender and flavorful .

Margarita's were decent .
