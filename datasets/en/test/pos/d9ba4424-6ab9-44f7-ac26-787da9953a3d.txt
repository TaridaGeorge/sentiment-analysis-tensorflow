I have got to say that this is my favorite place for a burger period just make sure you've got cash although they do have an ATM on site. I love everything about this place: the atmosphere, location, food, and the people that work there. This is the kind of place that doesn't try to be something it's not. I've never had a burger that wasn't incredible and I absolutely love watching the guy behind the grill make the burgers.

If you're looking for a great burger with that classic charcoal taste this is absolutely the best place to go. You have to check it out.
