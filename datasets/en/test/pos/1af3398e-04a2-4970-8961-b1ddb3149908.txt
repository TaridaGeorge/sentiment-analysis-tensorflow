I brought my 80 pound crazy Austrailian Cattle Dog here for a checkup, shots and some dental cleaning.  Let's just say that he is socially challenged and takes a bit of time and effort before he really warms up to people.  The staff here did everything to work with him and make him feel comfortable without manhandling him.  It did take a second visit and some nice doggie downers to get the shots and bloodwork done but his return for dental work went much better.  Very impressed with the professionalism of Dr. Walker and his staff.  They followed up with me and showed genuine concern for the well being of my hiking buddy.  On top of that, the bill was incredibly reasonable.  They have become my regular vet for my dog now and any pets I may have in the future.
