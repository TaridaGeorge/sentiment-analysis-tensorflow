This place is a MUST... I couldn't exist in this country without some decent German baked goods. Not sure where the poster who lived in Germany ate her pretzels when she lived there. I'm German and the pretzels at Old Heidelberg are as authentic as they get. 
The ladies are always friendly and I only wish I lived closer and could go there more often.
