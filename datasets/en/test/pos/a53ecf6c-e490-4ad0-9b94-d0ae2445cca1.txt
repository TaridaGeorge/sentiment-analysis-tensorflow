You know how it is.. when your jones'n for something .. your just gonna have to find it.. ENTER yelp app on the iPhone! Boom .. Bobby Q's within 15 minutes of my home.. during the rain and the wind.. thats what I needed .. good old barbeque.. Really.. I couldnt decide how or what to order to get my comfort food on.. because that is the way the menu rolls.. Ended up with the 2 meat platter.. split with someone else.. salad on the side.. perfect.. pulled pork, beef brisket.. yum.. 
mashed potatoes are the kind grandma used to make.. 
my cohort in jones'n crime got her carb on with the mac/cheese.. (kind of velveety' for me..but still yummy).. 
AWESOME corn muffins.. 
Alfonso, our waiter.. the best Ive had in months:-) 
Oh yeah.. they love yelpers .. mention it.. see what you get:-)
