what can i say about the deliciously dripping juice i was covered in after i left. the burgers are not greasy at all here, however, when you bite into a double bacon burger with cheese, there is no stopping the juice flow down your arm. the burgers are phenomenal, the beefs are amazing! (new bread?) and the hot dogs are crazy good. Finally found an authentic chicago style hot dog right around the corner from where i live! Check it out if you haven't, and for all you haters out there, try it again and stop hating!
