Took a Cannonade to be repaired at this shop. They fixed it quickly and in a manner that was better than expected and at a great price.

Selection of American-made bikes is nice.

Accessories are expensive and no great deals on anything besides bikes. Some accessories I asked for were not available but it wasn't why I was there.

The neighborhood is pretty scary and I even saw a crackhead hooker that stank and who was asking about a bike that someone stole from her. Very entertaining.
