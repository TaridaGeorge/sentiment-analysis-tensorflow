A pizza place within walking distance from several bars, that stays open late... who doesn't love that? We had a few beers at Tops, then spotted this place so we dropped in and ordered a couple slices of pepperoni... nothing fancy, just wanted to take Tessio's for a spin! Five minutes later, we were presented with 4 HUGE slices of extremely hot pizza! I'm not gonna lie, I burned the inside of my mouth, this pizza was so good, I did not bother waiting for it to cool down!! The guys working there were all very friendly and very helpful! I definitely recommend them! If you're in the area (drinking or not) stop by and grab a slice!!
