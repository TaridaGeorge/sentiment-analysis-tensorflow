I think I've already wrote a review for Total Wine, but figured I'd write another for this new Scottsdale/Shea location, as it is closer to me and will probably be my new location to go to.

I love that they put it in literally right behind BevMo....take that BevMo!  I cannot see how the heck BevMo will even stay in business with Total Wine right behind them.  The selection at TW is light years ahead of BevMo's....but even better, TW's prices are insane cheap compared to BevMo.

If you need alcohol/wine, look no further.....drive right past BevMo and go to Total Wine, you will not come out of the store empty handed.
