WOW!!

The new owners of the Al's on Northsight have it down pat! My beef was perfect, as authentic Chicago as it gets (and that's coming from a REAL Chicagoan). My wife loved the fact that they've added salads and wraps. Now I can bring her more often. We were surrounded by great people, great service, and smiling faces. Kudos to the new owners.

Great job!!
