I love this place!  Great for kids because they have activities for them and in the spring the butterfly garden is teeming with life.  Always have a something great on exhibit.  Being a member there myself, I know there are a lot, no, a ton of classes and walks and guides there almost daily.  Classes from the arts to landscape design.  

The experience is never the same there on the trails and in the exhibits, which is what makes it so fun.  You really have to go there and walk the trails and hear the jazz played at night!
