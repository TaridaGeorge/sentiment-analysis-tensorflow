1 1/2 hours well spent exploring an eccentric artist's Mystery Castle.
Cool story behind this interesting characters plight and his home. 
Awesome attention to detail, any artistic  minded person would appreciate and enjoy exploring.
This is a cool surprise date place to take someone.
 I did that for husband and he didn't have a clue as to where or what  we were doing; especially if you start from the heart of phoenix and head south,,,their curiosity meter will venture towards exploding

It's now $10 per person not 5,inflation hit the castle too. Still worth  every penny!
