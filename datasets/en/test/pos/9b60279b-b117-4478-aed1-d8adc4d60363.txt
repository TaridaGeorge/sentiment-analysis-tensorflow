I had the unfortunate experience of being over the top sick with a Migraine the day after Christmas. I was so bad off i couldn't drive or really even see straight.  I have never been to an Urgent care ever, but i have been to the ER.                                       So this was a whole new deal.  They were so  wonderful!                                            The wait was not long at all,even though they were very busy!  The Dr. saw me right away, and he knew what was wrong and how to fix it.  Two shots later i was pain free. Thank you Dr. Doug! I hope i never have to go back, but if i do i am glad they are here.   The entire place is very clean and smells clean as well. Keep this place in mind if you are ill and need help fast.
