UPDATE: Starbucks is now offering these delicious little breakfast treats that are simply DELICIOUS! They are breakfast sandwiches: Bacon, Egg and Gouda/ Veggie, Egg and Monterey Jack/Sausage, Egg and Cheddar/Reduced Fat Turkey Bacon, Egg and White Cheddar. So far, I have enjoyed the Bacon, Egg and Gouda served on a ciabatta roll and the Sausage, Egg and Cheddar served on a whole wheat english muffin. Both are SO delicious. Whether you dine in or get the sandwich to go, they will heat it up to perfection! The sandwich will be PIPPING hot, but not enough to make it soggy--there is still plenty of crispy goodness where there should be. 

Enjoy with a cup of coffee (or my fav) a Soy Chai Tea and you'll be well on your way to a LOVELY day!
