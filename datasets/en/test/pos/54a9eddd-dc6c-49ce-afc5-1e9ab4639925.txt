I love coming here for my pedicures,which I get often.  They are VERY good at the details (which I've had other nail places take little notice of).  It's no spa, but I feel that it is clean and comfortable.  I've been coming for years and have never had a problem.  They are efficient and do a great job!  My nails always last for close to a month, which is amazing with the abuse I put them through on a daily basis!
