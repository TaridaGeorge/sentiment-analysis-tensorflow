I have had memberships to a few gyms in the valley and YMCA tops.  

The gym has more than enough cardio machines, including bikes, eliptical, treadmill and stairmaster.  I have only had to wait a few minutes for an eliptical machine once or twice in over a year.  There are a large assortment of weight machines.  

The best part is the classes - yoga, pilates, spin, step, ab-crunch, kickboxing - all included with your membership! There is also an olympic sized heated pool, the Y offers water aerobics, which I have not tried but am definitely thinking about.  

Another seller for me was the lack of pretentiousness.  People are here for one reason - to work out.  You won't find girls with full make-up looking to meet their future husband.  It is a family place and I feel very comfortable working out here.
