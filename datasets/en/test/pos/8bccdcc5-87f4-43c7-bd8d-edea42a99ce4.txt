Scott the mechanic is the man. He is the only mechanic in the Valley that I totally trust. He has worked on at least 10 cars of mine over the years. No one wants to hear...you need a new one of those, or are you ready for how much this is going to cost. But with Scott if he suggests doing something while he is in there, preventing future problems I do it. Sun Devil Auto is a good shop.and businesses.
