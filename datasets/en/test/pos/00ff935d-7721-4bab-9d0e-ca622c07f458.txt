I love finding hidden gems like this one! First time there I tried the  ice tea, coffee and a chicken curry sandwich! And enjoyed everything! The bread they use for their sandwiches was delicious!  The owners were adorable and genuine. They have put some amazing work into this place, the ambiance is incredible! Not a huge place, but nice and cozy. Will definitely be back:)
