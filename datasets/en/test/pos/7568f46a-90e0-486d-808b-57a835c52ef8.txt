If only it were closer. Or if only I was. I would marry this wonderful gem of a business and call it a day. 

The cupcakes are delish.
The latte is as close to on par as I suppose I can ask for.
The ambience is stellar.
And the line was in direct relation to its awesomeness.

I cannot go often, but if I could, I would.

Oh, and I asked if they could make gluten-free cupcakes. They said they could make any flavor gluten-free, though I am not confident in that, it still cracks the whip on any other cupcakery out there.

Now if only I were rich and well, had a car, I would move there in a hot second. Too bad for me. Good for them.
