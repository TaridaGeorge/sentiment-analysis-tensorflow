Cracker Barrel is one of those places I would  try and live at if they let me.
I live in California, so I have to cross state lines to get to one, but we do it.
It's just that good.
The lumberjack breakfast is one of the best country style breakfasts I've had hands-down.
This is a great place to go in a large group, and we often do.
