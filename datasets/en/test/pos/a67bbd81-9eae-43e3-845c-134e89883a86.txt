I have not experienced the issues of the previous reviewers.  I frequent this Starbucks almost every workday.  I find the employees to be friendly, welcoming, and oure grace under fire.  I have waited in long lines, but it seems they move it along pretty quickly. 

The only negative experience I have had is when I have to wait for the "high maintenance" customer that is in line in front of me with a list of special order drinks, paying separately for each one because they are not smart enough to do basic math.  I secretly wish they trip while carrying their drinks on the way back to their self important job.
