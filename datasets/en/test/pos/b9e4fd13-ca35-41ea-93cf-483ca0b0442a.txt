Hands down the best steakhouse/fine dinning experience in Phoenix.  If you are in the mood for a true experience Durants is the best.  I love entering from the kitchen, it is nice to see where your food is coming from.  The ambiance reminds you of a scene from a 1940's movie, you full on expect Frank Sinatra to sit down next to you and order a martini.  Not to mention that the food and the staff are amazing.  I come here for all my special celebrations and make it a point to let out of town guests experience Durants as well.
