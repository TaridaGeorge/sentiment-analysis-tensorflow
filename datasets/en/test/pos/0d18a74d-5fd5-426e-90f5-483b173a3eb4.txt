Tried the Wedge Side Salad yesterday as I was craving some veggies. So delicious and fresh for $5! The blue cheese dressing, crumbles hike the calorie and fat count so you might want to ask for these on the side. Service as awesome as always. I wish their wifi was better. I marked it upscale as I think the ambience is compared to 5 Guys.
