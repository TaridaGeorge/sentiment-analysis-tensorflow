Never had a bad meal here, this is our favorite Chinese food in the valley so far. Went last Friday and tried the steamed Chilean Sea Bass with scallion and ginger based off another Yelper review. We were not disappointed it was so perfectly prepared and delicious! We also had a combination special with shrimp, scallops and beef that was very good as well along with the minced vegetables as a side. All great. We had the potstickers for an appetizer and while the flavor was very good, they ere the kind with very think dough that i do not care for as much as the thinner ones. 

Live music and good wine helped round out our dining experience. If you are in the North Valley you can't go wrong with the Jade palace for Chinese food.
