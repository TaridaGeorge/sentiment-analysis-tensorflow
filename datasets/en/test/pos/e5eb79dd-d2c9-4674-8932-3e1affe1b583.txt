Lunch special was great price. Under $7 with drink. I had the orange chicken lunch combo. The meal was super hot and quite tasty. Good portion for a lunch combo. Nice clean interior with new granite topped tables. Atmosphere is what you would expect with a large waterfall painting and proverbial white ceramic cat on the counter. Staff was very nice, even asking me how my meal was. I will be back!
