This is a pretty awesome place. Everything I've had has been spot-on and they're really creative with their menu. I've never had a lamb brat before, but it worked! They have lots of interesting toppings to choose from, their pretzels are tasty and their fries are cooked to perfection. The cherry on top is their awesome beer list, and they're served in their specific branded glass!
