I love, love, love this place!  While I go to Fuego Cityscape more often, since it is downstairs from my gym, I love the ambiance, indoors and outdoors on the expansive patio. 

The food is excellent.  My favorite is the Chile Rellenos, but the Pork Nachos and Empenadas are great as well, as are the very fresh mojitos (can get Pomegranate and Mango Mojitos), wine and everything on the menu.

The manager is super-friendly and very patient with us, and when we go, we tend to close the place down, eating and drinking and being merry.  I told the manager that if you feed us, we will never leave.  I think he believes us!

Do yourself a favor and visit this excellent little restaurant..you will be glad you did!
