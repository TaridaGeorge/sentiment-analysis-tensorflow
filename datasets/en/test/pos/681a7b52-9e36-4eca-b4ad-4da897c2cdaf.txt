I stopped in  ,after reading Jim H's review .
Super friendly and such a relaxed atmosphere ..and the GREATEST BURGERS !

A burger built your way ...yes ..these guys deserve the crown .
I had asked for a well done burger ,sauteed onions and mushrooms and pepper jack cheese .on an onion roll ...this burger blew my skirt off ..and if i were a sock wearer it would have knocked them off as well !! 

Groovy Dudes ,Rock on !
