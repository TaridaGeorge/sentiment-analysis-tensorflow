I have been training here many years and continue to recommend them for anyone that is interested in being prepared for a home invasion or random act of violence that might happen.  MMA is great for athletes but rarely stresses the violence of an event that affects real people in real situations.

They recently added a new childrens, youth and teens programs which is great.
