Shawna is a god-send! She has helped me curb the barking in my house and reinforce obedience training that was lacking. I have also attended Rally Obedience classes with both dogs, they had just as much fun as I did! It's amazing to see her interacting with the dogs and seeing them do exactly what she asks of them. If you've tried other training classes without the desired results, give Maverick a try, Shawna will teach you how to get the response you want from your dogs!
