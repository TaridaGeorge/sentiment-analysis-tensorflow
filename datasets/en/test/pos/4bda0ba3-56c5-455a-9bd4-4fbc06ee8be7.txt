I arrived home at the end of the day to discover a swarm of bees on a rock in my front yard.  They covered about a square foot of the rock, and some were swarming near it.  I did an internet search, called a few numbers, and landed the Beekeeper Total Bee Control.  Kevin came out within the hour, sprayed the bees, cleaned them up, in no time the bees were gone.  I would highly recommend them
