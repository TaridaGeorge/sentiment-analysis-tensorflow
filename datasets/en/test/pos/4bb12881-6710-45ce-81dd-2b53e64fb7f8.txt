Cracker Barrel is one of my favorite restaurants! They always have the best comfort food. My five year old daughter loves their pancakes and my husband usually gets the special of the day which is always different and so tasty. I love mama's pancakes with peaches. 
We always have great service when we come here and I can never leave without walking through the store.
