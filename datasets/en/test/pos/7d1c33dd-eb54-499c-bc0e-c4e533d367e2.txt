Best BBQ in the Phoenix metro area. The home made red cream soda and home made root beer is amazing. All the meats are tasty. The home made BBQ sauce is great. My favorites are the pulled pork, potato salad, chocolate chip cookies. There are lots of seating and very family friendly. If you live in the PHX metro area and you havent been to Joe's, I dont know what you have been doing with your life.
