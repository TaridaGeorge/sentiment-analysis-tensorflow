We ordered a METRO pizza (just pepperoni and cheese) for pick up.  HILARIOUSLY huge box.  It took up the entire back-seat length of my Honda CRV.  

The pizza was delicious.  I think everything has been said about Pizza A Metro already but it really is some good pizza.  I need to go back and try the pasta now.  It is really small and warm, so I will need to go in the winter when it's cooler.  But I am sure it is worth the heat.

I wanted to save the pizza box and use it to store wrapping paper in it but my husband wouldn't let me.  booo.  It went to the recycle bin.
