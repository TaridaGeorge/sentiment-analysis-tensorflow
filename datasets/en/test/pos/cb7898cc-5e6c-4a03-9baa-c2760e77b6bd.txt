This is my another restaurant I have been going to since I was  a child.  I've enjoyed their bbq pork fried rice for about 25 years. Sing High's pork fried rice is the best I have ever had.  I will never eat rice at any other restaurant because I know that this rice can not be equalled. They also have great chow mein, fried shrimp and sweet and sour pork. Their prices are pretty good. The food is sooo good  that I make this 30 mile trip once a week.
