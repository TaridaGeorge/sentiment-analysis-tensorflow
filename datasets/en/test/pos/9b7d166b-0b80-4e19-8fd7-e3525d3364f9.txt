Fun Italian decor. Delicious hand made pizza.  The Chef Salad ($5.50) was very fresh and loaded with meat, egg, cheese and olives, on a bed of shredded lettuce, which made it very easy to eat, like a chop salad.  

Another plus was that they have yummy Moretti Italian Beer, light & dark.  There is also imported Italian lemonade and I saw some very generous pours of wine at the neighboring table.  Check it out.
