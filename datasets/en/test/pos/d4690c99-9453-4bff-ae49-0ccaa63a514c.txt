We love the food here.  Service is also always good.  The place is always busy, so you would be wise to call ahead if you don't like waiting.  Our favorite, family friendly, Italian restaurant.

The salad and bread are really good.  The entrees have generous portions and are really delicious.  There is a kids menu as well.

The whole restaurant is moving to McClintock and Warner in March and they said that the new building will have more parking, outdoor seating, and more space.  They promised not to change the food.  The new location will be a little farther for us, but that won't keep us from going.
