Love Costco for my big family. Its good for the bulk buying. But obviously you got to do your math and learn whats cheaper to buy at Costco or your grocery store in smaller packages. Birthday Cakes are cheap. But mostly I use the gas station since its usually a few cents cheaper then the cheapest gas stations around the area. As a member you can go there. Also their vacation packages rock! Used Costco for our family trip to Disneyland and Jamaica. Compared Disneyland.com and Getaway work deals...Costco Disney package was way better.
