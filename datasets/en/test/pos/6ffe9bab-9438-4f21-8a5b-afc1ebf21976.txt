First time here, heard so much about this place over the years. My expectations of a outdoor store was blown away by their customer service. 

I was unsure of the type of make boot to purchase for Alaska winters. They were extremely knowledgable and patient as I decided and tried on several boots. They answered all my questions and spent am appropriate amount of time with me. 

After my purchase I went home and looked on the internet for consumer reviews about my purchased boot.and what did I see, but a better price on-line. I called Cabela and they promptly refunded me the difference over the phone.

Great place for outdoor needs....
