My experience here was absolutely wonderful the first time. The service was prompt, and the ambiance was very pleasant.

For appetizer I remember having pâté de foie gras with a sour green apple chutney. It was great. After that, I ordered the French Onion Soup, which was made perfectly; they weren't stingy with the cheese, and the flavor was dense. Maybe they used beef stock? Either way it was delicious.

Finally came the Porterhouse. It was massive and every bite was delicious. Accompanying it was a chipotle glaze which made the steak even better. The sides were also good, but definitely not the center of attention.

The second time was not as good as the first, but still great.

Whether it is a pricey venue is unimportant. It is worth any money spent. 4.5 stars.
