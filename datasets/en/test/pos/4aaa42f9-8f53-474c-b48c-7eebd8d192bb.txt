I recently started riding a little Kawasaki back in forth from work to save gas. I needed a helmet but didn't want to spend a lot of money, just wanted something that works (it's a 100cc bike, I've already failed at looking cool). I knew nothing about helmets so I went to these guys for some help. The staff was available and very helpful. There was a huge selection in stock, so it wasn't difficult to find the right helmet for me. Multiple staff members checked the helmet to make sure it fit me properly. An overall great experience in a retail store, which is rare for me. Great business, I'll be going to them for all of my bike gear.
