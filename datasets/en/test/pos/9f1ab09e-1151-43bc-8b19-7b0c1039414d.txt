My hair salon needed an updated computer and I am not computer savy.  The tech that helped me was very helpful and did not try to sell me something I did not need.  Gordon was also willing to come into the salon on a Sunday when it was closed in order to change out our system.  He changed out my computer and also, loaded the software and files I needed from the old system and very quickly.  He gurantees his labor and computer as well.  Very happy.
