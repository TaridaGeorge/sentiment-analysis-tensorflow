This is as close to NY style pizza you will find in any other part of the country. The prices are good and you get a good slice of pie. I liked it a lot. I went for lunch had a calzone that cost $4.99 and it was very good. Sausage, peperoni, onions, mozzarella and ricotta cheese. Highly recommend it. Kids eat free after 4 on Wed.
