Going to Little Woody is like having an exciting secret affair? You don't want everyone to know about it, but it's so much fun you don't want to deny yourself of the pleasure!

The little woody its a hole in the wall, little neighborhood bar that everyone in the hood knows about despite the fact there is no signage outside the lit up cartoon eyes in the front window and no main street parking!
