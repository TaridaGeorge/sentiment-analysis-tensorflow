AZ88 - one of the best, most consistent spots in AZ for a great drink and casual meal.  The martinis are always ice cold, and poured so full that you have to bring your mouth to the glass to take a slurp before you can pick it up.  The gallettes and the hells fire fries (extra hot sauce on the side) are the best apps for sharing, and I never get anything besides the AZ88 chicken salad, chopped and tossed with ranch on the side.  One is enough for two people to share.  It's a great spot for meeting friends and people watching, and has remained consistent over all the years that I have enjoyed this place.  The patio is fantastic.
