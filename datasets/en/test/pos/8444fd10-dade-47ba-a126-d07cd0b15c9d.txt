Absolutely love this place.      Its very difficult to see from the road and doesn't look like anything special once you're inside but the food is phenomenal.      It tastes like what your Ecuadorean mother would make if you had an Ecuadorean mother.      It's a completely family run restaurant, the son and the father work the front of the house while the mother handles everything back in the kitchen.      Have been here many times, have tried most of the stuff on the menu and plan to keep coming back here for many years to come.


  As a warning, this is hardly standard American fare and I've noticed other reviewers coming in disappointed because the food isn't Taco Bell or On the Border.      This is hearty and authentic South American food, something you'd be likely to find in Ecuador or Peru and done very well at that.
