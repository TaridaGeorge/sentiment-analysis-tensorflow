Great prices compared to ANY store around! Produce is amazing! Beautiful, large produce and the best prices I've seen around. The design could be a little better to help with the flow of traffic, and they do cut some corners to help lower prices to customers, but I don't mind bagging my own groceries for lower prices. It does have a warehouse store feel, but you don't have to buy in bulk or pay for a membership. My family has been there 3 times now, and will definitely go back again. Oh, and they don't accept credit cards, but that's what debit is for.
