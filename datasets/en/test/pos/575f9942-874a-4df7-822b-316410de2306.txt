I went to Pastis today for lunch, and it was great!

I ordered the Madrid:
Hot sandwich with Prosciutto & turkey on toasted multigrain bread with sweet mixed greens, basil pesto aioli, tomatoes and home made mozzarella.

It was delicious.

The restaurant is very cozy and the service was great!

I also got the soup of the day, the pablano pepper soup,
I am saving it for when I get home, but I am sure it was good.

The other two people I went with ordered the Pierogi which is ground beef and potatoes in some sort of fried bread/pastry.
She loved them!

And the other person got the Milano:
Grilled hot italian sausage with grilled onions, roasted peppers, provolone cheese, & a chipotle aioli sauce.
All said food was great!

If you have a chance to visit this place, do so, it is amazing!
