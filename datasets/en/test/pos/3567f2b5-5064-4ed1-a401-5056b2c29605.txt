I am updating this review because I just wanted to share the info.  Koltton gave me lash extensions a few weeks ago, OMG, they were amazing.  I have had them before and they usually takes me a few days to get used to them.  Not this time.  They were light and amazing.  I showed them to several people who had done them before and they were so impressed.  He put two rows, since  I wanted them to look longer, but not full on Kardashian.  They looked so nice.
