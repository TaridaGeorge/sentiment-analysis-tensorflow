Sticklers - I've been searching for you...and I'm so happy I found you! Since starting a job downtown nearly a year ago I've been looking high and low for a place where I can make my own salad and not get charged an arm and a leg for liking lots of veggies.  And, now, here you are!  I see a long and beautiful lunchtime life together.  With over 30 fresh toppings and mix-ins UNLIMITED for $6.50 you are definitely the healthiest and best value in (down)town.  I may not go right at 12:30 when the crowds take up all of your indoor seating, but I have no doubt that I'll be back very soon.
