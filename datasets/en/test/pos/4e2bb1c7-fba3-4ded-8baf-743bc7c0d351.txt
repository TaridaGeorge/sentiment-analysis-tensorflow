Where to begin.  The beef sandwhich is just awesome and tasty.  The beef is juicy and the sauce is good.  The bread is crispy on the outside yet soft on the inside, combined with the fresh greens on the sandwhich, it's my favorite thing on the menu.  The chicken pho is right up there with the sandwhich.  The broth is just delicious as is the noodles and chicken.  You also have the choice to spice it up with a side plate of other ingredients that accompanys the dish.  The staff are very friendly and nice.
