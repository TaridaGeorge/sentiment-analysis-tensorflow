It wasn't smart coming here at 12pm. We were drenched with sweat by the time we reached the top...and running out of water! ahhh. Then again, we didn't expect the hike to be so long. The steps at the bottom eased us in..it was a nice leisurely stroll for a good 10 mins. Then..BAM! All these rocks come out of nowhere! A pleasant surprise, I guess. It was fun though, climbing like monkeys up to the top. Once at the peak, the view was amazing, of course. A 360 view of Scottsdale, Phoenix...and very far off in the distance, was SAN DIEGO (where we were visiting from). We definitely felt accomplished that day and celebrated with some ICE CREAM & Sprinkles cupcakes! Hey, we deserved it. :)
