This is a great place to get consistent asian food. Its not amazing, but always good. The decor inside is like every other Thai place you've seen, and of course has the mandatory paintings of Thai royalty. 


I really liked our waiter. He was funny and he and my dad talked all about their new Google Androids. Our waiter even showed us how to put the protector cover on the android without bubbles. Sometimes waiters are annoying when they get all friendly like that, but this guy was cool. He was great about filling water, bringing requested hot sauces, and bringing us chopsticks too. 

And the prices are VERY reasonable. Most of the non-noodle dishes come with rice, whereas at other restaurants you have to order rice separately.
