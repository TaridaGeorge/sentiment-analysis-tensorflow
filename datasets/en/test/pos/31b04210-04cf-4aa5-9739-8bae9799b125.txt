I love a good buffet!  This one has many selections to choose from.  You can have all the steak you want - no limits there.  Fried shrimp, chicken & dumplings, salads, desserts.  Yum-o!  This is a very traditional American style buffet.  Adults Dinner pricing is approx. $10.99 per person - not too shabby.  Would definitely recommend
