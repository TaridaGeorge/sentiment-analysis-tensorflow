I happen to buy a groupon for this place because I needed new running shoes a few  months ago. The sales associate was super helpful. Asking me what I usually buy, which brand I tend to like. She told me how to get the best fit and I was able to go outside the store and run/walk around. I love this! How else do you test running shoes if you just stand there???

She also taught me how to tie them correctly which I had no idea I'd been doing it wrong (it involves that extra lacing hole on the top that you think is too far up as it is). 

I bought myself a pair of Brooks and have been happy with them ever since. Although I haven't participted in any, they do offer free group runs also on a weekly basis.
