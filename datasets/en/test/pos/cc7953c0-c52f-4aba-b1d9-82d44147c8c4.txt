These pies are really yummy, they bake up in no time at all so they make an easy quick meal for people on the go. Plus, the best part - no thawing needed! A really tasty, flaky crusted all natural alternative to hot pockets with a much much larger variety of types. Only thing I would add is a variety pack or a sampler because for new customers they might not want to commit to a whole bag of one pie type.
