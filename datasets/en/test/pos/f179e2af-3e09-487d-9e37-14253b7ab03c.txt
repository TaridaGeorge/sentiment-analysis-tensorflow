Bought a Google Offer this past weekend, $20 for $40 worth of food.  Stopped to pick up lunch for me and a friend and wow, $40 went far!  And it was GOOD!!!  
We had sushi, rolls, tempura veggies, and the monkey brains.  Way too much food for two of us and it was all out of this world.  

I'm a huge sushi fan and the fish was sliced perfectly and so so fresh- like butter!  The rolls were great too, not too much rice and a perfect bite size.  

We will definitely be back!
