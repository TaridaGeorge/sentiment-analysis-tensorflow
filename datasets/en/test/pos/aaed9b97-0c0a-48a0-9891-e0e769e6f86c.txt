This place is absolutely fantastic.  Some of the best carne asada I've ever had, same for the al pastor.  The corn tortillas and sopes are out of this world.  Salsas are all fantastic (if not a little too on the mild side, but that's okay).  Very friendly and prompt service, and great prices.  I'll hit this place at least once a week for lunch.

I'll have to make sure I get something with flour tortillas next time, since we all know how important that is towards the success of this type of restaurant!
