Dr Josh and Dr Jenna are absolutely amazing. I have been going to chiropractors since I was 16 and by far Dr Josh is the best. He knows the body like no other. I use him as my primary care for any issues first ad then go to doctor if Dr Josh can't resolve it. I have not been to a regular physician in years. I see Dr Josh weekly for maintenance due to extreme use of my body with massage. 

Do yourself a favor and know what your spine looks like. Be in total health with chiropractic. Go see SCP Chiropractic.
