Dr. Jenista is fantastic. He is clear and concise with his dental plans and a perfectionist with all of his work. More importantly, he has a wonderful support staff working with him. Kim, one of the hygienists, does everything she can to make you feel comfortable and at ease in the chair. For example, the other day when I was getting my teeth cleaned she noticed I was shivering. Instead of ignoring it, she brought over a soft blanket and covered me! It's little things like that that make a dreaded trip to the dentist that much more enjoyable. 

Other positive: I've never waited longer than 5 minutes in the waiting room. Big plus for a busy woman!
