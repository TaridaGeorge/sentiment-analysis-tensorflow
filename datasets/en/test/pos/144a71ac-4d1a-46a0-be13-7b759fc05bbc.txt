My first time visiting El Chorro Lodge and I was blown away; I went right when the sunset was about to begin and that set the mood. I sat in the dining room next to the large doors that were open to the outside and you could see the outdoor fire pit. I ordered the prix fixe menu of the week and it was the their mussels and sausage in broth with garlic bread, I chose clam chowder for my starter and ended with my chocolate molten cake. Everything I ate was great and the best of all was the chocolate cake it was pure heaven. This place is pricey but definitely worth a visit at least once also it can be more affordable for meeting a friend if your'e just doing drinks and apps. I can't wait to go back.
