INCROYABLE!  You will love the food, the ambiance and most of all the people!  It is one of those hidden treasures right on the "rue" for great dining outdoors or in and Valerie and Faby make you feel like you are the only guests and being served in their home!  What a great combination for a truly joyous cuisine experience.  

It's a five star at every level---body, mind and soul!

Thank you again Valerie and Faby!
