Phenomenal service by Sarah, she is a class act among servers! I had seasonal vegetable plate with wilted spinach, peppers, tomatoes, delicious caramelized carrots and a grilled artichoke that picked up the smoky delicious flavor from the grill. Boyfriend had the ribs, which fell off the bone into succulent pieces of perfection. He even enjoyed the cole slaw which is a dish he usually detests! Topped it all off with banana cream pie. This pie has the perfect amount of chocolate shavings and caramel sauce all atop a walnut-Graham cracker crust. Swoon. Highly recommend and we will certainly be back!
