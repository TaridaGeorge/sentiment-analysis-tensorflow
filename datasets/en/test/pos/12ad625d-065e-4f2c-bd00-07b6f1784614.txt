Cheers to Cost Plus!!!! I love coming here to pick up candles and little knick-knacks for our new home. If you're into fragrance candles check out Indonesian Teak, Tahitian Vanilla and China Pear-basically their whole candle line is amazing. I also pick up ALL of my coffee here since they have unique and strong flavors such as Italian Roast. Every 6 bags of coffee purchased earns you a free one. :D  Cost Plus is even my go-to place for last-minute gifts like photo frames and wine. As a rewards member (sign up for free) I occasionally get emails advertising awesome specials in-store and online. The cool thing about these coupons is I don't even have to print them out, the cashiers are happy to scan then from my cell.
