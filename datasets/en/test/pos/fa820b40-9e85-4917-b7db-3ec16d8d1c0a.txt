Cornish Pasty is...wow. It's almost indescribable. It's really that good. First of all, any pub that has Hoegaarden on draft is automatically a winner in my book. When you add that plus a great happy hour, life is good. If you just want to get your drink on after a long day at the office, Cornish is hard to beat. If you want to drink AND eat (two of the best things a person can do) you will have an evening to remember. I'm vegetarian and this place has a ton of options for me. The Veggie Oggie and The Greek are my favorites--make sure you get a side of HP if they have it. You won't regret it. As long as this place is open, my husband and I will be frequent visitors.
