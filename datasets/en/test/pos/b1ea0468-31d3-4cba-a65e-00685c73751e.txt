A great place, great uniforms, great attitudes, good food.  It's tops in the market segment of, well, the market segment of Hooter's and Tilted Kilt.  Really Tilted Kilt is far better.  The garlic fries I'm sure slapped 2 pounds on my waistline but were fantastic.  All the gals working - whatever their stage names - were positive and helped run food and provide good service.  The food was consistent over a few days too.
