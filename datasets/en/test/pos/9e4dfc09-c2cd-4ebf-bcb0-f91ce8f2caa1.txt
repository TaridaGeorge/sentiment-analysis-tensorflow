Ok. So, the service is usually slow and getting a seat can take a while on a busy night. The college crowd can be overbearing and loud. But, if you go on off hours, like lunch on a Saturday, you can sit on their beautiful patio or check out the historical interior and drink awesome whiskey and eat some amazing Irish pub foods! There hasn't been a single item on the menu I've tried that I haven't loved.
