Top notch Italian food. I have to admit that when I go there i am not the most adventurous of eaters. I typically get the pasta when i go there, but their angel hair pasta bowl is the best I have ever had. the sauce is deliciously flavored, though more a mix of Chunks of tomato and tomato sauce, while most places just serve up sauce. I'm not a huge fan of places that offer large pieces of tomatoes in places they don't belong, but they aren't heavily found so it doesn't really bother me here. I do know i have friends and family that go here and have been going here for years who order all kinds of dishes and they seem to always love it. The atmosphere feels like a cozy Italian Kitchen and the wait staff is always around.
