Went back and picked up the best canolis I've ever had along with some delicious NY Cheesecake, Romanelli's pasta sauce, imported pasta, Wise potato chips and Italian cookies.  

It is now very clear to me that you absolutely cannot go wrong at this place.  I'm comfortable trying anything and everything there.  I would go every day if I could.  Great food, Italian grocery, deli, etc.
