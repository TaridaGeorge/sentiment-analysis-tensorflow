Lot's of really great beers on tap. Awesome atmosphere, staffed by really cool people and not overpriced. The food is extremely delicious, yet simple. There are a wide variety of pasty's for everyone's taste buds, including vegetarian minded people like me. I highly recommend this place for a drink, dinner or taking a date! It's definitely a good mix up to the usual fare, but be forewarned the pasty's are quite fattening--as is the case with nearly everything that tastes good!
