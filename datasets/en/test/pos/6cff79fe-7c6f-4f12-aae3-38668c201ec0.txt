Update: Just got back from SanTan last night. You know what? I'm upping my score to five stars. This place totally rocks!

We pulled about 35 folks through our #evfn event (Search for it here. We're a lot of fun!) The place was jam packed, and I was worried it was going to be a bust. Boy, was I wrong.

The staff quickly played a life-sized version of Tetris with the table, shuffling folks around to accommodate a group of our size. Everyone was happy -- especially us!

I think we'll make this part of our regular stops!
