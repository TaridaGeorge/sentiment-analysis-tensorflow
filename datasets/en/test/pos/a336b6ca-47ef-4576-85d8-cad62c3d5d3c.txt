This restaurant was recommended to me by friends that I was visiting in the Scottsdale area. Being from New York makes me a very fussy "Italian Restaurant" patron. I found Uncle Sal's to be one of the absolute best italian restaurants that I have been to. It is right up there with Carmines of NY, Patsy 's of NY. THe food was fabulous, the service was fantastic. It is not pricey at all. If you are looking for good quality great tasting Italian Food with great ambiance, this is the place!!
