Fresh homemade pasta! You can really taste a difference in their sauce and noodles. I was a little concerned going in because of the looks outside, It is in a strip mall and I didn't expect much. Inside was very nice however. The service staff was very friendly and the food was great. The appetizer antipasta platter was the highlight. Fresh meats, peppers, and bruchetta. The canolli's were truly the best I have ever had and they were huge! I think this is now my favorite italian restaurant. The pizza's looked really good and I will be back to try them. My daughter remarked that the capuccino that she had was excellent as well. Portions were good and I had some to bring home.
