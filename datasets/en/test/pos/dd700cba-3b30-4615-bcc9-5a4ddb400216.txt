Simply delicious! Super fresh! Clean! Nice space! Great music selection! Well stocked little Bar! The best part, aside from the really delicious food, was Pia, our server. Here 1 month from Thailand.. Excellent service!!! She only works Fri, Sat Sun. My daughter fell in love with her and the food!! Great new place to add to our weekly line-up! I used a lot of exclamations because it made us feel happy! And we could all use a little more happy in our lives! Thanks SaBai! See you soon!
