Ever had a customer service experience that actually exceeded your expectations?  I had one such experience at Gerber Collision and Glass in Scottsdale.  A guy and I backed into each other in an Albertson's parking lot.  I called my insurance company (Nationwide) and they something called Blue Ribbon shops.  I researched all of the possibilities and settled on Gerber because both Yelp and Angie's List had reviews from customers.  I met Kim for the estimate, and she got me in the following Tuesday.  In short, the experience was great, from the professionalism she showed, to the Enterprise rental car available right there.  My car was washed and vaccuumed at the end of the repair AND they took out a little dent that was near the damaged area as well - no charge.  How rare to be treated so well these days.  Thank you, Gerber!
