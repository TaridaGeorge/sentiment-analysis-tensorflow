A fantastic time.....but to be honest I didn't expect anything less!  Everything was great from the moment I stepped in the door and into Thomas's arms. ;)   

The concept is great and I'm definitely looking forward to the next FEZ Foodies event.  There is no better way to end your weekend then with good food and wine with friends!

Oh, and Erica, you got there too late for the Patron drinks...thats what we warmed up with!
