I went here on a Sunday night after reading all of the good reviews. The night that I went, they were serving a Mrs. White's Golden Rule Cafe menu. For those of you who don't know, Mrs. White's is The Original Soul Food Restaurant in Central Phoenix. She is also the mother of Larry "Lo Lo" White, the owner of LoLo's Chicken and Waffles (currently the best chicken and waffle joint in the USA). With that being said, the food was great, the service was impeccable, and the wine selection was good. Simply put, the guest chef idea is a great one. I can't wait to return; I believe that this will be my Sunday night dinner joint when in town. The Five Stars is for Sunday nights; it is as good as it gets.
