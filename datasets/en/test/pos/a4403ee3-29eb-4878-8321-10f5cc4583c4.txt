I freaking love this place. The food is always awesome, love the buzz, the staff is always hilarious. They can blare all kinds of reggae music, hell even country ( and I hate country quite a bit) and I'd still be there pretty much everyday. I do wish that they would be open later  so after work I could get dinner lol.
