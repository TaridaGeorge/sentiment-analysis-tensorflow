A pricey restaurant, but definitely worth every penny!!!!!!
Best Chilean Sea Bass I've ever had!! 
We started the meal with a lobster bisque which was delicious but rich so it was good to share. They have a unique bread basket which includes a delicious pretzel bread. The cocktails were nicely handcrafted and good to start or finish the meal with. I recommend the blueberry martini :) 
Not only was everything we ordered prepared perfectly the service was also on point. Everyone was friendly and more than willing to make sure we had an excellent dining experience. 
I highly recommend this restaurant just know it is expensive but the quality of the food and service are worth paying for :) :)
