Just returned from sleep inducing dinner at Pappadeaux's. 

In my stomach: half dozen (actually 8) raw oysters, Pontchartrain fillet, and peanut butter cheesecake. 

Service was A+... luckily Justin (our waiter) was a jovial one. 

Will update next time with details. 

My system will have the sweetest sleep tonight.
