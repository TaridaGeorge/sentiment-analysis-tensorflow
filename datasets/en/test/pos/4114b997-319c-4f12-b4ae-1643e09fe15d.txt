Best Gelato in town. Better than any self-serve yogurt place by 100x. This place actually has ever flavor just right and there is no weird chemically taste. I do 1/2 and 1/2 of the dark chocolate and coconut or the Panna Cotta and hazelnut.  I have been known to go  in and buy a few 1/2 gallons for party's since it is THAT good. They let you taste the flavors before you commit to also and the employees are always really friendly.
