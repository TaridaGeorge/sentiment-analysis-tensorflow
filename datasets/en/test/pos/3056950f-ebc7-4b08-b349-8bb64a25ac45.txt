Wow, i came here with my friend for lunch on Saturday. I can hardly wait to go back. All dishes are under 475 calories. I wish i could eat here everyday. The Decor is very nice,dark wood and smells wonderful in there. We had  pizza on flat bread with Roma tomatoes for appetizer. It was so fresh and smelled incredible. We both had fish. I the White Sea Bass and my friend got the Salmon. Both were incredible !  What a wonderful find!!   Our waiter Frank was also wonderful and knew everything about the menu and was very attentive. What more could you ask for. This is my new number one choice.     LOVE LOVE LOVE it!
