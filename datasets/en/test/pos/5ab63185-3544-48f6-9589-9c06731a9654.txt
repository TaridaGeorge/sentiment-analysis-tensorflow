New location and is this ever a place I want to invest in!  Its hard to not order breakfast as it is sooo damn good here but "The Place" now has a very credible dinner menu and next week we are off to give our favorite breakfast joint a try for dinner.

Gorgeous new digs and the same high quality of food and service from some very hot chicks!
