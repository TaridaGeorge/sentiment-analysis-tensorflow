This is perhaps the best meal I've had in Phoenix. We live right around the block and don't come here enough. This is the quintessential neighborhood restaurant. Right in the middle of Coronado Neighborhood. Amazing Food! Amazing Drinks! Amazing Deserts. The design is simple and brilliant. I can't say enough about this place. So happy and proud to live nearby. When we make our list to stick around in Phoenix, Tuck Shop goes on the Pros side.
