I was referred to Dr. Okun by a co-worker and must say I'm glad she referred me! The location is convenient and the office is clean and modern looking. The staff was very helpful and nice. I went in for my regular 6 month cleaning and got to watch The Office while they worked. X-rays were taken fairly quickly and I was out within 30 or so minutes! My previous dentist office was less than subpar so I'm looking forward to coming here in the future!
