Uber yumz fa sho.  Japanese-style Western food!  Last time my gf and I were here, we got the tofu steak and takoyaki (octopus balls) for starters.  The takoyaki came in a set of six and was topped with this oh-so-delicious brown sauce.  We followed that up with a wakame (seaweed) salad and an entree of salmon in cream sauce over pasta (not the exact name. it's on the last page of the menu near the bottom).  OH MAN! SUPER DELICIOUS!  Finished it off with a creme brulee, which surprisingly wasn't too rich.  Oh man, my mouth is watering just thinking of it and it doesn't seem to matter that it's nearly 6am in the morning as I write this.  That alone should be a testament as to how rad the food at Cherry Blossom is.
