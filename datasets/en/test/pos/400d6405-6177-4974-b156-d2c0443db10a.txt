i love this place. the noodles are so delicious! we went for the Cha-su ramen. it was very delicous. i was disappointed the next time we went however. we went a few weeks later. we got there at about 930 pm. it wasnt that late but sadly they ran out of ramen noodles when we tried to order them. i was very disappointed because we drove out from gilbert. so instead of the ramen that night i got the champon noodles. they put a lot of yummy seafood in it. the portions were huge. so i was very happy with this noodle dish. i love this place. the service is very slow however and sometimes the waiters never even come to the table after sitting there waiting for the check.
