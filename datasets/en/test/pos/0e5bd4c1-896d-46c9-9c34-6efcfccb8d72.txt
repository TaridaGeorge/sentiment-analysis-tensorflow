These guys saved Christmas for me.  I ordered a bike for my wife off Amazon, thinking that assembly would be no problem.  Well, after a few frustrating hours in the garage I tossed the bike in my trunk and took it to Bike Emporium.  The bike tech took one look at the front wheel that was giving me so much trouble and immediately deduced that it was a quick-release wheel, and that the quick-release mechanism had not been included in the box, hence my frustration.  

10 minutes and $10 later, and he had the wheel on, had adjusted the brakes, fixed the handlebars (I put them on backwards), and checked the deraileurs.  Very friendly and helpful.  Thanks!
