A great place for vampires!  Huge chandeliers, dim lighting, wood floors, open late and one of the best gnocchi dishes I have had in a long time.  Great service, they split our order when we said we were sharing.  They also have an interesting order form for charcuterie which was really tasty and went well with their different wines by the glass.   Pretty and young people all hanging out late on a Friday night in a classy part of town.
