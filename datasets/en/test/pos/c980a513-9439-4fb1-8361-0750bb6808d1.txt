I love coming here. It is my favorite place for a casual day date. I'm not usually a fan of hefeweizen but they have the best I've tried.  I am personally a big fan of their sunspot gold ale.  They have the tastiest burgers in AZ, my favorite is the one loaded with swiss and mushrooms. The buns are awesome too.  I think the greatest thing they serve has to be the jalape√±o caesar salad. Either ordered as the main dish with chicken, or as a side salad. Yum. Love this place, I am annoyed it took me so long to find it. Never had any issues with service, sometimes a little slow but not bad enough for me to lower the rating.
