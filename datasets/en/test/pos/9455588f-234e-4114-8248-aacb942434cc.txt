Great service & food. We got there before 4pm & got a drink from the bar next door and waited til 5 for restaurant to open.  At 5, they opened and took first 44 people in to sit down. We sat at the counter. Had Spiedini appetizer, caprese salad, house greens, wise guy & marghuerita pizzas. They gave great Italian bread also. Food and service was excellent! If you want the best in fresh pizza, you have to try this- one of the best ever....their reputation is well deserved! Get there early or you will wait a long time......
