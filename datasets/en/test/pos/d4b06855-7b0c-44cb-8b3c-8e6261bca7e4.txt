There are pet sitters who do the job because they want the money, then there's pet sitters who do it because they truly love animals and want to make sure they are ok while you're away.  Andrea fits into that second category.  I've used her in the past multiple times, she has ensured that my cat is given all the love and care I'd give.  She called me daily to let me know how my cat was doing.  When the monsoons hit, she stayed with my cat to make sure she was ok.  She didn't have to take that extra level of care but she did.  She's reliable, friendly and responsive to my requests even if they are outside the scope of what a pet sitter usually does.  Hiring Andrea is a smart decision.
