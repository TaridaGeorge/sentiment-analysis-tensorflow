The food, ambiance, and service here are phenomenal.  The 4-course tasting was unique and divine in it's flavors, and beautifully presented.  The portions were generous but not excessive, and each dish was truly memorable.  ShinBay holds it's own to other fantastic meals I've had at excellent Japanese restaurants around the country including Urasawa in Beverly Hills, and Nobu in Honolulu, Miami, Vegas, and NYC.  This is not a large restaurant - so make a reservation for sure if you're in the area!
