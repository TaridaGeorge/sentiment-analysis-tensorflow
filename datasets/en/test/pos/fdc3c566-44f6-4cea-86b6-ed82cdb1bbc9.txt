Andrew Klein is our financial advisor at Edward Jones, and we are very happy with his services.  My wife and I did plenty of research, and asked for several word-of-mouth testimonials from our friends and family, and no one came as highly recommended as Andrew did.  He is friendly, helpful, thorough, and trustworthy, even in these challenging economic times.

When we first called Andrew on a Tuesday to schedule an appointment to meet with him, he offered to meet with us as early as the following day.  On the day of our meeting, he was available right at the time we scheduled, and spent a great deal of time with us, asking questions, learning about our investment goals, and giving us great advice.

I look forward to working with Andrew more, and reaching our goals with Edward Jones.
