After my last experience, I'd vowed not to shop here again...so glad I changed my mind!!  My experience last week was one of the best I've ever had in any retail arena.  As soon as we walked in, the associates were welcoming, helpful, and very, very warm and helpful. We exchanged a handbag that was just too large for me, and the rep (can't remember her name, sorry!  Very pretty lady with long blondish-brown hair and a super personality!) was just the best in helping me find other things to replace the bag.  We ended up with a transformer necklace that I just love, a ring  and necklace that are just perfect.  Thank you, Brighton, for giving me the 100% perfect experience I am used to receiving, and for a staff that really "gets it" and cares!  Love you guys!!!!
