Read a couple reviews where the best the guys could do is pick on the owner because they could read the menu and left the house without $5 dollars. 

Owner has to stand on his feet in front of a hot grill everyday so you should try that and selling something for several dollars and see how you are.

Have cash, know what you want and be happy because its a great little place.

Burgers and hot dogs are awesome. 

Brown bag special cant be beat.
