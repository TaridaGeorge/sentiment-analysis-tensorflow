I found Gab's several years ago, after working with a few of those repair shops that give auto repair a bad name. Gab did right by me the first time, and has done right be me and our three vehicles ever since. As someone else said they are as honest as it gets, they do great work and charge a fair price. I won't take my cars anywhere else.
