Their espresso is absolutely the best. Every single barista that's made my latte has foamed the soy perfectly. Small, thick, creamy bubbles. I used to slang coffee, and I know. Small, thick, creamy soy bubbles. Most places don't steam it correctly, but Cartel? They're consistent and quite friendly. 

Usually they've got a pretty decent selection of tunes going, and I'm happy they're not afraid to play it loud.
