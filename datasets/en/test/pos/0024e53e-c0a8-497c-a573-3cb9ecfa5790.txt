Sick, need the best chicken noodle soup that Mom didn't make?  Come to Jason's! Plentiful moist chicken, plump egg noodles and perfect broth are available everyday for $4 something a bowl. Sick or not I'll drive to pick up a bowl to-go!

My favorite sandwich is the pastrami & turkey on an onion roll, called  "Bird to the wise". Lots of pastrami and just a touch of turkey make you feel better about this indulgence.  

Large fresh salad bar, frozen yogurt and bottomless soda machine are just the bonuses. 
Happy eating!
