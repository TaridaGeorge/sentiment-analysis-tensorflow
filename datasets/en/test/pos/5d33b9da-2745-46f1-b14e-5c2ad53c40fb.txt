This place is fantastic if you have children, and great even if you don't.

I remember going there as a child myself, riding the rails, enjoying the play areas.

There is a carousel, a couple snack bars, model railroads to view, several miniature trains to ride, plenty of picnic tables and benches, and a huge expanse of grass on which to run and play.

Great park!
