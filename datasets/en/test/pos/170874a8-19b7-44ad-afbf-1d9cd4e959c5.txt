Absolutely love the guys and the station. Everyone from the 'corporate' to the promotions team, are awesome and make every event an adventure. 

As for the location, it's a lil nestled away in the Guadalupe area. So the building may throw you off. Everyone here is a a lot of fun and sincerely some of the nicest people you will meet!
