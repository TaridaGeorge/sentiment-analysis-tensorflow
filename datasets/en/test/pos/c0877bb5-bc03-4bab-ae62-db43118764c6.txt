I have absolutely fallen head-over-heels in love with Hula's for so many reasons! Let's just go over a few:

-The amazing tofu tacos
-The "I'm-gonna-fuck-you-up" Scorpion Bowl (they light the 151 on fire!)
-The kick ass happy hour
-Outdoor seating with misters
-Sweet potato fries

This is a really laid back environment with a lot of options for veggies AND vegans, and they have really awesome drinks. Do yourself the favor and head here with a group of friends and split the scorpion bowl. You can thank me later, just be prepared to call yourself a DD.
