If you're looking for the Chinese Cheers, you've found it!  Great Chinese food (quiet on one side, sports bar on other,)  burgers too if you're not a fan of Asian cuisine, wi-fi, and great service, it's all here.  

Lunch specials, happy hour food (mongolian beef tacos, sliders, chicken satay++,) beer on tap (Guinness, Sierra Nevada++), mojitos (Cherry is great!)

Owner, Kuei (pronounced Kway and former owner of popular Chez Song that was in this same location 17+ years ago) greets everyone and he, manager Simon and the staff never forget a name.

Locally owned and great all-around neighborhood joint!
