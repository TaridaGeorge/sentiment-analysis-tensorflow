I first spent money here when I found myself stranded downtown on a Friday night. "How late are you open on the weekends?" I asked, "24 hours", the energetic and gregarious pixie behind the counter proclaimed with great pride.  It has been a love affair ever since.

Good coffee, great crepes(and I grew up on a crepe farm, I know), and an atmosphere that could be described as "Twisted...but in a good way."

My only word of caution would be to keep in mind that this place is a loud party, all of the time, so if you are easily distracted by music and well styled bohemians, then you may want to stick to the library to write your blogs or do your homework.
