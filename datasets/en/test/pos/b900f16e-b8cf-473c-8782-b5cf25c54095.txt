Great place! Recently moved to the neighborhood and tried a couple of places and by far this is my favorite. Nice staff, very clean shop. Last Sunday I showed up after 4:30 not realizing until well after Mikey was giving me a great pedi, that they closed at 4! I apologized and Mikey was  wonderful and happy to stay late to give me a pedi & mani! I really appreciated his demeanor and friendliness. I have found my new spot for mani/pedis and brow waxing! Reasonable price too!
