Tomatoes may be Scottsdale Fashion Square's best kept secret. Tucked away from the food court, Tomatoes is your best option for a great lunch or dinner in between shopping.  The menu includes pasta, salads, burgers and sandwiches.  I always get the vegetarian sandwich and it's delicious.  
Be sure to get the fries...I agree with Rhonda- they're seriously the best you can get anywhere. 
Your meal will probably cost anywhere from $7-9 including a drink, but it will be worth it.
