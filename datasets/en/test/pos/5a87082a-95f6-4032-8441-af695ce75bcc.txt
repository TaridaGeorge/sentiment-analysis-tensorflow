This place is awesome! I have been here about 5 times within about a month, and every time I have been impressed with my meal. The first time I came was for lunch, and I had the Natie Bomb. The combination of turkey and bacon, balanced out by tart-ish apple was amazing. 
On my next visit I came for breakfast, which is by far my favorite meal to eat. This time I got the Santa Fe Sautee, and my wife got the Banana's Foster French. Both meals were absolutely amazing. The coffee is great as well. 

Overall NCounter is a great place to stop by for breakfast or lunch. With delicious food and surprisingly reasonable prices, it adds a great option to the sparse Tempe breakfast scene.
