We've lived in AZ for over a year now and TWCG is one of our most frequented restaurants. I don't think we've ever had anything bad there. The roasted chicken is unbeatable. Over Thanksgiving they had the best pumpkin pie I've ever tasted. They have plenty of service and everyone is always nice. Its a little dark so its more of an intimate feel. Definitely recommend this place!
