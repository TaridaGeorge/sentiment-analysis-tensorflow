This place rocks! 

On vacation, I got lucky enough to eat here several times with one of my best friends. I learnerd that there is a new owner/manager, (a greek god) who is making this place fun and exciting, while giving excellent customer service.

Every dish was an awesome, mouth watering creation. The prices were great, and the drinks were perfect.

I will be eating here everytime I go to Scottsdale!
