This place is great, especially if you're looking for a fun sit down restaurant. The pasta looked great but we opted for pizza. The thin crust pizza was tasty and so was the stuffed artichoke appetizer but the kicker was the peanut butter pizookie dessert. It was freaking awesome!! The service is great and very friendly and we really enjoyed the atmosphere.
