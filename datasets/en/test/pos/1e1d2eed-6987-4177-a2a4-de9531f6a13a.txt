We were visiting Arizona from CA and wanted to have the highest rated yelp restaurant in Tempe!  Cornish Pasty came up and it did not fall short of its reputation!  It's just heavenly!  The staff is extremely friendly and the food is incomparable!  I got the Pesto Chicken and it was so scrumptious!  The pocket was the right temperature and tenderness, and the filling was juicy.  My husband tried the Salmon with all the rave reviews on yelp, and it was so tasty!  The salad was fresh-loved the olives and cherry tomatoes.  The wait, however, was a bit long (maybe b/c the smell was too good so it felt really long to us.)  Highly recommended!
