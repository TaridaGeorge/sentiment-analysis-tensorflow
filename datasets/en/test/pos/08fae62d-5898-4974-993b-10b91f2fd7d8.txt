Delicious.  Attentive and courteous service, quaint location, and did I mention - delicious???  Thus far I've only been here for a Javelina Leap wine dinner, and normally I'd reserve judgement until I'd had a meal or two off the menu.  In this the deliciousness factor wins out and I'm going with 5 stars.  The dishes here are a perfect example of completely unexpected combinations of ingredients blending harmoniously to achieve...well... deliciousness.
