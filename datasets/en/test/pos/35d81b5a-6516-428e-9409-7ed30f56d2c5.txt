I've been a loyal R.E.I. customer for years. I've shopped at several different stores across the country and consistently had the same positive experience. They've got the highest quality gear for hiking / biking / camping / rock climbing and more. They've got knowledgeable and helpful employees. They've got customer friendly policies. And yes, they've also got higher prices - but here you actually get what you pay for. Last but not least, they've got a sweet membership program, which for a one-time fee (currently $20) gets you special offers, rental discounts and an annual dividend equal to 10% of your purchases.
