I have been to this place 3 times and each time it has been just great.  Great pizza - I've had the same pizza each time; the Lucky Special, and I tell, it just can't get much better.  Great sauce, great crust and the toppings are thick and tasty.  

I have recommended this place to all my friends and to a lot of people that I meet from out of town.  (I am in the travel business so I see a lot of out of town visitors).
