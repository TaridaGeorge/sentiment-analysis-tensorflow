My wife loves this store. She stops by a couple of times a week after work to check out what's new. She goes there so much that she's on a first name basis with the Manager and most of the cashiers.

I have been there many times as well. They have men's and women's clothing, shoes and home nick-nacks and other miscellaneous items.

It sure beats going to the Macy's of the world. Why pay $40 bucks for an outfit when you can pay $8 at Ross for a comparable item. Ross buys merchandise later in the merchandising season in order to capitalize on manufacturer close out sales so they could sell the item for less than a typical retailer.
