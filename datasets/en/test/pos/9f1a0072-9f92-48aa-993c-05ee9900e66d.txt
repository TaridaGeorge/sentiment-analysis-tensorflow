I've become a huge fan of Baiz Market, as hinted at in my review of its restaurant, Al-Hana.  For me, the major draw to Baiz itself is the bakery.  The desserts are amazing, particularly the pistachio baklava priced by the pound.

Drinks, chocolates, rice, pitas...   Really, Baiz has everything you could need.  The produce and cheeses are fresh, and I'm always tempted to pick up something at the butcher counter.  It's delicious, cheap, and you can shop while you wait for your meal at Al-Hana.  I'm most definitely a fan.  Warning: Cash only if your purchase is under $10.
