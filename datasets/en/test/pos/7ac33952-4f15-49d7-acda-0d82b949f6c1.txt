Was looking for a place to have lunch on Yelp last week and found the Crepe Bar!

This place is fantastic! Sweet and Savory Crepes!? Unbelievable! I think the price is just right, because it is a specialty dish so I don't have any problem paying the $7 for an amazing crepe. The First Time dessert crepe is to die for, as well as the Chicken Griddle.

Be sure to try one of the Grown Up Sodas they have in the fridge. I spoke to the owner about them and he just got them and they are fantastic! (And I'm not really a soda kinda guy)

I thoroughly recommend this place to anyone, I just found it last week and have already been there twice since and have recommended it to everyone I know!
