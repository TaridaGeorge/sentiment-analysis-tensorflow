I still can't believe how much food you get for the price and how quick the service is. After moving from Chicago, I never realized how hard it would be to get GOOD Chinese food in other places, 'til I found Hot Wok. It's a little rough around the edges and the guy who usually answers the phone is ridiculously mumbled and rather deadpan, but the quality of the food and the price makes up for it!
