A great place my wife and her friends alerted me to. Tucked away in a market, this place services excellent middle eastern food.  

I order the gyro platter.The plate is huge and comes with a huge salad, large amount of rice and gyro meat.  I couldn't get enough of the rice. This is my second favorite rice after Moby Dick (east cost) My only complaint is you receive only a small ll piece of flat bread to go with the meal.

I also appreciate the large water glass and not a small glass that requires several refills over the course of a meal.

Payment is done at the market register.

You receive excellent value for what you pay for. A meal for two will cost about $15 (or less) 

I will be going back to this place again and again!
