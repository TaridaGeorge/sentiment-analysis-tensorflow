I've always like Fry's and this location ranks right up there with the rest.

It's not the same as the Grayhawk location, but this one has a smaller population to draw from so it makes sense.

The fruits and vegetables are always fresh and as usual with Fry's they have a GREAT selection along with competitive pricing.

What more could you want from a grocery store?
