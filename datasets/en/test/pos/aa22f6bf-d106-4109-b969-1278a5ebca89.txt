Thanks Yelppers for recommending Postino!  Came here for a lunch date with the hubby on Saturday and it couldn't have been better.  We sat at the outside bar, sun shining, misters cooling us off...enjoying the $5 wine/beer before 5pm options to the fullest.  The vibe is relaxed, it's hip but not pretentious, the space is a good size, patio is lovely, the wait staff was friendly.  

I knew the bruschetta were a must so we ordered 4 and they sliced each in four so we can share.    They were hearty, BIG, and loaded with yummy goodness.   They do not skimp on the toppings!!!    Did we like the BLT?  YES!  Prosciutto and figs?  YES!  Artichoke spread?  YES!  Salmon and capers?  YES!    

We live on the other side of the valley but we'd happily travel 40 minutes just to eat hear again...and again...and again....
