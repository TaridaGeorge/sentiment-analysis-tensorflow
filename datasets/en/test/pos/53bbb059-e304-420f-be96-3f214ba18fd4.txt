I love this restaurant!!! First off I always appreciate a great dive joint but to top that, the food is incredible and very reasonable in price. Now I'm no expert in Vietnamese food but considering the place is always packed with Vietnamese people I have to believe that's a good sign. 

If you're feeling adventurous I highly recommend coming here.
