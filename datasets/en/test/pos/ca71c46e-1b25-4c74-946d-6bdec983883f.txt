Hell. Yes. Lobbys beefy beef burgers are uh-may-ziiiiiiiing.

The burgers are on the same pricepoint as luxurious, sitdown optional fastfood burger meal joints like Five Guys, but way better, imo, and Lobbys always has lovable service with a smile.

Lobbys fries are great too, and the chili cheese fries actually got my husband to cry uncle. That is some serious caliber of man-food right there.  

Friendly staff, really chill place, great spot to watch sports and consume the flesh of domesticated beasts. What more could there be in life?
