Super friendly, owner-operated place.  Just getting started but seems to be going strong.

Excellent grooming. Outstanding selection of dog food, almost all of which is grain-free/premium, and well - priced.

Nice outdoor play area out back, too.  They offer day-care, or even an outdoor play add-on after a grooming session.

Highly recommended.  We'll be back!
