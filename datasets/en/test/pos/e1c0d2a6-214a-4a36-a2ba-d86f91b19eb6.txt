I come to Phoenix once a month for business.  Every time I am in town I MUST stop by and get my sushi fix... Ok, the sake bombers aren't bad either.  The sushi chefs are personable, the food is FAB, the atmosphere is good.  I have never been disappointed when coming here and their prices are very reasonable as well.
