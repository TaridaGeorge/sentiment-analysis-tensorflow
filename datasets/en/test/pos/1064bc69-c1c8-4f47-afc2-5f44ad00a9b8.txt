Luv, Luhv, LOVE their Whole Hog platter.  It's always enough to feed my family.  2 types of ribs, 2 meats, and 3 sides.  The service is always friendly, though my server out in the patio wasn't as good as the other servers I've had there before.  I'll eventually have to go back there again and try some of their other offerings.  Great BBQ!
