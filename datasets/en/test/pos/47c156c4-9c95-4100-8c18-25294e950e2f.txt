The Arrogant Butcher is a great place to visit as long as there is nothing else going on in the area.   The night before my visit was an 1 1/2 hour wait.   Tonight I got in with no problem and the service was excellent.  

For an appetizer I had the Pretzel Fondue which was excellent.  My only complaint was that I had only eaten two bites and my entree was at the table.  It worked out well though because the bites needed to cool down so they became dessert.   

I had the meatloaf special which sounds weird at a place like this, but it was excellent.   The meat loaf tasted great and the green beans were steamed just right with a little bit of seasoning.  

I recommend that if you do go here that you save room for dessert.  I missed out on a few things that sounded great.
