I come to Cap'n Bills a couple times a week. I think the quality is better than the big chain sub shops and the price is better. I usually get a 5" sub for just over $3! I love this place! If you read the other reviews you know it's a unique place with bumper stickers, pictures and stuff everywhere. I like that I see something new every time I visit. I can also come in and order my "usual" now so it makes the experience that much better! Thank you Cap'n Bill and crew for the awesome food and service!!
