My new favorite lunch spot! fast, clean, friendly. Everything I've ordered from the menu has been pretty tasty. I personally like their Arizona bowl, which is like a giant California roll -- bowl style. Lots of avocado included too :) 

Sometimes the food can take a while to get to you. I've noticed that when you order a roll, sometimes it's the first thing that gets to your table, other times it's the last, when you've already devoured most of your other food (sometimes I'll get 1/2 a roll with a small bowl). But I only get a 30 min lunch and I'm always back in the office on time.

Being from Los Angeles, I haven't run into too many reasonably priced little Japanese restaurants (as opposed to the high priced fancy fusion places) that serve yaki soba and udon so I'm very happy to have found this place.
