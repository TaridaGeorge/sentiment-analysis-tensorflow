This place is located right around the corner from my fabulous apartment.  I like this place for a few reasons.  First, it has really cheap gas!  They also have free air for your tires!  The parking lot/gas area is nice and big, so you can easily manuver your vehicle around without to many worries.

The inside and outside of this place is nice and clean, comparatively speaking.  The place is well lit, and carries a nice variety of drinks, snacks, and the staff here is CLEAN and friendly also.  I think QT does a great job of keeping this place clean, and the staff is great here.
