I stumbled across Yen Sushi about a 1 1/2 years ago and it's one of my favorite places. The first time I went I wanted to just get takeout and I did over order but it was AMAZING! The second time I actually ate at the sushi bar and Paul is awesome! Service is top notch and so is the sushi. This places is great for lunch, dinner or even takeout. I would go there several times a week but now I'm down to at least once to get my sushi fix. 

You won't go wrong with ANY dish you have at Yen Sushi. 

AMAZING!!!!
