It has been about 3 years since I last visited and it took me this long and a few people to say good things about them before I could return. My last visit was reminiscent of cheaply made sushi and bland food. The green tea fried ice cream was terrible.

Just last Sunday I had a wonderful experience and the place was nearly packed to full capacity. The happy hour had a few great items and they also have specials that are written on the boards. The atmosphere was cozy and relaxing. 
Dont miss the surf sushi or the lollipop. I'll be returning next week to enjoy other interesting sounding items like pork and ahi sliders.
