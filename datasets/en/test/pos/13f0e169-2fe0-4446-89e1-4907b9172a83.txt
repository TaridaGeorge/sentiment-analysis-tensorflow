For our wedding anniversary, we wanted to go to a nice decent restaurant. First thought was Houston's, but my husband's work schedule gets him home a little late. Fortunately I knew Hillstone has the same Hawaiian steak, my hubby's favorite,  plus they were also open later than Houston's. Service was delightful and our server, without mentioning it beforehand, brought out a little dish of some kind of garlicky buttermilk spread. She said it goes well with our cheesy toast appetizer, which it deliciously did! It was also good with my hubby's steak. I had the Thai noodle mango salad with steak, also like Houston's. Simply delicious!
