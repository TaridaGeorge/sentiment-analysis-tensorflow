I love coming here with coworkers for happy hour. The bruschetta is amazing in all flavors and very vegetarian friendly.
The wine and beer selection is substantial- there is something for everyone's pallate. The veggie sandwich is full of mushrooms, so if you're not a fan, better order something else.
The atmosphere is laid back and relaxing after a long day at work.
