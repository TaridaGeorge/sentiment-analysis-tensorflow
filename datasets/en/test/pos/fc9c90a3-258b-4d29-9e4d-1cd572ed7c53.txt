Yippie! I'm not a coffee drinker but I do down a gallon or so of tea a day. Today, Tara made me an iced black tea. It's nice to see the tea actually being made in front of your eyes rather than getting blended or straight from yesterday's pitcher. I give Jobot 5 stars for making a good drink, cleanliness, and hospitality. Piss on Starbucks.
