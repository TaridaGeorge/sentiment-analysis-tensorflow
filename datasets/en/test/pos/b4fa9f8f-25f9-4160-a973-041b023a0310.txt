Probably my favorite restaurant in all of Arizona. The food is fantastic (I recommend the Cajun Chicken pasty), the servers are really hip and awesome, the kitchen is open for you to see how your food is being made, and the prices are fair. Don't be discouraged if you realize they make the pasties the night before, because they cook them the day of and give you the option to take them home half cooked if you want to eat them at home and cook them yourself. Just such a awesome atmosphere for small groups or a date and really good food with a very nice beer list.
