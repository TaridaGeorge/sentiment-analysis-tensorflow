We went to the Adult Education event last night and had a fabulous time. The staff were friendly and super helpful and helped us make arrangements for the end of the evening when we knew we wouldn't be driving home. Unfortunately the nearby hotels were booked but we were able to take advantage of a DD service. The event was planned down to every detail, we just had so much fun. My favorite part of the event was taking a ride on the tequila bus! This was actually an educational/social experience and at the end we all earned our diplomas. I definitely want to go back again... After this hangover.
