Great food, variety of choices on their menu, reasonable wine list and excellent service, at least in the bar.  I have never eaten in the main part of the restaurant.

Their veal is always primo and their chicken parmigiana is the best in town.

Having come here from New York, I was very happy to find an Italian restaurant that makes me feel at home.
