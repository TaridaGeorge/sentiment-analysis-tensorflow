NY'ers Get in your car and head here as fast as you can. Chinese is my ultimate fave food. I tried this place after hearing about it 4 years ago and haven't stopped going since. Yes its a hike from Arcadia, but who cares. Order the peking duck, egg-rolls and whatever else looks good to you. I eat here most Valentine's and Xmas. PEKING DUCK i love you! owner is cool as hell too. make a reservation b/c this place is packed whenever you go.
