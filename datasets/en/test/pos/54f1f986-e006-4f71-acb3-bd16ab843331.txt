Love, Love, Love this place!  I can't think of sending my children anywhere else!  I know my kids are in good hands when I drop them off, and I know they had a good time when they talk about going to "school."  Cher (the head person) has been there forever and loves all the children.

I can't say enough good things about this place!  Please ask if you have something specific.
