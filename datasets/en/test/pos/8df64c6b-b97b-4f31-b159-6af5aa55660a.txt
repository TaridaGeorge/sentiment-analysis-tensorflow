WHOA!! What a cultural shock walking in from the totally common parking lot inside this shrine.  The smell instantly hits you and the taste buds start salivating.   I go at lunch time for the buffet and always walk out wishing I had worn elastic.  Everything is very good and it's fun mixing it all up.  The staff is quick with the nan and refills.  The 1st clue that this place rocks?  Loaded with Indians.  I also have to admit that I like entire meals without utensils.  Ya, I'm ready again
