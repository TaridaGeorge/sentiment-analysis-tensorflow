The food at this Pita Jungle is as fantastic as any of the others. But there's a big difference between this one and others I've visited. The atmosphere. 

Most Pita Jungles tend to have a more bohemian look. Very artsy, but not very chic. The Desert Ridge Pita Jungle instead goes for a very contemporary look. As my girlfriend puts it, this is the "yuppy" Pita Jungle. There's a bar with big screens above it playing sports in HD. The lights and decorations all look like they are at a chic new hot spot. But the food is just as wonderful, and gets to your table just as quickly as all the others.  And there's absolutely nothing wrong with that!
