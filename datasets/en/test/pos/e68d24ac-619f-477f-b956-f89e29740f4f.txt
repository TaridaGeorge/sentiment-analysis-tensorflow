Very much enjoyed my experience at Cheese 'n Stuff.

My first visit to Phoenix, on the road with my band, I decided to explore downtown. I had a hankering for a sandwich, so I summoned the iPhone and searched Yelp! for "sandwich" and Cheese 'n Stuff was a mere .2 miles from where I was standing (across the street).

The service was very friendly and attentive and the sandwich was by leaps and bounds the best sandwich I've yet to feast on...

I will be returning!
