I have been going here since they opened. The owners are a Husband and Wife team and are always there when I go. Friendly and Helpful Staff. Recently they have added Cherry Smoothies which are very good. Fresh ingredients, consistence in quality and friendly owners, make this my number one spot for smoothies. SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL MOM AND POP ESTABLISHMENTS !  You will NOT be disappointed!
