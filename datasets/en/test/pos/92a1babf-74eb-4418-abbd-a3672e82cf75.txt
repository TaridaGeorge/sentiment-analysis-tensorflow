Blueberry pancakes. Sausage patties. Hashbrown casserole. Iced tea. Scrumpdiddlyumptiousness. Sometimes I wish the wait was longer, so I could enjoy browsing the store longer! It's not the place for a cheap breakfast, but it is definitely worth it. Service is averagely good and friendly, but on occasion a little slow, understandably when they are busy. And every once in a while, my pancakes are kinda raw in the middle, probably due to the blueberry overload, so I just eat around it. No biggie and nothing to knock a star for.
