This place is great to get any nail service!! I like how big and spacious the area is and how they get customers in and out. You barely have to wait and thats if you have to wait at all. There's a menu of services for pedicures, which gives you a selection. So you dont get stuck with just the normal pedicure and they take their time as well. You get your money's worth!! Pricing is average. Go for a mani and pedi to give it a go!! : )
