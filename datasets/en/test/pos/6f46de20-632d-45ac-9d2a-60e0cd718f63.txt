I think this is a great little off the way place. Haven't had much luck in finding great Asian food in Arizona, but this place is definitely one of the best places that I've had. I enjoy eating Panang with duck and their Fish (Thai style). The amount of spice is great and spicy enough for me (I didn't realize that it was a Level 1 spice...then I thought how weak I was). I was shocked, but oh-so-good! I try to go every month and more so if I can and I've never left the place without ordering Panang. The price and amount of food you get is decent. I would without-a-doubt recommend this place to anyone. The workers are nice.
