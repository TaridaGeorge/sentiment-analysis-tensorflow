Welcome to the Royale!  An awesome new theater that just opened in downtown Mesa.

A bunch of us went here tonight for their opening night of Hobo With A Shotgun and had a great time.  With the weather being a billion degrees, The Royale did a great job at keeping the movie watches nice and cool.

Great staff on hand and they had a nice variety of drinks and snacks from those retro days.

Can't wait to go back!
