Love Chick-Fil-A

After I had my baby last fall the hospital brought in some disgusting excuse for food. 

I delivered at CRH right down the street from Chick-Fil-A and asked my husband to please go get me a chicken sandwich. 

I have been to Chick-Fil-A lots of times and it is always good, but let me tell you folks, it tastes about a bajillion time better if you have just delivered a 9 pound baby!

I love how everyone at this location is SO polite. Whenever you say thank you they respond, "My pleasure."

I keep it simple. I like the plain chicken sandwich with pickles, waffle fries, and a diet Dr. Pepper. 

A total favorite!
