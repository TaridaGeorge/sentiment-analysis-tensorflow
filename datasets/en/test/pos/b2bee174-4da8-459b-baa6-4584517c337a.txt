So, I am giving this Zipps 5 stars, because have become regulars here and even though we now live 20 minutes away, we still try to make it over here as often as possible.  Joey, the manager, is awesome and always says "Hi".  We know several servers and the bartenders.  Everyone has been super nice and friendly.  The food is always amazing, especially the golden-menium wings, cookie skillet and of course the monaco foccacia.  They have a pool table, 2 dartboards, and 2 golden tee games (my husband is a fan).  During NFL season, they open an hour earlier and serve breakfast.  My husband and I had our first date here and this is also where we had our rehearsal dinner.  It is amazing.
