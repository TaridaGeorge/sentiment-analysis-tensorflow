What exactly they put in their food that makes me love this place so much, I will never understand. It's simple, it's quick, it's yummy, and it's the same at every one of their locations. The people are nice, the place is clean and they have lots of locations. The portions are not giant, but more than you need at one meal. Prices are reasonable and everything is fresh.
