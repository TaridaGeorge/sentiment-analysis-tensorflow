I just moved to Arizona and have been looking for a good place to get my nails done, every other place I've been to was nothing special. I had driven by this place an thought I'd try it out. I had an amazing experience. When I sat down to get my pedicure I women started massaging my neck and arms! The pedicure was long an good and I had only purchased the cheapest one. I also got a gel manicure that was very affordable! I will definitely be coming back on a regular bases!
