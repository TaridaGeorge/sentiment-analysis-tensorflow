Wow, better than I expected.  Don't let the tacky fluorescent writing all over the front windows deter you, or the fact that it's in an aging strip mall.

Modestly decorated inside. Quick attentive staff.  I only had the green curry and it was a big portion and just spicy enough.  Lunches come with either soup or salad, which is just iceberg a few carrots and a drizzle of dressing. Simple but good.  Also included is a small egg roll which was darn good.

I had a yummy Thai coffee which was $1.95 and came in a really big glass. 

I give this place five stars because they don't suck. I've been to the Subway next door about a thousand times and most of the time they do suck. No more Subway for me.
