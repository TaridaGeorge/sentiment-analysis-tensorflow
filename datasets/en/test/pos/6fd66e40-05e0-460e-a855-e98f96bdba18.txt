I recently dined here at the Paradise Valley Chili's location and was so pleasantly surprised by my entire dining experience! It looked to me like there was a new updated look to the entire restaurant.  (I had been there last year) My husband and I stayed for over an hour and the flavorful food came out to us hot and quickly!  I think our server's name was Melissa. Cute smile and very friendly! We will definitely make this our regular stop now, especially after shopping at the mall. Not just because of the food and decor and service, but it was extremely clean, and that's important to me. Thanks Chili's. See you soon!
