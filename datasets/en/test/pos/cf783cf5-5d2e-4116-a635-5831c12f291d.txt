Heard about this restaurant from a friend and I was amaze by the food and their friendly service. I tried the chicken adobo and it was amazing! The chicken came apart with no effort and it had a great honey glazed taste. The portions were a good amount for their low prices. I couldn't  get enough of their amazing dessert!
