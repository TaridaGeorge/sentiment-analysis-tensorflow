I was very pleasantly surprised with this place. I'm not from Phoenix and after looking very hard for somewhere fun, good and non-Mexican to go to, my friends and I finally found this cool spot. On top of being super cute, the food was very good and the drinks were (as our waiter called them) liquid deliciousness! It is too bad I don't live in Phoenix because I would definitely be a regular at this place. If you're going here for the first time you have to try their cucumber drink (I'm not sure of the name of it but it was something like chu-cumber). Its got muddled cucumber and some oriental alcohol but the harmonious balance between the cucumber, ginger and alcohol is perfect. All drinks are $9 or $10 bucks so getting drunk here can get pretty expensive.
