This is a wonderful church in central Phoenix.  Pastor Dan Yeary is so kind and caring and has a story telling type of preaching so it's easy to understand.  It is Biblically based.  Even though, it's a large church there is something for everyone and every age.  There are so many small group Bible studies available.  People are friendly and they even have greeters in purple vests in the parking lot to assist you.  Sunday Bible studies are at 9 am and church begins at 10:30 in the main sanctuary.  All are welcome!
