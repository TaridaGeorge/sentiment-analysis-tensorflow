Southwest just kicks ass.  They always have amazingly cheap flight specials, are on time, and their crew rocks.  Any airline that will let their flight attendants sing the destination over the loudspeaker is ok with me.  Plus, they're not subscribing to this ridiculous fee-for-bags thing that everyone else is doing.  I can't really ask for much more in an airline.
