Turns out, my aura is mostly purple, with some yellow mixed in and a bright red orb in my sexy area....I know this because I have had my aura photo taken here twice. If anyone knows what this means i would be interested to find out if you think it matched my sparkling me-ness.

This place has spiritual books, sage, athames, angel stuff, t-shirts...It's like the gift shop to a non-biased heaven. It is a good spot for any budding spiritualist to get a start and the experienced to get supplies.

I love the aura photos obviously, and they also have tarot readings and chakra alignment classes and whatnot. Plenty of really cool stuff to keep ya in the light...whatever your light may be.
