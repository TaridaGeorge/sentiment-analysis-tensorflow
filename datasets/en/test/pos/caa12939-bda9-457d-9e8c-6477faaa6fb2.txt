The burgers are great here, but I really come for the atmosphere. I appreciate that Corbin's built from the ground up in my neighborhood and gave us a restaurant with real style - modern, sleek and yet comfortable.

Here's a tip: If you like pickled cauliflower, ask if they'll give you just a little more. It's delicious.
