I came here with three of my friends for lunch on a Saturday. Thankfully, the place was not busy which was shocking. This is a very cozy and romantic feeling restaurant. 

Whatever you do, please try the sweet potato chips. They are amazing! 

We chose sandwhiches with a side of salad and everything was very good.

Service I doubt could be beat. This is a place you can go on a date, bring grandma or take a group of friends to!
