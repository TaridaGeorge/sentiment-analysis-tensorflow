Love Sam's Gyros! Gyros are delicious, fries are perfect. Keeps you full but longing for more! =]

This place has had an extreme makeover restaurant edition! It's SO CLEAN! The colors are inviting and the furniture looks great! I love the open space and you do not feel overwhelmed with the clutter of images anymore! The owner, Matt, was super nice and hospitable! He has really done an amazing job revamping the restaurant and giving it a young, inviting feel!

I would eat here every day if I could =]
Thanks for the wonderful food and great service!
Can't wait to see the pictures of the remodel up on Yelp!
See you soon... Definitely!
