Casey Moore's and I have a complicated relationship.  I don't think there's a better place within 400 miles to grab a drink with friends, yet there are times when I just absolutely refuse to go here.  You see, if I go once, I'll likely have such a good time that I'll want to go again tomorrow.  This cycle will continue and, being a person who thrives on variety, I'll totally get sick of the patio, the (always interesting) crowds, and the food.  I don't want that to happen, so I'll just ration my visits out accordingly.

Casey Moore's is a college bar in the best sense of the term.  When I'm 40, I'll come here and not feel weird about it at all.  If you ask me, that is what  a great establishment is all about.
