Raquel, I'm sorry that you feel this way  but I have had an awesome experience at The Pink Zebra!  The owner was so pleasant, very patient with my two small children, and the store has fabulous finds!  I will definitely go back time and time again!!! I am so glad to see some lovely shops filling Old Town Gilbert.
