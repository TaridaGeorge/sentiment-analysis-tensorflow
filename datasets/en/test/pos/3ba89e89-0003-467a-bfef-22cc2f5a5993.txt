Maize's is Amazing! I nice little quaint spot for the locals! I would love to say more about the menu but me and BFF can only bring ourselves to order the Buffalo Chicken Dip! Even when we say we are gonna order an entree'! Buffalo dip wins every time! I get goose bumps just thinking about how good it is! But let me tell ya, the dishes I see them bring out to other patrons smell delightful! And the portions look enough for two for sure! Prices are really decent! I also love their version of Sangria! And the coffee is so flavorlicious that its an insult to put in creamer!  

If you haven't gone before, check it out! The ambience is fitting! The staff service is fabulous! They are so laid back and easy going! They just love me there! :) And I love them too! hahahaha!
