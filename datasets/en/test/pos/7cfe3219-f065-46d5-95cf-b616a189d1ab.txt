For a long time I kept calling it Exchanging Hands, I guess cause it rolls off my lips with greater ease.  Anyway, I love walking through this little hubbub, it's like a "welcome home" party every time, only without the fanfare. And I always leave with a deep-sitted feeling of regret in my belly.  It's the feeling that I didn't get to see and touch everything.  You wanna look at everything but you don't have all the time in the world to do it. But for a brief moment time does seem to seize while you are browsing around. Yeh, it's that kind of a place.

FYI: When it's your birthday month make sure to mention it at the cash register and you'll get $10 of your purchase.
