I absolutely love this place!!! It saves so much time and money. And you get to eat different and delicious meals on a regular basis. There is so much variety. Everything has tasted amazing! Since everything is already prepped and portioned you don't have to go shopping for 20 different things like you normally would if you were to make one of these dishes on your own. The Thai Shrimp with Coconut Rice was so delicious! That one has been my favorite, but everything has been out of this world on flavor! I learned about this place from winning a door prize at an event I attended and I'm so glad I did. What a gem, and it was fun to make the dinners too.
