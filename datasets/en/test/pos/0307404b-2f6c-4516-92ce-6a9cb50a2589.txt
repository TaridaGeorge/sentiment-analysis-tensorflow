A Great little 50's diner. A hole in the wall mom and pop's joint. Have been eating there since Lenny himself would cook the burgers.

The fries are amazing and the burgers are to die for. I get the ranch burger with jalapenos and cheese. 

Classic food for a good price, better than chain fast food restaurants. Good for low-key dates
