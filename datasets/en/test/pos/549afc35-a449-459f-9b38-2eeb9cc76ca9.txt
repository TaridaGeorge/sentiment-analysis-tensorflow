We LOVED our happy hour at Hula's Modern Tiki after a long day of sightseeing.  The happy hour appetizers of crispy coconut shrimp rolls and spicy Thai fishcakes were fantastic and a very good bargain during happy hour, and the drinks?  Oh my!  My friend and I shared a Scorpion in the large flaming bowl, and the blood orange martini was fantastic. The interior is cool desert modern, and the glass cases under the bar packed with  tiki kitsch was fun to peruse.  But the best part of our visit was John, the bartender from Washington, who showered us with attention and tee shirts.  We bought some tiki mugs and rocks glasses to take home too.
