I'm shocked by the bad reviews of this place.  You don't go to a place like this to have truffles in your waffles, or creme brulee: it's a BREAKFAST JOINT!  And here's what makes it great:

Food:  Generous portions of tasty food.  The french toast is great, and I love the variety available in their breakfast bowls.  They used to have Cuban salsa, which was a fantastic secret... they ought to bring that back.

Prices: Very reasonable, just bring cash!

Staff:  There's a kid who sings your order to you, and he's awesome.  Everyone else there is friendly, talkative, and happy to throw some more coffee in your cup.

Location:  Convenient spot, lots of parking, clean tables, fun decor.
