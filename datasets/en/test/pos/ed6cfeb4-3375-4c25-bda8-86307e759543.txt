Have you ever bought something and thought "I want to send one of these to everyone I know"?

Well, that is what it feels like when you have one of the amazing parisian macarons at Essence. The chef trained in Paris and it shows. The parisian macaron isn't the stack of coconut you remember from passover. It is more like a giant fluffy cookie sandwich with an amazing creamy filling.

Essence makes a plethora of macaron varieties including mint, french chocolate, raspberry, and my favorites, espresso and caramel. The flavors are perfectly balanced, and the cookies are perfect--slightly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.

Now I just need to figure out how to ship a dozen to my mom.
