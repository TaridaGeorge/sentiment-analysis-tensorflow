Great coffee, service-oriented staff who really seems to enjoy their customers and working there, and a very cool retro-but-not-over-the-top vibe, including a "recycled" back patio just opening up.  Baked goods made fresh on premises include to die for brown butter as well as blueberry scones.  And perfect, generous sized (and reasonably priced!) quiche if you need more substance.  Free wifi, good music mix and very entertaining owner (say hi to Pat when you come in - you'll know who he is) makes it a very frequent stop!
