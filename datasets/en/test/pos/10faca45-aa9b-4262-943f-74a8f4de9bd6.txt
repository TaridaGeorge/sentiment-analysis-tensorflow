Harkins is my go to theater, especially for matinees. Their popcorn is always delicious, the seats are comfortable, and they always have a good selection of new movies with varying times. Coming from a state where Regal and AMC were my options, Harkis was a huge step up! The multiple popcorn flavorings were the first thing I noticed, lol, which are now all over. Parmesan garlic!?!? Yum. :-)
