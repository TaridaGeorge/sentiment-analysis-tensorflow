Dr. Cellers is the best! He is knowledgeable and he cares. He has treated my pets so kindly. Even when my boo boo kitty was so sick. He took the time to answer my questions and he always takes the time to make sure you understand. He doesn't speak the technical speak that makes you confused.
The other remarkable thing about this animal hospital is the entire staff is friendly, helpful, and understanding. The best customer service ever. :)
I am so thankful for Dr. Cellers. He is amazing.
