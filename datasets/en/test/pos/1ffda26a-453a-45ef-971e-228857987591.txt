When you get a seat and settle in this place is the best.  If you have to stand for awhile (and you very well may have too) that part is gonna suck no doubt about it.

Went here on a Saturday night and out of the 2 hours we were here the music was 95% Radiohead and Thom Yorke solo stuff, that's what 5 star drinking establishments are made of!

Extensive wine list with a few by-the-glass selections written on the chalkboards each night.   Ton's of micro beers to choose from.   We didn't get a chance to eat here but the food looked like the perfect match for this place, simple, fun, and creative.     I'll be back for sure with my fingers crossed that they always play 95% Radiohead and I wasn't there on a special night.
