Tucked away in the back of Le Studio in the lovely rehab-ed portion of Downtown Mesa is THE best aesthetic store you will ever find. 
If you are looking for a place to find wonderful professional products- please visit Bertha at Alexander's Aesthetics! 
Bertha is tremendous. She offers the best wax in the business, Cirepil- the original from France- as well as Dr. D. Scwab skin care, all of the intrinsics disposable products and so much more! I am always amazed at the array of products that Bertha carries. 
Even better than the products are the professional classes that are offered monthly. 
I have been a client with Bertha for over 5 years and I wouldn't think of going anywhere else for my professional products.
