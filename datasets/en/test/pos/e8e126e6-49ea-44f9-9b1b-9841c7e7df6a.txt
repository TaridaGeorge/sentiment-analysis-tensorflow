OK, it's time to admit it, this is one of my top 10 favorite places in Phoenix and it's a crime I have waited this long to give it the full 5 stars it deserves. 

Great staff, great atmosphere, and $5 pitchers and glasses of wine on Sat and Sun afternoons...just imagine how all of this can improve your love life, social life, married life, life life...are you imagining? I don't think you are... 

Fine, don't imagine, get on your cruiser, keds, vespa, pinto and get over to Postino for the best bruschetta in town, top 10 wine selection, rotating beers, and top 5 patio.
