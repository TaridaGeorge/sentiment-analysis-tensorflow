Who doesn't love Matt, what a great guy. Whether this dude is slangin' hash and eggs or amazing beer and snacks everything he touches seems to be delicious. The snacky items are all unique/fresh, they amazing selection of beer freakin' rules (who has Rogue Beers on tap, this guy does), and the place is shwag as hell. Great downtown place to take a date, low light always makes me look better, you might be better looking.  If you like beers off the beaten path and a shwanky place to drink them this is it.
