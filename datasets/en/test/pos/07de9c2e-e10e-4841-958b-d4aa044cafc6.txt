Definitely a great addition to what's out here. We went in the 1st time for ice cream (hellz yeah Pistachio!!). For the 2nd time we ordered lunch to-go. Fresh sandwiches with nice quality ingredients. I had a Windy City (corned beef) and my boyfriend had the NYC (pastrami)...both were really good and I loved that the bread they were on was FRESH and soft. We ordered them for take-out, everything was ready when I showed up, they even put the soda in the cups for us (instead of giving us empty cups and having us do it ourselves at the fountain)...it was a nice touch since I was trying to balance the bag of food plus car keys, phone, wallet, etc. They're getting my repeat business for sure. Nice people behind the counter, I really hope they do well here.
