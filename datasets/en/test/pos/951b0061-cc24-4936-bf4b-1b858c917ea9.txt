I love this place.  Shauna at the front desk was very nice.  thanks for the free toothpaste.  The pools and hot tubs ate open 24 hours.  The valet and bellman were great.

Very clean.  I have stayed here several times over the last 15 years and always enjoy the stay.  I got it for $60 a nighrt on priceline.  I have paid $129-$199 before so you can imagine how excited when Priceline placed me there. The people that are upset about getting this place for $50 should go pay the same OR MORE at A Motel 6.
