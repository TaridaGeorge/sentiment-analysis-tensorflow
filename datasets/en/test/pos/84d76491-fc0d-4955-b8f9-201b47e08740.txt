I'm an  Italian girl from New York and I can honestly say: Marcellino is one of the BEST Italian restaurants in the Valley. 

If you like home made pasta, flavorful sauces, great wine and all the other elements that make a great Italian place - this is it! It even reminds me of a place back east with the owner (owner's wife?) working the door and the old school dessert ray presented by the waiter. 

Marcellino is not cheap, but it's price in on par with other high end Italian like Bravo Bistro, Um Bacio, Le Cabaffe, Tamasos...etc. But Marcellino might be the best!
