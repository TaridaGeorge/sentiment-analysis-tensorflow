This is the best sushi around.  They have the freshest fish and high-grade as well.  The Toro melts in your mouth and I recommend as sashimi.  The food is so fresh that one time they had Ama Ebi on special and they billed it as fresh.  I assumed it was flown in fresh.  In actuality is was alive in a tank in the back.  This place is pricey, but well worth it.  They do have some great deals on some items during Happy Hour.  Also, they have some special rolls not on the menu that they will make when it is not too busy...I highly recommend the citrus roll.
