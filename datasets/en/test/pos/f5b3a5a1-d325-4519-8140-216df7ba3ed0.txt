So worth the drive! It's about 1 1/2 drive from where I live, but we had to come to Phoenix anyways. I'm glad we stop by this unique burger joint... I had the AfterBurner Burger & Onion Rings also got the Pizza Bread... Yummy! I was starving ok lol. My fianc√© got a Fish Sandwhich and Fries he said it's like the best Fish Sandwich he's had. My little ones had the mini corn dogs & fries. So we enjoyed our self and the owners are really nice...
