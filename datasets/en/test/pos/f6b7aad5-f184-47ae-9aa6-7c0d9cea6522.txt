Gilbert's hometown 'Cheers' where the locals drink, and congregate. Prices are very reasonable, and the new flat panels were a great addition. Now, I don't get down to this area but a few times during the year, but I ALWAYS stop in for a good time. Thanks for being exactly what I expect when we're in town Champions, you're number one in my book.
