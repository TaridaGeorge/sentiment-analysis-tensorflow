I'm a sucker for Shaved Ice...it's just so much more refreshing than frozen yogurt or ice cream.  Bahama Buck's is probably a little pricey considering that it is just ice and syrup, but I happily pay because it's so good!  There are probably fifty different flavors, but I'm a creature of habit, so I rotate through maybe only two or three flavors.  My fave is Mango with cream (you have to get the cream).  Remember to bring cash, because they no longer take debit or credit cards.
