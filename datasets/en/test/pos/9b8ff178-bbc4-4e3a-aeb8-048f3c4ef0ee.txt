I managed to find Samantha after having a fantastic cut from her a while back (so good that I literally had some dude at a stop light roll down his window to tell me that my hair looked great:-) when she was at a different salon. I was so happy to find her at Medusa, where she is the owner. The space is really cool - relaxing and a good vibe - and Samantha rocks! She does a seriously awesome job, and is able to predict what you are looking for - an intuitive stylist, I guess you could say. I left with a great cut, and was just really happy to have managed to locate her. She is fantastic - highly recommended!
