I've been attending Urban Yoga for several years. And although I've seen instructors come and go, the studio always calls me back. It's a beautiful, warm space, and I've always felt wonderfully welcomed. 

My class choices shift, depending on whether I'm injured, tired, wanting a more vigorous practice . . .  and the schedule provides according to my needs. I'm a huge fan of Emily's classes. She is keen on serving the needs of her students and provides excellent instruction based on those needs. Tara provides a powerful and satisfying practice, and Danielle's Zen and Slow Flow classes provide for those times when the body asks for something quieter. 

Regardless of the class I take, by the time that I'm settled into savasana, I am more connected, calm, and centered than before I walked in the studio doors.
