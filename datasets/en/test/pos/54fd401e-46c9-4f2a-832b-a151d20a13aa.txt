I love eating here! I love getting take out! They are very nice, the hipster thing is fine, you aren't made to feel unwelcome, but the cool people are just sooo cool! :) haha! The Cajun is yummy, bangers and mash, the burger one with thousand island is soooo yummy! Oh, but the tomato soup.... oh my heavenly goodness!!
