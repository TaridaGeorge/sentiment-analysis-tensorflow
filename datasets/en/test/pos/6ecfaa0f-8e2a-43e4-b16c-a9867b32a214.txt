Dropped in again during Glendale Glitters... and they were OUT OF PIZZA because everyone packed it in during the event!

... or so they thought... hehehe.

We asked our sever if they were SURE they were out of pizza and she went to check... came back and they had ONE ball of dough left... ONE!

Yeah... MINE!

So... we got our pizza... added some calamari (REAL calamari with tentacles) and fettuccine al pesto with chicken...... of course, I had to get a couple different Italian beers again...

As usual... everything was fantastic (sat on the patio this time) to include the owner standing out front welcoming folks and walking around to check up on everyone.

I'm not the type to be a 'regular' anywhere... but it'll be hard to stay away from this place anytime we're in Old Towne Glendale!

Cheers!
