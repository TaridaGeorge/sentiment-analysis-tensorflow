Ordered the Red Curry lunch special, 'Thai' hot. It had a nice spice to it, not overpowering the flavor. I plan to try the Double Thai Hot next time I am in. 

Service was great, I drink Iced Tea pretty damn fast, I never had to wait long for a refill. 

The curry wasn't runny, like many other Thai restaurants. It has a nice consistency. The fried spring rolls were tasty.

We also tried the home made ice cream with fried banana. It was a coconut ice cream and it was excellent. 

I'll be sure to come back, this is my new favorite Thai place in the west valley!
