Being less prone to blathering on and on about every move or movement I take, I'm opting for the "short and sweet" approach. In a word, this place is as good as it gets! I have seen about 8 shows in the Ikeda Theater so far and I drool at the thought of going again if the right act is performing. I won't list the acts I've seen in order to not "name-drop" like many of you are prone to doing. Suffice it to say; ample parking, comfy seats, leg-room, impressive architecure and spot-on acoustics make this venue a true treasure. It does feel good to write this positive review in so few words, unlike those of you who need 3000 words to slam some struggling restaurant.
