We dined here prior to seeing a movie on a Monday night.
We lucked out and were able to check out their Happy Hour.  It is delicious food for an amazing value.  
We ordered a couple sushi rolls and the Lettuce Wraps.  We enjoyed everything we ordered.  
Their patio is great and even though it was warm out we were able to sit at the outdoor bar due to some great mister/coolers they have.  The service was good even though they were busy.  
We will definitely return!
