Our daughter has been at Arcadia Montessori for a year and we absolutely love it.  She has blossomed there with a sense of both independence and responsibility and we attribute much of that development to the Montessori method and her fantastic teachers and aides.  The campus is beautiful and well maintained, and the classrooms are clean.  We truly feel that everyone who works at the school and in her classroom truly cares about her development and well-being.  Arcadia Montessori gives us the peace of mind we need in a household where both parents work and we want the best childcare for her age.
