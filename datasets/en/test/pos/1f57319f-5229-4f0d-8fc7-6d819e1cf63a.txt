WOW you should try the gel manicures that they offer here! They are about $28 which seems expensive for just a manicure, but they seriously last for 2 weeks without chipping and they look really shiny! The gels are made by OPI and come in a range of their most popular lacquers. I have had 2 people do them here now, and I will never get a regular manicure ever again!
