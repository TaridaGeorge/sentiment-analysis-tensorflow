this place is bomb diggity, it is a family favorite and a quick delicious dinner night option, the staff is always friendly, and more than half the time our order comes with little extras in the bag, don't be scared by prices as each order comes a la mode, we feel their chicken rivals only Lo-Lo's in town, beware as the locals will tell you, it is more of a call it in place, but be sure to try some lemon cake!
