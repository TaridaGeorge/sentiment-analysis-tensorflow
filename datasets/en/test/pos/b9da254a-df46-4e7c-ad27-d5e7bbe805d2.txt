If there's ever an Intervention episode about pho, I should be the in it.

I'm pretty sure Noodles Ranch puts crack in their pho. I almost always get the P3 (Pho Tai Chin) that consists of sirloin and brisket. The broth is perfectly balanced with lots of amazing flavors.

Other than my usual order, there are lots of other great items on the menu. Shrimp/sweet potato tempura is a good way to start the meal.

I'm come here at least once a week. Even in the hottest part of the summer. It's that good.

The owner Andre is super friendly and will definitely remember you. In fact, whenever I call and he picks up the phone to take my order, he immediately knows it's me calling and what my regular order is.

Like I said, I have an addiction.
