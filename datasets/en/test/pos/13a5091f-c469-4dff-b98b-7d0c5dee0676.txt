My mom took me here with a Groupon she had.  I am still dreaming of the sugar cookie ice cream.  It tasted like a snicker-doodle and had everything going right for it!

They have a variety of made in house ice cream and sorbet.  You can try at your leisure.  They are open until 10pm.  Yes!

Must visit here when in the area.  Or if you live here, come ALL the time!!
