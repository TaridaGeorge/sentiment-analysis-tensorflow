I held off, I wanted to be judicious, but my satisfaction is so thorough, it knows no bounds.  This is a restaurant that is exactly what it is trying to be.  Everytime I have gone, my expectations have been exceeded.  I have tried most of the pizzas, all have been excellent.  I have sampled salads, burgers, sandwiches, everything A-OK.  Beer, wine and liquor prices are beyond reasonable,  Basically, this is the neighborhood restaurant you have been waiting for, the place where everything is affordable and delicious, and the menu is diverse and balanced enough to keep you coming back a couple times a week.  Thank you Parlor, I love you deeply, and sincerely.
