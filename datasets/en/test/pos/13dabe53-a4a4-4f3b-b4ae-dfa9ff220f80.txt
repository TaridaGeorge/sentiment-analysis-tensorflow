I absolutely love this place.  Don't go in here expecting anything but good traditional food.  I don't believe anything here is really healthy.  I read a previous review that mentioned soggy veggies...I had a Ranchero Breakfast (sans veggies) and it was awesome...The food was really fresh and service was great
