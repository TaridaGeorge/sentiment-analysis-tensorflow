I love the Phoenix library system anyway but this library is the top of the heap!  It is great.  

First the architecture is great.  Very unique especially for a library.  

They have a good amount of books, audiobooks and DVD's.  The kids section is vast.  My oldest son absolutely loves it.  He could sit and read books in there for hours.  The librarians and staff are great too!
