This place needs a sixth star.

The most romantic place for breakfast in all of Phoenix ... outdoor and indoor dining ... it's self seating ... but before you select your table you place your order on the supplied clipboards ... you then you turn them in and pay and they give you a number to place on your table.  A waitress supplies water and your drinks ... but you serve yourself coffee (all of which works out PERFECTLY).

Bar none this the (new) best breakfast place in town ... 

I had the pancakes which were out of this world.  

We sat outside with a picturesque view of downtown all while a guitar player played ... just AMAZING ... 

Yet again another incredible independent business playing a huge roll in the amazing resurrection of Downtown Phoenix.

Go here ... seriously ... you WILL thank me (no need, really)!
