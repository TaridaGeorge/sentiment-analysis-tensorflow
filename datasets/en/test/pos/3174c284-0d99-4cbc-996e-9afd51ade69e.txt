The Best Indian Restaurant in Tempe. I am big time fan of Channa Masala and they are best in making that. 10 Start to Staff they are really Helpful. I forgot my mobile and the Staff guy found outside of Restaurant after 5 min and gave that. I am really thank full of that guy. It was great food there I will defiantly go again and again there.
