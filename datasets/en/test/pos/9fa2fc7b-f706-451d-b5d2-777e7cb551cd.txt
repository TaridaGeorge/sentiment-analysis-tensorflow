I am a huge fan of Ah-So! Their Tepan experience is great! The fillet, the shell fish, calamari, scallops, etc are all very tasty.  The few sushi entrees that we have tried have been very tasty and fresh. We have also tried the gyoza and it is very good as well for an appetizer. The mixed drinks are so so. I would recommend getting a Japanese beer. We have always had great service and friendly cooks and wait staff.
