Kim is my new favorite cutter.  I'm a seasoned veteran of Sport Clips, but had never been to this location.  She greeted me warmly, signed me in, sat me down, and got started.  This is the point at which she distinguished herself -- she started by asking me questions and actually LISTENING to what I had to say.  

Kim figured out my hair and the radical (for me) changes I wanted to make.  Halfway trough the cut, she stopped and carefully reviewed the progress with me before finishing the job.

After the ordeal (haha!), I bounced out of the shop with my most satisfactory haircut in years.  

I'll go back to this Sport Clips again and when I do, I'll have Kim pull another rabbit out of her hat.  If you're looking for a haircut, give this place a shot.
