Best pizza in town. Grazie's is fantastic. I have had pizza all over the place and this is a good place. The owner is always around greeting people and serving wine, the pace is very cute and really the food is great. The pizza is very good and true to Neapolitan pizza! He use to use 00 flour but now uses regular and the quality IMO did not change that much to not go back. Nothing more I can say except this is real pizza. Pizzeria Bianco which is suppose to be all this and that is a Joke, the lines are stupid, the people are stupid, stupid for waiting and I can say it is not as good as grazies plus you get right in to enjoy the pizza! 
Dont' waste your time with other places, this is it.
