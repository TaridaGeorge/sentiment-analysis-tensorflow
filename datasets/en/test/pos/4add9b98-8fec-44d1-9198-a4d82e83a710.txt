I enjoy going to both crate and barrel stores in the Valley,  This one is great if you want to compare against Pottery Barn,  which I find there is no comparison.  The designs are superb, timely, and the staff is friendly and full of personality.  While my budget has not afforded furniture pieces to date, I have purchased many accessories and art pieces, etc.  I found a blue Polish Misa vase on sale for $24.95 which was over 50% off.  Wonderful piece and very sturdy.  Also found a mirror for the bedroom-very contemporary and I'm sure it will fit my decor for many years.  Plus I told the staff how much I love their merchandise and they offered me a job application.  I look forward to many additional purchases at this store and hope I can soon start purchasing furtiture pieces.
