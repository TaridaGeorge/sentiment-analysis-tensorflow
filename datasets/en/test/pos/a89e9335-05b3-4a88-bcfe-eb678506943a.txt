athena fit body is the best and Serina Kappes is a phenomenal instructor. If you are just starting out or advanced or somewhere in between .Serina has a gift for figuring out where you are and where you want to be with out making you feel silly or in my case dance challenged.  I definitely arrived on the ZUMBA  short bus and was determined to hate the class. I LOVED IT !!  greatly due to Serina !!!!  I have lost about  twenty lbs in about four months with no dieting  just three to four classes a week  THANKS SERINA AND THANK YOU ATHENA FIT AND BODY !!!
