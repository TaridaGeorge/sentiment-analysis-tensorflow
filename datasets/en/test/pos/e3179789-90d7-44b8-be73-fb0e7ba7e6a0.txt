Fabulous Experience.  Things were explained, demonstrated so I could understand what they were - I'm a total newly at this and they were okay with it!  Our sales person David Roy was the absolute best.  If you go, see Dave and tell him I sent you.  If you buy from David, he'll send me a gift card to spend in their Camping World Store!  And you know, with a new toy there's so many things you need for it!
