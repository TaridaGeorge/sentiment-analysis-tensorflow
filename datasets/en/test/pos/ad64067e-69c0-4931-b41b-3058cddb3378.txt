My boyfriend and I are leaving to vacation next week so we needed a nail place around the house since mine is a little far. After running errands I seen Sky nails and thought hey let's try it out! First off amazing! You feel so relaxed and welcomed, the staff was really sweet but respected my boyfriend and mines privacy and didn't speak much unless we made conversation. Each pedicure was 23 we did the basic one, we love foot messages! I didn't get the guy and gals name who did our pedicures but we will definitely be coming back!
