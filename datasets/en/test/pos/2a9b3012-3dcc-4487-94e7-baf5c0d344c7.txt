Everything about the place is great! The design is earthy, warm and friendly. The service was fabulous and was only surpassed by the food. The food concepts are basic and comfortable and the flavors are complex and wonderful! The zucchini pancakes were a surprise and AMAZING!!!!!!!!!! The wine list is great too. This is a definite must see and taste!!
