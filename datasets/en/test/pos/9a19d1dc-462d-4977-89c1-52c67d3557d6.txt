After a phone reservation mishap with the Cibo folks I posted a not so stellar update to my review. The very next day, I received a personal and personable e-mail from someone who works there featuring an apology and an explanation of what had happened. WOW I'm impressed!!! this is not only a testament to Cibo for caring enough about their patrons and giving a whole new level of customer service, but also to Yelp for creating a true community that is not only among fellow yelpers, but among business owners and their customers...something that was completely unheard of just a couple of years back!! 5 starts to Cibo and 5 stars to yelp!
