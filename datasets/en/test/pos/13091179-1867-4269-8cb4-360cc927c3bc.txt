I've been wanting to try Yogurtland for so long now, and after a trip to the chandler mall one night we decided to. omg i cannot even tell you how amazed i was at this place!! we sampled a ton of choices before making our own.  The strawberry cheesecake is one of my faves and they have really good toppings! huge blackberries, strawberries, kiwi and lots of chocolate and candy!  but my fave, two words  FRUITY PEBBLES!!! i am a fruity pebble freak and was in my own lil world eating this with the cute pink spoon :)   i cannot wait to come back!  if you haven't been here GO!!!! !!!!   NOW!!!!
