Wonderful food! Don't be deceived by the outside. This is on the end of a mini mart-Circle K. It is one of those holes in the wall locations, but WOW is not a big enough word to describe it. Went in for the pizza and ended up with a seafood pasta dinner that was delicious. It was served in the pan it was cooked in on really nice plates. We were served an appetizer of bread with chopped tomato & onions in vinegar & oil. We were greeted by the owner himself. It is really small inside, so seating is limited. There were a lot of take outs for pizza, and they have this really long pizza that is one of their specials. Can't wait to go back for the wood burning oven pizza!
