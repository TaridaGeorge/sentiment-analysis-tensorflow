The Scavenger Hunt was such a great way to start the Christmas season and discover new local shops . The weather was perfect, there are so many neat places in old town that I never knew existed, I couldn't ask for a better day. It's dangerous for me to work up the road from old town,  because there several places I want to revisit and do some damage to my wallet. Baratin is on my list of spots to check out. Shop Local!!!! Thank you once again Lindsey!
