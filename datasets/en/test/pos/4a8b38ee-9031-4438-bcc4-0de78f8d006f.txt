Used book store, big place, very crowded, I had to fight over my section.  I picked up a few older books, mostly crafts, and prices were a surprise, mixed really, some were cheap and yet one book, was price higher but it was out of print, so prices must be based on that?

Anyway, big place, selection is expansive, and you could probably find something you've been looking for here!
