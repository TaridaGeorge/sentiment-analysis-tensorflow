This is absolutely my favorite place in Phoenix.  It is a great place for lunch or dinner.  The outdoor patio is awesome, especially at night.  Everything I order is perfect.  My favorite is a Seafood Salad that I have them serve with mixed greens.  It is perfect.  I also like the roasted half-chicken and the fish tacos.  The nacho plate is also insanely delicious. 

This is my favorite place for business meetings, out of town guests, and family meals.  I encourage you to go and go often until you have tried several different items on the menu.
