Where other stores in the same category has closed, REi has remained open and I hope they stay open and survive every cycle cause I just love this place. I love coming here to browse their products. I love buying their products and I love how once I'm a member, their generous return policy. 
Funny enough. It's their generous return policy that has turned me into a loyal customer and someone who doesn't mind paying a higher price for a similar item I can buy elsewhere.
