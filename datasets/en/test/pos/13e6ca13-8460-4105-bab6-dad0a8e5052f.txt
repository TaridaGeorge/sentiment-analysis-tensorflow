Great prices!  Great food!

I buy certain things here that are hard to find elsewhere.  Here is my typical grocery list:

1 lb. hommos - $4.99
1 lb. kalamata olives - $4.99
1 lb. feta cheese - $3.99
1 bag greek style pita bread (fluffy) - $3.29
1 lb. dates - 4.99
1 pkg dried figs - $5.99
bulk spices - $2 - $4 per 4 oz bag (4 oz is a lot of spice!)


While I'm there I will usually get a dessert to go or a slice of pizza.  Their Gyro sandwich is great too!

Love this place!
