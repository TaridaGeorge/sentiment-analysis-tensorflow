I'm a Yooper-- I was raised in Michigan's Upper Peninsula and left for college.  Ever since (and that's a few years now!!), I have felt the absence of a good pasty nearby.  

Totally by chance had this place recommended to me at a business meeting and was BLOWN away.   I'm used to the traditional "Oggie" and  it brought me right back to my childhood   but as I went with family, got to try a few bites of some of the others--all were amazing including the Royale.  

Love the eclectic crowd too.  Definitely a place to go back to when we're in Phoenix again.
