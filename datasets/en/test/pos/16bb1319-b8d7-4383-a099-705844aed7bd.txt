I've been a fan of Roy's since I was "forced" to do business in Hawaii years ago. We took the in-laws to this one for a birthday and the food and service was excellent! 

We started off with the Wood Grilled Szechuan Spiced Pork Ribs and they were great. 
My wife and I wanted "surf and turf" so I ordered the filet and she ordered the White Truffle & Black Pepper Seared Sea Scallops, they were excellent.

We all shared the chocolate souffle and it was delicious. 

The wait staff did a really nice job as well and we thoroughly enjoyed the evening.

Will be going back and taking a client.
