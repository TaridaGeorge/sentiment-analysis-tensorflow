Why did I wait so long to come here?  I live around the corner from this place and just visited for the first time a few weeks ago.  Since them I have been there at least 6 times.  The Chicken Shawarma is amazing.  I love that they also give you a choice of sides.  The lentil soup is great and the fresh cut fries are always really good.  

The service here is really friendly and they are always happy to see you. 

Go to the Pita Shack.  You will not regret it.
