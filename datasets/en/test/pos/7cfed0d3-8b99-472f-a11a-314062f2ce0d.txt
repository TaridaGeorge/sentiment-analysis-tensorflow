Best barbershop in the phoenix area.  Go to Vadim...he is like the michael jordan of cutting hair! 16 bucks and some change with a military discount. Straight razor lineup, hot shaving cream, hot towel, and a slightly awkward neck massage.  There are several tvs in there with man stations on...ie espn, as well as a clean decor with a fricken pool table! Go there...like, now!
