This is the nicest Whole Foods Market we have been to. The produce is fresh and the best looking organic food around. The choices are endless. The store is clean and the staff is helpful and friendly. They actually seem to enjoy their jobs and love to help. Unlike most grocery stores, it was alway easy to find someone knowledgeable to help. It is well worth the drive.
