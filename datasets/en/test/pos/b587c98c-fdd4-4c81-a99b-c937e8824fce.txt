I had the salmon + asparagus risotto and the bourbon shake. 

The lady had the chicken wrap with fruit salad. 

The server was friendly and the decor of the restaurant was beautiful. 

It took a little bit of time to get our food but we were enjoying what was playing on the 2 TVs behind the bar.

The food was delicious and the service was great.  It looked like a small amount of food when they brought it but we were stuffed and could not finish our meals. The food was moderately inexpensive for such a nice restaurant as well.
