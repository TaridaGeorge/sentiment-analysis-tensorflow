Last weekend my boyfriend surprised me with a date to the opera to see the adaptation of William Shakesphere's Othello called Otello. The opera was being performed at Symphony Hall in downtown Phoenix. It is one of the few performing arts locations I had not been too and I have nothing bad to say about it. The sound was great and the seats were comfortable. It is very nice inside with different paintings, sculptures, etc on display. Parking in downtown Phoenix can be tough and pricey, but we were able to get there early to grab a drink at a local bar and found metered parking..and since it was a Saturday evening we didn't have to pay the meter...SCORE!  I would go back to see other performances here!
