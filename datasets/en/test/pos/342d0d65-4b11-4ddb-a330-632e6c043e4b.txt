I had never heard of this breakfast place until my dad took me this morning.  This place is great!  My dad and his wife said it was the best breakfast place in town, and I'm inclined to agree, even though I've only been to a couple of breakfast places.  I had the fruit crepes, which came with granola and their muffin of the day, while my little sister had an omelette and my girlfriend had some dish with sausage and egg.  I tried everything and it was all great, and super cheap to boot.  I think each of our dishes were like $7.
