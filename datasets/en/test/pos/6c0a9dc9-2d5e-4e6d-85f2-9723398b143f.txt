I very rarely give out 5 stars so here is why I do for this place...
First off the people are friendly and that is really great...

Also, the ingredients are always fresh, the cook staff are fast, and everything is delicious.  If you are a newbie, follow a recipe... If you are adventurous, try lots of YC's own, black bean, Garlic, Szechwan, and a little sesame oil. 

I started out on Kublai's Mongolian BBQ in Hong Kong.
If I had one thing to change or add to YC's it would be to include an egg as an ingredient, white rice as an ingredient, and fried tofu as well.

Great place!!
