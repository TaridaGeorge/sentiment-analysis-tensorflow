Love their pizzas!  Thin crust, and it just smells heavenly.  It's the pizza I remember from my childhood.  Their menu doesn't have the standard pepperoni, etc, but pizza Margherita, and a couple of other specialty pizzas.  I plan to eventually try their other menu items.  But as of now, they're my favorite neighborhood pizza place.
