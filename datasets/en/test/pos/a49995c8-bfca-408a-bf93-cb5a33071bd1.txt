Asbury United Methodist is a place for all!  The congregation is welcoming, diverse in age, race and sexual orientation.  Pastor Jeff is a warm person who is real, down-to-earth, and you know that he is passionate about his ministry for the community.  They are social justice minded and teach what true love and compassion (real messege of the Bible) is about.

If you stopped going to church due to being tainted with hypocritical, conservative, and narrow-minded theology, then go to Asbury where you will be refreshed and feel accepted.

The only difference I have is the style of service, which is not the preferred contemporary worship that I prefer; however, everyone varies when it comes to worship style and I have grown to like it.
