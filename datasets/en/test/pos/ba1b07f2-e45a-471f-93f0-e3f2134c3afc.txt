Not a single bad seat in the house, SERIOUSLY!! 
I love this place :) The energy is palpable! Even for those of us who are still learning their way around hockey, the experience of watching a game here is second to none. 
The only thing I would warn you about is that they stop selling alcoholic beverages when the last period starts ( I think that's what it's called!). 

When I've attended games here I also have dinner at one of the local restaurants, so I park out by the movie theater. The walk to the arena isn't bad (you just walk through the outdoor mall & it's directly behind it), parking is free & the street entrance is right off the free way, so it's quicker! Honestly, there are no cons :)
