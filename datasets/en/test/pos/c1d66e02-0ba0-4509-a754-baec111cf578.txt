I don't know what to say but absolute perfection, from the gelato, atmosphere, service, even the little cookie they put on the gelato. I've had the salted caramel twice and it's wonderful, rich and creamy. But not as many calories as normal ice cream?? Hard to believe but I'll believe it eat more! 
Expect to wait especially on a weekend evening after dinner. Yum!
