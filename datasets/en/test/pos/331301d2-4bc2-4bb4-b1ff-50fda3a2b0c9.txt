Brian's one of the easiest designers I've had the pleasure of working with and I used to run my own ad agency for over 15 years, having worked with literally hundreds of designers worldwide.

If you give him the parts that are important to you and then give him the freedom to build what he envisions from that you are sure to get an outstanding design, image or art piece.

This is a designer's designer - not the kind of person you micro manage on a creative project. Like the great cook he is, he likes to use and produce original works, original photographs, and original masters to get the image across.

I definitely recommend him from the work he did in designing my company's corporate identity material.
