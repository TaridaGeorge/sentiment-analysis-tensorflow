This is just about my favorite restaurant in Phoenix for casual dining. The salads are large and the best I've had anywhere. The Southwest Caesar Shrimp Salad is nearly orgasmic. The meatball sub and sausage sub are huge and delicious. The pazookie desert is just about the best thing I've ever had, and might be my last meal request on death row. The only downside is the wait, it gets REALLY busy every lunch hour and evening. No call-ahead seating either, so I tend to drive up, put my name on the list, then go shopping nearby for an hour before returning for the final ten minute wait. But yeah, it's just hard to go wrong here, everything I've had ranges from good to wow...
