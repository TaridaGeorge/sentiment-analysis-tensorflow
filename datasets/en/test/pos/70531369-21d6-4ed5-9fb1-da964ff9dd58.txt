Doug is the MAN! As a visitor in Phoenix, getting around, especially when you are drinking, can be rough. That is where "The Dougie" comes into play. Doug was able to help us out on our recent trip to PHX for the Fiesta Bowl. He charges fairly, and is the nicest guy you'll meet. We also had a pretty large group, so that is also a huuuuuge plus when being transported around- especially since the taxi companies don't typically have large vans. Riding The Dougie was truly an experience that everyone should have!!! Get 'em Dougie!
