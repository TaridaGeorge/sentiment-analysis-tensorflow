The absolute BEST breakfast I've had in Phoenix! The eggs are always cooked just the way you order them; never over or under cooked. There was no problem when I asked for Eggs Benedict (which is excellent, BTW!) with eggs over easy instead of poached. Food arrives promptly and hot, no matter how busy they are. The only thing they could improve upon is the toast. It's barely buttered and not always warm. A must-try is their link sausage. It's made fresh in house and is incredible!  Get there early because they fill up fast, and bring your appetite! You won't be disappointed!
