In one word, YUM! Loved the food here. I am known for getting scallops quite frequently and these were cooked to perfection. The appetizers were great as well and the portions were definitely generous. 

Service was superb. Gina, our server, was personable and took our dining experience from good to freaking outstanding!  I'm a bit of an indecisive orderer and am therefore appreciative of the servers' opinion. Gina gave honest, enthusiastic recommendations, not only with food but also our wine pairings. 

Decor was dark and comfortable. They had a great bar set up as well and have a fantastic specialty cocktail and beer list. Next time we head back, we will plan to belly up and get our drink on!  Overall, I can't find anything negative about this place. Kudos!
