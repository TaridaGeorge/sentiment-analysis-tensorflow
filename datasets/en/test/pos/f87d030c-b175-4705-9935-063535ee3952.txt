Took my husband for our anniversary and it was great.  I loved their little amuse bouche that kept us interested between each dish.  Plus I've never been served cotton candy for desert, what a great idea.  The deserts were the best part of the meal.  My hubby got the gelato and it was amazing.  Can't wait to return.  The only problem, we made reservations and still had to wait for a table.
