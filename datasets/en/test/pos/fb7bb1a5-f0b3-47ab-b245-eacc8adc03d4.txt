Had lunch here today with a friend, and my lunch was fab. I had the chicken kabobs with basmati rice. There were yummy raisins and almonds in the rice, and the chicken was perfectly cooked. Loved it! Atmosphere was great, complimentary valet is always awesome, and the waitress we had was very helpful. My friend had the special: a salmon cake salad, that looked fab as well. Highly recommend if you're in the area hitting this spot up!
