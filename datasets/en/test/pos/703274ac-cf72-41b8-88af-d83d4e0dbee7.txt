Felt a connection with this lively, positive-energy filled Church since the first time I went about 5 weeks ago. Haven't missed a service yet. Couple weeks ago the Pastor mentioned that listens to 2 types of music, Country & Western- haha, now that's my kind of Pastor! Lots of opportunity to volunteer and serve in their ministries. The sermons are honest and give you that unbeatable wholesome happy feeling when you leave. Great community to be a part of.
