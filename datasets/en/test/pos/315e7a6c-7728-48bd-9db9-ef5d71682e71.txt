We wanted to get something to eat after picking up a family member from Gateway Williams Airport.  It was supposed to be at 9pm. We called the restaurant and asked if that would be too late to come.  They said no, and they would have a table set up.
Her plane was late didn't arrive until 9:35.  We said we would get something to go so as not too keep them open late. They said no problem. We thought the food was great.  We visit various Serrano's throughout Phx.  The service was great.  I think this deserves 5 stars for Customer Service alone!
