First time, recently moved here and hated to have to find a new OBGYN, luckily I found Advanced Care, P.A. Kilman, was awesome!! She answered so many questions, and took the time, I didn't feel hurried. She was careful, and made me feel very comfortable. The front desk staff were ok, they made me wait for them as they finished their conversation, but the most important part,the nurse and the PA were great!!
