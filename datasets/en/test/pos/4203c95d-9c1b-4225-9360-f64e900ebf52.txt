Sherrilee Denton at Keller Williams East Valley is the awsomist!  
Very knowledgable, quick to respond.  I bought AND sold my house though her.  She looks out for your best interest if your are the seller or the buyer.  She knows her stuff.  She also has referrals for everything from painters to pool guys.  I was looking for a renter for 3 months with no results, I then decided to rent or sell, which ever comes first.  She found me both in a week.  I then had a choice of direction - a good place to be.

If you read this, you should at least interview her as a potential realtor.
