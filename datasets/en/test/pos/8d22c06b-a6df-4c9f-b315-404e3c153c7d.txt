After my usual spot closed down, I found this place after making a few friends at Recollections before they closed thier doors.

I went in for the first time today, and I liked it.  They have plenty of paper, some ribbon, stickers and other scrapbooking supplies that you will need to work.  The store was neat and clean, lab had plenty of work room, with die cut machines and good lighting to work under.  No charge for lab time, and they do offer scrap nights for the usual $15. Open crop nights are Friday and Saturday nights, with door prizes and dinner.

Please check with the store for class times and schedule.  The staff here is great, and extremely helpful.
