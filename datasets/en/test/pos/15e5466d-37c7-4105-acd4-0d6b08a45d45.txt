If your new to AZ, you'll want to put Kierland Commons on your list of top places to shop at. 

I love this place and choose it over all others. I just wish they had the major department stores here too. 

This is a strip mall and outside shopping. They have a lot of the coolest high-end shops here too; and great dining. 

I hit the Starbucks up and then shop away. They are starting to know me by name LOL!
