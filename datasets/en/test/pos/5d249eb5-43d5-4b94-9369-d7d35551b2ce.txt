What a great park!

I have been to this stadium a couple times, and it is a great place to catch a ballgame.  Not being from Arizona, I am very appreciative of the air conditioning when there is an August game.  I also like how many options there are for food, and the places are kind of clumped together so everyone can get something different without having to search far and wide.  

The downtown location is convenient, and parking isn't bad at all.  You won't be disappointed when you catch a game at Chase Field.
