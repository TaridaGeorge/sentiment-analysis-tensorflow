It was the afternoon so I said why not try a non breakfast sandwich, so i took a chance on the "chicken panini" (added avocado because as you know which you all should avocado is a gift from the gods) AND IT BLEW MY BRAINS!  I ate it so quick I couldn't take a picture or I would upload its deliciousness to it can stimulate your eyes as it did my stomach.  This place never disappoint's, EVER!
