Just returned from a great first time at Four Peaks. After much debate on what to drink, I enjoyed a nice, cold pint of the 8th street ale, along with the Southwest burger. Both ended up being excellent choices. The beer was tasty, and the burger was one of the best I'd had in a long time (fries weren't too shabby as well). Service was pretty quick for how crowded it was. Nice establishment.
