Best boba I've had in Arizona hands down. You know of a better place? Let me know and I'll put it to the test. Honestly. It's that good. I've never had a problem with their boba being frozen or too hard. Their milk tea tastes legit! I haven't actually checked though to see if they actually use real tea with real condensed milk instead of that powdery stuff some places try to pull on you.. Their selection of finger foods is just enough to keep you going but not so much it takes away from it being a small tea house atmosphere. A honest good quick boba place that I make sure to hit whenever I'm in this part of town.
