Good food, good service, good prices. That's all I want out of a restaurant.

There are reviews here that say Bombay Spice isn't necessarily authentic Indian food. Maybe it's not. So what? I honestly wouldn't know authentic Indian food if it bit me. It still tasted good. Taco Bell isn't authentic Mexican food either but sometimes it still tastes good.

All I can say is that I liked the food at Bombay Spice and there was a decent vegetarian section. I'll definitely go back. If you like Indian flavors and aren't a snob about perfect Indian cooking, give this place a shot.

*edit* A few months later I'm moving them up to 5 stars. I've been to Bombay Spice a few more times for lunch and the food is great every time.
