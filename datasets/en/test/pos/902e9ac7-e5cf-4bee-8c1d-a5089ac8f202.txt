I've had a lot of massages from a lot of different places and I have to say, this is one of my favorite places to come. I always have courteous service and the employees know what they are doing. I wish I spoke the language, it would make communicating easier, but they always understand when I tell them a certain area hurts. I think i have a free punch on my card now too!
