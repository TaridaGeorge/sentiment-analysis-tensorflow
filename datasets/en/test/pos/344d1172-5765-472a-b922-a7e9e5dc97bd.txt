We had a great time at the Saguaro. We stayed from August 24th until August 26th. Our room was awesome 2 flat screen tv's a huge bathroom with a super deep tub and separate shower area. The bed was so comfortable, although the pillow were a little thick for my liking. The staff was super friendly and they really made our stay wonderful. The pool is really cool and when you go under water you can hear music, nice touch. Last but definitely not least Distrito was great especially the drinks that Jay was serving up. We will go back just to drink some more of Jay's creations. They were absolutely unreal and out of this world.
