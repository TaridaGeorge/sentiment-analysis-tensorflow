Love this place! Lo-Lo's is a great place to try something different before a D-Backs or Suns game. I recommend you try it if you like chicken and well... waffles. Not a place for your dainty girlfriend who just kinda wants to you know like become a vegetarian because you know like the bunnies are like cute and everyone is doing it
