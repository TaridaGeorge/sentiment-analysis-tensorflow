This has been a place on my bucket list to check out and I was pleasantly surprised by a romantic date night here last Friday with my bf.  Service=amazing.  Atmosphere=Amazing.  Food=amazing  We had the sea bass and filet and can't give enough props for how great it was.  Even better the restaurant offered 20% off the bill if you donated at least $10 cash to a reputable charity.  One of the most charming places I've been too in a while and will be back very soon!
