Thanks to Yelp, I was able to find a great and honest electrician that has great customer focus.  Mike quickly responded to my voicemail message, set up an appointment time, called ahead to confirm appointment and when he was running a few minutes behind, he called me to let me know.  His labor charge was fair and he quickly solved the problem as it turned out to be much simpler than I had thought.  He thoroughly explained what he was doing, what was the cause of the problem and what the fix would be.  He didn't waste time with needless stuff just to run up a tab.  I wish all contractors were as honest and forthright as Mike.  I would highly recommend him to anyone who wants a knowledgeable and hones electrician.  This was much more affordable than I thought a licensed electrician would cost.
