This place is AWESOME!  I usually go there for late breakfast around 10:30 or 11 after working in the morning.  The wait at that time is not that bad but I can imagine the long line in the morning.  

Well every time I go to Phoenix for business, I come here for breakfast.  The OJ is AMAZING!  The waffle is AMZING!  And the staff is AMZAING!

If in doubt, just look at the pictures.  Viewing them made me want to have an excuse to go to Phoenix again just to eat.  My mouth is still watering as I am writing this.

You MUST try this place.
