Me and the GF went here for dinner last night. Have had a cold all week she brought home from NYC. Their pho broth is probably the best in town. Spring rolls are also tasty (but I like the ones at Pho Bang better). Always have to pig my way through the Ban Xeo, wonderful egg crepe with pork, shrimp and bean sprouts. Wrap in the greens, dunk in fish sauce, and enjoy as all the happy points in your brain lite up. 2 orders of spring rolls, 2 orders of pho, 2 teas and the crepe=20 bucks of bliss. One kvetch for this trip: we ordered 3A I think, and while the brisket was excellent, the flank(?) was a tad too done and tough. Even with that, I still give them top marks.
