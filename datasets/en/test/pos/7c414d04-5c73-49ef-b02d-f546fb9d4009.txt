THE BEST!!!

I was there recently on a date night with my wife. LOVED IT! Thanks Tasty Thai!

Our waitress was very courteous, and left us alone except to take our order, re-fill our glasses etc.

Food was GREAT! Both of us LOVED it especially the FRIED ICE CREAM! Portion size was so big that we even got to-go. Prices are INCREDIBLE!

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
