We went here on a halloween night and expected the long wait but I guess everyone was trick or treating so we got inside in less than an hour. The pizzas were outstanding and their salads too. For some reason that coke in a bottle went well with our pizza.  Make sure to order the wiseguy and the Sonny boy. This is a must go for pizza lovers if you happen to be in downtown phoenix.
