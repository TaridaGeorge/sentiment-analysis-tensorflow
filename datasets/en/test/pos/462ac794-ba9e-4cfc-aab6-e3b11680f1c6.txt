When I moved into the neighborhood, one of my friends said I had to try Spinato's.  So I ordered a few pies for everyone who helped me move.  They are not near as cheap as fast food pizza joints, but it's worth the price.  While the crust is a little thicker and lacks the crispness of traditional Chicago thin crust, it is fantastic pizza! (For more traditional Chicago thin crust, try Johnnie's on Cave Creek)  Sauce is nice and sweet, and they have a large variety of fresh toppings.  This place gets busy most nights, and delivery can be an hour or longer during prime pizza hours, so plan ahead.

(I haven't had any calzone or pasta dishes, and always gotten delivery or pick-up)
