Coffee, beer, and food.....everything a girl could ask for!  The lattes are very tasty and is perfectly paired with the Big Ben sandwich.  This breakfast sandwich is a whopper with the right amount of chiplote aioli.  There's plenty of seats in this hip little coffee shop.  Whether you're stopping in for some coffee or there to borrow the wifi, this is a great local place!  I will definitely have to stop in for their daily Happy Hour and check out their drink selections.
