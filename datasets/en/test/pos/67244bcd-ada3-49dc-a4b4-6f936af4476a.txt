I love this place! The food here is not only amazing, but also very affordable. I was impressed by the quality and flavor of the food here the first time I went. Plus, every time I come back to order something new, I am impressed again! 

I love their panini and regular sandwiches; both are equally delicious. And to go with your tasty meal, you also get, don't act too surprised, a pickle! Now, this isn't just any sandwich pickle, it is their very own pickle and it is quite good. One of my favorites! To top it off, they often have $5 meals after 5pm - a good deal!

I used to go here all the time when I lived in Chandler and now sadly go less frequently because I live downtown. I hope they open a location in downtown soon!!
