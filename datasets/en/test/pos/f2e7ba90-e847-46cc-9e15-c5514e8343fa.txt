Having moved to Arizona recently, I went looking for some pho for a little bit of comfort food. This place was the first pho restaurant I saw when I searched online, and I'm glad I went! The broth was flavorful so I didn't use any hoisin sauce- just a little chili sauce. The noodles weren't stuck together. The service was nice and quick. I will be going here again for sure!
