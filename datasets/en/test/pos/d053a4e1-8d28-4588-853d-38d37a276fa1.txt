Best happy hour in the area.  Wish the Desert Ridge location would lighten up on the staff and let them be-the vibe in Tempe is much more mellow.  Things to try:  Black Bean Burger and the Spinach pasta salad-must add chicken.  We always customize our app, by getting 1/2 red pepper hummus (ridiculously delish) and 1/2 tzaziki with a side of cucumbers.  This one is VERY kid-friendly and has the best service around.  We go once a week!
