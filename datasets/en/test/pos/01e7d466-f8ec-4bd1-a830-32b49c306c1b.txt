So far my favorite pizza bistro! Love the music, the whole wheat pizza crust and the service. The main problem is that it gets really crowded Friday night. That's why I suggest to stop by any other day of the week and even try to make reservations if you are a group. I always sneak to the bar and enjoy the meal. 
Ingredients are really good in taste. I have tried also their salads and I'm waiting to try their pasta or other offers...but, any time we go, we end up always ordering a delicious pizza!
