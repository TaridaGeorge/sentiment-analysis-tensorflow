This place is wonderful.  My boyfriend used to work there, so it was his first choice when we went to buy plants to spice up our new patio.  We bought some really healthy plants that I can't help but be really proud of!  I've never been a plant person, but I love to gather knowledge about almost anything.  I was so impressed by the knowledge of the staff at Berridge and better yet - their eagerness to share their knowledge with us.  This place gets a huge thumbs up from me!
