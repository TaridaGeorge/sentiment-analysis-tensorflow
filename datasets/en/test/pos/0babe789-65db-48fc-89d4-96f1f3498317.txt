This is the second time I have visited Phoenix Flower Shop and was equally as impressed by the selection and quality of the flowers, in addition to the amazing staff. I came in looking to make a custom bouquet for a friend's birthday. The two women working were both very helpful and knowledgable. I find the flowers to be priced at a bargain considering their quality. The store also offers a weekly half off all loose-stem flowers-- a happy hour for flowers--great idea! Top-notch customer service. I'll certainly be back.
