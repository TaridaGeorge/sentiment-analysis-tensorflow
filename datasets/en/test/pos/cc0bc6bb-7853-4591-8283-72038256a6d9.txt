ZINC is one of the most consistant places to eat in the valley.
Zinc is the only place for a late lunch = bottle of wine and no time commitments! The entire menu is delicious and the decor makes you feel like your in a French bistro (especially once the wine kicks in).
Weekend evenings are too crowded and busy. Go non-peak and savor the moments.
