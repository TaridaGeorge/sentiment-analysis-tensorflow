I didnt know where I was headed, so I passed the place.  I won't forget where it is now.

One of the above reviews mentioned unique flavors that push the envelope.  I dived right into one myself.

Dates and Bleu cheese.

What an amazing little treat for a cheese lover like me to find this flavor in an ice cream shop!  I did a double take and had to sample it!  Eating the ice cream was delicious.  You can't really begin to taste the bleu cheese until a few bites into a cup.  The sweetness of the dates really compliments cheese.  From sweet and creamy right into the aftertase of bleu cheese... wow.

If would say that if I was in the area, I would try another flavor, but I am totally hooked on this flavor now.
