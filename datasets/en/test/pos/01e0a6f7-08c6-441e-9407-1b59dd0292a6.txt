If you are looking for a Unique Dining Experience, this is the place! 
Cute atmosphere but the food is some of the best I have ever had. I love that there is no menu and you get what you get. I make enough decisions every day and it just feels good to let the experts handle it! 

The three course dinner was so amazing I took photos! The only thing I would love to see is chairs the are more comfortable. But hey when the food is so good the hard chairs don't seem like such a big deal. 

Great job Chef Christopher!
