I am in love with Cornish Pasty Co. The servers are friendly and the food is yummy.  Yup, that's right.  Yummy.  Everything has that made-from-scratch feel (cause it is).  I like the Greek salad (amazing pesto vinaigrette) and chicken pesto pasty best.  For you non pesto-junkies there's a full menu of delicious pasties to select from.  

FYI: Save room for dessert! Just saying.
