My 1st time here and it wasnt my last. The Cashier greeted me and was cheerful. Its way better than In And Out and Fat Burger. They dump the fries in a Bag and its enough fries for 2 people. The Beef tastes fresh and is juicy. The Cheese is thick but a lil runny on the ends. I enjoyed every bite of my burger. Only thing that they should add to the menu are Shakes and Onion Rings.
