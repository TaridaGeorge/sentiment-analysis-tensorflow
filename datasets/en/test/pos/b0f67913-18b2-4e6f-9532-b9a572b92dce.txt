I had a hankering for a good noodle dish last week and happened upon this gem of a thai joint.  Over the past year I have stopped in regularly for both the pad see ew as well as the pad thai.  They have also added thai sandwiches for 3.99 lately! This is a great spot for soups, dessert's, noodle dishes, and curries.  If you are in the chandler fashion square area do yourself a favor and swing by the Thai cafe!
