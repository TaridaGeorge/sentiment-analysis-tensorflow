Probably the best cup of coffee I've ever had. Definitely the best I've found in downtown Phoenix.  I'm definitely going back for some more coffee and to sample the breakfast menu.  

Excellent service from very helpful staff who talk about coffee the way some people talk about wine. Get a coffee from the Clover machine and drink it black, even if that's not how you normally drink it.
