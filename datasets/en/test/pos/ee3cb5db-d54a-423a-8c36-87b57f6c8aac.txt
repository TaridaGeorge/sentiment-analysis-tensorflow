Yes yes yes, for every reason all the 5 star reviews state below!  Multiple trips to wine country with more than my (small) wine fridge will hold, this is exactly the place I want to crack these bottles open and let the atmosphere and food wash over me.  Hey...though I love to cook at home, I admit my meals do not justify these bottles' price tags. :P  So bring your beautiful wine and enjoy the evening away...  actually bring 2-3 bottles and decide what you are going to pour once you hear the menu  ;)

PS.  Just talking to Chris on the phone, he has more personality than some folks exhibit their entire lives!
