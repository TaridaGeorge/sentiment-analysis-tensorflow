Its nice and this review is written for event meeting planners. This facility is awesome if you're doing a large conference. There's room for a conference within a conference as well.

I love the availability of suites and flexible catering options. There's food around the clock. I don't love the WIFI system.

There's Hertz rental cars on site, a Starbucks and a Kinko's... You can operate a business there pretty easily
