This place has it all over "thee-coffee-corporation-that-shant-be-named"... cheaper coffee which tastes miles better, text coupons and deals usually once a week or so, a frequent buyer card (buy 10 get 1 free, and don't forget double stamp Tuesday!), but what sticks out to me the most is the employees. Always friendly, which is nice, but more importantly...  *gasp!* completely competent (a rarity these days).  They always deliver spot on, and are really cool to boot. I will never, ever go anywhere else as long as these folks are around!
