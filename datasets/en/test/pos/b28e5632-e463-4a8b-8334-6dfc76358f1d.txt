If you're looking for pure luxury, don't go here.

If you're looking for a perfectly priced room with a nice bathroom, kitchenette, and comfy bed - this is the place.

The grounds are well maintained, the pools were sparkling clean and on more than one occasion the night we stayed there, we saw security patroling the grounds.

It's conveniently located near shops, restaurants and so on.  We didn't check out the free breakfast this time.

This is definitely where we'll be staying when we have to go to Scottsdale again!
