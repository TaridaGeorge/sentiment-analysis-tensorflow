YUM YUM YUM! They have great cocktails, great staff, and the foie-gras pizza is TO DIE FOR (despite the $24 price)! I had a bad experience there once and the manager called and asked that I come back for a comped dinner.  I find that type of customer service SO rare but definitely brought me back many times!
