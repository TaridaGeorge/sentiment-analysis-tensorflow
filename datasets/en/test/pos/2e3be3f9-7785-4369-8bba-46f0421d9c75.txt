My family & I have been taking our cars to Kelly Clark Automotive for at least the past 8 years, and have had amazing service from Jim, Mitchell and their team. 

As a young woman, taking my car to a repair shop can be nerve-wracking because I'm afraid I will be taken advantage of. Kelly Clark is run like a family business, and they always take care of me and are very knowledgable. 

They handle all makes, models & brands of cars and have helped out my friends as well. I highly recommend Kelly Clark Automotive Specialists.
