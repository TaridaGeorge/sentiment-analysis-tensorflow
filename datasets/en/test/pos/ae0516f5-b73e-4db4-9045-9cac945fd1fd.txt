Went to Cafe Bink for lunch on Saturday, and it was one of the best lunches I have had in a long time!  We had a bottle of chanpagne and a sandwich each.  My friend had the White cheddar grilled cheese and I had the Corned Beef sandwich.  His grilled cheese was full of flavor and I cannot tell you how great my corned beef was....We also had the french fries which have to be the best french fries I have ever had!  They are cooked 3 times before arriving at your table and served with three dipping sauces.  With our lunch we split a bottle of Baumard which was perfect with both sandwiches.  Also, the service was great.  Highly recommend Cafe Bink!
