Excellent place.  I have eaten here several times and the place is always busy.  The sushi is good and you can order things that are not on the menu if you know what you want.  I have a friend who works for Intel with a lot of Asians and they frequent this place a lot, which is how I came to discover this place. 

The prices are good and are much cheaper than the RA or Kona when you take into account how big the portions are.
