I was delighted with this place upon reading its name.  I went in to visit and the delightful smell of Cheba Hut immediately captured me... The fresh smell of ingredients and the slight hint of Oregano will capture you upon entrance.  While the dining area is quite small, the pot memorabilia around the shop makes for great decor.  haha.  I had the white widow, but subtituted the ingredients for shredded cheddar, red onion, lettuce, tomato, cucumber, pickle, salt, pepper, and oregano.  This was THE best white widow I'VE ever had. hahaha.  But yeah, great food, great price, great place.   They've earned themselves a new customer, not because of the great atmoshpere, but because the sub I had was better than any other sub places around, bar none!  Highly recommend it!!!
