Food is super tasty! Can't go wrong with the turkey panini with pesto or bruschetta with prosciutto, figs & Mascarpone cheese. Mouth watering just thinking about it. Sundays during 11-3 they offer cool laid back tunes by Walt Richardson and $5 refreshing white sangria. A great way to relax at the end of the weekend.
