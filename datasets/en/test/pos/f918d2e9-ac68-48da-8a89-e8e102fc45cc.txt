What can I say? This place is just money. 
We've come here several times and just keep coming back despite the fact it isn't that close to home--but it is always worth the drive. 
The adventurous flavors make this place really interesting compared to other places in town - truly creative... some example are Chocolate Rosemary, Watermelon & Chocolate Chip, Blue Cheese and Fig (my wife's new addiction), and many many others (have no fear, plenty of traditional flavors as well). Foodies will love this place. 
The owner is so sweet too - she really makes the experience special. 
My wife has a sweet tooth and a passion for ice cream/gelato, and this is pretty much the only place she ever wants to go anymore (and we've been to a lot).
