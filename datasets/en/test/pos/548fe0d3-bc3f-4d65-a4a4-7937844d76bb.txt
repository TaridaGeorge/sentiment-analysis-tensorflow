I have had 3 root canals and 3 crowns from Dr Lee in the past 2 years and I can say every experience has been outstanding.  I have never been a big fan of Dentists or root canals, but Dr Lee makes you feel comfortable in his beautiful office and I virtually felt no pain for any of the procedures.  I would highly recommend Dr Lee over any dentist I have ever seen in my life!
