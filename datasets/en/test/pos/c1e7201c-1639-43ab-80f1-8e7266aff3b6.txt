ALTERNATIVE!!

That's what this place is and in the land of BIG chains, this only could add some spice. We were welcomed here to the free screening of Dale and Tucker Vs Evil as part of a Yelp event. The personnel is totally committed to their project. 

If you are looking some retro movies or the gender I don't enjoy (but others do - horror), this is a good alternative.
