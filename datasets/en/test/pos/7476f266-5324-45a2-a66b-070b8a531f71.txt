My wife and I stayed here with our two boys while boating at Lake Pleasant and we couldn't say enough good about this hotel!  Booked 2 nights and ended up staying 3; very enjoyable stay!  Rooms were clean, beds were comfortable, and plenty of room to enjoy time with friends after the lake!  The staff was top notch and really set the bar high, even compared to other substandard so called 5 star hotels.  The front desk always greeted us when arriving and leaving the hotel.  The housing staff always had the room clean for our return and the complimentary (hot) breakfast was pretty dang good!  While eating our breakfast one morning, the cook brought out Transformer goody bags (like you'd get a birthday party with little toys in them) for our boys....they absolutely loved it; very cool and way above and beyond!
