This is my favorite place to visit for some delicious fruit, sandwiches, and incredibly friendly people. Upon entering, the staff will offer you free samples of the fruit they have to offer. I enjoy picking up local or organic fruits and vegetables and supporting the last remaining fruit stand left along Baseline Rd. Before the push to build along South Mountain, there were several others that lined the street. When the City of Phoenix widened the road, they took away the left hand turn to make it easily into the parking lot. I refuse to let such an inconvenience keep me from a place that I share with all of my friends, when I can get the chance. If you want to support a local business, experience real hospitality, and find something delicious to eat then I highly recommend Summers Fruit Barn.
