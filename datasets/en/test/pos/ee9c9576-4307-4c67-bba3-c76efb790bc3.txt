As promised, I returned to Lobby's, tried their Chicago Dog and I am now giving them five stars. So far, that's the best Chicago Dog I've had in AZ. The only other thing they could have done better would have been to char the dog on the grill. Thanks again, guys! I'll be back soon to try the Italian sausage and the Maxwell!
