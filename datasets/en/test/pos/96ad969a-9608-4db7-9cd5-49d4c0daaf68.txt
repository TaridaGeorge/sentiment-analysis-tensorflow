First time visiting Tempe, and first time visiting WOB. After bouncing through a couple other bars on Mill Avenue, I landed at WOB. I must say, the staff and atmosphere made me feel much more comfortable than my earlier journeys that evening. I wouldn't call myself a beer enthusiast, but after our server brought us a flight of various samples, I was hooked! The atmosphere was GREAT, live music and a friendly crowd. I didn't realize the endless possibilities, and at first I was a bit overwhelmed. However, our server (who was extremely knowledgable on beer) pointed us in the right direction!  Highly recommend this place if your looking to have some fun on a night out,
