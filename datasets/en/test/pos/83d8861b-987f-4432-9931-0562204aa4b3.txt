TC Eggingtons is so Delish!! I go here for breakfast at least once every time I'm in Arizona. 
Where do I begin.. The apple jelly, the fresh orange juice, the giant blueberry pancake, and the most amazing omelette/frittata selection you can possible imagine. I highly suggest going with a group so you can sample eachothers food and split the blueberry hill pancake.
