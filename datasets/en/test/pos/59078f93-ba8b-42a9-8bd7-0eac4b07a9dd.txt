THis place is delicious. The first time I came I ordered the Cobb salad and it was great. The second time I came here I ordered the BLT with turkey and it was even more BANGIN'!!! Everyone I have brought to this restaurant has loved it.  I brought a work crowd here for lunch and it was the perfect setting. This is now my go-to restaurant whenever I'm hungry downtown.  Also, I learned that they validate parking in cityscape. Next time I won't park in the street!
