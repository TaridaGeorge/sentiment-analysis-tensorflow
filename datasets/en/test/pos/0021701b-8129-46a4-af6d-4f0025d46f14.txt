Even if you are not a fan of chain-restaurants, this is one to try. First tried has Brio's in Las Vegas and got excited when I move to Chandler and found there was one close. The "Artichoke Crusted Beef Medallions" dish was like butter! They also have a great patio with heaters, but they get pretty busy on weekends.
