Oh, how I miss Defalco's!!!! My saturday's were not complete without an eggplant parm sandwich. The chicken caesar pasta salad is delicious as well. It's all great and homemade. Waiting in line (there always is one) is so painful because you just want to eat everything. The aroma of the place is insane. The hot sandwiches take a few minutes and I am quite antsy but they are very worth the wait. They also stay well. I would always have to take half home and eat it later that night or the next day (sometimes even cold). Regardless, this place is sooooo good!!! I found it hard to find good authentic Italian anything and this was perfect!!!
