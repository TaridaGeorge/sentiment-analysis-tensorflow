We decided to go here due to a long wait at another hookah lounge. I was kinda hesitant to go in because I couldn't find any reviews on it. But decided to go anyways.

Glad we did. Their hookah is amazing & customer service is the best I've had at any hookah lounge. Hookah hit strong & never burned. The atmosphere was chill & the music was at the perfect level so that you could converse w/ friends.

Definitely will be returning.
