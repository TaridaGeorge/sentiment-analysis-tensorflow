Just great sandwiches!  IMO they serve the best gyros around.  Sandwiches are yummy and portions are hefty.  Salads always fresh.  It's a neighborhood gem and a quaint little place for so-much-better-than Fast Food!  Give this place a try but be sure to go when you're really hungry.  You'd be sad if you had to leave any part of your meal behind.  Go for lunch and you won't need dinner!
