This place rocks! I got the Gyoza and Oyako bowl for lunch  on Tuesday and I was immediately a fan. 

The gyoza is deep fried deliciousness and comes in pork or shrimp (I think? I opted for pork) and it is BOMB! 

And the Oyako was amazing, grilled chicken cooked perfectly, and blended with light eggs, veggies and rice that added a sweetness to the chicken and eggs. Amazing balance in this dish. Whole meal was like $10 too, and that includes a "medium" lemonade which is actually HUGE!! Seriously, get a small lol

All in all I greatly enjoyed myseld, and the service is off the charts. They do everything they possibly can to make sure you're enjoying your meal, and all with huge smiles on their face, like they enjoy their job or something. Weird lol
