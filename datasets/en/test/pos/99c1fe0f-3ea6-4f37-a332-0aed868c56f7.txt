Oregano's is my #1 favorite restaurant. While it's known for it's pizza (which is fabulous) I have to recommend the Pablo Picasso Salad. My mouth waters just thinking about it! You don't need to be a salad fan to enjoy this feast. If you don't like spicy, just ask for the dressing on the side and add as much or little as you like. But I've introduced this salad to many who were less than excited to try it, but coudln't stop talking about how wonderful it was after cleaning their plate.  Make sure to save some room for the pizookie!
