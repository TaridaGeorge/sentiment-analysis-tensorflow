The food is good (thumbs up for the taco salad) but the view is awesome. Sitting out on the patio & gazing out at the lake makes the meal that much better. The last time I was there we couldn't get lakeside seating because of a quincea√±era. Because of the view, it's an excellent place for parties, meetings, etc. I believe they also have karaoke.
