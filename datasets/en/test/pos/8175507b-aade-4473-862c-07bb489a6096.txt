why would you even want to change anything on the menu at noca??? by far and away some of the best paperdelle pasta i've ever had. great setting - not too big, not too small. and if you're going to bitch and complain about serving sizes, go read a fucking book about good cuisine - you don't need a full plate of this kind of food. you WANT to eat more than two courses. i highly recommend noca and will come back time and time again. No Option Can Accomodate better. ZING!
