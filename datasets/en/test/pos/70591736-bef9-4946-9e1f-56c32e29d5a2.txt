I came back last Saturday and ordered myself the orange chicken to go before meeting up with some friends that night. As always, the food was fantastic and my buddies are planning to stop by for lunch after they picked a few pieces off my plate. I hope you appreciate my sacrifice!

Also, the fried rice has improved, so they've actually gotten better. Think I'll head there for dinner tonight.
