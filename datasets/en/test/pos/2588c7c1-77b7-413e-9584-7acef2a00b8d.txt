Grrrrreat coffee shop!  Comfy couches.  Good coffee.  Great service.  Yoga.  Good breakfast bites.  Lots of space indoor and outside.  The beautiful landscaping with abundant flowers takes it far and beyond.  My wife and I absolutely loved the ecclectic decor and architecture including the spiral chimney, china chandelier, and especially the Alice in Wonderland themed rooms.  The sheet music tables were a nice touch too.    

I spent all my college years lounging and studying in coffee shops around Seattle and SF.  This place challenges, if not surpasses the best of them.  Really quite astounded to find such a gem while here on vacation.  Had to come every day while in Mesa!!
