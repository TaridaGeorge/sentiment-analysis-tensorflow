I think this place really exceeds at doing what they set out to do.  The gelato tastes great, the presentation is gorgeous, and the staff always seems very accommodating and friendly.

I only give it 4 stars because the location doesn't really seem convenient enough for me to go as often as I'd like - the parking can be difficult, and it is not walking distance from very many night spots.  If this were in downtown Scottsdale, Tempe, or Phoenix it would be perfect.

1/22/08 Update - I'm increasing my rating to 5 stars since they have since opened up new locations, one of them being Old Town Scottsdale.
