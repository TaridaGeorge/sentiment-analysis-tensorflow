This place is a tough to find gem. It is tucked away near the City of Scottsdale offices and is much diff than your average lunch spot. The space is beautiful and I feel like I am eating in a art gallery. The menu is not huge, but they do a great job with what they have. Ingredients taste fresh and food is delicious. Highly recommended.
