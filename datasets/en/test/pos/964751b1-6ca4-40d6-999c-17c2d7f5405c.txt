hallelujah- there is some pork up here in the north(kinda)west valley!  My favorite thing about this place is that you can buy the pork by the pound.  I think it's about $14, which sounds a bit spendy, but it is worth it.   The sandwiches are amazing.  If you are in the area and want a hefty lunch- you gotta go to Pork on a Fork!
