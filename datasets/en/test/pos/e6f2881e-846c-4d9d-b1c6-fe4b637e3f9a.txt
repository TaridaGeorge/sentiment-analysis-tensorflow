Malee's is one of my favorite restaurants in The Valley. It's the type of place we need more of; good, friendly service, tasty ethnic food, and a very urban feel that might make you forget you're in a suburb.

Everything I've ever had on the menu has been delicious, and the interior is comfortable and cool. The best thing about Malee's is that it's hip without trying to be.
