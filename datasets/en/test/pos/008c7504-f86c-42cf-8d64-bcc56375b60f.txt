What a find!  The first time I walked into the place I saw handmade clothes, jewelry, pottery, shoulder bags & coffee.  The back section had health and beauty creations from soaps to hair care products all locally made.  The coffee is great and I like the hummus and flax seed crackers since I'm gluten intolerant.  Usually I go into the library and browse the Internet and read some of the zines people have written like, "Jail Stories."  This place is such a good spot that I bring everyone from out of town to it.  One person described Conspire as an artist collective akin to those found in Seattle or Portland.  Da bomb for shiz.
