Christy is an amazing cake artist.  She has an impressive portfolio as she has a flair for creativity.  Her cakes are amazing and are truly one-of-a-kind.  She also has several delicious cake flavors to choose from or she can create one for you.   She has made several cakes for our family and I have been impressed with everyone of them.  I was also excited to see her compete on TLC's Ultimate Cake Off show early this spring.  If you're looking for a sculpted cake or one that will be the center of attention at your next party, then I recommend you call Phoenix Cake Company.
