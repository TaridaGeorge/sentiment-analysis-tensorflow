This place is fantastic. The service here is the best I've had in a long time. They really treat you like an honored guest. The food is also amazing! It certainly is a carnivores delight. While EVERYTHING was delicious, the stand outs for me were the bacon wrapped Filet Mignon and the their juicy garlicky signature sirloin. Just so you don't O.D. on meat they do also have a wonderful salad bar which has various peppers, cheeses, and cured meats in addition to the good selection vegetables.
