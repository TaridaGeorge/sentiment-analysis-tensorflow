Go here! It's a big bakery, mostly Mexican treats with some American too. The staff is friendly and the bakery cases are full of beautiful pastries and cookies, and just ask for a dozen flour tortillas and they're handed to you still warm.
The pan dulce is offered in every variety and my favorite, the crescent- shaped covered in sugar and cinnamon (sorry I don't know the proper name), is the BEST I've had.
