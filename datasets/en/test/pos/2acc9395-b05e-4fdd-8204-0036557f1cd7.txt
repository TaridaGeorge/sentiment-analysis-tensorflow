I absolutly love this place.  I live in Chandler, go to MCC (there is a Cheeba Hut right across the street), but I travel the 20 mins to go to the Tempe store.  The people here are awesome.  They make you feel like a friend, not just a customer.  Everytime I go in the employees introduce themselves, let you take as much time as you need, and will answer 1001 questions without getting impatient.  They know exactly how to make the perfect sandwich.  I tell them to make it how they think its good and they are always excellent.  If you are visiting AZ YOU MUST GO! They not only offer great eats but an aptmosphere you will never forget.
