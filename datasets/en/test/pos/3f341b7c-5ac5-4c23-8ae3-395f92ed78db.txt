Dr. Mitchell is awesome!  After suffering 6 months due to an injury... having gone to the doctor weekly, bi weekly, taking meds, completeing 2 months of physical therapy, chiropractic care, and massage therapy... he relieved the majority of my pain in just 1 visit.  I can't recommend his practice highly enough!  His staff is awesome.  The location is clean and comfortable.  It's funny how after living with pain for so long, you don't know what it's like to not be in pain... my attitude about life has improved tremendously!
