Delicious!
I just tried this place last night, and let me say the boyfriend and I were DEFINITELY impressed. I got a delicious Machaca & Tomatillo Chimi, and he got.. well I dont remember what it was actually haha. The chimichanga was amazing, and I love black beans and the rice was pretty good as well. Boyfriend thought his was spicy, which was impressive because he likes spicier things. We both thought the dishes were very flavorful. We also ordered the chips and salsa, and I am not sure what the salsas were called but the green salsa, Im assuming possibly jalapenos was SO good! It was the perfect mix of sweet and spicy. Our waitress was very attentive, and very nice. So the service was good, and we will definitely be back!
