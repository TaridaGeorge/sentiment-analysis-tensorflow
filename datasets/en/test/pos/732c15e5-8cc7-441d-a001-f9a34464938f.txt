I attended here both for my undergrad and grad degrees, and this fall I will be attending as an instructor. I recommend this school (and specifically this campus) to every college-bound person I know. The small campus and classes allows for a very personalized education. You always have access to your instructors, and all of them are very personable and friendly. There's a gym, a cafeteria, a starbucks (of course), a graduate study lounge...everything you need for the complete college experience. 

I would highly recommended not underestimating the promptness of the parking meter employees.
