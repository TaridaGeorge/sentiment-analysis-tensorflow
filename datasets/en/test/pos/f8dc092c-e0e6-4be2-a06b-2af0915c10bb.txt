I've been using DRAH for over 5 years and have no plans to ever change. Every staff member is highly attentive and caring to both you and your pets' needs. No question is too trivial for them. I have COMPLETE confidence in DRAH and encourage anyone to give them a try ... You'll make them your permanent veterinary service.
