Like Mary Poppins, the Gelato Spot is "practically perfect in every way" (I know it's a weird reference, but have I mentioned I live with a 2 year old). Delicious gelato. Yummy, yummy tea. Incredible bend-over-backward-friendly service.Great hours. Always crowded but worth the wait. This is for sure my favorite place to go for a treat. 5 stars all the way.

UPDATE: They no longer have a wide selection of tea at Gelato Spot (boo hoo hoo) buuuut they have this heavenly new thing (some italian word that starts with an A... sorry, can't remember what it is called exactly) that is essentially all I want in a dessert.... gelato with a shot of espresso poured over it....omg... so good, and invigorating... you must try this if you are a coffee freak like me!!
