Good, but not incredible (for me). I had a hot fudge Sunday and the kids got cotton candy ice cream which they loved!!!  The place had a funky smell to it too but since my wife loved her ice cream sooooo much ... she is making me give it a 5 star ... for me it was close ... 4 stars, but gotta listen to the boss ....right?
