I'm not much for going out. But I LOVE SideBar. And I always have to ask myself why.

It's overpriced, the food is meh, BUT...

The bizarro movies on the screens ROCK! I'm either trying to figure out what's going on or what the name is so I can watch it later.

And most important, the men who go there are GORGEOUS in both personality and physical appearance. I'm quite shy but somehow I end up chatting with someone for a couple of hours when I'm there. That's without the alleged benefit of Dutch courage.

Easily a place to go where I can grab a nice drink by myself and either not be bothered or be bothered... depending on my mood.
