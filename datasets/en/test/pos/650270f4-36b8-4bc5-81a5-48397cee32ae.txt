After finding Ryan's on yelp I decided to check it out.  First off I was a little thrown off at walking through the warehouse but they have super helpful and friendly staff!  I FINALLY found a leash a collar set I adore and at $15 (after tax) for them you can't beat it!  I scored a great collection of new toys, an AWESOME set of nail clippers and a very useful travel dog water/food dish all for $38!

I will be making trips there regularly.
