Camelback Mountain
ONE MOUNTAIN W/ 2 FANTASTIC TRAILS...
Echo Canyon & Cholla trail - 64th St (Invergordon).
Both offer amazing splendid scenery & a fantastic workout. 

This is one of my favorite thing about living in Phoenix!

Caution! I've seen many people get helicoptered off this mountain!

#1 reason heart attacks! This mountain is not the treadmill/stair master/eliptical training machine!

#2 reason broken bones  Slippery trails w/ loose gravel, rocks, cliffs. & e rough sharp edges. The most dangarous thing about this mountain though is the idiots who pay attention to no one... A combination of obnoxious loud talkers, cell phone users and pushy runners!
Just use caution and you'll be fine.

I personally like to hike it mid-week & not on holidays inorder to find a little solitude...
