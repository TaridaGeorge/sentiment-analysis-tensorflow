Pretty sure I died and went to sushi heaven after eating here last night! Sat down at the sushi bar and had the most entertaining sushi chefs! I tried their recommendations of the hirame (winter halibut) and rotate (sea scallops), both sashimi style was out of this world!! Freshest and best selection I have enjoyed in a long time!! For drinks, went with hot sake but they do serve quite a collection of wine, specialty drinks (which I will have to try next time) and other sakes.
Expensive but worth it!! Location, ambiance and food here made for a great evening!
Thank you Sushi Roku!
