Great hummus and shallot dip (the added currants are a nice touch).  The koobideh is very juicy and well seasoned, and the albalo polo is very good.  We also shared a stew that was filled with chunks of meat.  Service was attentive as well.  Only bad thing about this place is its location, it's sort of out of the way unless you live in East Scottsdale.
