I am a new patient to Sonoran Hills Dental.  I have got to say the treatment was first class.  From the reception desk, dental hygienist, all the way up to Dr. Ito.  I was treated with respect, which is huge with me.  Every procedure was explained thoroughly and if I had any questions......they listened and took the time to answer my questions.  Dr Ito was caring and warm and seemed like a "down to earth" kind of man.  I would recommend my new dental office to anybody that looks for any of the qualities above.
