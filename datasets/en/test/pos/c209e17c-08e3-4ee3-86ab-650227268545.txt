This is hands down, the best nail salon I have ever been to in AZ. The staff is very professional, hard working, kind and best of all clean! The salon is very beautifully decorated, so relaxing and again the #1 this salon is CLEAN! Michelle, is wonderful and doing a fantastic job making sure of customer satisfaction and return business. They want you to be more than satisfied, they want to put a smile on your face. My sister and I are now regulars, we always look forward to our mani-pedi's! Give them a try and you'll become a regular. Can't wait for my next visit!
