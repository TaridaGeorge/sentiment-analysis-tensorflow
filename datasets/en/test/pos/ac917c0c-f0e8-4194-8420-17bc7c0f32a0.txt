I have been told by several Arizonians that I must try Pita Jungle! And it is simply amazing! I have been to a lot of mediterranean restaurants and this truly tops my experiences of them all. The food is awesome! Absolutely everything on the menu sounds delicious! The cilantro jalapeno hummus I had is outstanding! You must order this when you go. Simply amazing. Every ingredient is so flavorful and the food just melts in your mouth. You must GO!
