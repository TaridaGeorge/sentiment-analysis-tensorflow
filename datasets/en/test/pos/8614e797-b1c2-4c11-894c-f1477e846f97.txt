This is date night restaurant...  Nice sitting outside, cozy and nice music.  I love their drinks and they always have the best fish dishes.  The staff is best in town and the new owners are very fun.  

The have the best meat loaf in town and they make it up very pretty with green chiles, yes green chiles.  We are regulars there and they spoil us on our favorite drinks and dishes.  Spot on!
