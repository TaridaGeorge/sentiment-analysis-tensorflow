This place was awesome! We ordered 5 different things and loved them all except one! Great atmosphere, awesome service and friendly people. We had the hot pot, lettuce wraps, some short ribs (dont remember the dish title) ramen and marsala (this is the one we didnt care for) Interesting unique flavors. Also, very inexpensive! We ate like kings and only spent about $30
