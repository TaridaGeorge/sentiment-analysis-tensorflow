So the pool store we had been going to closed. Bummer. 

Fortunately we remembered this place was right up the street from our house! 

Its super old school in there. Nothing fancy, but they have all the chemicals you could need and they also work on your pool pumps and vacuums right there so that's handy! 

Our pool developed the black algae :( We took in pictures and a sample of our water and they set us straight. Black algae was wiped out and pool is back to new! 

We will definitely be making this our new pool go to place.
