Love the outdoor patio. Sat out there on Sunday with a few girlfriends, had a couple drinks. The bloody mary is HUGE! Great drinks, good prices, and excellent service. I can't remember our waitresses name, but she was a cool chicka. From Chicago, very sweet and totally friendly. Will go back again very soon.
