BEST SUSHI IN SCOTTSDALE!!! Great Drinks! The owner Tami is the best, remebers all her guests and what they like to drink! It's hip, sexy and atmosphere is awesome, Can go for an intimate dinner or with a group of friends. Or just go to watch a Laker game! Ok, suns game. lol. They food is fresh and I've been coming here since day one! Now that I live in Los Angeles, i still make at least a couplle trips a year to this place! I miss my Pearl Sushi! This place is the best!
