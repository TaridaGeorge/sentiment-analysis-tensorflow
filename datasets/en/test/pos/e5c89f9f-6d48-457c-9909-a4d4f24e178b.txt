I beg to differ, dude.  Here on holiday and let's just say, Chompie's is better than the average chipotle lovin, brain boiling sad excuse for a seafood restaurant place in BFE (AZ)!!!!

I've only been to this one location and from the taste of it, it was one of a kind!  The first time we went I got the latkes (yum, best ones I've had that weren't home cookin) and the second time I went for the hot pastrami sandwich (so good)!!  The bread was a little soggy, so if you go for it, do it right and ask for the bread to be extra toasty...  Overall, good place.  I wish we had a nice reasonably priced jewish deli where we lived!!
