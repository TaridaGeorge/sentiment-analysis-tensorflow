Carly's is in a very unassuming little building in the downtown area of Phoenix. There are two doors, but only one works. For people like me, that can be a bit of an embarrassment.

The bartender was quick to come and offer me a drink. They have quite a wide range of beers and ales to choose from.
I chose a Guiness because, well, it's Guiness.

After some conversation I decided it was time to eat.

I ordered the cuban.

Two words; GREAT Cuban!

Seriously, that was one of the best sandwiches I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing.

Evar!

The cost was quite reasonable, great food, great beer selection, they have private parking, and it's downtown. What more can you ask?
