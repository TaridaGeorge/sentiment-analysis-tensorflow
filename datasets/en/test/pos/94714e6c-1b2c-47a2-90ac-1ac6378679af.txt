What is it about a location that is so attracting? 
well for starters attractive clientele. 
great food 
great drinks 

Postinos is awesome, i love the beautiful ladies that go drink and eat there. I love the food and beer/wine selection, and the extremely attractive ladies that go there...oh did i say that already 

i have to say i wasn't going there on Wednesdays because they had live music there but last night i was informed that it has stoped..so with that said i do give this a four thumbs up location..(two hand thumbs and two toe thumbs up) 

i venture often to people watch and enjoy a good salad 
try their raspberry salad..
