It's not secret that I love LGO and the fact that now I can enjoy a commuter breakfast sandwich while waiting for my flight is amazing! This is LGO airport-edition so it lacks the charm that the actual LGO has, but it has much more charm than an airport restaurant should! The food tastes exactly the same, the prices are the same, the service is the same and they are very fast! 

I visited for breakfast and enjoyed the commuter sandwich but noticed that they have a wood-fired oven to make their well-known pizzas and they have a full menu of LGO favorites including all their breakfast, lunch and dinner offerings. They also have the cookies, baked goods and pre-made sandwiches. 

LGO is located at gate D and it's worth visiting regardless of your location in Terminal Four!
