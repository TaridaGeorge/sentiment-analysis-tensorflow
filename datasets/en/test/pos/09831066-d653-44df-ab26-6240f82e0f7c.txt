Yum.   My girlfriend who is from Chicago initially introduced me to this place.     For the longest time it was a once-in-awhile treat whenever I went down to Tucson but now its finally here, just down the street.    Now that there are Jimmy John's in the Valley, there is absolutely no good reason to go to Subway whatsoever.     Better bread, better meat, better cheese, Jimmy Johns is awesome!
