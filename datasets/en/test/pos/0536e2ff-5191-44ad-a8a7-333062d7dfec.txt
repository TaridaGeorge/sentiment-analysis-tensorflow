Believe the hype.  What sets this place apart is the fact that the flavors don't just taste "like" cheese, peanut butter, mint, lime/basil etc. - they are actually made of those ingredients.  The cheese plate duo ice cream is tasty but I don't see myself ordering a whole bowl of it any time soon.  Still, plenty of delicious flavors to choose from.  The staff were friendly and helpful, allowing us to sample many of the goods.  When it was decision time I committed to the coconut sorbet.  It was somehow creamy and light tasting at the same time.  Cute seating area too.
