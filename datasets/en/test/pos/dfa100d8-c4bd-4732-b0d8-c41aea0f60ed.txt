This is a follow up to my earlier review. on 4/5/2012. 

I just went to my second appointment with L for L and I am loving it! This time, I was only flushed for about 2 hours, and it didn't hurt nearly as much. No blistering, either. My technician, Lindsay Black, was extra careful as I told her about my last painful experience. She also made sure to zap the  fine hairs on the back of my forearms. Lindsay was very professional and did  not rush although they were running about 10 minutes behind today. She got both arms done in about 20 minutes. 
I have almost no hair regrowth at this point and my skin is so soft. I only wish I had gone to L for L years ago instead of bothering with waxing, bleaching, and shaving for so long.
