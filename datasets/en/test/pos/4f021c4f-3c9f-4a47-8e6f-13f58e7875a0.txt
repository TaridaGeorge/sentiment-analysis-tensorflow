came here for the first time on my birthday.  Took the wine 101 class. its on a monday night at 6pm. It was sooo much fun and I learned so much.  The wine was all really great and it came with delicious little pairings for each different glass.  The women who taught the class was great. I feel back I can't remember her name but she was so cute and was super knowledgable.  The best part its very reasonably prices so I love that
