I took my senior dog to Hopi last week because I thought her regular vet had become a little blas√© about her condition.  She's arthritic and just seems uncomfortable, but still full of energy.  I want to make sure she's comfortable and happy in her last years.  I just moved to the area and drove by Hopi Animal Hospital and thought I'd give it a go.  I also found a coupon in my money mailer, so that sealed the deal.
Scheduling was easy, they got us in the next afternoon.  I didn't have to wait very long at all.  Big, beautiful lobby.  And the coolest, most personable vet I've ever come across. Dr. Pruden. So sweet and compassionate.  My dog is pretty easy to please, so I'm sure she'd give the same rating.  Honestly, I'd refer anyone and everone here.
