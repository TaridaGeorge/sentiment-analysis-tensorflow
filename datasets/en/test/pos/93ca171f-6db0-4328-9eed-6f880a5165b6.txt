The downside is you'll never buy teabags in the grocery store again. The upside is there's hundreds of different teas, blends, and flavors to try - pick a couple you think you'll like and get samples of some others and your morning tea will never be the same. 

You can also find all the assorted 'stuff' to store, brew and enjoy tea.  At first, it may seem you're paying more for tea than you're used to - but as you begin to enjoy the value of bulk teas instead of overpackaged mass produced teabags - you'll find it's well worth the trip to downtown Scottsdale because it's that much better.
