I really like the new Vig.  Mondays are a great day to check it out as it's $5 burger day and the Vigazz burger with an egg on top is amazing!  Can't beat the indoor Bocci Ball court.  Free valet is nice also considering the continued the Vig tradition of barely any parking.  I'll definitely be headed back
