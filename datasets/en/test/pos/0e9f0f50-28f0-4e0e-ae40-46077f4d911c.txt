I attended one of her classes for pressure cookers, and had to leave with one. Luckily, she offers great discounts after her classes!

Since then I have also gotten a bosch mixer (don't know how I lived without one all these years!) and also a wheat grinder. Everytime I go in here I find something I can't live without!

Shar has great classes, and tips on how to utilize all her products. Well worth it to attend a class. I just wish the store was closer to Glendale!

So glad I found shar's, now my family enjoys homemade wheat bread and pizzas and all sorts of yummy things that are good for them too!
