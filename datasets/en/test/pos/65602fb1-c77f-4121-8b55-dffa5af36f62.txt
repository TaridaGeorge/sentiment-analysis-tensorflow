Windy at Kelly's Critter Clips does a fantastic job on our dog.

Stanley is a little neurotic, but she manages him well and he looks adorable when he's done. He gets a full schnauzer clip and hers is the best he's ever had. The price is very reasonable too. We've been taking him to her for almost 2 years and have always been pleased.
