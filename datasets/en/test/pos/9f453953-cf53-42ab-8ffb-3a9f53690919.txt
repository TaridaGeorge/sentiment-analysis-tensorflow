I met a couple friends here last Wednesday night. This place has a calm vibe to it.  The decor is modern but the strategically placed candles/lighting, fire pit, and Latin World Music playing in the background give this place a warm European feel. I did not get to see much of the inside.  Check out the web-site's slide show.

I tried South American beer for the first time. Very good! And we split a Bruschetta plate. Also very good!  

If you want to enjoy a great place with a great patio (before the scorching heat hits) then get over to Bomberos. 

I will do this place again and again!
