Quite simply, if you know Vietnamese food, you know this is great food.  If you don't know about it and want to learn, please go here and ask.  They will teach you about it- and you should try it.  I crave it now!  They have another restaurant in Virginia and have been restauranteur-ing for years.  A complete family operation and truly authentic and home cooked food.  Located in the Mekong Plaza next to the entrance to the supermarket. Enjoy!
