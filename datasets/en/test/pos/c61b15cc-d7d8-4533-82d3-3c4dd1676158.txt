Could there be a cuter store?? I mean really, could there be? I think not! 

This place is stupendous. It's a foodie's wet dream. It's a brunch-goer's happy place. It's a latte lover's paradise and why, oh why, can't it be in MY hometown. Seriously, I would live here just for the gourmet goodies alone and then add the stellar menu of deelish goodies like croque madammes, fig pizza, creamy yummy oatmeal and a latte with liquid raw sugar! AWESOME.

You have a loyal Los Angeles fan La Grande Orange and I will be back, oh yes, I will! :)
