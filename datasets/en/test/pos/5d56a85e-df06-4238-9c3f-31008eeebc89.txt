This is my favorite gym in the valley. I've been a member here for like ever. Thier classes are the best. Cycle at 5:45am is the best. The kickboxking used to be the best but that one guy left and now I never go to kickboxing anymore. 
The equipment upstairs is great. I personally like the older version of elipicals seemingly meant for taller people. The pool at this location is also good because its away from most of the gym. 
I've never gotten weird perverted looks at this gym.
I like how they remodeled the locker rooms. The sauna is great.
My favorite gym :)
