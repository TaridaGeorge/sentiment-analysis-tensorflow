Yummmmmmmmmmmmm

We went here on Mothers Day, and man am I glad we had reservations! Even with reservations we still had to wait at least 10 minutes to be seated, they were hoppin in there! 

Once we were seated our wiatress was quick to take our drink order. 

I ordered the griddled corn cakes and that has all I have thoguht about since taking my last bite. They were beyond amazing! 

I have never been here for brunch before but think I will need to go back very soon! Such a great brunch to honor an awesome mother in law!
