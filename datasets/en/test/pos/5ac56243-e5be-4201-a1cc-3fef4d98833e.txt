Casa Grande was a blast to see.  It's a really humbling experience to view the ruins and see what an ancient civilization was able to construct without all of the modern tools that we use.  The surrounding area is very nice and the site is punctuated by informative signs printed with what we know about the Hohokam people.  A must visit!
