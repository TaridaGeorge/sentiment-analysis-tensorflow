Duuude! The hamburger here is one of the best in the Valley. I forgot which Yelper recommended it to me, but he was right. Just very good, high-quality ingredients -- and the right amount of them. Soft, flavorful bun. Fresh, hand-formed, patties. Mmmm!

Oh yeah, the BBQ here is good too. Their sauce is great; and they serve it in heated containers so it doesn't get your food cold. Try the BBQ Chicken sandwich -- with fries or coleslaw because both are top notch.

Lastly, if you check in with your phone, you'll see a 10% discount to Yelpers if you mention it.
