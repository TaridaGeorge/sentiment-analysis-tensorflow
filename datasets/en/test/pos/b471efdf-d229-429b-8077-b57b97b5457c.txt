I'd never thought I write about a doctor's visit. But Dr. Shay is an amazing woman. She handled my ultrasound and prenatal visit with so much professionalism. She expressed her personal thoughts at the same time (let's say we had a long discussion/tangents about raising children) that I found priceless. Concerns that I had with both my body and future were both addressed, and she answered my questions before I could think of them. I think it's funny that most doctor's visits, they hardly look at you, rush you in and out. and claim at the same time 'people is who they care about'. Dr. Shay actually showed me they're not all like that.
