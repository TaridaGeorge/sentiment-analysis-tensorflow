My picks:

Chateau Ste. Michelle Indian Wells, Merlot
Grilled Steak & Cremini Mushroom Flatbread
Grilled Boneless Rainbow Trout
Mini Indulgences (you may need to try all of them)

I am so glad to have another new restaurant choice at the Biltmore.  This restaurant is absolutely gorgeous inside and the staff is amazing!  This is sure to be an instant hit when they open to public on 10/25. I was stoked to get a sneak peak of this place and try a few thing before they opened.  Did I mention that everything on the menu is 475 calories or less?
