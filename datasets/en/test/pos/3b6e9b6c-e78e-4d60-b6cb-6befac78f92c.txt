I had them paint some fenders for my truck and they were awesome!  They are a family owned business and you can tell they take pride in doing a good job and going beyond what is required.  Also they were alot cheaper than the other places I called.  I felt like I was getting an honest price, not the same case with the other auto body shops i called, when I got the "ummm that will be about $500" I knew they were sizing me up.  Anyway you can go to Painters and fell good about the price and feel good about leaving your car with them.
