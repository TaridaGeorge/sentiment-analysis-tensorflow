Came back the very next day and brought 4 coworkers with me.  Tried the tortas which was great and filling.  Friends all liked it too.  Everyone said they would be back and excited to have a new restaurant in the hood to put in rotation.  One person said she was thinking of stopping on the way home to get dinner to go.
