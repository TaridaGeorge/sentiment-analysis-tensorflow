Roy's defines all that is good about fine dining. In fine dining it is about more than just good food. It is the entire experience, which I have everytime I go there. The food is magnificent, the Lakinilau roll (I doubt I spelled that right) is to DIE FOR! The entrees are always magnificent, they have the best sushi chef in the valley. The desserts are amazing, try any of the special creme brulee's or their signature chocolate souflee.
Besides the food, the staff always makes our night memorable and delicious! The service staff are on top of everything and the management always make every attempt to keep us happy. Many times I will just come in to sit at the bar for cocktails (yummy Hawaiian Martini) and appetizers!
I love Roy's!
