So, I was irritated because someone told me that my passenger headlight was out (ignorance can be bliss).  I went to Sun Devil Auto Parts on a whim, and the not so kind dude told me that my headlight number was odd and I'd likely have to go to the dealer and pay the big bucks.  Despite his scare tactics and general stupidity, he did suggest I go over to the auto parts store next door.

Luckily, I decides to try it.  A lovely girl (Miranda?) helped me find the right headlight and even put it in for me!  We had a nice little chat about how mechanics shouldn't take advantage of people and then I fell in love with her.

I'll be heading here any time I have a question about a quick fix repair for my little hatchback.
