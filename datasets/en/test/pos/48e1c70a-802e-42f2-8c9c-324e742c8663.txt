I love Postino. I love it so much. I am here much more often than I'd like to admit and I just wanted to remind everyone of how much I love it. 

The food is delicious and the service is always excellent. Jenny is our personal favorite...she's prompt, friendly, and never misses a beat. Plus, she always remembers us (even when we're not in her section). =)

See you next week!
