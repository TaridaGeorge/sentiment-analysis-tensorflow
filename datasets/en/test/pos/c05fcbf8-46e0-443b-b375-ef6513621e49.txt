I had heard about chicken & waffles for a long time, and never had an opportunity to try them. 
When I had them at LoLo's in Scottsdale I was NOT disappointed. 
The fried chicken was among the best I have ever had. It was like being in the south.
When you follow the fried chicken with a tasty huge waffle, it's like dessert, but better.
I can't wait to go back
