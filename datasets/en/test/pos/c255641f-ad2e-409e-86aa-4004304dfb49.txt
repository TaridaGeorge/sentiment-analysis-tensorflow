This place Knocked it Out of the Ballpark !!  THANK YOU !

I walked in the door and was greeted by a very professional and seasoned hostess.  I was given an option of the dining room or lounge which ironically is why I was at their restaurant.  I was not offered such in one of their competitors restaurants just shortly before.  I'm glad I decided to walk out of that place and come to The Keg.

The food was phenomenal and the service even better!  I had the Prime Rib.  Everything from the Wedge salad, dinner bread, entree and sides were nothing short of awesome!  

The service was so incredible that I tipped the server 50% of the check.

Thank you The Keg ... I'll be back soon !
