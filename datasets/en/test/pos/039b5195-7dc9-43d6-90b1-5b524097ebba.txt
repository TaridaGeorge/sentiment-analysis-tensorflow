Oregano's not Great tasting food, a large menu (both literally and figuratively), large servings and a reasonable price.  But like I like the most are very friendly servers and hostesses.

As an employer, I was curious about how Oregano's can consistently hire such friendly people, that genuinely seem to enjoy their jobs, soni have asked on a couple of occasions about how they do it.  Unfortunately, the answer I keep getting is that they interview for that characteristic.  While I am sure that is true, it did not explain how they are able hire so well, where other companies have not.
