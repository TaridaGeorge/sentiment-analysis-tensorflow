This has definitely become our go-to ice cream place! We love the local feel.  It's neat that they have both couches and regular tables to sit at. The people working there are super friendly and super helpful. Oh, and the ice cream is fantastic. :) My favorite was during the holiday season when they had pumpkin pie ice cream!!! Why, oh why, can't that be a year-round flavor?!

Anyway, did I mention they deliver??? An ice cream place that delivers? Are you serious? I think my life may be complete now! I think we're just outside their delivery range, sadly. But it's still cool!
