How can you not like the library?  Especially when its as cool as this one?  Ive been here twice now, and absolutely love seeing the arcitectural masterpeice that it is.  Made out of steel and glass, its a jewel of a place.  Glass elevators, reflection pools, and art throughout the place thats lovely to look at.

If all the libaries were like this, people would come more often.  They have 5 floors, and each one has its own special purpose.  Will return in the future.
