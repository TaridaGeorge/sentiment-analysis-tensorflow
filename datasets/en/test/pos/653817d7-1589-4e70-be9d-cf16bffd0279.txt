I've lived in New York and LA..both major cities with lots of good hairstylists. This is by far the best hair cut I've ever had. I actually took pictures afterwards in order to show to my stylist in DC. 
The environment is ok but could be even classier. It's a guy's guy kind of place--with foozball table and a pool table. I didn't partake of the beer or wine but it's always a good idea. 
Julie, the owner, is amazing and followed my instructions but, more importantly, she improvised based on my requests. I have some...er, um...thinning hair on top and Julie did a great job giving me a haircut which didn't accentuate that. 
I'd fly back in to Phoenix just to go here.
