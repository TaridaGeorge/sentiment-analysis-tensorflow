Dr Woodbury and his staff are 100% professional.   Everyone in the office from the receptionist to the hygienists to Dr Woodbury are super friendly and super competent.   This is not a big operation with a bunch of anonymous actors...it's just Dr Woodbury, a couple of hygienists and the receptionist.   Dr Woodbury gives you an honest evaluation of your dental health...ie: work that needs to be done vs work that should be done to work that will need to be done in the future.  There's no pushing to get work done.   I went without dental care for many years because I couldn't find a dentist that I felt was honest,  competent, and friendly.   I read reviews of Dr Woodbury on several sites and decided to give him a try...and I'm 100% happy with my choice.  You will be too.
