Had my wedding reception at the Steele Herb Garden and loved every moment and aspect of it. The space is newly updated and DBG did such a great job with it. It smelled lovely and fresh. This space sat 75 (and some) comfortably. Conveniently located is a building in the space for the Bridal Party to get ready in and back parking lot to unload all our supplies. 

The Garden is such a sight for guests especially those from out of town. The cacti exhibits are larger than life and the entire Garden captures the beauty of the desert  so well.

Amber, the event specialist was great to work with and the DBG events team accommodated my lighting needs.  Thank you DBG for making our wedding night AWESOME!
