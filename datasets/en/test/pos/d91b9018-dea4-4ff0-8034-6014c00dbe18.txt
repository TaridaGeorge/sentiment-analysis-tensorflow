This is such a cool cafe, with tiny wine tastings, GR8 little gifts, coffee & snacks.  Since there is nothing quite like it for miles, it's a great ride on the (motor) bike for us.  Both staff members we very nice, even though it was very late & i think they wanted to close, but tried hard not to indicate that.  Try their yummy gelato samples :-)

Nice little find, and make sure to ck out the gorgeous grounds of this amazing resort - W O W.
