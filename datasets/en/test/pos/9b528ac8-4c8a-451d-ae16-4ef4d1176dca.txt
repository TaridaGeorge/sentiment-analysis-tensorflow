Muncha is our standard breakfast and lunch joint (when we order out) at my studio. It's a little hole-in-the-wall spot in an industrial area of Tempe. The owners are great; they staff the counter themselves and know their regulars. The sandwiches are generally enormous (I recommend the 61, turkey with italian dressing), and they've always got new daily specials. Substitutions and sandwich customization is a-OK with them.

They feed you -really- well for the price, I can't recommend them more!
