I don't normally have a sweet tooth...but I could come here every day!  Yum!  So happy to have been introduced to this place that is a mere 5 minutes from my house!  

First, they let you try each flavor in typical Baskin Robbins fashion.  So for those that want to TRY avacado/jalepeno but do not want a full scoop then you can go for it.  I recommend the strawberry buttermilk and anything with caramel in it.  Can't wait to go back!
