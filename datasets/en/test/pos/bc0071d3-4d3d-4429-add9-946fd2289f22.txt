If you are looking for AMAZING food and wonderful service, go to George & Son's!! Ever since I've left the area, I've been searching for a restaurant that will satisfy my cravings for savory Asian food like: Salt & Pepper Shrimp, Shrimp with Honey Glazed Walnuts, Special Chicken/Shrimp, Sizzling Rice soup, Hot and Sour Soup, Spicy Pork, General Yang's Chicken, Chow Mein, Lemon Chicken, Orange Beef, Crab Puffs, House fried rice and the list goes on and on. I have yet to find a restaurant that has so many GREAT dishes! Not to mention great music, ambiance and staff... It's at the top of my list for best local businesses in the Phoenix area.  

If you're lucky enough to catch George and Miona there, introduce yourself! They're great = )
