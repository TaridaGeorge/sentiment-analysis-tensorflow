Had my first yoga class in years.  As a renewbie to yoga, I might not be the best judge of a yoga studio.  However, if you are new to yoga or returning to yoga ( as I am), this is a great place to begin your journey.  Great class ( power yoga- nicole).  Regained my respect for the challenge of doing yoga and a reacquaintance with the great peace and contentment that comes with a yoga session.  I'm hooked again.  Nice studio.  Great workout.
