I went in thinking I just needed a tire repaired and ended up realizing I needed four new tires for my wife's car.  The sales associate was extremely helpful and was able to get me a sizable refund on my existing tires.  They were even finished within 40 minutes which gave me time to grab a bagel at Hot Bagels nearby.
