Great espresso, amazing service.  Sparse atmosphere but who cares when the coffee is this good.  Order a double espresso.  You will NOT be disappointed.  It is literally half the volume of a 'normal' double espresso (served in a single shot espresso glass) but QUALITY WAAAAAAAAAAAAY over Quantity baby.

Update - as it turns out, they don't deliver downtown except for large orders.  Also, the phone # listed on Yelp gets you Tempe.  Hard to track down # for downtown location.  Really hope you start delivering lunch.
