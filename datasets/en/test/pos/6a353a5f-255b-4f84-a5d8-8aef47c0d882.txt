I first started dealing with Helmet Center by watching their review videos on YouTube. Those alone helped me narrow down my search before I ever set foot in the store. Once inside the store, I met Jeff and was guided to my absolute favorite helmet, and for less than $200! Unfortunately it was on manufacturer back-order, so I had to wait. But Jeff kept me abreast to how everything was progressing.

I have since been stationed in Seattle, but I will continue to use the Helmet Center for everything that I can. Jeff's willingness to serve the customer and not the profit graph has earned a lifetime customer in me. I highly recommend his store to all riders in AZ, and even my buddies that I meet in other states. You will not be disappointed your experience.
