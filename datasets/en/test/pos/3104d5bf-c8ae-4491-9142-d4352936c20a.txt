OMG!  Love Chelsea's Kitchen!  Love it.  First, you MUST have the Chicken Nachitos!  The Roasted Chicken Spinach Salad is awesome. This is what I order most of the time because I think it balances the Chicken Nachito pig out that prefaces the main course.  However, the Fish Tacos are great too!  I love hanging out on the Patio.  It's so lovely and the weather is getting nice now to sit outside.  Perfection.  The staff is great and the service is fast but not rushed.  I wish the owners would open up a  place in South Phoenix -- we are "hungry" for  non-chain restaurants!
