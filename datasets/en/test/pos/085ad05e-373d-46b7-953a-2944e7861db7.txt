How many times have I been here? You can't even imagine. I think Sky Harbor is a great airport. The signage is easy, people are polite, and the airport is easy to figure out. I am an Arizona native and can still remember being able to go on top of the roof on what is now terminal 2 and watch planes take off and land. There is a lot of construction going on right now but the airport is still easy to navigate. You can go on top of the parking garages and watch the airplanes take off and land. The mountains surrounding the airport make for great backdrops as the planes make their ascents, and descents.
