This store is kick ass. Picked up a pair of Jordan Spi'zikes today with no mark up they had plenty to choose from. I loved the sale they recently had on all the retro AJ1's too... picked up the red do the right thing pack for 30% off, came out to like $75 total.... for a pair of AJ1's! I dropped almost twice that on some pairs. 

They have all the awesome shoes and can make special orders since they are a Nike top dealer. Staff is very friendly and knowledgeble. Weird that Adrian Wilson owns the place.
