If you are looking for some really great French food in a relaxed atmosphere, this is the spot. I recommend three quality dishes: 1) The Handmade tagliatelle pasta served with braised rabbit, 2) Steak Frites and (as  starter) 3) Frisee aux lardons....this is a perfect salad served with lardons and a poached egg atop with a coarse mustard viniagrette dressing.
