Absolutely love this place!  It was very clean, the servers are extremely nice and super quick service.   The number one thing about this place that was shocking is the quality of ingredients they use.  The beef was thick, the shrimp was huge, and the chicken is all white meat.  The veggies are fresh and the rice is perfect.  I was really impressed.  My hubby raved about the hot & sour soup, and everything we have tried is excellent.  They also give you hot tea and its delish.  If you go for the lunch specials, its and excellent value so much for cheap.  Dinner is a little more, but still a good value, we always have to take food home.
