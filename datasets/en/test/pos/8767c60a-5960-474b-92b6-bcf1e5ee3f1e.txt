Flo's is our new happy hour spot!

We stopped by on Friday night around 6p for dinner. To our surprise, their happy hour runs from 3-7p. Also to our surprise, it's a pretty amazing deal - 1/2 off all alcohol & apps!

We ordered lettuce cups, wontons, spring rolls & a couple beers. The food was delicious & they were all large portions.

Our total for 2 beers + 4 apps = $17. 

Flo made her presence known which I also found refreshing. Everyone was friendly & the food was top notch; you go girl!
