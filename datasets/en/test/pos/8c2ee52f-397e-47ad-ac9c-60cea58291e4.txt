I visit this DD almost every morning for coffee. There is one employee there in the morning that is just a really nice and friendly human being. I honestly don't know his name but he takes the orders through the drive through and is always very friendly and happy. He also is considerate if I am on the phone and while I understand that is kinds of rude of me, he gets that people work and it happens! 
The coffee is the best and worth the price. They also have a punch card where you can get your 8th cup of coffee free. Overall I LOVE this location!
