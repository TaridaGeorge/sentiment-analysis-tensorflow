Loved this place so much.  I was there with my husband, 4 year old and three 8 yr old girls. We were there on a friday afternoon and had no wait. I ordered the special french toast ( guess what its crusted in). It was so good, everyone tried a piece and I still had leftovers. The portion sizes are huge! (a good thing). My husband got the Huevos rancheros and they were spicy and greasy just the way they should be. I can't wait to go back and try the bacon pancakes!! Oh and my favorite was the cute menu with tiny pink pigs showing what has bacon in it.
