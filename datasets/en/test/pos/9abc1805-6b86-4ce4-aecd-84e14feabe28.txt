Changing Hands has been one of my favorite book/gift shops for years.  Last night a friend and I attended a fabulous writer's event that featured several writers, illustrators and an agent.  They offer many free amazing events.  If you haven't checked out this little gem make sure you head over and check out their website for events.
They carry a wide variety of books including heavily discounted used.  You can bring in your old books for credit too.
