I have been using Bill and 25th Street Automotive from the time they opened.  I wouldn't go anywhere else for car repair.  I find Bill very honest and fair, and he does great work.  He lets you know when certain work is needed, but also realistically gives you an idea of how long you can wait before having the work done which I appreciate from a budgeting perspective.  He never uses the fear factor to get more business from you like some places do when they give you doom and gloom stories of why you'll die if you don't have more work done.  I have never thought he has suggested any repair that wasn't truly needed.  As someone who doesn't know much about cars, I feel fortunate to have found such an honest, reputable business to take care of my car.
