We decided to try Gtimaldi's after reading other reviews...we are so glad we did!!  The pizza was delicious & the service was outstanding. We eat a lot of pizza at different places and this is by far the best we've had. The staff were outstanding too!!  Great experience, any time we are in the Scottsdale area we will eat at Grimaldi's.
