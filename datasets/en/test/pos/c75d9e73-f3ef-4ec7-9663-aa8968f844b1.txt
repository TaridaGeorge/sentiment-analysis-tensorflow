Wow great breakfast spot. My friends recommended going after seeing it on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives on the food network and we were not disappointed. Being the norcal gal I am I called and asked if the line was hella long... the gal on the phone mentioned that around 12:30-1pm the line calms down. We got there and were seated immediately. Bonus points for having ice cold water outside too. This place was perfect for recovering after the previous nights drink fest. I had the Five Spot with hash browns and it was amazing. My entire group agreed I picked the best thing off the menu. When I'm back in Phoenix I will be back for the Five Spot again..
