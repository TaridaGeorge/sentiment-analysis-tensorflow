This place is delicious! I always bring my friends here and they all love it. The chicken shawerma plate is the BEST and the hummus is so heavenly. I'm drooling just thinking about it right now.  Their food is so authentic and I haven't found a place like this yet.  The best part is that it's so affordable for starving college students.
