I love the girls there. I get my eyebrows done every two weeks and I get my nails done there as often as I can. Recently, I just did the gel nails (just the gel polish not like the fake nail stuff) and I LOVE it. I can't tell you how happy I am that I did it. I always just did my toes because I'd always manage to goof up my fingernails in the first hour after I get them done- but with gels, you can't do that because after they're put under the UV Light, they dry immediately. No goof ups! Plus, they don't chip. The lady said they'd last around two weeks. I'm so happy with them. It's been a week and they still look pretty good. :)
