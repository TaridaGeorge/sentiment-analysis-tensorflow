I originally wanted to try Capriottis after hearing some people at work brag on it, but they were closed and I turned the corner and went to Firehouse. IT WAS JAM PACKED..and for good reason. My hot pastrami was sooooo good; juicy meat, extra soft warm bread, and not a lot of fluff on the inside. The 8" sandwich is just enough to satisfy your hunger, yet have your mouth begging for more. Expect to pay more than Subway, but it is worth it. Ironically, Gilbert Fire Department walked in as I was walking out. Hey..its good enough for them!!!!
