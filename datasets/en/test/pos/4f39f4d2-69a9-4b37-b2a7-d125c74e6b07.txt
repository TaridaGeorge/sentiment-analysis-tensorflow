My family and I came here for a "pre" pre-wedding family dinner celebration. We decided on Kona Grill because we learned they had a decent selection of dishes, which was what we were looking for with our large group. There was 13 of us in the group (we had reservations from a week before), and every one of us was talking about how much we enjoyed the food and service once the night was over. 

We ordered 3 appetizers, 3 bottles of vino, 13 dishes, and did not have a single issue with anything over the 2 hours we were there. Several servers helped us, and all were friendly and attentative. 

Overall, we had a great experience. 5 stars all the way for the food, service, and experience we had. We're still talking about the great time we had almost a week later!
