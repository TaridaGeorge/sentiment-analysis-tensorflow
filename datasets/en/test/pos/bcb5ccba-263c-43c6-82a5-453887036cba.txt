Great dessert choice!  In the hustle and bustle of the Old Town in Scottsdale, this is the perfect place to finish an evening with a tasty Gelato that has the feel of a little slice of Italy.  The woman that owns the place is very professional and direct and does a great job keeping this place running like a well, oiled machine.  I would go back for sure!
