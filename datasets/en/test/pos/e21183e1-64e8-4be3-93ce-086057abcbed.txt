I'm lucky enough to latch on to my in-laws trip to the Four Seasons Scottsdale every April.  The service is consistently beyond exceptional, but you're going to pay for it.

Prices for lunch at the Residence Club pool are less than at the main pool, and the food is just as good.  Lunch at Crescent Moon is also great - entrees are big enough to share.

If you can take the heat, try to come in May or September.  You can get great rates and the heat isn't too bad except for at its peak.
