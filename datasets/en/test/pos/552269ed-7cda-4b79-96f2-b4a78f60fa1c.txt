A smile when you walk in the door!
My neighborhood Rubio's is a true neighborhood place to eat. There is seldom a time when you don't get a smile when you walk in the door. The staff is always happy and upbeat, the management is always on the ball, but takes time out to ask how your day is going and how the food was. When we think of dashing out for lunch...Rubio's is the first name on our lips. And then our lips can't wait to taste the food!
