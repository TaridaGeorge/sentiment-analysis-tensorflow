I would put this up against the best steak in NY.  Wolfgang's in NY still gets my top place but Mastro's City Hall is great.  

Incredible steak and sides.  I had the bone in ribeye which was cooked perfectly.  Great cut of meat.  Also had a tremendous bowl of delicious lobster mashed potatos.  

Beware of all the butter though...there is plenty of it!

Entertainment in the lounge area is great too.  Not your typical lounge singer but a guy playing the guitar along with a pianist will entertain you all night with Top 40 hits in a lounge singer fashion.
