I loved the tamale sampler and the coconut flan. The tamales each had a unique and incredible flavor even the cheese one. Their salsa is to die for with a perfect blend of taste and spice. I really cannot say enought good things about this place. If you are looking for excellent place to eat I would suggest the jewel.
