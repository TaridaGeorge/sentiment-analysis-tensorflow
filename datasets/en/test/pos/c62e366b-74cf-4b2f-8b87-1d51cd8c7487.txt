Love this place. I got their Ahi Tuna Burger and an order of Sweet Potato Fries. Both were amazing! The Ahi Tuna Burger had a nice peppery taste and not at all fishy. The bun was amazing too. The Sweet Potato Fries with the Pineapple dipping sauce were kind of spicy and sweet at the same time. I will definitely be back! Simply Amazing!
