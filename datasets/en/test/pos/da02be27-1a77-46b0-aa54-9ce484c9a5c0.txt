This review is from the perspective of a patron and a performer who plays music at Crush'd once every month or so with my trio GedaLifE. Crush'd is a rare find! A very cool neighborhood hang out for those who appreciate reasonably priced, really fine wines and beers and tasty food fare and easy listening live music. The people at Crush'd really know their product and are friendly and welcoming. They host terrific wine tasting events on a regular basis and they price their pours and bottles reasonably so you're not paying double the retail price which is what most places charge. Whenever we play at Crush'd our fans always come away with positive things to say about their experiences there. Check out the events schedule on their web site for tastings and live music and stop by. You will not be disappointed!
