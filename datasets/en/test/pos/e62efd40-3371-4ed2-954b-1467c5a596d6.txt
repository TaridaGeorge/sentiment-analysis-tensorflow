I had the privilege of attending this past Friday for the Phx Art Museums "First Friday" event. This time is was a floral themed event.... where local floral artists were paired with different pieces throughout the museum. 

It was really very wonderful! I had not been to the Phoenix Art Museum for many years (since the Monet Exhibit). And I had the impression that this time it was MUCH BIGGER than I ever remembered it.

I loved the diversity of the art exhibits. My personal favorites are the more modern multimedia type pieces.

There was a live performance art group when I was there... they were awesome... but very odd all at the same time. 

I look forward to attending again next month. I would very mch like to make it a routine.
