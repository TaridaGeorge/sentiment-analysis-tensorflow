We stayed at the Firesky Resort over 4th of July weekend...and we were not disapointed! We brought our 2 dogs (our main reason for staying at this hotel) and we were more than surprised to learn that your dog is allowed anywhere on the resort, except for in the pool! The grounds are gorgeous...the pools are refreshing & the drinks are strong! 

They put anyone with dogs in a reserved wing of the hotel, and it was funny to see so many dogs in one place! They host a daily wine reception in the lobby, where they invited us to bring our dogs to (and we did!) It was nice to stay in a resort where our entire family felt welcome. 

I will definitely be returning to the Firesky!
