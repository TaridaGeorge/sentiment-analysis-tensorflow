Because of cost, our cooling and heating needs had to be done in stages over several years.  First was the research, then electrical upgrades had to be done to accomodate the new heating/cooling projects, then the swamp cooler installed, then finally, the air conditioner was replaced and reducting was done.  

It has been nearly a year since Miguel last worked on our house.  Everything is working perfectly.  Miguel Flores was such an integral part of making our house better through all of the stages that not calling him for so long seems strange.  We miss him.
