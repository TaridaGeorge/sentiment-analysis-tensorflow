Rare Earth has the best super-thin crust gourmet pizzas I've ever tasted.  The Godfather pizza, with its peppers, sausage, olives, prosciutto, etc is amazing!  However a glass of wine is a must or the flavors are a bit overpowering (and to be fair, Rare Earth *is* a wine bar; the pizzas were designed to accompany wine).  Also amazing is the salad with the pears, blue cheese, and candied walnuts... I forget what it is called, but yum!
