My first visit here was amazing! The place is very cute. I always pass by this place thinking I wouldn't like anything on the menu. So I decided to give it a chance when a friend recommended this place for a healthy lunch or dinner. I got the chicken biryane with quinoa. It was delicious! Chris was a awesome server and super friendly! It you are a local you get 20% off every time you come in. I will definitely be back!
