This place is amazingly good. I love going here. The only bad thing is its in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale which can be a bitch to navigate. Trust me though its definitely worth it. They have many types of teas and I personally love the toasted Foccacia Bread with 3 spreads. Uh! Thinking about it is making me extremely happy!
