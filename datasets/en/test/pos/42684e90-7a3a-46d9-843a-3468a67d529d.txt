My boyfriend played in the TPC tournament. We decided to have dinner here. It was wonderful from start to finish. I had the prefixe which included seafood chowder, fresh salad, lobster & peanut butter tower. We also had a crab cake for an appetizer. HOLY. I consider myself a picky eater. I loved everything. Our waiter, Eric was beyond helpful. He was very personable and kind. My boyfriend had the halibut & crab claw. He was beyond pleased. We appreciated the GM asking about our experience. Overall, one of the best restaurant experiences in my 35 years. We don't get service like this in San Diego!
