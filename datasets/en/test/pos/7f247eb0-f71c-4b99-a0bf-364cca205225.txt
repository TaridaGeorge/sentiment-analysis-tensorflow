All four of our current pets (2 dogs, 2 cats) are patients at Hopi and we couldn't ask for better care! My childhood cat, who passed away 4 years ago, was also a regular.  All have had various medical issues and currently, our oldest cat goes in once a week for IV fluids. The same two nurses take excellent care of him and from what I can tell, are happy to see him each time. Dr. Pruden genuinely cares about each animal that walks in that door, is thorough, friendly and personable. I 100% recommend her and value her opinion.
