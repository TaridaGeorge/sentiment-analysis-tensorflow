I love Pearl and it is by far my favorite place to go for Sushi in all of Scottsdale. The drinks are amazing and the fish is always fresh not to mention the staff is very friendly and I always feel welcomed. I love their calamari salad it is the best. I also like on their happy hour menu their sashimi and have tried them all and have not been disappointed!
