If you are having a craving for Gelato, then this is the place to go! I have been looking for a good place to get some Gelato for quite some time and now my quest is over. They have 30+ flavors of Gelato to choose from, like pistachio, hazelnut, rum and nuts, creme brulee, peanut butter, whiskey etc., and they even make certain flavors during certain seasons, like pumpkin and green apple for the Fall. You can also get a nice cup of coffee as well as some cannoli's and other baked goods. They even make Gelato cakes! This place is incredible!
