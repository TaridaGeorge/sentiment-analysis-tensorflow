OK, so I am writing this review for my boyfriend. Gentleman Joe's is the ONLY place he will go to get his haircut in the entire valley. He drives all the way from Peoria just to get a hair cut. He loves the attention he gets from the barbers. I believe he enjoys it as much as women enjoy going to the spa! I went in to pick him up one day and saw him getting a shave with a straight razor, just like in the movies! He also had his own private television set to watch as he got his hair cut!!! Maybe I'll send him there for valentine's day.... bet he would then volunteer to do anything I wanted to do. :)
