Ok, right off the bat I'll concede the steaks are quite as good as Mastro's (Ocean Club or City Hall) but they're damn close, and combined with the rest of the menu and the service its a better overall experience.  
The food is GREAT, especially the shrimp with cream sauce (I forget the exact name, but its featured on the menu).  The steaks are well marbled, not overly seasoned and perfectly cooked, and my wife says the fish is terrific as well.  The bar pours real drinks and the waitstaff knows how to serve them.  
My biggest problem with many of the best steak places in town is the vibe they give off that "you're just lucky to be here".  Not so at OP, rather it feels like they've been waiting for your party to arrive all night, which sounds cheesy I know.  Definitely a favorite.
