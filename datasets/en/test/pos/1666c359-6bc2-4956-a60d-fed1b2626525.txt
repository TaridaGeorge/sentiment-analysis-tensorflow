came here after playing tpc scottsdale. My dad got a chicken sandwich and loved it. We had the az. egg rolls, ive had  these before somewhere but dont remember where. I ordered the wcg cheeseburger and it was great. I tried finishing it but ate to many egg rolls and way to many glasses of fresh squezzed lemonade that was great also. I kept trying to finish the burger because it was so good but just couldnt and i still had to leave room for the white chocolate bannana cream pie. that was great to but i only wish it had more white chocolate.
