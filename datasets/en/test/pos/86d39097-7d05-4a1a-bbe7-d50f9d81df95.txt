The staff is very friendly and is always willing to work with you on appointments.  They're very open about scheduling changes.  They're also great with children, who can accompany you to your room.  There are toys and movies available in the waiting room.  It's a very comfortable atmosphere.

I have been receiving adjustments from Dr. Chris Koch and he's been able to reverse many problems I had been having with back, chest, and neck pain from years of working at a computer.  He's also very good about listening and addressing the problems that you notify him of.

I love coming here and getting my adjustments.
