My husband and I just had dinner there this evening - I cannot even begin to tell you how amazing the service was ... our waitress, Paula, was fabulous!!  She grew up in Rome ( I grew up in Milan)... She could not have been any friendlier and informative on the specials...
Meanwhile, Salvatore "Sal" (the owner) ...I have a secret crush on...he treated us like royalty - we spoke Italian...he gave us a grappa
AND the piano player!! He was fabulous!!
NOW HONESTLY...where can you get AMAZING italian food, fabulous, friendly service, reasonable prices, great wine AND an extremely talented pianist!!!
BRAVO!!!
