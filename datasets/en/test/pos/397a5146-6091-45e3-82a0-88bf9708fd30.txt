Plaza de Anaya is a family for local belly dancers.  Its ran by two of the greatest ladies Kim and Tiff, who support the local dancers and put on great shows to showcase local dancers. You couldn't ask for a better place to learn to dance they keep it exciting and new with the different classes they offer. There is always a chance to learn the basics of belly dance, cabaret belly dance, tribal belly dance, ATS, hip hop, Polynesian, Bollywood, Poi, Fire Arts, Skirt, Sword the list can go on. I highly recommend checking out the studio.  I would also suggest stopping in just to shop not only do they have some of the best belly dance wear out there, the jewelry case is  brimming with pretties that everyone can wear.
