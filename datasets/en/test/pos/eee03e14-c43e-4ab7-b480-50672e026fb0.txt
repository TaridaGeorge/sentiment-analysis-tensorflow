I'm in here for lunch every month or so, and I'm always impressed.  Fantastic food at very decent prices.  It's a great spot to hit if you're craving some Indian food, but don't necessarily want to go the buffet route.  They've usually got a good crowd, but the service has always been top-notch, no matter how busy.
