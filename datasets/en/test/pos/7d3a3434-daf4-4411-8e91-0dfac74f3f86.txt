Holy crikes this rugalach is amazing!  Cheese-filled with fruit and I think chocolate.  
Walking into Karsh's with my Groupon in hand, I thought I'd landed back in mama's womb.  Pastry is one of my comfort foods.  Flaky, buttery and chilled to the right temperature.  I'm not saying mama's womb was flaky but...
I also got an eclaire, some mini-pastries and a white cake that's covered with chocolate icing, then rolled in coconut.  That's in the freezer until book club night!
The service was wonderful!  I got to try a bunch of different sweets and left with a huge bag of stuff.  For my $20-valued Groupon, I will be eating this for a week.  A WEEK.
Only bad thing is that it's close enough that I can walk there.
