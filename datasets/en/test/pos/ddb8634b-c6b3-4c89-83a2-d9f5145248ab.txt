Four Peaks is a classic institution.  Not only is the building a really cool old building they have the best patio in town. The beers are consistently good and the food is above reproach with fantastic daily specials, some of which you'd only find at high end restaurants. The only knock is that because of the lack of a/c you have to rely on swamp coolers and misters to stay cool in the summer, but hey, that is covered by having Four Peaks North in Scottsdale. 

P.S. The ASU student waitresses aren't bad either.
