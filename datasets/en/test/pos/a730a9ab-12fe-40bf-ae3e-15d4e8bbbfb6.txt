I am a big fan of Crust!  I have been here twice and I have met a different owner each time (I think there are two or three partners in this restaurant).  All of the pizzas are made from scratch and I love the sauce!  I have never had anything but the pizza (it is the specialty after all), but all the other menu items I have seen come from the kitchen look fabulous as well.  Another great thing about Crust is the wine list (great wines and an extensive list), not to mention they give you a fairly liberal pour!
