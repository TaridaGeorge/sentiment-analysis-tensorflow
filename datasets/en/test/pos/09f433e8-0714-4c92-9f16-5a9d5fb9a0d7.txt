Amazing coffee (thanks barista Jeff), delicious food, yummy drinks (thanks bartender Josh), and super awesome staff (thanks Becca). 32 Shea is a hidden gem located in front of a very empty strip mall. They have indoor seating as well as a nice dog friendly :) patio that I can't wait to enjoy as the weather is finally starting to cool off. The owner and employees have put a lot of love into this local coffee shop/cafe and I hope for its continued success!
