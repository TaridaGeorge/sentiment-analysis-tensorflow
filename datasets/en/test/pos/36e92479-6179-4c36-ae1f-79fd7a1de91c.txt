A four stars for Brandon and a five star for Kurt.  I have suffered shoulder pain for over 20 years and Kurt applied a level 11 pressure on me but that is the energy level required to tackle my problem areas since majority of the therapist gave up on me due to the lack of their skill.  Being a therapist myself, he is definitely the top of the line as far as skill level and his attention to detail is rare in today's spa environment.  Next time I will have to ask for luke warm water since cold water will siphon the energy away (point taken from my master in Thailand).
