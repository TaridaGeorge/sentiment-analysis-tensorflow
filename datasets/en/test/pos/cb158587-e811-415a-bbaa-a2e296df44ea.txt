I really like the modern burger attached to modern steak. Its exactly what you should expect (and more) from a restaurant/take out in the mall. It's quick, delicious & inexpensive. I usually don't like a lot of food options in food courts and this is a great alternative to the standard mall food. Check it out if you want something quick & yummy so you can keep shopping!
