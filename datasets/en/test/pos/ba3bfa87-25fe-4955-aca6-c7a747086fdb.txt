I finally made it back to Banderas to actually dine in the restaurant.  I am still dreaming of the macho salad... I think I am in love!  This salad is so good it has Roasted Chicken, Avocado, Chopped Dates and Goat Cheese... I cannot wait to come back.  Michael had their dinner special which was the mushroom meatloaf with mashed potatoes and spinach; I tried this also and it was so good.  I wish Bandera was open for lunch I would come here every week!
