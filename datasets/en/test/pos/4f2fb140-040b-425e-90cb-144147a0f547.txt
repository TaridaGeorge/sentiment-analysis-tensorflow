I have had a membership to this location for over two years and have been in about 5 times because I didn't like the atmosphere & energy when I went.  I just found out that this location has new owners and went in this evening...what a change.  Taylor was so helpful, gave me a tour (first one in two years) and answered all my questions.  The new membership packages they have are great!  The place was clean and has new equipment...no more shock from the cold mystic tan...it has a heater!
I can't wait to go back in a couple days and try out some of the spa stuff!, 
Stay tuned for an update...
