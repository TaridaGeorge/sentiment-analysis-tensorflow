Firebirds, how I love thee? You deliver the perfect piece of meat everytime - whether prime rib, sirloin or ribeye. Because of this, I don't even know what other proteins you serve, nor do I care. You always have room for me to sit near the grill where the smell is devine. Your wait staff is well-informed and happy to be at their job. But surprisingly, my favorite thing about you is your loaded baked potato! I'm not sure how the skin is so crisp and salty, and the toppings more fresh and mouth-watering than your steak. Yes, you are expensive and I do not care for your fat-ridden del Monaco. But we should love our favorites unconditionally.
