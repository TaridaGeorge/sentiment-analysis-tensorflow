I'll never go back again! Not by choice - they will close their doors after Saturday :-(  We have gone here on an avg. of 1x/mth.  I will miss their bar & patio, as well and their unique hand-shaken infused & top-notch martinis.  

It's unfortunate we won't be able to experience this hip, chic, high-end bar which had excellent service, GR8 food, and fantastic drinks.  

The Prime Rib tonite was awesome, and so was the heirloom tomoatoe & mozzarella salad.  

There's now no where to go for effen cherry vodka & fresh squeezed lemondae :-(
 
 WhaaaaaaaaaaaaaH  ..........
