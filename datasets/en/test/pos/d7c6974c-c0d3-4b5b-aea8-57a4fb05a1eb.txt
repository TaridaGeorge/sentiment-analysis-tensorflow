Family-owned for 35 years and we felt like family on our first visit! We stopped by here yesterday after reading reviews from other yelpers and we were not disappointed. The pizza hoagie was delish- even my kids ate every last drop. Husband had the pepper cheesesteak and devoured it. Make sure you have cash and drop by here soon!
