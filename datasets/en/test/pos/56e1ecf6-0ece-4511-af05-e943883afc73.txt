Update to my review, dined here again recently and it gets better and better.  If you go here, and the special is a meat or fish that you would like, get it.  The specials are SOOO good and really big!  They stay seasonal and change things up, so hard to say exactly what you should get, but the food honestly speaks for itself.  It's worth every penny.

Service is great and friendly as well, and every seat in the room has a good view, so not worth complaining if you don't get a window seat.
