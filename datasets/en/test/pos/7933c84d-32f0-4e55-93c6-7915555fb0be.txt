YUMMY!
We are from L.A. and so we have pretty high standards when it comes to boba but this place....it is great!  I actually think this is the best boba place  ever.  My bf thinks this is probably #2 in his list.

*Texture = very mochi like...so soft and very flavorful.
*Decor = pretty hip.
*Milk tea = pretty good.  
*Slush = It wasn't the ordinary sugary sweet taste you get from flavored syrup.  I was actually able to taste the tanginess of the fruit.
*Service = very polite and fast.
