This place is excellent! I had the falafel pita and wanted to die of happiness mid-first-bite. The desserts looked yummy, too. The staff here is amazingly friendly as well.

The food does take a while (at least 20 minutes) and there isn't a ton of seating. Of course, I love waiting for food and I hardly ever go out to eat with a part over 4, so this doesn't bother me at all. I will return to Beaver Choice again and again. :-)
