I heart Coffee Bean!  Loved you in Vegas, loved you in LA, and now loving you in AZ.  I normally drool over the ice blended stuff but I wanted to try the teas since my friend said they have a great selection.  My god-daughter was undecided.  The girl behind the counter let her taste a few samples.  That was cool!  I got the tropical ice tea.  She got the green tea apricot something.
