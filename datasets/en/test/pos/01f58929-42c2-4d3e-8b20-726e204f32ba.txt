When I asked my fiance what he liked about this place, his response was "Everything!" The decor is cool, seating is neat & comfy, we go on Sundays and eat & drink off of the happy hour menu (Happy Hour All Day!) and get out of there SO CHEAP. The teriyaki ribs are AMAZING, so are the lettuce wraps.  Nice waitresses, and yes - cool bathrooms!!! The sushi is good, the music is better than a lot of the crap they play in most other restaurants these days... one of our favorite places to eat!
