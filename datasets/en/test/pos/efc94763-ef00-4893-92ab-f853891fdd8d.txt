You definitely get what you pay for, Dr. John Clark is amazing he will not only explain what changes you dog is going through but explain the history of why, i brought my puppy there for her rabies series, im a college student so he cut me some slack on the expenses of it, he gave me food advice and education on her growing process such as her weight teeth and eye sight the girls are okay but i go for the Dr. my puppy wont know another doctor ever again! go see him :)
