I love this place and finally was able to sucker my picky husband into going. He loves bruschetta, but I'm pretty sure this topped the cake for him.
They have had a win with me from the very first time and easily won my husband over. 
Service is always good. Food is always great. Hipster vibe is pretty legit. :)
