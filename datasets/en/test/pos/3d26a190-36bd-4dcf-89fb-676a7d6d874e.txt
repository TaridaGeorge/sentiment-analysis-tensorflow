This place is one of the reasons why I love living in Mesa. 

I first found it when I was working nearby in the one of the most soul-crushing jobs I've ever had.  The only bright spot in those days was the occasional opportunity to grab lunch here and eat it in the vacant lot behind work before trudging back to four more hours of mindless test scoring.

Everything is good, and the value is awesome.  Be prepared to wait for a table, even on weekdays.
