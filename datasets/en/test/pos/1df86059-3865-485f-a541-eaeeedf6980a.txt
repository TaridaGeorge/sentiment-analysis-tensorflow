Vintage, re-purposed, recycled and new.  COLAB is a shock as soon as you walk in the door - as you can BARELY walk in the door because there is so much stuff!  It's amazing!   From Gerber Onsies that have been silk-screened to older clothing that has been re-sewn into something a bit more "today" while retaining it's retro feel - this place IS your place.  

C.O.L.A.B. stands for Collectively Operated Local Artist Boutique.  Why has no one done this before?  Maybe it was a matter of rent, but hopefully with their tiny spot at .anti-space they'll be able to keep it going for quite some time.  

As of today their hours are W-Sunday 6pm-10pm and Saturday 2pm-10pm.  Go.  Shop.  Support.  We need more spots like this for our current and future fashion artists in Phoenix.
