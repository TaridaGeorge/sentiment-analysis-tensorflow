My husband and I splurged on the evening tour.  It was truly magical.  Viewing the exterior and interior of the home at night was breathtaking. If you love architecture and/or American design this is a MUST DO while in Phoenix area.  You can see the roots of what some call "Mid-Century Modern".

FYI. The Tour we had was very light on architectural education/details and heavy on the "realty show factoids" of FLW.  If you want a deeper architectual tour, I recommend  Wrightours.com - -- TOGETHER  ----  with the evening tour of Taliesin West.

Truly two of the highlights of my stay in Phoenix!!!!
