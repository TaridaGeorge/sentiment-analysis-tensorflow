I already love everything about all Trader Joe's, so I won't delve into the minutiae about all that is wonderful about this store - I had a great "customer service" experience at this location today that makes me love this grocery chain even more.

I like to make my own Micheladas at home, and when I lived in LA, an employee at the Trader Joe's in Hollywood recommended a beer and the store brand Bloody Mary mix as my base, which I've always been happy with. But an employee at this location recommended a different beer (after my purchase), and sold me a single (even though it's only sold in 6-packs) of his recommendation, and I like it even more! All the employees at this location are always helpful, friendly, and go the extra mile.
