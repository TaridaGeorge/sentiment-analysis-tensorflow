Really nice place.

My sister-in-law comes here for her timeshare and she let us use it for our trip to Phoenix this last Summer.  Our suite was quite big--essentially a one bedroom apartment.  There was a big bathroom there, sauna, swimming pool and hot tub outside, barbecues, wireless internet and a comfy bed.  It's a little far away from Phoenix proper, but being close to the freeway is a plus.

If you got the bucks to pay for this, then by all means splurge.  I thought it was a great spot to stay at.
