I am not a programmer or a coder, etc... so when my husband told me about Gangplank and their "Hack night" I was concerned about what I was in for.

I was quite surprised. The folks are nice and fun. It has a true community feel about it. Many of the people who work at Gangplank I now consider good friends. 

Gangplank is an open workspace. There are several anchor companies but anyone can drop in and work. 

They have a recording studio. Several podcasts come out of this studio each week. 

Drop in anytime and enjoy the collaboration that happens!
