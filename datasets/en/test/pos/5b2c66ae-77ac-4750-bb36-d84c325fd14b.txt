I eat at this place 1-3 times every week and am not close to being tired of it.  There are so many things that I LOVE about Wildflower.  Delicious iced tea, banana walnut pancakes, pastries to die for, toffee cake, lovely caesar salad that is very non-boring for a caesar, shortbread cookies Scotland would be proud of and bloody awesome pesto pasta (all their pasta is great).
