The five stars is for just being a Frank Lloyd Wright inspired building- it echoes the same principles of harmonizing with the environment and echoing those elements into the interior- and harnessing natural light to its full efficacy...I was here during a conference- but wished I could have stayed and taken advantage of the resort- golf, spa, dining and pool...wonderful place!
