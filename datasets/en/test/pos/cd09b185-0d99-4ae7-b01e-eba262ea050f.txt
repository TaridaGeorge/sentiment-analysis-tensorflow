Just had dinner there w/a big group (4 adults & 6 kids).  Our bill came out to $84 for 2 plates of sushi & 6 large size entrees (orange chicken, veggie lo mein, house lo mein, veggie & garlic chix, mongolian beef, hawaiian fried rice). What a great deal & everything was great!  Even had some left overs!  Located near the Scdl Gun Club.  Give this place a try.
