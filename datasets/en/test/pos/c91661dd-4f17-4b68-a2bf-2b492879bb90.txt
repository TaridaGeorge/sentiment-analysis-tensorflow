What is there not to love about this place??? Super friendly people working here and really know there stuff. I was trying to explain something I was looking for and even though I did not know the "correct" term for it she was able to figure it out with my horrible description and body movements(she would be a good Pictionary partner).

Prices are really fair and they have everrrryythhingg you could think of.  My number one spot to check out for when I'm getting costumed out.
