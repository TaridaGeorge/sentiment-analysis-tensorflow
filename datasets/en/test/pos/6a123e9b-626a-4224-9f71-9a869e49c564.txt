I've been a few times now, and increasingly enjoy myself with each visit. Music, drinks, lighting... all are swanky with an hipster/older/speakeasy-style feel. What a breath of fresh air compared to many of the spots across Scottsdale Rd!! The "secret room" in the back with 1-way mirror is super unique, and I'm waiting for the next appropriate occasion to book it for me & my friends. It will definitely be a good time. I'm a big fan, and will be back soon!
