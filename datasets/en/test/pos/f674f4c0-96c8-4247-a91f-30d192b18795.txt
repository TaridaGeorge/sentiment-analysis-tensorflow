Who'd ever thunk that avocado, cilantro and bacon would be so good on a hot dog?  I had the Hana style toppings, but on a brat instead of a hot dog.  Soooo incredibly delish!  I definitely want to go back and try other styles of hot dogs, including ones that put pineapple, coconut, mango, and other tropical delights on hot dogs!  They also have a shaved ice, which I didn't get this time, but I definitely plan on getting next time!  The owner is also very pleasant and personable.  I'll be back!
