What impressed me most about this place is the staff could teach a seminar on customer service. It wasn't that 1 server was great or they fixed something wrong, it was that every single person working there was nice, happy, eager to help, and on the ball. 
As for the food - it was exactly what you would expect from a top notch pizza bistro. Inventive and fun ("OZONE" as in create your "own" calzone). We had a pesto pizza, wongs wings (not on menu- you have to ask for them), stuffed mushrooms, italian sub, meatball sandwich and it was all great. They have two smaller seperate indoor dining areas and an outside patio/bar as well.
