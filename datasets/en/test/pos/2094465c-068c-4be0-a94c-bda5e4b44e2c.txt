I visited some friends in Phoenix for the first time in April 2011 and one of the things I like to do while on my vacations is eat. Of course, we had to try this new place called The Parlor. No one had ventured to try this Pizzeria and my visit was the perfect excuse.

5 words: Antipasti meat and cheese selection. 

Grilled Rosemary Flatbread, Basil Pesto and Peperonata. We chose some smoked prosciutto, bleu cheese and then a bleu cheese/jack combo, I think. Quite tasty. Of course I tried a pizza and a chocolate cake for dessert but both are a blur since my brain only wanted to remember the Antipasti.
