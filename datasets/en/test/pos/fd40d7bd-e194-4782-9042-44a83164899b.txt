Looking for great quality in produce and a great, reasonable price, then this is the store for you. I only found this place last year, but it is now the only place I shop for produce. Their prices always seem to be lower than any other supermarket and the quality of the produce is outstanding. It's the one place I buy my seedless watermelon and it comes out so sweet and juicy when I cut it open. They do have specialty items, mostly organic, also in the store and their own deli and bakery, but my main discovery was the excellent vegetables and fruit.
