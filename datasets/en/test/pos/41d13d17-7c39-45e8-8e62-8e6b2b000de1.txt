I hear British accents every time I come to Churchill's (both among staff and customers), which I take as a good sign.  The service may not be as perky and prompt as, say, Chili's, but what do you want?  It's British!  

The food here is wonderful, particularly the fish & chips.  I've had burgers, salads, and a variety of other things, and everything has been great, and sufficiently generous that I've had trouble finishing it.

I always love coming to Churchills, and I always leave satisfied. Great lunch spot.
