Scramble has quickly become a favorite weekend breakfast place for me. My breakfast of choice (as of right now, anyway) is their bacon and mushroom omelet with the roasted potatoes, wheat toast with a dab of butter, and a large iced chai tea. Love! They have lunch options as well, not just breakfast -- come hungry! 

If you arrive and the line is out the door, don't worry -- it moves quickly. Place your order, grab your number and find a seat. They bring your meal to you after it's been made.  

Seating is available inside or outside on a cute patio. Inside, one end has a couple TVs. For singles, there's great counter seating at the window overlooking the patio. The patio is dog-friendly.
