As I walked thru the door, the bartender practically greeted me by name!  This was Saturday at 1pm, and I don't even remember ever being here before.  Have I been unconsciously living some sort of shadow life with the daydrinkers?

Oh, that's right, I met the bartender before at my drinking buddy's BBQ party.  Still, it's nice to find a comfortable bar where one can relax a bit and engage in chatter with the regulars.

The Men's room continues to be 5+ stars!
