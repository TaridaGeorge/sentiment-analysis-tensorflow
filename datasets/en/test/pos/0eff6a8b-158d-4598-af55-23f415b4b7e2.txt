I've eaten here quite a few times and I absolutely love it.  The first time I went I was with a group and as not sure what to expect and it was always a pleasure to dine here.  The Grilled Artichokes are amazing.  If you had to start anything and get a feel for what to expect this sets a great foundation.  The entrees are focused on the savory proteins but thats what I'd expect from an American themed restaurant.  The service is always top notch.  Professional, precise, informative and quiet.  Simply put its like ninja's with water jugs because everytime I'd look my glass as always full!  Honestly I love that.  Great atmosphere for a business dinner or formal quiet celebration.  Drink selection is accomodating for any taste and I'm always a return diner at any time of the year.
