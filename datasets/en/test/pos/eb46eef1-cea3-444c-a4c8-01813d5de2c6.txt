Super clean rooms, nice housekeeping staff (one left a note on my bed for me!), free WiFi, the continental breakfast had a waffle making station, a pool and hot tub, and super affordable! 

If you are going to Spring Training and have a car at the ready, I'd definitely recommend staying here. 

I don't know the last time I stayed at a hotel that had free WiFi, I want to give them six stars because of this.
