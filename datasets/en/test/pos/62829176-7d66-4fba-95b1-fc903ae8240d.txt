I am having a difficult time deciding how to even begin this review. In the simplest terms, Cibo has my heart. The outdoor seating is romantic and lovely, while indoors is equally cute and "busy." The food is TO DIE FOR. If I was on death row, their food would constitute my last meal. Hands down, they have the best pizza I have ever had the pleasure to taste. Do not miss the opportunity to order the Burrata as an appetizer (and then again for dinner!) - the mozzarella is creamy, the prosciutto fresh, and the bread baked to perfection. We also had the prosciutto crudo pizza, which was every bit as delicious as the appetizer. Overall, one of the best restaurant experiences I have ever had. A big 5/5 from this foodie here.
