Every time we venture to Scottsdale, my mom and I stop at Z'Tejas. Their food portions are rather large, so we split our meals. She loves the spinach salad. Everything we have tried here has been delicious and worth the money. They also have a wide variety on their menu (including hamburgers) for the picky. We tend to visit Fashion Square during busy times (such as around Christmas or Black Friday), and we have never had a problem with the service.
