I had taken some belly dance, but in a much smaller setting.  I am overweight and older, so I was nervous to try a new belly dance class venue, but Plaza de Anaya is great!  Very welcoming of all levels of students, with a great dance floor, excellent instructors and a strong community feeling.  Now I'm addicted.  I can tell this is a great place for the more advanced dancers as well, and they host workshops with famous dancers from around the country.  Highly recommended!
