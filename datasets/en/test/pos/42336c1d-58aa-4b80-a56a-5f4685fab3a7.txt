I love this place. Ever since i came here the first time two years ago this is the only nail salon i will go to. Not only is it affordable they do an amazing job every time. The designs are gorgeous! Its worth the 5 dollars extra.
I cant do acrylics anymore but when o had those done every month they did an amazing job on even my most ridiculous requests. They even made the nails from Dexter amazing! 
Everyone is super nice. I would recommend this place to anyone!
