Must say....Best....coffee....ever.  I have consumed my share of coffee and I must say, I love their iced vanilla coffee.  To make a great iced coffee you must start with a great coffee, and they've got it!  

On several occcasions I have brought breakfast to my job for my co-workers and they flock to my desk everytime I bring in a box of donuts from Vantastic.  The fried donuts are always sweet and crispy on the outside and just the right blend of fluffy goodness on the inside.  The cake donuts are a big hit and the blueberry donut holes are ones my coworkers fight over.

This shop in a small hole-in-the-wall kind of place but don't let the appearance fool you, the food is great and the regulars make it a unique experience not to miss.
