I hate ordering flowers sight unseen, but needed a local florist for a sympathy arrangement. Rachel immediately alleviated any concern when we discussed what I wanted in detail, and she even emailed me a photo of the final arrangement. 
Gorgeous flowers, same day delivery and reasonable pricing - can't beat that.
