The property is fabulous!  This is my third stay, and I can't say enough good things about the entirely friendly and professional staff, the grounds were impeccably maintained, the linens in the casitas were divine, and the spa spectacular.  If you want the best deep-tissue massage ever, ask for Mr. Stacy at the Centre for Well-Being.  He is an amazing massage therapist, you won't be disappointed.  I can't wait to go back.
