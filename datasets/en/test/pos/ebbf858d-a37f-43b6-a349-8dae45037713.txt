Being new in town, not knowing what 'ado' about my hair, Alex came recommended from someone I saw at a restaurant, whose do was very cool and unique.  

Went to Alex last week and LOVED what she did.  Totally trusted her creative ideas, let her do her thing shaping cut and color.  She is very talented and love the vibe at her downtown spot.  Not a strip mall and yummy hibiscus-agave tea!

She's a find and a keeper!!!
