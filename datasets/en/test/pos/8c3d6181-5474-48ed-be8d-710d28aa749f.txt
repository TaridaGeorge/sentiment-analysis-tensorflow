Customer service can't be beat!  My 93 year old Mom wanted cookies delivered to our 95 year old uncle who lives in AZ. He has a PO box and has to get his mail from a local friend in his area - when I explained the situation, management went way out of their way to make sure he would receive his shipment before Christmas. I can't recommend them highly enough.  If you're sending sweets - order from Urban! Uncle Mike's Christmas will be special because of their efforts! The cookies look fabulous and even though we live in PA & VA, we certainly plan on sampling all their goodies.
