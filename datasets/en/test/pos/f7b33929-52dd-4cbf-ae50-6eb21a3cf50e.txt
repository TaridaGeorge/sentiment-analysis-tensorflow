So we finally joined this local Gold's Gym. My wife was already a member so she just had to upgrade her account to be able to go to this elite location. What a dope gym!  They have all of the top-of-the-line equipment, a huge cardio cinema room where they play movies all day, nice sauna's and great city views. I was literally able to run a few miles on the running eliptical while overlooking the downtown traffic, how awesome is that???? 

Everybody seemed very helpful and the clientele was your downtown workers, not the juice heads from Scottsdale Shore. They have an expanding class program with hot yoga, power yoga, pilates and spinning. Woo Hoo for the hot yoga, bikram is getting pricey for me!  What a gem, super stoked to have such a high caliber gym so close to the pad!!!!
