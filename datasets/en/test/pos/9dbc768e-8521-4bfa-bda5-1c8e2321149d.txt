So as we were driving down Mill, I saw this store and had to drop by.  The fiance should be glad that I wasn't in the store too long and that I made a great effort at not looking at all the books they had.  I could spend days  and do a lot of damage in here.  

The store is awesome and I wish I could visit it again, but it will be closed the next time I am in town.
