This is an incredibly good food stop!  Check out their hours before you go, however, as they are closed during various hours of the day.  The lunch buffet is our favorite--great selections, varied spices and tastes, and all you can eat, of course!  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and most of the menu is gluten free, which is important to us.  It's quiet, clean, cozy, not expensive, and decorated classic Indian.  Trader Joes is next door, as is a bead store for the ladies in you group (needs a motorcycle shop or gun store nearby for the men).  If you like Indian, you'll like Star of India!
