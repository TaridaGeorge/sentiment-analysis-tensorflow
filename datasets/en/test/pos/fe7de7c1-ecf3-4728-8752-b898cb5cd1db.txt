In my earlier review I was like, "Only if they served beer...." sometimes they do, now!  Only during certain screenings, like with Rad and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but it's awesome.

This is really, honestly, the coolest theater in Phoenix.  

Maybe one day this place will need a roommate and I can stay in one of the theaters.
