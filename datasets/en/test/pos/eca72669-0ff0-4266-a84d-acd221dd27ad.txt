If you need a really cheesy gift to give to your boyfriend or girlfriend nothing says I Love You and I'm a dork faster than Build A Bear. 

At Build A Bear you pick out your own stuffed animal and they charge you more to do all the work. It's true, but it's also a lot of fun!
You stuff it, you can put sounds in it, dress it anyway you want, and your bear even gets a birth certificate! 

This place is great for kids or adults, and although I do think it's a bit pricey it is also fun and creative. 

Just added build a Hello Kitty! Woohoo!
