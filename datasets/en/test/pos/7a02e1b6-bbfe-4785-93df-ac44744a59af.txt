I am giving them 5 stars because there is no other Chinese food here in Surprise that matches with them. We sometimes come in a big party (15-20) but has never waited for more than 15 minutes. 
My personal favorite is the fish in black bean sauce. My son loves their orange beef. My wife loves the tofu and eggplant dish. 
Never go to other Chinese restaurants in Surprise. This place is affordable, quiet, and the food is always good. It also helps that the service is excellent.
