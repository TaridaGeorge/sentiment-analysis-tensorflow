I just had more decorative painting done by the crew. As before, they were meticulous and very exacting --all the more important because each wall painted is juxtaposed to the basic tan as a contrast panel. Any edge not done with care becomes very noticable. Several sections were again done in faux.
If you are looking for pro's with a creative flair, this is your painting company.
