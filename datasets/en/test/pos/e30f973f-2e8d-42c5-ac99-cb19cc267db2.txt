Small, elegant, romantic and affortable italian restaurant! 5/5

We didn't find out about Tesoro until about a week ago. Went there for J's birthday. We didn't feel like dressing up for a fancy meal but still wanted to have some good soul italian food. So we ended up at Tesoro that night. It was our first time there and we totally love that place! We shared a steamed mussels dish in tomato sauce and I had an amazing seafood pasta dish (~$24). Amazing finding! Would definitely put that on our fav list.
