I walked in expecting to get a drawing and an appointment.  Instead, I got some very cool ideas and an awesome tattoo!  "Uncle" Josh was a great guy with a very unique style.  He did a great job on my pinup tinkerbell without batting an eye at my unusual request.  He kept me comfy and didn't cause any unnecessary pain, and didn't even laugh after I nearly killed myself trying to get up from the table.  I really enjoyed the entire experience from the whole crew to the movie playing, and I will definitely go back when I get another wild idea in my head.
