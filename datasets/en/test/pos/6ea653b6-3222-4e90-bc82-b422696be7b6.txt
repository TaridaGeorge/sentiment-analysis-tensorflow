This place fills a gap that is definitely needed in the area. Fast, delicious, and relatively cheap breakfast food and coffee. Yesterday I had the low carb breakfast in a tomato basil wrap - warm eggs, fresh greens, potato, and pesto sauce. It was fantastic! The iced coffee was smooth, almost-carmely (not sweet), and delicious. I highly recommend this place any day. Oh, and they're open early! 

Beyond the food, the place looks great and has a beautiful patio. It stands out amongst some of the eyesore plazas of Apache. The only down side - they close at 4pm.
