A breakfast/lunch-only place driven by the local industrial and commercial buildings nearby, they have really good sandwiches!  Simple, quick, friendly - go enough times and they start to know you by name.  Their specials on the whiteboard are usually really unique, inventive, and super tasty (they had this one with a mustard sauce/dressing that I still get cravings for, but yet to see it again...).  They close around 2 or 3p so go only if you're in the area.
