I've heard the hype about LGO and this was my first visit (and then again a second time at the SWA terminal at the new airport location). I was not disappointed with the huge portions, unique ingredients and fair prices. 

Tuna salad sandwich is spectacular. Also loved the Thai salad. The sonoma garden salad was a little less memorable as I think it's all packaged before you order it at the airport. It still had nice ingredients and they added shredded chicken for me (at no charge)! The other items I ordered at the restaurant location listed.

I imagine all the food is to die for at LGO.

Be aware that in the evenings the sandwiches aren't available and pizza/entrees take about 25 minutes. Salads are still available
