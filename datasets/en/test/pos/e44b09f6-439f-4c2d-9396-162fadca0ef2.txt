Feeling yucky one day and wanting nothing but some reminders of my bay area asian food... My search began with my iPhone for Pho.. AND I wanted good Pho.. (Im skeptical of some dishes in the desert, just sayin'!).. I drove a good 20min from my loft to find this place.. worth it. Usual toppings you will find with real Vietnamese Pho.. but awesome! I asked for a variety of tofu and seafood.. I couldnt finish it all.. but never can with Pho.. its a big bowl, and filling! 
Extras on tables to get your Pho on.. 
Ordered the Vietnamese Shrimp Rolls too.. left feeling not so stuffy! AND full.. OH yeah, and I still had money for a bit of shoe shopping the next day... :-)
