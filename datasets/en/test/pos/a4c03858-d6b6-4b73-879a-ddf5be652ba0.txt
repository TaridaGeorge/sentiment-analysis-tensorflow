We always stop by this awesome place when we need to wash our dog! Staff is always super nice and helpful.. asking you periodically if any help is needed. Things are always clean and neat which is nice when you're dealing with tons of dog hair! They have a great selection of good-for-you dog food and are knowledgeable about what the differences are. Not to mention they have adorable little treats to give your puppy after their bath! This will always be our number one place for our pets!
