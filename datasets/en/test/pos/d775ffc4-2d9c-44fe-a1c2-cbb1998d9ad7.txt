This Mesa location for Souper Salad has undergone drastic improvements in the last month or so, and I would like to compliment them on a job well done. Gone are the greasy tables and dirty heat lamps, the permanently ill staff coughing on the dinner trays, the poorly laid-out floor plan and the perennially dirty windows. Now the place is open, inviting, and full of sunlight and air. Yes, it's closed now and the doors are locked, but think of the favor they've done you--now you can't eat there if you tried!
