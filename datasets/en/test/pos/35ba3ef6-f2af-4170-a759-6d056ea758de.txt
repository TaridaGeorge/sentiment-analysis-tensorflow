I lived in D.C. for 5 years and got completely spoiled by the ability to go on a choose-your-art adventure any weekend (for free) at any of the many museums.  I was therefore worried that visits to the Phoenix Art Museum just wouldn't compare.  I didn't need to worry!  The Phoenix Art Museum is amazing.  Really wonderful.  The exhibits are varied yet not overwhelming; the docents are knowledgeable (but they don't hover, which is key); and the architecture of the building is beautiful and surprising and perfectly suited for a museum.  I was so impressed.  I'm not used to PAYING for my art yet, but that will come in time, I suppose.
