Best of the best.  This is THE sushi place in all of Scottsdale and the surrounding cities in the Phoenix area.  Having lived in Japan, I have tasted the real good sushi and other traditional Japanese dishes like udon, tonkatsu.   The fish is always fresh sometimes flew in from Japan. On a regular night, Hiro and his sons are behind the counter, making sushi for the customers.  During the cooler months, I like to order the nabeyaki udon and some rolls like toro, caterpillar, rainbow, spicy tuna etc.  The nigiri and sashimi are amazing.  Sometimes, I like to order the bento selection with tempura and tonkatsu as my favorite choices.  The tempura here is just the way it should be, light and crunchy.  Seriously, Hiro Sushi is a gem in the desert state of Arizona, can't get any better... Totemo oichi desu...  (very delicious)
