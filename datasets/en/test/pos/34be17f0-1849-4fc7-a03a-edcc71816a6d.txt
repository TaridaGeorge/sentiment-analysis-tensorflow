Lo-Lo`s:You had me at chicken and waffles!! A first for me trying this and damn I`m gonna be back for more!! Hardest part here was deciding what to order but I went with what I came for- Lo-Lo`s ( 3 pc fried chicken and waffles). Juicy and crisp,Heaven to my tummy!!  Also tried the red Kool aid drank! Yum!!

Like I said I plan to be back to try more delicousness  here, especially the red velvet cake!
