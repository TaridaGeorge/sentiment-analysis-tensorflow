We go there for Christmas dinner but any Sunday is just as nice. Try to arrive by 11:00 AM or you could be in line for over an hour. Prime rib, oysters on the half shell, shrimp, salmon, roast pork plus all the side dishes, mashed potato's, and the dessert bar and key lime pie is just fantastic. This is a 5 star establishment and the servers are very attentive and really take care of you, be sure and leave a nice tip. Just walk past the slot machines going in and out.
