Yum, yum yum - I finally had a sandwich from here and my coworkers were jealous.  Which in all fairness I probably did on purpose.  I got the Market special and Friday a great day.  

Bread is round and thin and charred, and I swear something had the perfect hint if saltiness.  I had turkey with slight chili sauce, fennel and squash puree with greens and provolone.

I am pretty sure Monday I got find some at work I can bribe with I buy you fly, although I don't think I will have to bribe.

I have been there once but was grabbing coffee and the place is chill, sit outside enjoy the day,  and price point dead on
