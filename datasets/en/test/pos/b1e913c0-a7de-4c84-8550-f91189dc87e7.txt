I have a theory that there are great sushi places and then, there are the rest.  This is definitely a great one.

Every time I am in Phoenix, I run to this place (multiple times).  The fish is ALWAYS fresh and I miss it dearly.  They also have tempura but really, eat the sushi!  I would simply eat here everyday if I could.  Really, it is that good.
