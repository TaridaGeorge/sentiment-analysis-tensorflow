Drove all the way down from Anthem to try Chef Jeff's new place. Boy was it worth the trip. The food was delicious. We had both the savory and sweet crepes and each one had its own special something that made it great. The crepes themselves are really flavorful and have a great chewy bite to them. And the fillings are all top notch ingredients with Chef Jeff's signature dedication to amazing flavor combinations. I will definitely be back.
