I have never been a member of any other Yoga Studio so I have nothing else to compare it to, but after being with Metta for about a year, I can with all sincerity say that I never want to leave... (although I may have to once I move :() 

Suzanna is my favorite...  her classes are never the same.   She also has a wonderful personality, you can't go wrong with metta.
