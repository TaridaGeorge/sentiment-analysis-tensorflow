This place rocks and will be a new top Fave!  The delish food, the cheerful, knowledgeable waitstaff, drinks, and even the music (any place playing The Doors, Led Zeppelin, and the song "Relax" has my vote) was great.  Had the Blood Orange martini, Ahi Bowl, and the Sweet Potato fries.  We shared the ceviche, poke, and the calamari.  My wife also had the Mai Tai, which I tasted.  It was refreshing and not too boozy tasting, yet had plenty alcohol.   And for dessert, a great Key Lime Pie.   On a Saturday night, the age range was very eclectic--some families even seemed to be there, yet it is a good place to take a date.   Will go back again!
