Ticks all my boxes for what I need in a nail salon.  Techs are precise and friendly.  They take their time and care that you are perfectly relaxed and happy with what they are doing.  I felt the instruments and tubs were extremely clean.

Don't you just hate those places where all the techs are speaking to each other and you have no idea what they're saying?  Well, at Elite, my tech and I had a running conversation and it was very nice.  She didn't spend any time shouting at the latest client to come in the door or chit-chatting with her fellow techs.  Focused on me.  Yay.

I had the pleasure of a mani and pedi with "Vana", and she was absolutely delightful.

Will definitely return to Elite when I'm back in Scottsdale.
