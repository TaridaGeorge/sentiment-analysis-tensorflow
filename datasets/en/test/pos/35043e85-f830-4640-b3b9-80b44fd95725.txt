I love this restaurant. Whenever I'm in Phoenix for work, I make sure I stop by. The service is wonderful and the food is pretty damn good. I love the soft shell crabs with a load mashed potato. I've also tried the Alaskan King Crab, Lobster, and Salmon and Pappadeaux never dissapoints. They sometimes have specials for a half dozen oysters for only $5. 

I'm from Los Angeles and I wished they tore down all the Red Lobsters and Joe's Crab Shacks and opened a couple of these restaurants closer to home.
