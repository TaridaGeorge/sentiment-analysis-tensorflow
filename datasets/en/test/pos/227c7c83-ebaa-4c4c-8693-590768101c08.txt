For a place called Thao's Sandwiches this place has some AMAZING Pho.  I had the Pho Taii - rice noodles with tender beef - and it was absolutely amazing.  I've tried all the other Pho places in this area and Thao's is by far the best.  Not to mention the fact that their sandwiches are bombmazing as well.  Order Pho, a sandwich and an ice tea, and you are leaving with a bill that tops out at $8 measly American dollars, even with current inflation included, thats a steal.  

First tried this place for dinner on Thursday night, was so good I had to go back for lunch on Saturday.  Had the same thing and it was just as amazing.  You know the Pho is good when you know there are no more noodles or beef yet you keep fishing the bottom of your bowl with chopsticks and spoon.
