The food taste great! We have eaten here 2 nights in a row and they have yet to disappoint. 1st night was the catfish & oyster combo and my hubby had the shrimp Po Boy,  It was a pretty hefty serving of deliciousness! 2nd night was the gumbo and red beans & rice plate, totally hit the spot. They even serve alligator. I love this place!!!
