Food was good, happy hour prices all day long on Tuesday.  Pork and chicken quesadillas, carne asada, shrimp, and pork tacos; all were tasty.  Place was packed so we ate at the bar.  Service was still acceptable despite how busy they were.  They have a good tequila list though I wasn't drinking tonight.
