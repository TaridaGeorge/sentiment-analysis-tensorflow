Why expose a child to music at such an early age when there's so much time? If you've ever been around young children, you've probably noticed how they tend to try to skip rather than walk, dance rather than stroll...Music together in Phoenix creates the perfect environment for you and your little one to harness the opportunity to grow with music. The undeniable benefits are endless whether it's neurological stimulation and brain growth, or fine and gross motor from dancing and playing with the instruments or vocal and speech development from singing! That doesn't even mention all the fun you will have dancing, snuggling and singing! We will be starting our 3 semester with Music Together in Phoenix and my little 14 month old loves it! Teacher Sarah & Teacher Kathy are spectacular!
