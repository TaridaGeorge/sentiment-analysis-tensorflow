Hate the industrial look of the building's exterior, but LOVE the food and service.  Excellent salad bar with never a wilted lettuce leaf in sight.  Love the no-fat honey mustard salad dressing, the Big Chuck Chicken Noodle Soup with more chicken than noodles (who woulda guessed?!), the bran muffins, the chocolate brownie muffins (which taste especially good when topped with frozen yogurt) . . . .  I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!  LOVE THIS PLACE!!!
