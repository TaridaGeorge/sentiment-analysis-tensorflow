This place was awesome!! I had never had a pasty before going here, and it was definitely worth all of the hype I saw on yelp. The ambiance was the first thing I noticed when I walked it. It's a very long, dimly lit restaurant with limited seating if you're not into sitting at a bar (which, I don't mind). One of the servers was quick to notice our group right away, and provided us with drinks as we waited for a place to sit. The beer was very diverse and exciting, which made me extra happy. The grub was great... I got the pork with mashed potatoes pasty with a red wine dipping sauce. I have to agree with past reviews and say that the dipping sauce was delicious! Next time I'm in Tempe, I'll be making my way back to this place.
