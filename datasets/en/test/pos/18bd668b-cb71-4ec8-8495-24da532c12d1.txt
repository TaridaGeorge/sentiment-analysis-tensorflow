I go to Steve (Slava) quite frequently (as in, whenever the hair gets long) and the fact that I drive all the way to his location from my castle in Tempe should tell you that it's for a good reason. His rates are good, the quality of haircuts is very consistent and you can even ask for a neck shave with an actual straight blade. He is careful, yet efficient and quick. Don't forget to tip well!
