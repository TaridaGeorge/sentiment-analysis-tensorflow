My girlfriend and I stopped to have lunch here a few months ago. The name "The House at Secret Garden" says it all. The location is a beautful secluded house with intimate and pleasant landscaped surroundings. 

I ordered the roasted cauliflower soup and she ordered the grilled chicken with salad. The soup was really delicious and her chicken smelled heavenly. We both finished our meals and then headed outside to walk into the "secret garden." We sat in a shaded grass area in between the tall trees and chatted. 

We enjoyed our time there, the food and scenery were great, so we both agreed we would eventually come back.
