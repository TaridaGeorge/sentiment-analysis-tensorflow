I don't remember exactly when I met David. As a home inspector, I seemed to be running into him several times per month. David is one of the most reliable and honest professionals I have met. I was present when a home buyer thought it would be a good idea to treat for termites, and David talked her out of it. Said it wasn't necessary. He also lets people know if they can obtain treatment from an existing warranty which means they don't have to spend additional money. A great guy; family run business with two generations of experience, terrific personality and a beautiful family.
