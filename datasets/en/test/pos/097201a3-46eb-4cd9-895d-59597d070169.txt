Quality food and good service!

My favorite is Sauce's sausage and pepperoni pizza, with red peppers, onions and mushroom.  Definitely a gourmet pizza with quality ingredients.  Although it's a small 12 inch thin crust pizza, it is satisfying and has a freshness unlike the typical heavy pizza you find at other chains.

The vegetable chopped salad is served in a generous-sized bowl.  I like the light dressing and crisp bite size veggies.

You order at the counter and your meal is brought to your table.  The servers are attentive and check to see if you need anything. This service always earns them a tip by my appreciative lunch buddy.

I look forward to a future lunch at Sauce!
