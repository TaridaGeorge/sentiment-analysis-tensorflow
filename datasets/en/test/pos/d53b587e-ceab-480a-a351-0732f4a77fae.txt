I am shocked at how much I liked their curry chickpea soup. I had a cup for 2.99 and was stuffed. The chickpeas were done perfectly, and a slice of pita bread to dip made the whole thing that much more enjoyable. I was hesitant about this place because the one in Tempe is less exciting. I can't wait to frequent this place when I live downtown.
