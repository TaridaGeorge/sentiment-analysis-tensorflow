Sometimes I just wanna sit on the patio with my friends and not worry about having to chase down a server or bartender to get a brew. Casey Moore's fills that void in my nightlife, I had to put *zero* effort into getting a pint. They even patiently made obnoxious, complex drink orders without showing the slightest signs of irritation. 

This is what a perfect staff looks like. IDK about the food (not important) or like the restroom (size of a closet), but it gets 5 stars so that other bars' staff can perhaps down a black velvet while they take notes.
