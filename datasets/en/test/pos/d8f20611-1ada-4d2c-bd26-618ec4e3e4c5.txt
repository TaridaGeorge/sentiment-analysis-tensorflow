Ahhh how I love love love this store. I feel like I'm back in Seattle and get get all the Asian goodies I grew up eating. this place is a true gem. I often pick up some new type of noodle, fried goodie or "odd" food that I can't get anywhere else in Phoenix (except maybe Lee Lee's, but I don't wanna drive way the ef out there). 

I like that I can get some very authentic items to cook with, and really learn about the different cultures. They have a great seafood/meat market and I'm dying to try one of the peking ducks they have hanging in the deli window!! Great store to have in my cooking repoitoire!
