Pizzeria Bianco (bear with me here) was the first bad review i wrote on yelp. And one of the few.

On a friend's suggestion, our faith in old-house-come-traditional-pizza-joints was restored when we came to Cibo.

I can honestly say that I've tried every pizza, salad and antipasto on the menu and have never been less than delighted by any of it.

Top it off with consistently good service and a great value, and Cibo has us coming back once a month if not more often.
