The tempura orange roughy has ruined me on all other food. It was possibly the most delicious thing I have ever had. The coating was crunchy, but not rough and the sauce it came in was rich and delicious! My husband is constantly dragging me to Chinese places that serve mediocre noddle dishes with so much salt, I can barely finish them, but this was a pleasant surprise! The atmosphere was lovely and the green tea ice cream was amazing! Cannot wait to go back. Oh yeah, it's incredibly reasonable for the food your getting. We couldn't believe how little we paid for such fantastic food!
