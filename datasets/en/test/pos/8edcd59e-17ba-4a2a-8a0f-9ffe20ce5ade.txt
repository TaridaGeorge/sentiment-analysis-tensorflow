When I was here, (and I'm not making this up) Bill Gates was on the next lounge chair by the pool (with a guy in shorts and a blue blazer who looked extremely alert). My wife had a massage and waited next to Julia Roberts. I don't know if this is normal or not but it was us, Bill and Julia. Same old, same old. The pool is fantastic. The service was great. The prices were astoundingly high. Very classy place. Come here to relax but if you look at the bill, you will not be relaxed.
