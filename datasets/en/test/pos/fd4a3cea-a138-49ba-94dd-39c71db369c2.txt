I love everything Bianco. I just went to PHX last week and ended up at Pizzeria Bianco twice - you may think of me as a bit crazy, but I tell you that in all my travels (Italy 3 times and living in NY), there is no better pizza. 

I enjoy the wait because of this place.. spending 2 hours drinking Peroni's, a bottle of the Green & Red and a plate of cheese is a great way to spend an evening, if you ask me. This place is also about as good as you can get for a date - just not a first one. 

Fair prices and a great atmosphere.. get there early if you want a seat inside and feel free to read the notes that people have written to each other on napkins inside the small table in the corner of the front room.
