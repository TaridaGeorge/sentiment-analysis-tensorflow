Lenny (the tint wizard) did a fantastic job. He was fast and efficient and also prevented me from making a dumb rookie tinting maneuver by providing his honest opinion as opposed to just going for the bigger sale. I was having work done on my car over at Rick's Auto Body and just had them drop it off at Tint Wizard when they were finished.  

Worked out nicely and my car looks sweeeet... Thanks Lenny!
