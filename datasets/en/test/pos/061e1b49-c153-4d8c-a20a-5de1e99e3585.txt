I'm surprised to see such mediocre reviews of this place!  I live just up the street, so we go to J. Alexanders at least a couple of times a month.  Everytime we've been here we leave raving about the service, the food and the drinks.  We actually tried Houstons across the street before we tried J's and left Houston's saying never...ever again!   We've taken out of town guests and business clients and they're always impressed!    In a city full of chain restaurant after chain restaurant J Alexanders (I know it's also a chain) stands out in the crowd!
