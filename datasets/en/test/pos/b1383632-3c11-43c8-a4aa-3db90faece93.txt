I took my wife, daughter - 7, son - 3, and mother-in-law (not by choice - lol) and we had a great time.  The kids loved looking in the stores at all the different and somewhat authentic items.  My daughter really enjoyed the gold mine tour and my sun loved the train ride.  A definite must see if you want a taste of a mining town in the old west.
