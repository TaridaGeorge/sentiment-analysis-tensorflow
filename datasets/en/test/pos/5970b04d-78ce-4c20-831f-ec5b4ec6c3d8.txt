I took my Onkyo TX4500MKII to be repaired and cleaned by the guys at this shop and I must say they did a stellar job.  $25 diagnosis fee is standard but applied to the balance of your repair.  I small price to pay to get your vintage equipment up and running!

No hassles, quick turnaround.

Perfect!
