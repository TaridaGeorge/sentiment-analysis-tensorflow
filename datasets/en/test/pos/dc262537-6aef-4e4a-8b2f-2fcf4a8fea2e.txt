While on lunch a week or so ago I saw the signage for this new location, and on a 100 degree Sunday afternoon I figured it was time to check it out.

I had been to the Bell Rd location before so I knew what to expect for the most part.  It was nice to see this location is a bit larger, as the Bell Rd location seems cramped (if not as well laid out).  There are 16 flavors to choose from, and a spread of toppings ranging from fruit to cereal to candy bars to you name it.  At 39 cents per ounce you won't be breaking the bank unless you fill their largest tub to the brim.  They also have a loyalty card that (unless my math sucks) equals out to a free $5 cup for every $50 spent.
