First of all the portions are amazing. I had the Catfish Lunch special. It comes with 3 pieces of nice sized catfish, a heaping fries, white bread lightly toasted and all the condiments you need. 
The seasoning in the fries is great and the fish didnt taste "fishy" the way catfish can. It had a nice light coating on it as if it was not soaked in grease. 
I went ahead and ordered a small cole slaw and it seems homemade. Very fine and not too sweet or or drowned in mayonnaise.  My drink was Triple Berry KoolAid. 
Can't wait to try something else. I hope this place survives because it is hidden in South Phoenix.
