Great spot for lunch in City Scape, downtown Phoenix.

Took a friend here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon, and we both loved it! I was so surprised at how spacious and open the place is and how interesting it is to see the preparation area in front of you. The staff was very friendly and attentive. We ordered the chicken salad and a turkey club or sorts, the names escape me. Both were made right in front of us at the bar. They were amazing! My friend said it was the best chicken said she'd had in a very long time and I was gushing about the sauce my sandwich had on it. 

I wish I could have tired one of their breakfast items because the danishes and bagels looked great. I cannot say enough good things about this place and I cannot wait to go back.
