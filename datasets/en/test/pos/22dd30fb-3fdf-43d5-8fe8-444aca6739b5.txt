Absolutely AMAZING.

My coworker and I were sent to Phoenix for work and he suggested we try this place for dinner.  I was a bit weary since I heard that the portions were small and the faire was somewhat pricey.  Although that is in fact the case, the quality, taste and overall ambiance of the place made it definitely worth it.  We practically ordered everything off the menu and we left (borderline) uncomfortably stuffed.  My three favourite dishes were the Short Rib & Pork Belly and SoftShell Crab sandwiches and the Grapefruit & Hamachi.  

If only they had this restaurant in San Diego......
