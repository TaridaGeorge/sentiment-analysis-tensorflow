This is great! I stopped here for lunch and had one of the salad and pasta lunch specials. The salad with mixed greens, chicken, pine nuts, gorgonzola cheese, and tomatoes was delicious! My pasta was also very good. It was the perfect portion size and also came with a drink and bread---all for $8! I was impressed.
