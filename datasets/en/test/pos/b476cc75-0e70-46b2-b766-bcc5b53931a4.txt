The staff is here is always friendly and usually pretty fast (sometimes they have lines out the door so I cut 'em some slack). We eat there a LOT and the pizza and wings are consistently good and very reasonably priced for the specials. We always get the slice and wings special, which comes with a drink. If you get the VIP card, this special is available any time of the day. Yes, there are better pizzas out there, but my family and I still choose to eat here. It's close, it's friendly, it's affordable and it hits the spot.
