Had lunch here today It was great, the food was great We had the Appetizer Trio, Pasta Mardi Gras, and the Mixed Seafood Grill. It was way more food than the two of us could eat. The server was very attentive and very helpful. I would recommend Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen to anyone who likes Cajun food or Seafood there is so much to choose from and basically the server said we could change anything on the menu to have it made just the way we wanted. AWESOME
