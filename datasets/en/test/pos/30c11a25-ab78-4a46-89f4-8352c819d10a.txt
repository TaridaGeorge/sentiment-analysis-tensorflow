This review is for the current production ending 4/5/09, Masters of Movement.

Wow. What a great program.  They led w/ the classic Les Sylphides, but it was the 2 modern pieces that blew my socks off.  Polyphonia choreographed by Christopher Wheeldon had some incredible movements of balance and dexeterity that I turned to my sis, who was attending with me, and commented, "I bet you and the Irish Hubbie do that in the bedroom." 

The final piece was The Golden Section from the Twyla Tharp ballet The Catherine Wheel. Twyla Tharp collaborates with David Byrne (Talking Heads) = FUUUUNNNN. The energy of that number with the dancers flying and the beat of Byrne's music made that piece my favorite.

David Byrne ROCKS.
