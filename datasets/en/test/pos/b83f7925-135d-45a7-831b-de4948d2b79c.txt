I wish I had tried this place earlier! It has quickly become my go-to place for pizza in the Valley. I really like Oregano's, but they are better known for their specialty pizzas and when I crave sausage pizza they aren't my number one choice. I've never actually eaten in-shop as I always pick it up and take it home, but they are prompt and I've never had to wait for it to finish. There is seriously something addicting in their sweet sauce, because you definitely start to crave it after a while. I wasn't quite sure the first time I had it, but I've quickly come to love the taste.

I tend to go between the Mama's Signature, the Combo, and the Sausage and Peppo, but I've never had a bad pizza. Way better than the chains! I've found it even reheats better than most.
