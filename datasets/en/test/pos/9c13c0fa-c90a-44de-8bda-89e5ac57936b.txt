Just a wonderful little theater. Always clean, easy to go with the kiddos, and super friendly workers. 

I didn't know that my daughter was free until she was 2. I was there paying and the girl noticed that she was little and asked her age. After I told her, she said, "Oh no ma'am, she's free!" and proceeded to refund me. That was so nice. 

This Harkins is my go-to theater.
