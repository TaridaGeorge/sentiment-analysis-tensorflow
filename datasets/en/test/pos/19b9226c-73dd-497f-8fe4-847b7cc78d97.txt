I have 5 piercings and i got them all at HTC. Each time I got a new piercing they took the time to not only answer all of my questions but to show me how to take care of my new piercing instead of just tossing a pamphlet at me like they do at Club Tattoo.I will admit that I am neurotic about symmetry and each time my piercer made sure that my piercings lined up. They even set up a time for me to come back in for a check up on some of my more sensitive piercings to make sure everything was healing correctly. If you want a great piercing experience I would recommend HTC.
