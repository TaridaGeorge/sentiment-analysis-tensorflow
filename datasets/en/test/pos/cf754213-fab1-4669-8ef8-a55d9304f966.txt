I read about Lobbys on the Internet and was excited about the hamburger, when i arrived I noticed that the place was very clean which is always a plus, once i ordered my double cheeseburger i was amazed once my number was called, it looked just like the photo's that I seen on the Internet, thick, juicy and hand formed Burger's tasted great, if you like real burgers check this place out.
