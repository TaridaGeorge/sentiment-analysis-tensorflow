I think noodles ranch is truly awesome Vietnamese food.  It's a small menu, but everything is well done, and it is probably the only place you can find vegetarian pho with a meatless stock.

If you're looking for cheap Vietnamese, there are definitely cheaper places.  If you're looking for a place that is clean, friendly and good, this is a great choice.  I typically eat here once a week.
