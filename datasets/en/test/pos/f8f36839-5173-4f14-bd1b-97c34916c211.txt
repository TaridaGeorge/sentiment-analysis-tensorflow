Costco Travel - My husband and I recently returned from a trip to the Big Island, HI that we arranged throught Costco Travel. After shopping around I found that their prices were the best and after one phone call I was able to make all arrangements for airfair, condo and car. They didn't have arrangements with any B&Bs on Hilo but were able to adjust our travel dates. Everything went according to plan with all arrangements being accurate. Condo was outstanding and a great value. We got gas and did some souvenier shopping at the Costco in Kona and again saved $$.   I've shopped at Costco for years - now becoming a groupie!
