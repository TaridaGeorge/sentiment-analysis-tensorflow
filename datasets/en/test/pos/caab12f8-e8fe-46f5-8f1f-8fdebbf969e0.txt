I started at Ulta with Brian and Miguel; both of them have done my train-wreck I call hair. Brian managed to fix a bad self-dye job and usually does the cut and was entirely too patient. Miguel has styled my hair. I typically go see Brian but I swear by both of them. I followed them to D Hair Lounge and I love the place! It's cozy, small, and comfortable. You don't have people shopping around and staring at you while you're getting your hair done. Everyone is super nice and I have no idea what happened with the person who gave them 1 star... They do typically run a bit behind, but they do a spectacular job. Perfection takes time and if you want a fast cut, maybe you should run to Supercuts.
