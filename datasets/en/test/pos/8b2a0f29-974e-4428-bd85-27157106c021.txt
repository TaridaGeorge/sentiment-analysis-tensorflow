My picks:

The Cable Car (my current favorite drink on earth)
Rosemary Roasted Cheese
Sweet and Spicy Burger (really ... it's made with candied jalapenos)
Chocolate Bread Pudding

I dream of Chef Matt McLinn.  I absolutely love this menu! 

Plus the owners George & Allen might be some of the most charitable guys in town.  I heard about this location at three charity events they supported before the restaurant was even open.
