I could spend HOURS in this store. Seriously, you can find any & every container for everything in your house. 

If you love organizing this is the place to go. They have little trinkets and plastic containers for your bathroom, kitchen, bedrooms. 

You can also order stuff online like shelves and pick them up here too. 

i ordered to leaning book shelves that I had to assemble myself. Lots of people on the floor to help find what you need as well.

It's located next to a Whole Foods and there's plenty of parking!
