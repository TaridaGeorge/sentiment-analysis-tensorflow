Just had my teeth cleaned and checked here.  I would highly recommend this dental office--the hygienist was the best I have ever had!  The space was clean and comfortable, the dentist and hygienist were on time, and the office could not have been more convenient for people working downtown.  The office also has up to date technology, so even the uncomfortable x-ray process was much better, easier, and faster than I have experienced in the past.  Two thumbs way up!
