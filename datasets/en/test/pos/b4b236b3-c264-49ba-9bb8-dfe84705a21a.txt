Wow! I was very impressed by this place. They might have the largest topping selection of any fro-yo place in the area (including chocolate waffle cone chunks, kiwi, nutella, and tons more). The quality is much higher than most other places, and they have an excellent variety to choose from. I would strongly recommend it!
