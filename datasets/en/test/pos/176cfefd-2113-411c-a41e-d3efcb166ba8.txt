I was frankly blown away by how nice the people working here were. I'm used to the typical Baskin Robbins or Cold Stone employees who usually don't care if you have a good experience or not.

The Gelato Spot employees asked if we wanted samples and made good recommendations when asked about flavor pairings. They all provided energetic and smiling service. 

The gelato was excellent. I can't tell you whether it was good gelato or not but it sure tasted good to me. 

What also struck me was how clean the place was -especially on a busy Friday evening.

I'll be back again, most definitely.
