I eat here all the time and I really wish this place was busier. The food is great and the owners are both very friendly. The only real downside is there's no free refills. I usually drink water so it's not a big deal for me, but some people love their soda. They serve both lunch and dinner but they're closed from 2pm to 5pm- so get there early for lunch!
