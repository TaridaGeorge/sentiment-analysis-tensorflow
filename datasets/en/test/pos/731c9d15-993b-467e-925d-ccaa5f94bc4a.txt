They are very friendly and took great care of my dog Max. He needed surgery for bladder stone removal and they did a great job. Great follow up, I received a call the next day to check on Max. The surgery was expensive, but I called around to 2 different vets to see about pricing and make sure I wasn't getting gouged and Arizona Animal Wellness Center was $600 less. Very happy with them.
