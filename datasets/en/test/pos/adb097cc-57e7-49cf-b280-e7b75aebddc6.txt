I am usually not an organic food person, but this may change my mind.  Great food and service.  Nice simple menu, but food quality is great, never knew kale could taste so good.  Also sampled the pizza's, and black cod.  The only drawback is that it is loud inside, so if you a looking for a quiet place, this may not be the place for you.  But, it still deserves 5 stars in my mind...
