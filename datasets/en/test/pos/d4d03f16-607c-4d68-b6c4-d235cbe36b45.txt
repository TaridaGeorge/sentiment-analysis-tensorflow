I am a diehard Phoenix Suns Fan. Back in the day with Kevin Johnson and Charles Barkley. It broke my heart when Amare left, but we still have one if not the best point guard in the league, Steve Nash. We're definitely in the rebuilding phase, but we've proven we're still capable of being a playoff contender! GO SUNS!
