I swear I probably eat at this place **too** much, but I have made a commitment to myself to eat better, to include seeking out organic and local options, wherever possible, and I haven't found a place that does it quite like this, for such a reasonable price.  Be sure to check out their amazing happy hour specials, as well!!
