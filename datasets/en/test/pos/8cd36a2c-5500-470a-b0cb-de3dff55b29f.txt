I am picky about boba. The Street satisfies my boba cravings in every way, always! PLUS, the ambiance is killer, tiny shop with graffiti-like writing all over the walls, little pictures scrawled everywhere, very hip feeling without being stuck up.

The Street has good quality boba, fast and polite service, and in my experience the drink you have the actual boba is always good! I've tried everything from the thai iced tea ( not a big fan of the sweetener used but thats just me), to the pineapple-kiwi slush with double boba, to the chocolate strawberry milk smoothie with double boba! Consistently delicious!  

If you love boba, you will love The Street.
