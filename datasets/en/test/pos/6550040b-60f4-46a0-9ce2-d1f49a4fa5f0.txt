This is my FAVORITE place to come and hang out with friends.  The food is good and the drinks are even better.  I have been here on Sunday morning to watch football and almost had a seizure because I don't know which tv to focus on because they have all the games playing on multiple tv's.
The watresses seem to always be in a good mood and having a good time. I have some of my best drunk memeories from here (Patron) that I can and can't remember.
