Yelp needs the ability to add a sixth star...

Not much to add to what's already been written here. Gangplank rocks my world.

Several wannabe geeks whose day job entails selling real estate got all fired up to find an open collaborative workspace where we could talk real estate and get our geek on.

Gangplank offered up some space, and we're off to the races.

Let's face it. It takes special people to welcome a bunch of real estate agents, lenders and title guys into their work place. Gangplank welcomes us with open arms. That's pretty freaking cool.
