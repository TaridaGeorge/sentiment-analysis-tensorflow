This place had one of the best chocolate croissants I've ever tasted outside of Paris!! Their chocolate is not too sweet and it has just the perfect amount of chocolate instead of one "toothpaste" squeezed shaped roll you usually find in a chocolate croissants here! You have to come early cuz it is really hard to find a place to sit! We were very lucky to find a large table for 6 ppl.  As everyone has been telling us to try their macaroons, they are worth coming for! The texture of the cookie is chewy instead of flaky and crumbly.  I also like the croque Madame!! It's so great they don't put the ham on it..Thank goodness for that!
