Dr. Cheng is the best Doc in the whole Queen Creek area.  He's funny, he listens to you, and takes his time.  He does meet with a lot of patients but it always feels he's taking the time for you.  I love that when I have an appointment with him, I get right in (no waiting) and NO I am not kidding.  This seriously is the best Doctors office that I have been to in this area and all of Arizona.  If you live in the Queen Creek/Gilbert area and looking for a good family Doc.  This is the place.
