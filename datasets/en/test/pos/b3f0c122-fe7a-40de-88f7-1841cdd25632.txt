LOVE Hillstone it never dissapoints.  We ended up at Hillstone last night after being badly mistreated at another restaurant.  (an hour and a half wait that never got us a table)  We arrive at HILLSTONE  hungry & frustrated we explained to the host what happened..... He told us another 20 min. wait we went to the bar and before we had our drinks we had a table! Not to mention a complimentary appetizer and a really lovely waitress.  We were so grateful to be treated so well and the food was outstanding!  Hillstone saved our girls night out and cemented our love of the restaurant!
