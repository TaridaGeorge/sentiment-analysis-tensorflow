The service here is friendly, and they have samples sometimes.  I have started buying loafs of their pastry bread to eat for breakfast. Everything I've bought here has been really fresh and delicious. They have also been well stocked when I've been in, and the store is really nice looking, as well as clean. I'm not sure about the price because I've never really bought bread from a bakery before. For the pastry loafs they are around 4 dollars. The singular pastry breads have been 1.25 I think.
