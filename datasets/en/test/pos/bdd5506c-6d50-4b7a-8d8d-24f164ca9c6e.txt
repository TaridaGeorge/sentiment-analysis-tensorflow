I love this place. Delicious homemade pasta and a beautiful, open atmosphere. They accommodated my birthday party of about 30 people even though they don't take non-corporate reservations. They were still able to sit us all in the same general area relatively quickly on a busy night. I've gone a couple times since it just opened and I haven't been disappointed once. Sometimes I even stop by here for a drink on the patio while I walk my dog around the neighborhood. While I'm sad that it is no longer that really awesome hand carwash, I can't complain that it is a really awesome Fox Concepts restaurant right down the street from my place. Will definitely go back. Often.
