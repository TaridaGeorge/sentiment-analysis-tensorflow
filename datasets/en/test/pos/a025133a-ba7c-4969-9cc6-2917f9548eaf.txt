Thinking about one of these burgers is making me wish I didnt live in Chicago. They are so tasty it should be against the law. The place has such a great feel with the fire pits, animals, and live music. It is one of those places that you can go for the burger and hang out all night just enjoying the atmosphere and roasting marshmallows. It is definitely one of my "must go to" places when I vacation to Arizona. I wonder if my dollar is still hanging from the ceiling?
