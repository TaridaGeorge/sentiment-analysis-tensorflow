We stayed at the Westin Kierland and went over to Chloe's Corner for breakfast one day.  What a great little spot!  

Independently owned, this place has all the character and atmosphere of a sandwich shop in NY or San Francisco.  They have counter seating at the long butcher block counter, lots of indoor tables and a few tables outside as well.  Coffee, sandwiches, snacks, beer, salads, etc.  Perfect spot for breakfast, lunch or take-out.  Highly recommended.
