I am indebted to this store. My home was infiltrated with ticks thanks to my beloved puppies and after using some other store bought solutions (from Target) and then hiring an expensive professional service to treat our home inside and out, we still kept finding the ticks on our dogs and in our home. The wonderful people at Bug and Weed Mart in Phoenix, provided me with very simple instructions and after a very small investment and about an hour of my time treating my year and home, I am happy to say-"problem solved!"  I only wish I knew about this store and went to them in the first place. It would have saved me a lot of time and money.
