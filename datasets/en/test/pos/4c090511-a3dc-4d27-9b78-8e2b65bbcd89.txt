i'm not an arizona resident/native (but who is?).  i have 2 friends who live in the area and every time i come to visit, i have to come here.

being from chicago, it's refreshing to have a healthy choice when i come visit.  i LOVE the chicken pasta salad.  i know, it's nothing fance, but it is refreshing and yummy.  i recreated the dish at home.  i also think the hummus is fab, too.

being from chicago, i know good food.  pita jungle is a great place for healthy, refreshing food in a laid-back atmosphere.  eating outside by the lake is the best.
