What an amazing place to stay. I went out there for business but really felt I was on vacation the whole time,In fact I decided to extend my trip because I did not want to leave.The private suite I stayed in had my own jacuzzi out on the deck that over looked the beautiful mountains. Just breath taking.The service was top notch. The Phoenician Hotel is much prettier in person. This place should be on everyone's bucket list as a must stay.
