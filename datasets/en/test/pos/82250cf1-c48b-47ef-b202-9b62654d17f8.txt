W0o-hoo!  I am a fan... BUT note the review is for a WINDSHIELD CHIP REPAIR only.  My insurance does not cover windshield replacement so I was left to find a place that could do a chip repair.  The chip was a little bigger than a quarter.  A friend recommended Safelite and Diamond Glass.  Safelite quoted me $79.95 online!!  There is no guarantee the windshield won't crack so that was way too much to pay.

Diamond Glass was only $19.99!  They contract the work out to the local Jiffy Lube.  I drove up, 30 minutes later the chip was repaired!  BONUS.., they offer a 10% ASU DISCOUNT on all services and there is no tax so I ended up paying $17.99 out the door!
