We went for restaurant week and had outstanding service, wonderful food, and reasonbale drink prices.  We really enjoyed beef tenderloin, smoked salmon quesadillas, and pecan pie.  My French Maritini with Grey Goose was awesome for $12.50!  It is a formal setting with low lighting for a nice romantic setting.
