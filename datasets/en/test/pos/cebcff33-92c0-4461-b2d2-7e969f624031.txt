What I like about Casey Moore's (other than the obvious drunkenness) is that it's a converted house. I'm a sucker for anything that's not in a strip mall and the fact that it's in the historic Maple-Ash neighborhood in Tempe is a bonus. It's neat to sit and drink on the large patio and watch people walk to their homes or on their way to Mill Ave. I'm always jealous of those people. If I could afford one of those houses, I'd move there and frequent Casey Moore's every week. Being walking distance from such a cool bar? Score. It's a nice change to have brews on their large patio and enjoy the winter or spring weather.
