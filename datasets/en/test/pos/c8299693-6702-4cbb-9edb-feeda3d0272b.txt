Had delivery from this location multiple times. The pizza isn't lets say cheap, but with the quality ingredients it's worth it! Kind of like the Whole foods of delivery. They also have sandwiches, salads, and etc... I can't help it though with rustic pizza's and a choice of whole wheat crust I've been stuck on the pizza and I don't want to share! Next time I'm doing half and half because it's so hard to pick just one.

Easy online ordering is awesome! I also want to say the woman who has delivered a couple times seems sooo happy. It's really nice. It makes me want to apply for a job, so that I can be happy too. :)
