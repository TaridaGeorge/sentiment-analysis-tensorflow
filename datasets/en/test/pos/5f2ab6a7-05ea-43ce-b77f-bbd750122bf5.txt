This is one of my favorite places to go and eat and drink at. There probably isn't enough space for me to write what I could in here about San Tan Brewery. It's located in downtown Chandler and is sandwitched between the San Marcos resort and lots of neat restaurants and little galleries. This place is always busy and is worth the wait. They brew their own beer and I really like the Sunspot Gold (very light) and the HefeWeizen Wheat (Oh so good!) If you order anything to eat, I will sugget the pork pibil. Hands down, the best I have ever had. Their Chandler Club sandwich is vey good too. Excellent place to hang out with friends and family.
