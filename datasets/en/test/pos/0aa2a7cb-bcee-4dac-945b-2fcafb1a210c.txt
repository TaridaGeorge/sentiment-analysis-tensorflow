This is the best frozen yogurt place I have been to anywhere....not just in Arizona.  They make their own yogurt daily, where many other places get it from a vendor.  You really can taste the difference!  They also offer much more than yogurt.  You can design your own smoothie, but my favorite is the Boba tea.  I literally get it every day, sometimes twice!  It has completely replaced my Starbucks addiction, and is a lot healthier (no fat, less calories).  My daughter first asked me to take her, but now, I go even when she is at school.....shhhh, don't tell her that.

The owner is incredibly friendly, and he has trained his staff well, because they give you the same great customer service when the owner isn't there!
