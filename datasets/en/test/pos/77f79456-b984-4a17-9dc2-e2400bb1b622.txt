You have got to try this place!  I love the concept of writing what you want on the bag your sandwich comes in.  It speeds up the line since there never is one because the slow pokes are still figuring things out on the sidelines and you can bolt right by them if you know what you are doing.  The ingredients are always good and fresh, plus the way they grill the sandwich it always comes out so perfectly blended and tasty.  Cant say enough about this place except they need more locations, I have to make a special visit if I am craving this place or plan my day around it when i get close by.
