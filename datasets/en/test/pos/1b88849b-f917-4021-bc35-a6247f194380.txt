Great grilled Italian sausage! So good, and I'm a plain person and don't like new foods much. Had with the sweet peppers, which was great! Husband loved his bacon burger. Great fries and their special sauce was surprising good. (again I don't like trying new things) but this place was great. Bringing my parents next they come to the valley!
