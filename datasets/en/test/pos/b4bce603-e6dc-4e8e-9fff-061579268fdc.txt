This place was sooo yummy! 

Very clean, nice employees.  

I really wish we had Pinkberry here in PHX, but in many ways this is better.  At least 10 different flavors of yogurt to choose from.  I tried their green tea, but didn't like it as much as Pink's.  But they did have a DELICIOUS "taro" flavor that I think I like even better.  I could eat a ton of it.  There were also many many delicious toppings to choose from.  I"m kind of boring and just like the fresh fruit and nuts, but there are also sprinkles and cheesecake bits. 

This is a really great place to go for a date, b/c it is so cheap and intimate.
