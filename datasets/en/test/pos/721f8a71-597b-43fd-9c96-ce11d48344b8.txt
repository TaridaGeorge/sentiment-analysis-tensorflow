I was just having a discussion about top 5 places to eat in the Phoenix area with my friends. Many of their answers were fancy, expensive, date type places. Mine top choice was Pita Jungle. 

Every time I am here, the food tastes fresh and made with love. The lavoshes are very tasty. 

But my favorite orders are the grilled chicken and hummus or the Mediterranean chicken salad. Both delectable!!!!
