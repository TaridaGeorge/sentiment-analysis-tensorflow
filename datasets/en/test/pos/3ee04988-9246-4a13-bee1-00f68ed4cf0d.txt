Okay, so I have to admit, I'd addicted to Picazzo's! Where else can you go when you're gluten free, living in Phoenix and absolutely LOVE, and I do mean LOVE, Italian. One mouthwatering word: Picazzo's. 

They get it right from the texture of the GF pizza crust to the taste to the million toppings you can concoct on it. Also, they have a plethora of other goodies such as spinach and artichoke dip, Mama's Meatballs and the perfect pesto pasta dish. The regular foods not too bad either I hear, I'll take my boyfriends word on it.
