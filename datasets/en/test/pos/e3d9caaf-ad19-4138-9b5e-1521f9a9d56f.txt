Classic Italian Pizza was recommended to me by some friends who said, "You may think it's not there, but it is."  Oh yes, it is and is fantastic.  I crave their food!  Being a vegetarian many places don't have much to offer, but their menu offers many different options for those of us who don't eat meat anymore.  I have introduced many family and friends to this restaurant and each one of them has returned many times.  The appetizers are fantastic (Aglio Olio is my favorite) as well as any pizza I have had and any others that my friends have tried.  Give them a try, you won't regret it (I hope!).
