Honestly, one of the most amazing and delicious sandwiches I have ever had!! That dressing is garlic heaven, the sandwich was LOADED with meat but balanced with the other ingredients well, the bread was perfect! My eleven year old just freaked out at how amazing his sandwich was, he wants to eat it everyday now.  I had a turkey and prov, the kido had an Italian.  

The sandwich alone is five tons of trillions stars, but the owners are one hundred million, billion, infinity....  I enjoyed the kind and simple conversation we had so much! They made my day! 

I can't wait to some back!
