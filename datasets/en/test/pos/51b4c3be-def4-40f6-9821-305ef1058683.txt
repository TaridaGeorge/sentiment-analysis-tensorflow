Delicious Cajun food! A friend took me here for my birthday and I am definitely a fan. Great flavors and great selections. The food is slightly pricey but wonderful for the restaurant. Very memorable. :) 

I would definitely come back. I love spicy and butter and this place has a wonderful combination of both. The portions are also large so it will feel you up until you are a happy full. Service at the table is also a hundred times better than the bar so sit at the table. For Westcoasters, like myself, definitely give this place a try!
