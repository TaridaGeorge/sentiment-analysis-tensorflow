Decided to try this new sandwich Shop on Dobson and Germann. Since opening we have been at least twice every week! I love sub sandwiches especially the specialty sandwich Shops like Fire House Subs and Jimmy John's.  They have a large specialty menu of sandwiches as well as a build your own.  They also have a ton of add on's like sundried tomatoes, artichokes, cream cheese, guacamole, etc.   AND the best part is they are baked to perfection!!!
