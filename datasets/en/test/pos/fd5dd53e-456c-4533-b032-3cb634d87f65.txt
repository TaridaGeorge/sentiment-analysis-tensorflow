This is my favourite Pier 1 Imports location in the Phoenix area, especially for the West Valley... much nicer than the Surprise location, too! The store is a bit larger, the employees are friendly and helpful, they have an excellent selection, and they always have plenty of clearance items! :) Actually, before going to this Pier 1 location, I would've never thought about writing a Yelp review for one... they were all pretty standard and similar to one another. The Goodyear store definitely impressed me, though!
