I came here based on a suggestion by a waiter from another restaurant.  The food here was so good that after two weeks I'm still dreaming about it.  I felt like I was a judge on Top Chef or Iron Chef.  Everything that they served me was amazing- my favorites were the foie gras and the wild boar bacon.  I do wonder if all the meals are really just a fixed menu based on your selections when you sit down (meat, temperature of meat and fish), but honestly- when the food is this good, who cares! Just eat it, relax and enjoy the experience.    

I am now on a mission to find glacier lettuce and try to recreate the salad they served.  It was so good!
