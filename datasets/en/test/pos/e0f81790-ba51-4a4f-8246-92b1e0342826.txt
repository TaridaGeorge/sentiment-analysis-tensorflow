Shawna is terrific.  I attended a private session and then puppy school with my adopted terrier last summer and she was so helpful.  She held a small class in her yard and there were 6 people/dogs at one time.  Shawna was understanding of the fact that everyone has different expectations from training and she accepted our different goals.  She does a great job explaining why certain techniques are easier for dogs to learn and also why some things like crate-training and walking on a leash are important which I found really helpful.  I respect her, and would definitely recommend her to someone with a puppy, a new dog, or even a long-term problem with an older dog.  She knows what she's doing and will patiently explain it to you for the betterment of your pooch and your life.
