If you know Indian food then you can tell upon entering that this is the real deal.. These people know how to cook and are proud of it... I saw somebody using what looked to be the size of a boat oar in a pot almost big enough to get in and it smelled like heaven.... I sometimes just order the naan bread on my way home to accompany a salad.... it is like 3 bucks and the best in town...  you can close your eyes and pick anything off the menu and you will not be disappointed..
