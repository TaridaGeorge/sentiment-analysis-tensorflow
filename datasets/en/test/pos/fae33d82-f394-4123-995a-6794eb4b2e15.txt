I dig this place for sure.  The wild mushroom and goat cheese flatbread is (in the words of Fergie Ferg) tastay tastayyyy.  They have a decent selection of beers, my favorite is the Left Hand milk stout.  As far as food goes, they have a little of everything: Deviled eggs with truffle oil for a starter, caprese salad, house made soups, flatbreads, burger, chicken sandwich, grilled cheese, steak, etc.  I have heard complaints about the service, but I have never had a bad experience here.  Kim, the bartender is super sweet, and Casey and Dillon (servers) are rad and accommodating.  Thanks guys!
