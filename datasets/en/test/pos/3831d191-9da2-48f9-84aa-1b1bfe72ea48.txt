This place is amazing!! It almost looks like a Las Vegas hotel!! it has two waterfalls coming off a 20 feet ceiling...there is a large fishtank that has a lot of kewl fishes inside and everywhere you look it is like something from the natural history museum..taxidermal deers, foxes, bears, etc! They have quite a lot of products esp if you are interested in going fishing or camping.  But if you are not interested in buying anything in particular, at least go and take a look at this place....it is soooo much fun! There's even a restaurant inside.
