This is a great place to dine after work if you work downtown.  I met my husband here for dinner and we had a great meal!  It's a casual spot so you can just relax and unwind.  It's a bit hard to find though with all of the construction, so it might help to know that it's right at the corner with Central and Portland.

Our dinners were pretty good.  We started with the crab cake appetizer.  It comes with an awesome spicy sauce.  I had a burger and my husband had their big pork chop.  We split a chocolate cake for dessert.  Yum!  Check it out if you are downtown for lunch or dinner.
