Unbelievably delicious pizza - the marinated spinach on a couple of them - L'Italiana and Mama's - is fantastic. We tried the calzones - I think they were the best I've ever had. We tried the Baked Spaghetti and Mama's spinach calzones. I don't know why we would go anywhere else for pizza or calzones unless we're out of town! 
We have only gotten take-out so far but look forward to eating in next time we go out.
