I love this place! It's nice to have something different once in a while. The paletas are so tasty... a few of my favorite flavors are arroz con leche (creamy rice flavor), naranja (orange and cream), calabaza (pumpkin), and fresa con crema (strawberries and cream). Don't forget about the pups... they sell doggie paletas called "perroletas." My dogs have had both the chicken and peanut butter flavors and devoured them.
Another thing I like about this place is that they always have great service. Everyone who has helped me has been super friendly.
