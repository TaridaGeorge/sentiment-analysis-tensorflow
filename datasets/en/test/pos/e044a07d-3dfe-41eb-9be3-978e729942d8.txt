This place serves up the best cheese steak sandwich west of the Mississippi. I have lived on the East Coast and would probably admit that their cheese steak is better than anyone I can remember, even in Philly itself (maybe its the bread?).

My absolute favorite sandwich is the "Bellyfiller."  This sandwich is a cheese steak sandwich with everything on it.  A month ago, I ordered about twenty mixed sandwiches from Phlly's Famous.  In that order, five of the twenty were the Bellyfiller.  These sandwiches lasted about 30 seconds before being taken!  

The staff is great.  The orders are completed even if they have to make a side sandwich (e.g. veggie) for that special someone.

In addition, to top it off, the serve Wise potato chips.  Now that is worth noting.

The mean price is about $5.50 per 8 inch sandwich.

Come by here, it is worth the experience.
