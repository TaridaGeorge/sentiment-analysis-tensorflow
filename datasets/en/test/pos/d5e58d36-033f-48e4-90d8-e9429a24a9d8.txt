Desertique is a wonderful ladies boutique in North Scottsdale owned by Linda Hanna.  I've known her for years and find that she is not only a great merchandiser but can help clients determine what's really right for them.  She has terrific taste and it shows in the store!  It's a shop filled with something for everyone.  She makes everyone feel welcome without being overbearing--and knows everyone's name!  It's the best.
