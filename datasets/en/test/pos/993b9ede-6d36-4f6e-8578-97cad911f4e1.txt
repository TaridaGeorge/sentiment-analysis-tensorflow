I would move back to Phoenix just for this restaurant.  My roomate introduced me and although I've been there only once, that was all it took for me to fall in love with this unique Burger joint.   Its probably the best burger I'll ever have!  The fries (regular and sweet potato) come in cute little shopping carts!  Great beer selection and the menu isn't too extensive, but don't bother with anything else than the burger! Not too pricey, and the wait staff is friendly.  Unfortunately is so damn good, its always crowded and the seating area is just so friggin small!  You're kinda seated family style on this long table on bar chairs that don't move.  Wait can be looong sometimes, but trust me, its all worth it in the end when you take your first bite!!  Gosh, my mouth is watering!!!!
