I've been to now two locations and love it the same every time. We always order the Chicago and are always pleased. My family is from Chicago and have found our very own taste of home every time we go here.. service is great and quality needs no explaining.. I already miss the city, but know a memory is only around the corner.. try it yourself.. thank me later
