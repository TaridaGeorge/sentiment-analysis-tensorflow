My favourite restaurant in the valley so far. 

Within driving in you feel that you are transported to another country. Remotely reminds me of my house in Greece (with views of mountains instead of the water) and it makes me feel very comfortable and at home. 

Each time that we went the service has been absolutely perfect. We went for all meals of the day and each was different and absolutely perfect.  I love the sticky buns. Wish I can have them everyday.

If ever given the chance to eat here do so.
