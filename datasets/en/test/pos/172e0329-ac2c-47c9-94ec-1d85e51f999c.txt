Yelp's good reviews actually encouraged me to try this place and I was not disappointed!
It's small and tucked in behind Goldwater Blvd and has a great "locals only" vibe. Food was delicious - between 4 of us we had a meat & cheese sampler appetizer ($16 i think), large caesar salad (large salad is more than enough for a table of 4), 2 pizzas (price range is around $13-16) and 2 bottles of wine. That was enough to make us miserably full!
But of course we had to try that nutella calzone, so we ordered a small one, thinking we'll just have a small bite each. The thing is.. their small calzone is really gigantic! It's waaay too big even for 2 people, so have that in mind. Although it was incredibly delicious!
