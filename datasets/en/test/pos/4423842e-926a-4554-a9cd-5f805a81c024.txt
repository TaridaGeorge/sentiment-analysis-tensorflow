Love! Love! Love! This place! My boyfriend and I go here very often! It's again a great first date and for many dates to come! 

I'm gonna keep this short:

For drinks get a Melboc or Cucumber Cooler

For breakfast get the baked eggs or eggs Benedict 

Lunch/dinner the salmon,meatballs or chicken

It's great! Have fun!
