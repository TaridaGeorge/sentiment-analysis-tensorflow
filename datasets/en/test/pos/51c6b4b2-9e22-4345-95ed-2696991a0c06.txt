Sunflower market is WAY cheaper than Whole Foods and has a lot more than Sprouts. It's my first choice of healthy grocery stores!

They have the freshest produce around without it being full of bugs like Trader Joes. Their selection is very wide and their employees are really nice. Seriously I can't stand the employees at Whole Foods or Sprouts. They're such pretentious jerks sometimes. 

Whether I need lamb or bison meat, coconut milk ice cream, or almonds...this is always my first choice. They're also the only place in town that has every kind of vegan sliced cheese. Whole and Sprouts have some of them but which flavors are sporadic and random. I will never stray from Sunflower again!
