These guys did 2 paver jobs for me, we did most of our own landscape installation at our homes but I would rather hire someone to do the pavers and these guys did a fantastic job for a great price.  I was able to get ahold of Dave right away and his bid came a few days after he met with me.  He mostly works out of the east valley and completes his jobs in a timely manner.
