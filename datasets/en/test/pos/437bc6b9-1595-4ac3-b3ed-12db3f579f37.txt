Pierre, perhaps you should find a bar more...ahem...suitable to your taste.  Sometimes when you open a new bar, you're going to have glitches.  And being rude to the server will not earn you any respect in the service industry...my guess is that you have never been there.

This Zipps is fluid, well run, inviting, and the servers were ALL friendly to my friends and I during happy hour.  The drinks are delicious and the food is well prepared.  

For a sports bar...fantastic.  For dinner, fantastic.  For lunch when I only have 30 minutes and I ask the bartender if she wouldn't mind asking for a rush....amazing.

Thanks, Zipps...for continuing the tradition.  Let's leave the annoying ones at home, where they can properly shower without company in whatever temperature they choose.
