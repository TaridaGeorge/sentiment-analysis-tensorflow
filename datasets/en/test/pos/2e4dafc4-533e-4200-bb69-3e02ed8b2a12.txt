Food City doesn't meet my regular grocery shopping needs; however, whenever I need to buy a cake this is the first place I think of! The five stars are for the the Tres Leches cake alone! 

A yellow cake moist with the three milks (evaporated, condensed and whole) but not soggy and frosted with a barely sweet whipped topping. Ordinarily more of a butter cream gal, myself, this frosting is the PERFECT compliment to the cake! 

Inspired after my first try, I started experimenting with Tres Leches from other bakeries or panaderias and I have to say... Food City's was my favorite. 

So, quick! Somebody have a birthday so we can get a cake!!!
