Went here with colleagues, first note of business: it's BYOB, so you can bring your own beer and/or wine.  Now to the sushi...top notch, top notch.  I travel a lot, and sushi is always something I look for.  Was not expecting to find such a great establishment in Phoenix of all places, but, the rolls were unbelievably good, and the sashimi was fresh.  Our waitress was very informative, friendly, and made us feel at home!!  Will I be back....yes!!
