I love this place...happy hour is amazing I would go on Tuesday for Martinis having just two you will be leaving nice. The garlic hummus was tasty...but not for those who do not love garlic it is beyond garlicky. I usually go for happy hour I love the fries I have had almost every flavor. yum! This is a good place for brunch on the weekend they have great mimosas although the techno can get a little old if you are not into techno.
