This state park is fantastic. The views are great, the staff is great, the cost per night is great. I have not a single complaint. We stayed a few nights on site 19. We awoke every morning to more quail than you could ever possibly count. Our daughter was in heaven watching them run around. One of the nights we heard some coyotes coming through the sites which was pretty cool. This is very close to our home so we will be staying many more times to come. If you are close you should really come and check it out!
