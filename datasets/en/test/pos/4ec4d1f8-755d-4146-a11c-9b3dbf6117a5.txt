AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME experience there!  I am a vegetarian and the waitress and the kitchen staff went above and beyond to make me a veggie sandwich that wasn't even on the menu.  At times people get really annoyed when you ask for things not on the menu but I couldn't have anticipated such accommodation!  They were so kind and the sandwich was amazing!!!!  Thank You Claim Jumper!!!
