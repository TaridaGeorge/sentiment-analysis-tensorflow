Inta Juice is a great place!  I have been taking my kids here since they opened.  I have gotten to know the owners by name (Tom and Anita).  They know my daughter by name as she is the one that comes with me most frequently.  We all like the "Lime Your Mine" smoothie as well as the "Fruit Kiss".  I agree with Merle that I go out of my way to support the nonchain food establishments.  I get a shot of wheatgrass everytime I go there.  It has become an acquired taste for me.  This place is great!  If you want a smoothie go here!!!
