I have a soft spot for Brasseries. And burgers. So this place was an immediate win for me. I have to say, I think Chelsea's burger was a little better, but I bet a lot of people would disagree with me. Chelsea's is just a great burger - the way you expect a burger to be. The Metro has an amazing fancy burger. ;) Which as also absolutely delicious. It just depends on what you're in the mood for. I LOVE the atmosphere as well. The wait staff was very nice. The other customers were nice, and we wandered around Scottsdale aferwards. All in all, a great place. A friend mentioned that they have a fantastic brunch, so I'll be back for that.
