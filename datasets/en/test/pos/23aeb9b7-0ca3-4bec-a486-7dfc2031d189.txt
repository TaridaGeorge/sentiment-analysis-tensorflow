My favorite fro-yo place! So sad to be moving away from it. They have about 12 flavors to choose from.  A few stay always like plain tart and chocolate but the rest rotate around. I've seen Pistachio, Oreo, Butterfinger, Pineapple Tart, Coffee(my fav!), Red Velvet, Crumb Cake, Oatmeal Cookie, and tons of others.  There is usually an even mix of tart and sweet flavors and they always have a couple no sugar added or dairy free options.

Lots of toppings to choose from. Ghirardelli syrups, almonds, peanuts, walnuts, cereals, candy, cheescake bits, brownie bits, mochi, and others.  They also are pretty pet friendly with outdoor seating and a water bowl for them to drink from.  They even have doggy fro-yo but they were out when I tried to get it so I have yet to see if my dog is as in to Aloha as me.
