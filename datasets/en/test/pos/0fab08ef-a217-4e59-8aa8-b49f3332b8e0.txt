Alright Gluten Free eaters! Though this place was definitely a bit expensive, it had the most amazing gluten free pizza I have tried yet. I so enjoyed eating traditional Italian pizza, free of worry!  

As far as gluten free pizza, I give this place five stars. Although, if that were not a consideration, I might be leaning more towards four. Our server was attentive and pleasant. However, as previously mentioned, it was a bit pricy and lacked an ideal atmosphere (granted this could have been because there were few customers in the restaurant). 

I would definitely go back, although probably only for more special occasions, and would probably try a Friday or Saturday night for a better atmosphere.
