My boyfriend and I stumble across Khai Hoan about two years ago on a cold, blustery evening. Since it was so chilly, I was really in the mood for pho; that and the fact that I am Vietnamese and always on the hunt for new Viet eateries. We went in and I immediately got a good feel for the place. It was simple and the owner was friendly and seem to recognize me every time. They have the BEST bun bo hue in the Valley, don't let anyone tell you different. What's special about theirs is the fact they don't skimp on any ingredient, I got delicious chunks of pig's blood and hearty meat and big stalks of scallions. And it was ACTUALLY hot. . .whoo hoo!!! But hands down, the BEST authentic Vietnamese restaurant on my side of town.
