Everyone in my family was sad to see this place close down several years ago but we were all excited to see it open again on a recent trip.  Great fries, great garden burgers (most of us are vegetarian) and great milkshakes.  A recent trip to Chandler Mall included lunch at Ruby's followed by a trip later in the shopping spree to consume some milkshakes.  Not a bad way to spend the day (and 5,000 calories!).
