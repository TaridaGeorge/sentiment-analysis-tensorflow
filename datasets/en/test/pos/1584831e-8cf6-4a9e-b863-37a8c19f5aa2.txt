Ladies, all the ladies, go to this auto repair shop.

I went to this place for  an oil change and then mentioned something else that was going on with my 9 year old car.

My oil change was completed quick and efficiently and he completed a full inspection.  Guess what, they did not try to up sell me on anything that I did not need at this time.  I mentioned a couple of things that were told to me from another place and he even said my car doesn't need it right now unless I want to spend the money.

AMAZING!  I will forever be a customer of this place.
