Well, I can't review this as Lamars, but this place used to be a little sandwich shop with the cutest little train themes. According to my fiancee, it's the same cook, and he will make anything from the old menu. So maybe this is the review for the cook.. but it is absolutely delicious! Try all of them, but my fave is the pulled pork.. don't remember what it was called.. some sort of train name. Mention it, they'll know what yer sprayin'!
