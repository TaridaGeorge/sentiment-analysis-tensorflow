This is a great place to run if you live in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  The very canals that provide water to the metropolis are bordered by excellent hard packed multiuse dirt paths that are perfect for logging serious miles on foot or bike.  The various marathon training clubs run the canals.  Not terribly scenic but flat, safe from traffic and well traveled.  If you go to the SRP website you can calculate the distance of your run with their handy map.
