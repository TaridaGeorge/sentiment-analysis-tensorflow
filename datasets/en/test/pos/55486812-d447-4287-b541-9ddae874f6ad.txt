Great service and great sushi. Toro is by far the best in the valley. Happy hour is one of the best I have ever encountered in the Valley. Service in wonderful as well. All of the waitresses that I have had have been more than helpful and friendly. After traveling throughout Asia and living in Southern California, I know good sushi, and the sushi at Stingray Biltmore is WONDERFUL. 

Tip: Don't forget to top off your meal with a chocolate cake! and the Patio is INCREDIBLE
