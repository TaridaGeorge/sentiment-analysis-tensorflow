To be honest I was apprehensive to try sushi ken at first. It's unassuming location close to a dry cleaner in a strip mall doesn't overwhelm one with the assumption of great cuisine. But...I was wrong. Their food is great...and the prices are equally awesome. I had a huge pork ramen bowl about a month ago and it was awesome. The portion size was huge!  almost ridiculous actually...I probably got through half of it! Not to mention the fact that the entree came with California rolls and a small side salad...all for around 10 bucks! I will definitely be going again...I will just maybe not eat anything like...a day or so beforehand so as to have a fair shot at finishing my food!
