Stingray is great! Really, coming from me about a Scottsdale establishment of any kind is rather bizarre, I know, but I always have a great time, not entirely too much douchebaggery happening, and they keep their patio appropriately misted. The bar booths are way comfy, the bar stools are nice, and the appointments are great. The service has always been efficient, and the staff seems like they like working with eachother (rare, and awesome). The sushi chefs are skilled, the bartenders pour a sexy drink, and the price point isn't too high.

And, and, and... I like it.
