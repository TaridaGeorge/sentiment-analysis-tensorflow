OMG I warn you, as a fellow pepper-head, watch the hot wings. Only for the waiver signing crowd. And the medium are hotter than most hot and they have a "golden" style where thay add some honey and that is really good to try as well. Sandwiches are fine.The wings are great, burgers are great, very loud, always a drunken sports crowd during games or happy hour. I heard the Scottsdale cops pull everyone over as they leave so park down the street,
