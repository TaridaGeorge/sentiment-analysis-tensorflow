Carden's Cafe is the BEST hidden gem in Chandler! Not only is it a great environment, the food is amazing. Our family visits more often than I care to admit but, we've had the scones, the biscuits and gravy, the Belgian waffle, the breakfast burrito, the cinnamon rolls, well....and a bunch of the lunch sandwiches. Owner is always there and the walks around to make sure everyone is happy with their meal. 

Choose Carden's over Paradise or Wildflower! They are so much less expensive and 4 times better. We even stopped our weekly visits to Good Egg and substituted Carden's.
