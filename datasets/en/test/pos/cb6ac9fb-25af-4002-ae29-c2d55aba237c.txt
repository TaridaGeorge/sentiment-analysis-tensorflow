I drove here from Los Angeles and everyone whom I asked about a place to grab breakfast told me to go here. If you don't mind waiting, it's worth the wait on weekend. I actually went in on Monday morning to see what Sunday's 45 minutes of waiting was all about. 

Great breakfast, large portions, and friendly staff.
