What could I possibly not be pleased with Fez's service, food, environment and drinks? Not a D@ng Thing.

Opening the 9' frosted glass door always brings a smile to my face. I have to admit I do know the majority of patrons and staff inside but that is only because everyone is so happy to welcome new and frequent visitors. And on the weekends during Brunch you may get to visit with their very own music sensation Monika. Love You Girl!

The Kisras are so easy to order when with friends after Happy hour. The Hummus comes "however you want it"

For you Folk who enjoy the Sippy Cup... FEZ has amazing specials for every night. Two to mention of course are the Tequila Night & Mimosa Brunch! 

Come Enjoy YOURSELF!
