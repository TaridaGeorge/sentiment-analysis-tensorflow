This is the second time that I've been and the place is packed it may be a small restaurant but the quaint atmosphere makes for a good meal all around. The chicken Parmesan  is still to die for:)  if you are ever in the area stop in and try the best Italian food for under the cost of a movie. I have a big family(6) in all and I get out of here for about 50 bucks!!!!!! That's real cheep
