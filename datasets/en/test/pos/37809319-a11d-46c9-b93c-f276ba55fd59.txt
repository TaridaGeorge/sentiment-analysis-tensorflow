Bicycle-friendly and vegan, Green is one of my favorite places.  I ordered a Mickey sandwich with a side of faux Buffalo wings.  While that was being prepped, I ducked out to Nami next door and got a peanut butter and chocolate blizzard, non-diary treat.  It was obvious that I should eat the Nami first, because its the best.  That Nami was so delicious it made the whole meal a real treat.  Thanks to the cooks at Green and the folks at Nami I had a vegan feast fit for a peasant.   Cole slaw, french fries and tasty vegan meats layered between toasted bread of the Mickey sandwich, it was simply good.
