Update!! Talked to Rosati owner of the Power/Thomas location. He informed me he just bought 3 locations as of the week of Dec 12th. He bought the Greenfield, Crimson, & Val Vista locations. This is great news! Now we don't have to worry about poor customer service and still able to enjoy a Rosati pizza whenever we want to....not as before, when the previous owner decided he would work. All 4 locations are owned & operated by a husband & wife team. They even caterered our company Christmas party on Friday (12/16) with less than a 24 hr notice! Great job!
