What Can I say...I love their BEER and their FOOD! It is a perfect combo. My favorite beer is their Epicenter, but all the others are good to. I have tried a variety of different menu items and never ordered anythig I did not like. The staff has always been nice and friendly. They have a great patio. I highly recommend this joint to all. Don't forget Monday night is movie night and they have a facebook app letting you know about specials and what not.
