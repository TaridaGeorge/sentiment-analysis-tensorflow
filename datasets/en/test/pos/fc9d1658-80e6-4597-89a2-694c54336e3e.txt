Thoroughly impressed with this place. We were in for dinner on a Wednesday and the dining area was crowded and vibrant. The decor is better than average for an indian restaurant. 

The service was superb and he was honest with his opinions. He told us not to order a certain dish. 

The food was awesome and the complimentary chai tea warmed me on the cold night... I strongly recommend this place. 

Not too expensive considering the location.
