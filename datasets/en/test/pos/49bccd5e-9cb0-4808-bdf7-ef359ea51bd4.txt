This place is not just for kids although it is obviously just a tourist trap.  If you're looking for something off the beaten path, this is not it.  That being said, my expectations were certainly met.  It is an old wild west town with the most beautiful backdrop.  There is a little bit of history mixed in with the narrow gauge ride, coal mine tour, anti gravity house, reptile exhibit, shoppes, and wild west show.  If you are visiting the scottsdale area and you only have a half day of free time, this is a good place to visit.  Along the way there are also quite a few vendors selling all types of authentic goods from handmade to native american.
