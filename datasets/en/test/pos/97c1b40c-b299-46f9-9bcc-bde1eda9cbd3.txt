Great Treats!!! I've been to Italy many times and have eaten A LOT of gelato- this is exceptional. 
The atmosphere is really nice, super clean and the staff is very friendly. 
You should give them a try- you'll go back. I had the dark chocolate combined with the cherry. Too bad I have to leave tomorrow morning.
