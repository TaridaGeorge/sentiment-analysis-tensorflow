Cornish Pasty Company is one of my favorite restaurants in Tempe. For under 10 dollars you can get a good meal that will fill you up and it tastes delicious as well. I've been here around 5 times and I always try to get something different than my last visit. If it's your first time at this place I suggest you go with the original Oggie. So far I've tried the Oggie, the Italian, the Meat and Cheese, Bangers and Mash, the Reuben, I can't even remember them all.

But you won't be disappointed with this place, the food is consistently good every visit. The only drawback about this place is that it's pretty small.
