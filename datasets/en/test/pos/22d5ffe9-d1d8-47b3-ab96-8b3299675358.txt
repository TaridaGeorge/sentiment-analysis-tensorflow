Visited for the first time this week.  Smallish place but welcomign and comfortable.  Has dart area and several TVs, high and low tables as well as bar seating.  It's a little hard to find in the center but it's therere on the SWC of McDowell and Scottsdale Rd

Really enjoyed the beer selection - about 20 bears on tap and dozens in bottles.  They really have a great selection.  

We tried the hot pretzels, smoked jalapeno salsa, thai chicken and muffleta pizzas... All we very good.

The place was packed on a Thursday evening but we had great service.
