... it's one of the best spas I have ventured to in the world!  Beautiful, serene, peaceful and with intent.  This is like a tribute to the finest in spa land.  From arrival to departure every detail is well thoughtout all leading to the perfect experience.

The massage I had was unbeatable.  The sheets on the table were the silkiest and I look forward to purchasing some. The warming pads were so cozy. The hour and a half was spectacular.  I felt like a new girl...my body was renewed.   Best experience and massage I have had!   

Pool side was enjoyable and lunch was so tasty.  I can't wait to come back!   Spend your money here it is well worth every bit of it!!!
