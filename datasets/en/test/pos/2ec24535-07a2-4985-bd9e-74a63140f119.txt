It's like Disneyland for winos! Although I'm not much of a wine drinker, their selection is outstanding. But that goes for the beer and other liquors, too. The prices are great and are usually lower than most other places. They offer wine classes and wine tastings, but I've never partook in either. The staff is nice, friendly, and very helpful with suggestions and answers. My favorite indulgences I seem to only find here: Lindt Chocolate Bar with Almonds and Darrell Lea Soft Liquorice. :)
