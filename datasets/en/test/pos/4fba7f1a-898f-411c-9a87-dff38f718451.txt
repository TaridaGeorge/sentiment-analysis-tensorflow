Had breakfast here Sunday. It was such a great experience. Envy one was happy, and smiley. The food was great, and not pricey. They have very cute concepts such as the muffin baskets, and "kisses" they give you with your bill. Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for great food and a happy atmosphere.
