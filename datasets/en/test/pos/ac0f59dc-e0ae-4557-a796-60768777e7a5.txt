First trip to Grimaldi's was a winner.  They basically won the super bowl, if you will.

We have been FIGHTING this no-carb thing, and tonight we really caved.  I bought a 4-pack of beer, pledging to return to it once I satisfied my blood-type-thirst for pizza.  We ended up in Old Town and Cassie recommended Grimaldi's based on a whim.

Quickly seated and greeted, and although our table was at a busy corner, we had a great perspective of the entire place, most importantly the brick-oven.  Our caesar salad came quickly and was better than average.  Shortly after, our "small" Italian sausage and mushroom pizza arrived, and fully satiated our ravenous appetites.  Fresh mozzarella, flavorful sausage, and delicious sauce, all combined with perfectly crispy crust... Mmmmm.  Pizza.

Will (we'll) be back.
