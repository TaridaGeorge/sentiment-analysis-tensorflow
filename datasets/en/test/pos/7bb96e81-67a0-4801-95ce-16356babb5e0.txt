I want to spend all of my money eating at the tuck shop. Not sure if these are still on the menu, but their beets...what the what? I looooove beets now. Everything we tried during their last season was outstanding--mac n cheese, chili, shrimp po'boy. Healthy people will enjoy the portion sizes; girthier people will not. 
Can't wait to return for the summer menu.
