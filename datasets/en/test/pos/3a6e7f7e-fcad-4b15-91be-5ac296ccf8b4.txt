Found this place because it is close to Changing Hands Bookstore where Gary Vaynerchuk is speaking next monday Oct 26 2009 and I want to bring a group to yoga first. This is the closest place.

I dont do a lot of Bikram but do enjoy it every so often and the studio setup at BYT is really good. The heating system in the room is setup so that you get consistent temperature the whole class. The teachers are all top notch especially Reba and they do a really awesome deal for $25 if you are new where you get 2 weeks unlimited for free.
