I love going to Luci's to sit back and relax with some friends, or take my laptop to browse the internet all while sipping on a Green Tea Smoothie (with a banana mixed into the drink).  They have a good menu, and delicious pastries!  I'd have to say The Hum-Dinger Vegan Wrap and Say Cheese melt are so far my favorites.  I especially enjoy going to Luci's because the place has a good down-to-earth atmosphere, and their staff is friendly.  They also have on Sundays a a musician come in to sing and strum a few melodies on the guitar, which is nice to hear just before the hustle-&-bustle work week begins.  Overall, Luci's has a good vibe all around, the owners are very pleasant people, and it's a local business that I'm proud to support!
