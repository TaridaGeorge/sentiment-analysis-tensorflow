The lunch was absolutely amazing.  I thought it would take a while but I was in and out in under an hour!

Serivce was great...everyone was so friendly.

Most importantly the tempura lobster was absolutely delicious.  The butter ponzu sauce that came with it was the perfect compliment and I wish I had more.  

Will be going back ASAP.
