I came here after a good friend said that I can't leave Arizona without eating here first.   I dragged my boss here during a business trip, and we had the foie gras and souffl√© after reading the reviews on Yelp!.  We were so glad we came!  The food was fantastic!  We had such a great experience that my boss kept talking about the food the next day. It's small, but since the weather was nice we were able to sit outside and not worry about being too hot.   Please note- if the waiter suggests any wines with the dinner, I suggest you follow his advice.  He really knows his stuff.
