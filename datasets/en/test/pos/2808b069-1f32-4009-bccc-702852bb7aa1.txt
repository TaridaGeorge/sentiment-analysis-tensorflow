You can search high and low, near and far, and you will never find a dentist as amazing as Dr. Woodbury. His skills are world class and his team is fantastic. Katie, the hygienists, is first class. I have been a patient and a loyal fan of the office for years. I have recommended them to countless friends, family member and co-workers, all with equally impressive opinions of Dr. Woodbury and staff.
