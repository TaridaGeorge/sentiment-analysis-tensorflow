5 stars to you, Gentlemen. Like many bike shops, these guys love to talk all things bike. Nice group, lots of good natured banter making even a new transplant to the area feel welcome (especially after some douchebag fixie hipster a**hole stole my handlebars last week. yes, my /handlebars/ honestly, who does that? next teenager i see with an emo haircut, skinny jeans walking around my apartment with an allen key and wire cutters is getting a serious beat-down).

But I digress. They hooked me up, always looking for ways to save me a few bucks and I appreciate the personal service and attention to details.
