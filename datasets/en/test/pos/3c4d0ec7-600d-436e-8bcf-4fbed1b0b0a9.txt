Damn am I excited this place is finally in AZ!!!!  And I didn't even experience any sort of newly-opened growing pains on my first visit!

When living in DC I ate Potbelly (mushroom melt, extra hot peppers!) a few times a week.  Finally, the deliciousness has arrived in the Valley!

Great chocolate chip cookies as well - prepare to be the 'hit' at the office if you are so kind as to bring some to work.   I've never had their shakes but I know they have quite a following...  They also have convenient and VERY affordable catering that we used often in DC for meetings, but I haven't tried it here.

Affordable. Delicious.  Friendly, welcoming staff.  And the perfect vegetarian sandwich.
