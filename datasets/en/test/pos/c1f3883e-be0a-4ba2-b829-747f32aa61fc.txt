For the first time ever, I have decided to aware 5 stars. I guess its the euphoria of enjoying Pita Jungle, then again maybe its the opportunity to go to three different Pita Jungle's and still get the same great service. 
I have noticed this location to be wrought with the 20 somethingers and 30 somethingers. I enjoy the chance to kick back, be healthy and have a good time. 
Thanks, Pita Jungle!
