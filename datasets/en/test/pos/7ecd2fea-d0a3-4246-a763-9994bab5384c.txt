What else is there to say?  This place is amazing.  

Great wine.  Yummy food.  Excellent staff.  Beautiful neighborhood.  Funky/chic interior.  I love the garage door indoor/outdoor seating. 

I could waste my entire paycheck here.  Better yet; I can move in and just sleep on the comfy lounge furniture.
