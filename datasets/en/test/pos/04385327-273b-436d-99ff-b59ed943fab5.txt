I ran my first Phoenix 10K way back in 1984! I was thrilled to run in the 2011 race even though it was an obvious reminder that I'm not a teenager anymore! The upside, my times are not that for off (sub 40). 
I love having the race downtown and all the free goodies after the run make this an awesome event.
