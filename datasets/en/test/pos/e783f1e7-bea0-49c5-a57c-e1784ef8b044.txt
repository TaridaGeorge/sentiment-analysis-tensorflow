I have been coming to nousha for over 5 years now. She is great. She does everything for me from my colors to eyebrows and she does a great job every time. She is not just a beautician , she is a magician. She make me look great EVERY time.
For the last 2 years I have been bringing my picky teenager to her also,and my daughter loves her. She is great with kids.
To top it all  her prices are great. I promise if you try her you become a regular customer and will not go anywhere else.

Thank you nousha.
