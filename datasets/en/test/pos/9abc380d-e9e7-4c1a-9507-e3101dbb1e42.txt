This place is a fantastic collection of talented and unique individuals coming together in a homey space and making a small bright spot of art in the utter bleakness of the Phoenix cultural landscape.   Also, it's really close to the Phoenix Metro, the freeway, many fine drinking establishments, and there is a hotel nearby if you can't get the light rail home after going to too many drinking establishments.  It's like a piece of chocolate, wrapped in chocolate, inside a giant chocolate.
