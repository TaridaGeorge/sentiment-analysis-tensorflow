What in the World is such an upscale, nice, delightful, charming restaurant doing in a strip mall?

I probably should drop a star because of that location, but I didn't.

I had the vegetable soup & veal marsala.  Companion had pasta.  We cleaned our plates.  A galls of wine with the meal and dessert to top it off (I had ice cream & companion had creme brule).

And we got out the door for under a hundred bucks (including a 20% tip)!

Highly recommended!
