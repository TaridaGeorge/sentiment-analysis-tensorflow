Uhm, I'm not from Phoenix so when our friend suggested a hike, I was just expecting your normal hike with a little uphill action. We took the Echo Canyon Trail and it was the most intense uphill hike I have ever been on. We brought a water bottle without a sack - and that was a huge rookie mistake because you absolutely need both hands to climb up this mountain. The view from the top is breathtaking and you can see the entire city from there. I feel like I conquered the world coming up and then coming down this insane mountain.

Water is absolutely necessary and bring a camelback or backpack. It took us about 2.5 hours round trip.
