Great Mexican food, cheap specials, friendly employees, bottomless chip and salsa bar, great location right next to lightrail.  Lots of seating options.  This is my favorite Mexican place in Phoenix.  NOTE: Avoid during lunch rush, because of it's location, it gets swamped, and there is a huge line for the salsa bar.
