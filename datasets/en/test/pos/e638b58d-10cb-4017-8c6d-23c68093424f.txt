Always forget about this place cuz its so far from the food court.  Great food, atmosphere & fast service.  If you want to relax with your $10 salad away from the food court chaos, come here.  Also Ron Goldman's dad, with the mustache from the OJ trial, works in the men's suit dept, just leave him alone...unless you want to buy a nice suit of course.
