What a neat place in the center of town! This is unlike any of the other nearby nature centers in that it is surrounded by a beautiful, recently restored, riparian habitat. I attended an event here last month and thought it was an amazing facility for small to medium gatherings. And the surrounding trails are absolutely serene, despite the hustle and bustle of the city in every direction.
