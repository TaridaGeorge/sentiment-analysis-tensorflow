Fantastic food.  I also don't like sangria all that much we ordered the red for my friend's birthday and I really liked it.  We split and amazing salad with candied walnuts and goat cheese and pears and then the veggie pizza.  Highly recommend both!   Super fresh and just delicious.  The reviews led us out of towners to la Boca and it was a fabulous find.
