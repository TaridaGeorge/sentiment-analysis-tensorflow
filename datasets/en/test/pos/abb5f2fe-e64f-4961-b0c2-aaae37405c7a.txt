You know it is good if I'm beginning to write my review, and I haven't even finished my little cup of heaven yet!

I have been stalking Torched Goodness on Twitter ever since reading incredibly complimentary reviews on Yelp.  Finally! A chance to sneak out to the Farmer's market to snag myself a creme brulee.  I came hoping for the coconut flavor, but alas - it is seasonal (sure to return in a couple of weeks, I was told).  Instead, I set my sights on the special flavor of the day - Maple with caramelized bacon on top.  Ahhhh.  I LOVE bacon!

The creme brulee had the perfect texture - smooth and silky with the most delicious burnt sugar crust.  And the bacon... oooohhhh man! Definitely get that on top!  Or on its own.  Either way - get it.
