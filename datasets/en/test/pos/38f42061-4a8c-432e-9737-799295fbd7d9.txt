Absolutely delicious. But it almost feels like they put this in the wrong city because as a Phoenician, you get used to dried up parched up lakes and river beds. But coming to Twirl, you get a sense this shop would be right off of a beach boardwalk with their wood accents and surf magazines accenting the place (and a giant chalkboard). 

I wish they had a wall were I could write my love for them for other people to admire my stick figures. Hey, I guess I have a full belly now and if this little complex gets any cooler my wallet will be in trouble.

But back to what matters--I had peanut butter yogurt with reeses cups. And sat on a couch and enjoyed the air conditioning. So freaking good.
