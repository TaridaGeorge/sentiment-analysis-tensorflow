Co+Hoots has been my first experience coworking in Phoenix and I've really enjoyed it. The people there are great. Everyone goes out of their way to make you feel welcome and invited and part of the community. Jenny is always super helpful and friendly. They have a great conference room for large meetings and a smaller one for those instances where you just need some privacy to talk with a client. The price is very reasonable for drop-ins as well as those wanting a more permanent desk. With the wide range of professionals involved with the space, there's lots of opportunities for networking.
