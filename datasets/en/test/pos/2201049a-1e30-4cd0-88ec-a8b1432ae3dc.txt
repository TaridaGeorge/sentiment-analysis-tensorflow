This is seriously hands down the best pizza i have tasted in this country. Im not even from phoenix, but shortly stayed there years ago and i still remember this pizza like it was yesterday. I also saw a really odd bird with a crazy beak. he was a funny lil thing. 

ok so the pizza, i think the cheese made it spectacular. It also had corn and goat cheese, yeah im pretty much in love with it. It aint your moms pizza. It was just sooo good, melted in your mouth, new flavors, new ideas, great lil spot with outdoor seating, boos and good food. It def made a huge impression and i will prob always think of it as the best place i ever had pizza in the USA. two enthusiastic thumbs up.
