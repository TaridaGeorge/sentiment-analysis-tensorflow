If I were a tasting judge for the best pizza in town, this one would be one of my top picks. I've eaten pizza in New York, and Chicago. This pie, bar none, is up there with some of the best I've ever had. 
This sauce! OMG, tastes like home. I've found my go to pizza place! Please go and judge for yourself!
