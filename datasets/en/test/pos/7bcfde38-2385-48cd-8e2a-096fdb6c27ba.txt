How did I not know this place was here?!

I mean, I did. Ive passed it a hundred times but never thought to go there when I needed to send something.

Its now my 1st choice. It may not be the closest one to me, but it is THE best. The lines were minimal (even w/ it being the holiday season), and every clerk was pleasent and helpful. Awesome!

And you cant beat their hours. Open til 9:30PM on weekdays and til 5 on Sat. You cant beat it!
