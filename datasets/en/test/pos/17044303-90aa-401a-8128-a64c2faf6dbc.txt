I LOVE Dutch Bros! They have great coffee, great prices and their employees are always friendly! 
They have a great selection of drinks (ask for their secret menu) that are super yummy! I highly recommend trying one of the custom drinks...the B-52 (sometimes known as the Orange Kicker?) is my favorite!!
