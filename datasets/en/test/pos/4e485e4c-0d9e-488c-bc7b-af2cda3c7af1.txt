This is Teakwood's newest location here in the valley and they are really great! The service is wonderful, the wait staff friendly and the food is really good for pub fare. It is definitely not a health food restaurant, but if you want great pub food and a good beer while watching a sporting event of your choice, then this is definitely the place to go!
