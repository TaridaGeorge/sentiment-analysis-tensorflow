In my many visits to Phoenix, one place I always like to go is Biltmore Fashion Park. It's because it has a great, almost resort like, feel to it, with the trees, the grass, the outdoor patios (keep in mind I'm visiting from Cleveland and always stay with family). There is a great selection of stores and restaurants and it is conveniently located in the Camelback Corridor. The Borders store here is one of my all time favorite Borders locations. The Brookstone store is one of the largest I've been to. The Apple store is nice, although not much larger than the Cleveland area location. Overall, Biltmore Fashion Park is a great place to kill a couple of hours. I like it better than the newer lifestyle centers in the Valley, although those are all great too (see Kierland Commons review).
