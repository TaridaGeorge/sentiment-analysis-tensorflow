Awesome! 

Here are some of the dishes we order every time we are in town. Steam dumplings, greens, fried tofu, salt and pepper fried shrimp, beef with fried noodles in XO spicy sauce, and beef noodles with lemon topped with garlic. All are very tasty.

Oh and the boiled peanuts and pickled radish appetizer are really good.
