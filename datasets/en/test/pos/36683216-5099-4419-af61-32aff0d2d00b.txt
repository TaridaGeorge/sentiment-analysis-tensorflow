WOW!  What wonderful food and atmosphere.  I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!  My friend and I like to go in early, order 3 small pizzas and take the next two hours enjoying the options we are eating.  The combinations are so unusual and complimenting of each other.  I suggest this restaurant anytime friends are looking for places to eat in the Central Phoenix area.  Great job, Arik, you have done an amazing job!

The restaurant has also kept some items from the original establishment.  There is a dryer chair and even a piece of the original wallpaper.
