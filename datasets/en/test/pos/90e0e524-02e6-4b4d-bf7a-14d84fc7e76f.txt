Nice work, American Cleaners. 

Came here accidentally when I neglected to drive the block north to Regal Cleaners and when Uptown on Central was closed. Glad I did! Quick turn around, better finished product than Regal, friendly staff, and easy in and out. Also, nice printed receipt you cam read. all for the same price as Regal and less than Uptown.

They took time to talk to me, make eye contact, ask about my day, go over my clothes with a real inspection and ask questions before taking them, and generally doing the little things. I like to think they do this because they care. So do I, American. So.Do. I. 

For dry cleaning in Central Phoenix, I will be back and will also refer my friends here.
