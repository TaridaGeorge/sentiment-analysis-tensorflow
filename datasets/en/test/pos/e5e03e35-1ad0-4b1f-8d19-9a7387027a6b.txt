Everything here is great. I've had the salads (fav is parm crusted chicken). Had the sandwiches and pasta also which are awesome. Soup is good. Haven't had the pizza cause I usually eat that at Pomo, Sauce or Grimaldi's.
Anyway, if you are in the mall this is some of the best food there cause food court is awful.
