Went last night for a benefit for Logan's Playground.
What a great place!Staff was friendly,the patrons were an interesting mix of leather,rubber,and joe q public.
The place was on the small but not cramped scale and the x mas trappings were not overdone.
The event I was there for was a lot of fun and the group putting it on (The Phoenix boys Of Leather)were amazing.
The parking lot itself was small and cramped,but there was plenty of street and alternative lot parking available.
I will certainly return to this comfy spot.
Thank you Velocity for involving yourself in paying it foward!
