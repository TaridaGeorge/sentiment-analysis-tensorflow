I LOVE SHADY'S!!!  That's three exclamation points and five stars.  I love the jukebox.  I love team Justin.  I love Julie and Katie.  I love Erin and her love for Asta.  I love the regulars and the not-so regulars.. (except for that one guy.) I love "the drink to forget".  I love watching Evil Dead, Evil Dead II, and The Army Of Darkness then I Am Legend all in one day with a yummy cocktail in my hand.  I love how JMV can be grouchy one minute and hysterical the next.  I love the color of Detroit's eyes. Aaah Shady's... I love how it makes you feel like you are a part of a community.  I haven't felt that in a long long time.  Thank you Shady's.
