Amazing! Amazing amazing amazing! I came for my birthday with twelve people, we feasted like royalty on 15 different dishes, brought our own booze, had an amazing time all for under $200 bucks. The service was exceptional and the lok lak and fish amok was better than any I ever had in Cambodia. Go eat at this restaurant! Now!
