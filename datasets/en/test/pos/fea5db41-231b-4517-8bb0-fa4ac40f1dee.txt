Having lived in Portland for years, I consider myself to be a bit of a coffee snob. I have a very distinct opinion of what a coffee house should be! This is it! 

Quality Coffee 
Free WiFi
Drinks offered in real dishes not just to go cups
Comfy seating as well and great work spaces
Yummy baked goods
***extra points for fresh organic fruit being offered***

While I'm not a regular here this is clearly the spot of the neighborhood locals. The staff is super friendly and remembers all of the repeats by name. When I'm back in Phoenix I always try to stop by Lux!
