Incredible value. This is one museum not to miss. We ended up staying most of the day. We arrived before 11:00 a.m., stopped for a short lunch (their cafeteria served yummy, fresh food that was very well priced), and we didn't finish until it was closing time. We suggest that you arrive when they open so you will be sure to have enough time to enjoy all of the exhibits. You will amazed at what you will see, how beautiful all of the exhibits are, and how extensively they cover the world. Be sure to visit the interactive room where you will enjoy the opportunity to use many instruments!
