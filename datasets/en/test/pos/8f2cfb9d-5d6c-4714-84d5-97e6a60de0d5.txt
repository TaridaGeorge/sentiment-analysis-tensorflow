So I was living in Phoenix for about a year and lived 4 blocks from this spot. Hands down my favorite bar (and I live in Texas currently)

Always great atmosphere killer selection of beers and rotating ones too. Same owners who own Matts Big Breakfast so everyone is like family almost. I recommend the House Beer. I would have 3 and be faded.... luckily I walked. But don't get drunk like me... just a great place to chill, eat some simple snacks and watch some old school westerns on their TV..

kick ass place, I miss :(
