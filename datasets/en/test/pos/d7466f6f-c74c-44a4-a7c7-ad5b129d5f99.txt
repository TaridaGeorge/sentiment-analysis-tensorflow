So I was brought here for the reverse happy hour. We went downstairs and when you first walk in, the atmosphere just hits you! The lighting is ideal for this place. The fireplace is a nice intimate touch. Their variety in liquor choices is vast and some of the best! I decided to choose wine this time around. The house cab was surprisingly good. Most house anything is cheap and flavorless but not here. My love and I ordered the small plates to share as they were $5 each. You cannot beat that. The bacon wrapped shrimp, the brie toast, and the calamari were outstanding! The sauces which accompanied the shrimp were fantastic (the spicy one is the best!). I will be back for sure especially since it is my boyfriend's favorite place!
