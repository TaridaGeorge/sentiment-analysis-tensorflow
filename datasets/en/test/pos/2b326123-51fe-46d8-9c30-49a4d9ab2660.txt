"MMMM. THIS IS. A TASTY BURGER." - Jules. Pulp Fiction.

I like this place, my siblings like this place, and it's the best thing I've got to remembering better times back home in California. 

It's a quick fix for people who want good burgers at a decent price. It always hits the spot when I'm feeling like a fatty. :)

Even considered biking all the way here from my house when my car was dead and going through the drive through. (Coz the cool kids did it back then... In CA anyway haha. And employees didn't care.)
I agree that drive thru is an atrociously long wait during the afternoon (after school). 
Peeps who work here seem pretty chill since I always ALWAYS, ask them for the hats and throw dozens and dozens of ketchup packets in with my to-go orders. Biiiiiiiiiiig plus!
