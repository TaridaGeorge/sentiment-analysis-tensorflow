Two center cut filets, arctic char (split) and cold perrier with lime.  The steaks were cooked perfectly.  The char has been better, but it was still exceptional and the spicy corn and baked potato (with everything but the bacon) was awesome!  Service was prompt and considerate - always love it here!
