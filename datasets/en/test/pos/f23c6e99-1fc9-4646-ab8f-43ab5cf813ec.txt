Love the atmosphere, the patios, drinks and especially the chicken lollipops.  If you haven't tried them, they are buffalo wings with a handy bone to hold on to while you eat.  The sauce with blue cheese dressy is one for the record books!

I am also a fan that they serve breakfast 7 days a week and have free wifi.  This is a great place to meet for work or meet after a game.  Not too stuffy, but nice enough that it isn't just labeled a bar.
