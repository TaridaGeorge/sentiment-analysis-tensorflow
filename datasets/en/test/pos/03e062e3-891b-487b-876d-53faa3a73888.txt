I always forget to review this place.  This is one of our fave spots on First Fridays.  I don't remember the Tea place next door, but after we wandered with our hot vegan teas, we found this place.  I love the mix media installation, psychological and contemporary art showcased.  Different artists' works rotate ever so often.  Most of the art is so uncontrived.  It doesn't follow the mass appeal like most of the galleries in the surrounding area.  That intrigues me.  I'm no art critic, but I can foresee some Eye Lounge artists with unique talents will do quite well.
