Holy Crap they've done a lot with this place! Having grown up in this neighborhood, I remember this building being Katz deli. Man it is so different from the yellow brick deli in my memory.

Of course we ordered the bruschetta: 
fig, mascarpone, and prosciutto- so good! I love sweetish/savory combos and the rich, creamy mascarpone was the perfect compliment.
Warm artichoke- good
salami and pesto- really good, simple. I really like their pesto
tomato, basil, mozzarella- really nice, classic. The sea salt very complimentary, gives a pop of flavor

I ordered the autostata panini on focaccia. Oh how I love Italian deli meats. So good. Huge portion. I took half home and it was still so good for lunch the next day. I tied my friend's nine iron and it was also really good. 

All in all very good!
