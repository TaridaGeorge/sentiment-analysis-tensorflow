This is a great place for Cajun food. It is located in the Town & Country shopping center in the camelback corridor area of Phoenix. Everyday the menu has a special that is fresh and exciting. I have tried several of their dishes, but have to admit I always enjoy the Beer Battered Shrimp with Crawfish sauce and dirty rice.

Oh, I almost forgot the GUMBO is the bomb, meaning, true Gumbo, not just imitating soup like others produce and call it gumbo. I think it is the best in AZ.
