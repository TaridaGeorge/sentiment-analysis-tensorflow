Boy do I love Pho! But not just Pho, goooood Pho! Khai Hoan is the best Pho in the valley, hands down. It is better than all of the Pho I have found in LA as well. There broth is extremely flavorful. The meat is great quality, and the rare beef is always brought out freshly placed in the bowl so that it doesn't get over-cooked.  The rice dishes are also very good. 

Sonny, the owner, is an amazing guy, and the restaurant is a truly family owned and operated business.

Also, I recommend checking out their 'sister' restaurant, Cyclo in Chandler. It is a very kitchy space with modern furnishings and bright, bold colors.
