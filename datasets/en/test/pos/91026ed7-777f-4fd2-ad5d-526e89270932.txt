I love this place.  The first time I went, I had my mom and my sister with me.  We all got pedicures and by far the best foot massages I've had at any of these nail places.  The thing that really impresses me the most is that after only one visit... the next time I came in- they greeted me by my name. How often does that happen?  Hello, customer service- welcome back.  It's husband and wife owned and operated and they are as nice as can be. Love it here.  Great atmosphere, friendly, good service, affordable.  You won't be disappointed.
