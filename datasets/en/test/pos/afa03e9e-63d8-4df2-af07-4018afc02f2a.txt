If you love a classic American breakfast, Matts is the best in Phx hands down. I've only been once, mostly because its downtown and the long lines. All their ingredients are local, organic, and farm raised. Their bacon is something I always tell people to try. Its insanely thick and peppered to perfection! I would go there just for a side of bacon! Their toast is thick and baked fresh. Even their OJ is fresh squeezed. I wish I lived downtown because I would go here every weekend!
