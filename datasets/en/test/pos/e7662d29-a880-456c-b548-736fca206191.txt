Pretty much all nail salons in Arizona are pretty similar. Feet soak, scrubbed then painted. Not alot of attention to callouses and rough skin  included with the base price which is kind of BS... but like I said, that seems to be the standard in AZ.

What set this place apart for me is that she asked me WHY I was getting the pedi. I disclosed that I was departing shortly for a family trip to Hawaii and she suggested a FABULOUS festive nail idea.

I have attached a photo of this master piece for your viewing enjoyment :)
