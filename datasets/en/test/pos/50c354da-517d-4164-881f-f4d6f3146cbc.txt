I am a huge fan of The Good Egg! They have the best flavored coffee. They have a different flavor every day, so check out the white board by the door as you're walking in to see what it is! I love their country style potatoes & omelets as well. The food comes out in a timely fashion & the servers are always polite & provide great service. My best friend highly recommends the Santa Fe straw sandwich if you're looking for more of a lunch entree.
