Great customer service, great selection for my beer brewing needs, and reasonable prices. I am so happy to have this place within a few miles of my house. Everyone I've dealt with has been incredibly helpful, knowledgeable, and not snobbish or pretentious. The place is also clean and well organized. My brewing activity has increased since finding this place because it's such a pleasure to go get supplies.

You might be able to get slightly better prices by shopping online, but then you're dealing with shipping and waiting and worrying about heat in transit... And there's less opportunity to learn something new or ask questions about the product you're buying. Besides, supporting the local economy trumps a few percentage points in overall savings.
