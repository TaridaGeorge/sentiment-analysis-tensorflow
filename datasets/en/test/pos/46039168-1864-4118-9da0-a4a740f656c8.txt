What a serendipity!! This place has all the other sushi places in the West Valley beat by far! Even my beloved Blu, since the prices during Happy Hour were incredible, the rolls were phenominal, and the service was fantastic! Mark and I ordered the squid salad (fresh and not too salty), the Philly roll (standard, but good), and the Volcano roll--(delicious, flashing light and all!)
We toasted with a sake bomb, since there aren't any cocktail options besides beer and sake. When the meal ended, our waitress brought us sweet, complimentary orange slices. This place rocks!

My only suggestions for the owners would be: turn up the music a tad, so I don't have to listen to the obnxious gossipers at the table near by, and throw a few mirrors up on your almost-empty walls...they'll make the place feel bigger. XO
