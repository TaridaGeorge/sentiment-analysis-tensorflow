5 Stars for this Famous Dave's franchise.

Worth the trip for the smokey tasting Brisket and St Louis Ribs 

Both the Chandler & San Village locations brisket tastes likes it steamed ... not smoked!

The St Louis Ribs are always so smokey tasting and tender, even beats Haps ribs on an off day ... and I love Haps BBQ ribs. 

Famous Dave's is one of the better franchise's in the USA, very consistent and always a great experience. I always eat in the bar because thats how I roll, I  have never been disappointed at any location. However this particular Dave's deserves and extra star for doing a better job smoking the meats. While I live closer to San Tan, I usually drive the extra distance to get my fix here

Only downside to Dave's is the corporate selection of beer, local microbrew's would have be visiting more often.
