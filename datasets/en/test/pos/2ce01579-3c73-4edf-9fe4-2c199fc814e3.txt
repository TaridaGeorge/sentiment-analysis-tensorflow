I absolutely love this cute, quaint cafe! The menu is great, it's always changing and you can tell they put a lot of thought in to it each time. The service is great, and the Mac & Cheese is the best I've ever had. They occasionally have live music, which just makes the environment that much better. If your in the area, you won't regret stopping in and checking it out.
