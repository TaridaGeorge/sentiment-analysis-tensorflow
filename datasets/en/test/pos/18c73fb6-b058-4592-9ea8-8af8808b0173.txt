This place is the best Paradise I've been to.

There was no wait (so unusual) and the staff was incredibly kind and let my partner try every soup on hand. The fruit salad was fresh, the cookies were amazing and the bread was soft - but I don't expect less from Paradise.

The only thing that's hard to handle are the hours... I'm craving Paradise for dinner and can't have it!
