I have a Canon S90 that I bought over internet.   My daughter broke it, banged it and lens got stuck in out position and was visibly crooked.

I went to Tempe Camera and they took it back, after 15 minutes brought back out fixed.  I told them I did not buy it from them, but they refused any kind of payment.
