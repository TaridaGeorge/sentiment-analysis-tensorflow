The Thai place in the area.  I really enjoy the general feel of the place, the staff is very friendly and the remodeled facade makes it appear much classier. The color and lighting are a nice balance of light and dark, giving the restaurant a comfortable, private aura without appearing cramped or dim. While the dress code is casual, I'd feel perfectly comfortable coming here on somewhat dressy occasions.
I've eaten here many times and have never disliked the food. Portions are generous while prices are low. Unlike many other places I've been to, medium here actually is moderately spicy instead of "just short of our absolute spiciest". The meat is always delicious whatever form you're eating it in, and the curries are spectacular.
Don't forget to get some Thai iced tea with your food!
