best char flame grilled burger in town.  I love burgers but I absolutely love Lucky Boys.  burger and fries (no drink) less than $4!  that is a steal, this place looks old school, takes you back into time as to what a small burger joint looks like.  I like this place better than Lenny's and better than hamburger works, and better than burger shop and burger factory.
