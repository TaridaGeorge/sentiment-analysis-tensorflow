Such a wonderful experience for my 3.5 year old son and Mom!!! We tried two other dentist prior to this office and had not so great experiences. I honestly thought my son had developed a fear of the dentist. We walked into to this  office and grandma Barb greets you and the little play area is small and fun. Honestly the experience was amazing they cater to little kids and know exactly how to work with them. I will be bringing both of my boys here for now on!!
