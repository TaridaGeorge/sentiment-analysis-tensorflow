Even writing this review is making me hungry. I used to live right across the street from Harlows. Everything time I go there it is packed with people having a great time. They have beautiful waitresses with lightning fast serving skills. The food is a little pricey and some times you have to wait find a seat, but not matter how busy they are always expect a smile and great service.
