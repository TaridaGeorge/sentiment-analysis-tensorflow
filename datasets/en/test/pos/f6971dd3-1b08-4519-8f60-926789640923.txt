For the past 15 years or so, I have been a satisfied and happy customer of KKL.  I absolutely love everything about Knock Kneed.  The fish is among the best that you will find in the Phoenix area.  I am also a big fan of the okra.  

The ambiance here is also quite enjoyable.  There is plenty of seating inside the restaurant and the nautical themed decorations make it one of a kind.

You can't go wrong here!
