5 stars for a great setting decorated perfectly along with a stellar lunch treat. Decor goes with the atmosphere and food, which feels like you're eating at a friend's house. Kitchen is open to the dining room. We stopped in 15 minutes before lunch closed up, and Chris was nice enough to take our order. Felt like having your own personal chef. Really a cool eating experience all around. He was also really sweet to our 1 year old, and gave her a few things to distract her while we ate.
