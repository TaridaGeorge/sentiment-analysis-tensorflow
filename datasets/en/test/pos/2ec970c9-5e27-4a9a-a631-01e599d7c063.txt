If you are looking for something unique and a bit edgy, this is the place for you!  Cornish Pasties are yummy baked pockets of goodness, they are so flavorful here!  I recently asked Cornish Pasty Company to cater an office event, and they were a hit!  I had the oggie, which is the traditional pasty.  Check out their website to see their menu options and read a little bit of pasty history: http://www.cornishpastyco.com/index.html, but its much better to go in, grab a pint, a pasty, and have a great time!
