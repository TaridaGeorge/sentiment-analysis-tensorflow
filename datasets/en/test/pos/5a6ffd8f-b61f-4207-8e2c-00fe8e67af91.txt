SO MANY SHAKE FLAVORS, OH MY GOD. It's like I died and went to liquidy ice cream heaven. 

The burgers are very good for their price. The quality definitely beats some other retro diner-type places in town, ahem ahem. You can load on all sorts of great toppings, including banana peppers and onion rings. I imagine -someone- out there likes that particular combo, right? 

Service can be a little slow, but it's in a mall, so I'm not really expecting stellar wait staff. No offense to the Cheeburger folks. I can understand the insanity since this place is usually packed with families, toddlers, and mall rats.
