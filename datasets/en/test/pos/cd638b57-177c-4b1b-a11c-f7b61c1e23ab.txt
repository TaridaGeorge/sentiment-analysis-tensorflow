What a great way to start your day! I haven't had the best experiences in the store ordering but Drive Thur makes up for it. . I love that they have a camera and can even predict my order by the sight of my car. . Though no one has asked for my real name, i guess I'm not a "bob" yet. . :) Just a card toting Gold Card member, you know, nothing special :-) lol
