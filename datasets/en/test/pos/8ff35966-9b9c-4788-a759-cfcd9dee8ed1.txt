This one's consistently one of my favorite places to eat in the valley, because it combines good food with pretty fresh ingredients (I'm a fan of the burgers) with a fun place to eat.  On a spring and summer night, it's a blast to sit outside on the picnic tables.  The food's often like really really good family barbecue food- with produce you just pulled from your garden and a really good soda.

Definitely suggest nighttime visits.  The place is kitsch without having "flair," it's unique around town and it's tasty stuff.

Just be ready to wait if you pick a typically busy evening.
