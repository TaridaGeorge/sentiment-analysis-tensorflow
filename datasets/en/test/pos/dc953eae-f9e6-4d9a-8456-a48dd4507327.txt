Went here on a Friday night and it was packed. We had an excellent dairy-free, gluten-free pineapple pizza - chock full of flavor. My friend also ordered a margarita and while it didn't have the customary salt on the rim of the glass, it did have quite the alcoholic kick to it.

It's a drive, but we will definitely be back. They have a limited delivery area, one I'm hoping will expand. Perhaps a satellite kitchen in Tempe?
