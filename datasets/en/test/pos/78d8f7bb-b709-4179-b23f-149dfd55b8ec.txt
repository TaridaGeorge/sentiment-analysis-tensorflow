This is my favorite venue--we've held two events here, and I've attended another four.
As an attendee, it's clean, bright, FREE parking, good food, constantly refreshed coffee and beverages, and good layout.  I love it.  As a planner, it's a good deal for what you get, and it's a well managed event end to end.  Conference staff are easy to work with, flexible, and they are there to support you.  IT works and it works well. it's a great facility, food, service, and staff.  Good open expo area too, if you have vendors, advice--do not use a separate room if you have a lot of vendors--put them in the main ballroom, and/or the vestibule, not in any other room.  Vendors like to be showcased and have traffic, not shuttled off to a low traffic low visibility area --regardless of any price savings.
