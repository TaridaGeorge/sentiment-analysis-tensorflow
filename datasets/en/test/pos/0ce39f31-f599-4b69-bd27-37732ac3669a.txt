service, atmosphere, and food are all perfect.

this is one of my very favorite restaurants in Scottsdale.

as a resident of LA, i don't often get a chance to dine at Zinc, but every time i'm visiting family in AZ, i make it a point to make my routine visit to Zinc.

make sure to try their duck confit sandwich, truffle parmesan fries, and chocolate souffle -- you won't be disappointed!
