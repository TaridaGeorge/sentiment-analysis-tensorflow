Some serious love went into this place and you can feel it.  Huge outdoor patio to swill some good brews (along with a nice, simple, sleek inside space).   Go...drink...be happy and support the local folks who played the part of Santa Claus and stuck this awesome gift under our collective Phx Xmas tree.  The evolution of downtown Phx continues.  BOOM.
