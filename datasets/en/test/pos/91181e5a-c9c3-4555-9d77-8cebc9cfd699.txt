I heard about this place from yelp and have been coming here since. Super nice people that take good care of your clothes. Prices are reasonable and the turn around time on dry cleaning is super quick (1-2 days depending on what time you drop it off).

They were involved with two episodes of Home Makeover which is pretty awesome.

Closed on Sundays -- also understandable I guess ;)
