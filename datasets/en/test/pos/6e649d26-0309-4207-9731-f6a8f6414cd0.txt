Love the ambiance of this bar, it truly feels like you've left phoenix and arrived in NYC... however, be prepared to pay NYC prices here. Very cool inventive cocktails, comfortable lounge setting, elcectic menu, and music to match the mood! Hands down my favorite bar in Phoenix! If you feel like getting dressed up and not having to deal with your typical Scottsdale crowd, check this place out!! And try a dirty martini!!
