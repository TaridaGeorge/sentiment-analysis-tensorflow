Oh my gosh, the fireflies!  I *am* an art historian, but rarely have moments with art that were as awe-inspiring as my time with/in the Yayoi Kusama piece.  I think my husband was pretty convinced that I would want to buy the "firefly" shirt in the gift shop, but I passed on that in favor of a signed Klett & Wolfe book.  Which is a perfect way to transition into saying that the current photography show, "Charting the Canyon" is wonderful -- it's whimsical and interesting and definitely worth the visit.  Also, I'm really glad that gallery exists, because without it there simply wouldn't be enough photography exhibited in the space.  All in all, a wonderful museum, and worth the time...and a gift shop that sells autographed books is always a plus -- not enough museums do this when showing living artists!
