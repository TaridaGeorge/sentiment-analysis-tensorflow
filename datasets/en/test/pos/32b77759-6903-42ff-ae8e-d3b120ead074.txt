I spoke with the owner again - he's recently become aware of the reviews here. He even mentioned the one 3 star he got. They recently expanded into the store next door, so it's less crowded than it was before. They also added shelf space room for more wine. Great selection... 

I still love this place. I still have yet to buy pizza fixings to make a fresh pie at home, but I will.
