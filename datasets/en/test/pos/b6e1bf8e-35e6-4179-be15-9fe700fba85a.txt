I'm pretty picky about my Thai and I love Thai food, and I have to say the Tom Yum soup here is FANTASTIC and totally passed the test. Also, I really enjoyed the red curry. The ginger beef dish was decent, and I really liked the pineapple fried rice. Yes, I came here a couple times this week - especially since I was "home" (at the hotel) sick one day this week. As a San Friscan (where Thai food is aplenty), I'll vouch for Thai House. ;-)
