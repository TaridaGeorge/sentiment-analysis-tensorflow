Traveling through Arizona on a hot summer night, I needed to cool down with some froyo.  And I was staying near this place and decided to try it out.  What great service, and a great selection of both dairy and soy based gelatos.  I swear they let me try one of every flavor and I ended up getting a variety.  Some of them were a bit too sweet, but I loved the Mango with the blueberries on top.   The people working there were very very friendly.   I hope this business does well.  And remember to check in on Yelp when you get there for an extra percentage off.  At least that was going on when I was there.
