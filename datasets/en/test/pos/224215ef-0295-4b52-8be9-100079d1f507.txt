Just had a fabulous lunch on the patio complete with stories about New York City from the restaurant's owner. Started off with a brushetta sampler followed by muffalatta and meat loaf sandwiches. And the owner concocted an amazing dessert just for us. Felt like we were eating at an Italian bistro in NYC. Great place!
