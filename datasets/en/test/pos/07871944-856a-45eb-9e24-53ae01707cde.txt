Best sushi I've found in the desert. It's almost a shame to give it 5 stars because it's already too busy.  The sashimi pieces are huge, service has always been great and the saki-bomb setup for $4 is a steal.  I've always sat at the bar so I can't speak about the tapanyaki tables.  Then again, who would want to sit at one of those anyway?  I'll take mine raw.
