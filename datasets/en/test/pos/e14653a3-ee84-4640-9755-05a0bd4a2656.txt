We decided to check this place out while in Phoenix because so many reviews of my favorite yogurt spot in Tucson had mentioned how much they loved Yogurtland and wished it were in Tucson.

I completely see why. The frozen yogurt itself was the best I've had at any frozen yogurt spot. It was super creamy and delicious. I had the dulce de leche, coconut and pecan and pralines, all amazing.

The topping bar was nice, not the largest variety I've ever seen but also not the smallest. Plus while I generally say the yogurt is just a vehicle for fun toppings, here the yogurt can stand on it's own.
