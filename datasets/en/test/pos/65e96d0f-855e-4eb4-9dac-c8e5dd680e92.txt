if you want true New York Pizza this is the place to eat. There Pizza is thin like NY and really tastes great and the Gravy & Cheese is very tasty. The staff and owner are very friendly. I have been going there for 5 years and have not had a bad meal at all. If you are a New Yorker you really need to go to Lucky's Pizza
