I took my family here when they were in town last month, and we all loved it.

The ambiance was festive and homey.  The meals looked enticing when they were served, and they lived up to expectations.  I ordered the mushroom and cheese enchiladas.  The truffle sauce was heavenly.  It was an extremely rich dish, and I loved every second of eating it.  

When you're trying to think of places to take out of town guests, particularly ones who are expecting good Mexican food because, hey, Arizona is close to Mexico, take them to Barrio.
