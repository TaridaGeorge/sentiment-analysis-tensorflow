Darn good chargrilled burger for the money.  Very flavorful, and the garnish was fresh tasting as well.  Plus they finally put a business at this location that may finally not go out of business.  They completely remodeled this location on the inside so it is all new and nice inside.  Clean bathrooms, great (self) service, and good food gets 5 stars from me.
