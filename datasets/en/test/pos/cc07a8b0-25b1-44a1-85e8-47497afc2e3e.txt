Yum, yum, YUM! I am so excited to have a great, local eatery that is not a chain! Bol Italia has really good food that is cooked fresh when you order it. The owner is an italian chef and definitely knows what he's doing. The menu is simple, yet creative, and SO flavorful!! I have had the chicken and broccoli bowl twice and the greek salad. So far, all has been wonderful!
