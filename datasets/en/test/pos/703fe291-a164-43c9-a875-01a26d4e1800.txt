Came to Surprise Arizona for an unexpected Funeral. I booked this hotel on Orbitz and the price was excellent for 4 people. The staff was friendly, the hotel was clean and the room was spacious, For one night it was perfect!. I probably won't be back in Surpise anytime soon, but for an over night stay it was perfect.
