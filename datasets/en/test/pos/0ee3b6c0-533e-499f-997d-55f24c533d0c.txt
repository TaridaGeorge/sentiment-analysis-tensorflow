This place is SICK (as in amazingly awesome)

Island Teriyaki has been a staple of well-priced, delicious food in my monthly diet for quite some time. 

The Good:
- Tons of options on the menu
- Great prices, even better portions
- The Teriyaki sauce is the BEST in Phoenix
- Service is kind and polite. Never had an issue.

The Bad:
- There's only 1!

If you have the opportunity, go out and find this well-hidden gem. You will not be disappointed.
