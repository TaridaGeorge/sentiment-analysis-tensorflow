Big fan of Fry Bread House. I love the hominy beef stew with the fry bread. The fry bread is just flat out amazing. That stew is so good I usually burn my tongue with inadequate waiting.

I've had the tacos & they're good but tough to make me pass on the stew.

The dessert fry bread (gotta go honey w/powdered sugar) is also amazing.

Cheap & locally owned too. Gotta love that.

One of the AZ musts for folks visiting from elsewhere in my book.
