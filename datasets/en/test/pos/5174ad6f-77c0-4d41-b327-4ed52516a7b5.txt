I'm not gonna lie, I've only been here Twice & once is all I need to fall in love with a place. The first time I went with my bf to eat. The food wasn't half bad, way better than filabertos!! The second time I went here It wasn't for food...haha it was for drinks. I don't really remember how much they cost or if the bartenders were nice but I had a great time! The best part is, they didn't kick me out! (:
