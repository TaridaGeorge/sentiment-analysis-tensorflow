What can I say? Famous Dave's is my favorite BBQ place in Az! My wife son and I where there the other day and we got the All-American BBQ Feast half size only like $33.00. It feed all 3 of us and we took home leftovers for the next day!  

Freaking sause... Their sause is so good! I was putting a bottle of the Sweet and Zesty in my wifes purse and got cought. The nice Waitress (Alicia) then reminded me that I could purchase a bottle for only $3.50 more!  Cha-ching and I dont have to go to jail for stealing BBQ sause. Although it would have been worth it! 

St. Louis-style spareribs, Chicken, Georgia chopped pork (or Texas beef brisket which you can add for a few $$$ more) , Corn Bread, Corn on the cob, Beans, coleslaw, and Sause!  What a day.... what a day!!!!
