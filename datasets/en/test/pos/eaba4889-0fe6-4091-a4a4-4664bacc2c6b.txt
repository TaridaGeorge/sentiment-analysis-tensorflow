Heck yay! All the reviews below are spot on, but I'll throw my two cents in. I had the lunch special (Magic Mushroom Burger) and ordered my son a basic cheeseburger. We both chowed down. Fries were a bit salty, but the burgers were bestest. And the $5 lunch special is toppermost!

The counter guys even had little airplanes for my kids to play with while we waited for our order. We sat on the back porch out of the sun and had a great lunch. Will visit again when I'm around.
