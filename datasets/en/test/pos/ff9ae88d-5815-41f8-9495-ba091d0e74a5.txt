Not only do you get a visual experience in the parking lot...but wait till you get inside! This bar/lounge & theater has such a great atmosphere & vibe going down :: Moroccan lights, perforated steal & wallpaper stencil art by Joerael Elliot...this place is HOT! 
Then you have what you went there for...the films!! All independent & if you stay on top of it, you'll even get to see real film projection as they showed 16mm last night!! Real animation...can you remember?? SO GREAT!  well enough reading and go visit my new local bar & theater!
