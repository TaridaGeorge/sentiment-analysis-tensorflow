I went to Party Planet (In Goodyear) today looking for invitations and not only did they have the invites I was looking for they were cheaper than another party store that is going out of business and has everything 50% off! 
They have great customer service and are family owned and operated. They also price match competitors ads.
Party Planet does cakes and rentals. Their website has coupons for rentals, cakes, etc.
I will be coming back to get the birthday cake, party supplies and balloons!
