Dollar drink nights on Monday, no cover!
What can I say, you can't beat it. I don't like fancy mixed drinks or club settings, so The Vine is a perfect place to knock back 'a few' shots and play some pool!
A lot better during the summer when the ASU crowd thins out... (yes, I go to ASU, but that is a whole lotta bros).
