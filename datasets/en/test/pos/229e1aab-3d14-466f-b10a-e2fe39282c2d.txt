We did date night with wine and cheeses and snacks and all kinds of goodies here the other night.  It was FANTASTIC!.  You can get cheap wine and you can get the expensive stuff but it is all GOOD stuff.

Live music was good too.  The audience was very eclectic.  Some look like they just rode in from 1874 and some looked like they were metro sophisticates.  I guarantee you will fit in if you go.

This is a great little place to go and spend a romantic evening.  You'll get mucho brownie points with out losing any macho status.
