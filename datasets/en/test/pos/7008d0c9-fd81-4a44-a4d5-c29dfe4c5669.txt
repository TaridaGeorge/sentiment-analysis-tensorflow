I had the opportunity to go to Centurion after I found them on Groupon. All I can say is that the food was totally awesome, the service was great and the chef took time to come over and talk to us.  Being European I can say that I have very high standards when it comes to food. We had eggs Benedict, Italian & Spanish skillet and there were all coked just perfect. I highly recommend this place. We will be back there soon.
