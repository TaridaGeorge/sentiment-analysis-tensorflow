This is the mechanic you want to see if you are mechanically-challenged or if you are a girl who knows a little about cars! ;) Greg is honest, trust-worthy, and really easy going. He will get you back on the road in no time AND tell you what you need to watch for down the road. He's a good guy! If you're in Mesa, I highly recommend him (and believe me, when I say I've been through the ringer with car mechanics this year and this is a HIGH recommendation!)! I will coming back to him in the future most definitely!
