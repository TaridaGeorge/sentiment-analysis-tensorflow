as a man who is used to good quality european clothing in london for so many years, i was looking for a similar experience in arizona. Brothers tailors did that for me not only as far as quality in clothing but also as far as service. they met my expectations above and beyond because of their expertise and the knowledge in clothing that they provided.  also they have timely service and they will provide u a custom service. in addition they make custom suits which will make any occasion a truly amazing experience..i recently had a few custom shirts made by brothers tailors and it has been the best decision i have made as i use these on a regular basis for any occasion.
