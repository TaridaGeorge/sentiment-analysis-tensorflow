I have always loved this hotel and after recently discovering their happy hour specials, I love it even more! Three dollar drinks? Yes please! I highly recommend the pomegranate fizz - so delicious that I completely lost track of how many I had! The pool is great, the music is great...I highly recommend heading here after work to unwind one day this summer.
