LOVE! LOVE! LOVE FEZ! I have been a patron of Fez for a few years. Always great food. Always great service. Love the specials. Dessert is out of this world. 

Great hang out. My friends and family meet there as often as we can. Fez is a destination of choice!

Best place of a late night drink or snack after a show.
