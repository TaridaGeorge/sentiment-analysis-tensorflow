Great!.  Packed on a Sunday afternoon!  $5 glasses of wine all day (like 20 to chooses from) which is $4-7 off each glass!  Oh yeah, $5 pitchers of Hoegaarden too!  Great service, great energy - just like every other time we have been there.  Postinos is what other wine bars try to be but usually come up short.
