Chill atmosphere and the smoothest coffee around!  I got hooked on Seattle when I was in high school hanging out at the Foothills location.  Now I live near the Gilbert location where I frequent the place for a quick morning cup of joe and on the weekends it's nice to just hang out.

A true neighborhood joint the barista knows my drink and makes it perfectly each time.  I definitely recommend the french caramel latte or the white Russian mocha.  This place blows Starbucks out of the water.
