I was looking for a place that does alterations, so I turned to Yelp... I never really needed a tailor before. After reading the fabulous reviews for Valentina's, I decided to go there. 

I brought in a dress to Valentina's back in July to get taken in. I'm standing up in a wedding in New York, and was sent a dress that was about 5 sizes too big. She took it in and did a beautiful job in under 2 weeks.  I tried on the dress again in early September (the wedding is September 25) and it was still too big. I had lost some weight since the first dress fitting- She complimented me on the weight loss, and took the dress in again without charging me for the second alteration! Now the dress fits perfectly! 

I would definitely recommend Valentina's for any alterations you need!
