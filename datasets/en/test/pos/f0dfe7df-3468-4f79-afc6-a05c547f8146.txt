I have found my new spa! this I travel nationwide and have visited alot of shops. This one is the best experience ever. Prices were competitive and oh so worth it. The shop is upscale in appearance, all the nail techs speak very good english, inviting in their conversation & professional in their dress. (white spa shirts and name badges)
The pedicure was complete with detox salt scrub for my entire legs, hot cotton scented towels and they spent just as much on my leg massage as they did when they massaged my back after my pedicure. ALL for $18.
THEY WILL SEE ME EVERY WEEK.
I will tell all my friends, this is by far the best nail spa in phoenix!
Thanks Susan for my amazing pedicure and your delightful yet professional attitude.
