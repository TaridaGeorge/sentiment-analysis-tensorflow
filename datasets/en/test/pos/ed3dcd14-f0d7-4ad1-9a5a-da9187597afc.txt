Wow. What a find. Great Chicago style hot dogs! Jumbo and foot longs great too. My son said best fries he's ever tasted.  Hours m-f . CASH ONLY. atm across street at gateway community college.. no Italian beeps, though. Outside eating, with misters. Clean eating area, so bugs werent an issue. Nice people running it today. 
1st time here, and we will be back.
