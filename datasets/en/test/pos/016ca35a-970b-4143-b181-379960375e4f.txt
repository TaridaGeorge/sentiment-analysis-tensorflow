Tomorrow is my one year anniversary of dog ownership.
It was time to get dogface'sannual checkup and shots.
This is my second experience at this vet's office and it was just as amazing as the first time I was there a year ago.
staff amazing,no wait,Doc incredible and supportive,dog wagged tail throughout whole thing.
they really make you feel as if your pet is the only thing on their minds.
Kudos for setting the bar so high!
