I've used them for parties (where I picked up large trays of food) and I've eaten lunch there often and never been disappointed.  I especially like the fried catfish (not served every day, so inquire.)  The staff is always friendly and the food always hot and good.  And, this location has french fries which I do like.  All in all, a great place for a good, quick meal in cenpho.
