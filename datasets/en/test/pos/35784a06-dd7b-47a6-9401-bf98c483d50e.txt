I really liked this place. When driving here, don't take the back-roads because the place looks like it's someone house. But from the front, the place is very cute with lots of trees. The breakfast combo is awesome. You get alot of options for $6. I like that the place is small and clean. The best ice coffee ever! ever! Don't ask because they won't give you the secret ingredient. Be back!
