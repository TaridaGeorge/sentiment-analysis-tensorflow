This is the best place for a great kids meal! Salmon,steak,ribs and 2 sides with it for around $7.95!  My kids loved the variety. My daughter had the ribs, fresh fruit and carrot sticks and dip. My son had the salmon, cooked veggies and mashed potatoes. If you are traveling and want to bring the kids to a nicer place I would recommend Firebirds.
Great  steaks, great wine list and half price wine in Tuesday,s  The desserts are HUGE so only order 1 for 3 people. And the carrot cake was amazing.
