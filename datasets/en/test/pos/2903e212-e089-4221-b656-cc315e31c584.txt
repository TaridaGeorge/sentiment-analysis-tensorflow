This is the first pizza place where I haven't eaten the pizza. My visits usually consist of the spring salad with their made-in-house dressing and either a sandwich or pasta. Every sandwich is excellent and filling no matter which you choose.

The atmosphere is excellent with sports on in the backround and this Nello's location has the friendliest wait staff out of all of them.
