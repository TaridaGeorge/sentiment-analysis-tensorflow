Went here with my outstanding Boeing hosts. It's a nice hangout. They had pretty good beer and the pizza was greasy but tasty. This place would get 4 stars, except for the fact that when our rental car wouldn't start in the parking lot, about 7 staff and patrons huddled around the car, hood and keys trying to help us one. A couple of people even went down to the radio shack to get us a new battery. When that didn't help a guy went and got his toolbox and helped us disconnect the battery. After reconnection, it worked! Thanks so much to all of you.
