Our favorite place to eat in Gold Canyon. Whenever we arrive for our winter vacation, before we even have a chance to grocery shop, we run to Chen's first. It's that special !
We always feel so welcomed by James, the owner and we are greeted like old friends by the staff. 
Food is consistently delicious, always freshly cooked to order and served hot. Excellent quality food. 
The portions are very generous and rarely does a person leave without some to take home.

Try egg foo yong there, which is like none other I've tasted in my travels...It's 3 huge dumplings with a yummy sauce.
Sesame chicken and moo goo guy pan are favorites as well.
Very reasonably priced.. We highly recommend it !
