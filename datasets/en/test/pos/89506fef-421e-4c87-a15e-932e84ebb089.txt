THE best pizza in town.

The SUPER SIX is a hit in my book.

I started going to Aurelios, now called Spinatos about 30 years ago.

Mr. Aurelio went back to Chicago and Ken stayed in Arizona to start Spinato's Lucky for us he decided to stay.

I discovered Aurelios back when I delivered the Sunday morning paper to Ken who lives in Fountain Hills. 

EXCELLENT PIZZA!
