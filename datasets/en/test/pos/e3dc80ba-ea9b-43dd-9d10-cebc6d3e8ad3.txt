My family has been here multiple times and the food is always dependably delish. The restaurant is pretty much a little hole in the wall (the best kind of place) with some of the best food you could ever eat. We've had the pad thai, curry, tom ka along with several other dishes and we have yet to be disappointed. They also offer a few Chinese faves with a Thai flare on their menu. Their won ton soup-I kid you not-has the BEST BROTH I have ever tasted! Unlike the other asian chain restaurants in the valley (that use poorly trained "chefs" to cook) the friendly Thai couple that own this place cook every dish as if it were for their own family. You must sample this place :-)
