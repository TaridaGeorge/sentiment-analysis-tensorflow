The Best Pizza....Hands Down

I'm a little embarrassed to say how many pizza joints we've been to. My wife and I lived in Phx before moving to the SF Bay Area and have been here too many times to count. The 2 hour wait does not phase us, its an experience to remember. 
Chris Bianco is an artist with a pizza oven, something to behold. No wonder he's won a James Beard and is noted as the best pizza in the US. 
If you are as fascinated with pizza as my wife and I, you can't miss this one. Put your name in, get a bottle of wine, and relax. When your table is ready, ask the server what to order. You wont be sorry. This is the place that all others in the US are measured by in my book. 
Buon Appetito!
