I adore La Bocca and at any given time, I'm probably thinking about when I get to go to there next. 
The bruschetta is unbelievably delicious. My mouth is watering just writing about it. They have 8 different options and you can choose 4 with each order. I normally get  the smoked prosciutto & fig, pulled pork & pesto, roasted garlic & goat cheese, and the pesto with roma tomato. 
Yum. Yum. Yum. 
I've had a few of the pizzas and loved them. My new favorite is the goat cheese & pear salad. Honestly I have never tried anything I wasn't completely satisfied with. 
They offer a nice drink selection and have different specials most days of the week. The atmosphere is sophisticated and relaxed. 
If you haven't been to La Bocca, please go. Right now.
