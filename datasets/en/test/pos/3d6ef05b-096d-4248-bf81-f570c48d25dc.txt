Love Yo Love! They have at least 10 flavors to choose from and they rotate in new flavors and toppings fairly regularly. My hubby and I really like the texture and flavor of the yogurts. They are not icy, but are very smooth and creamy. 

We are addicted to the cake batter with a bit of the oreo yogurt and caramel on top.  YUM! Drooling just thinking about it now!
