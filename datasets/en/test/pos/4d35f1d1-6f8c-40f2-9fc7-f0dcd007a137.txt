If you are ever in Phoenix, this is the place to go, a true authentic Irish Pub, with lots and lots of Irish items and such.  I had the Patrick's Irish Potato Skins and the corned beef and cabbage.  I must truly say I love every minute of it, slurping down with what, of course, Guinness.  The Barmaid was a treat, friendly and enjoyable to talk to.

What I really liked was the fact the corned beef was easy enough to cut and was firm.  It was Delicious!!!!
