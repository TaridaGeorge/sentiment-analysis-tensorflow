They got me at Red Velvet frozen yogurt! It's crazy good!!! The tart flavor was good but I got to admit I still like Pinkberry's better. 
They also have Tammy Coe's goodies, but considering I'm trying to eat better, I have to work hard to ignore them and concentrate myself on the yogurt. Luckily, with flavors like Red Velvet, it's not too hard to do.
There are other frozen yogurt places near Zoyo. I like it much better than Golden Spoon, which lately have a very weird aftertaste on it sweet flavors. 

I met one of the owners and he was very nice!

I would like to see other toppings like mochi and cheesecake bites. 

They have a frequent costumer card that I'm sure I won't have trouble filling.
