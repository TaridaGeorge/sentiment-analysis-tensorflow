I love this sports bar!  Their menu has something for everyone and everything I have tried was better than average.

As you know I'm a salad girl and a good fresh salad is a must, check... they have this.
Their personal size pizza is loaded with cheese and toppings and is good to split as an appetizer or order and devour by yourself. NOTE: Happy Hour has 1/2 price pizza and other appetizers in the bar.

The restaurant is large enough for a group and yet personal enough for a date.

Our service was great and the bathrooms are clean.  Five stars!
