My new favorite sammich spot!!! The bread is fresh and great!!! I always get the turkey tom with extra mayo (make sure you get extra mayo or you will have a dry sub on your hands). The hub loves the gargantuan. The only other advise I would give is to not get the chocolate chip cookies (they are pretty dense and not very good) and read the signs while you sit and eat. They are pretty funny. The service really is fast and I have freaked a few times. Be sure to take advantage of the free smell as well
