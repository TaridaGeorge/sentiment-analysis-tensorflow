Hallelujah! Nothing saves you more when you live in suburbia than fabulous Thai food!

The Som Tum appetizer is the perfect starter - raw papaya, chili, lime, carrot, cabbage...fresh and zesty.
Their curry is superb but I stick by their pad thai, paht see iiew and kaprow are all you need...though there is something that is drawing me to try the evil jungle noodles. 

Typical out of date decor and overtextured walls but all part of the experience!
