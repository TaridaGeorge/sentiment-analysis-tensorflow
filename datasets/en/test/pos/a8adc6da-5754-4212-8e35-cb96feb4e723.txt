I loved the original NoRTH is Scottsdale so I am thrilled to have this one in the neighborhood. I'm working my way through the menu and love it all so far!! Can't go wrong here. The general manager, Derik, makes each visit special. FRC made a good decision moving him to the new location. I'm sure many people are trying NoRTH at Arcadia because they know him. Great, great place!
