Definitely!

City Wide Pest Control has good service and a great price. 

The technicians are always on time and friendly they will show up as early as 7am if you need. They have a 21 day warranty if it rains and the price is less than any other company I have used.  

There is no contract or agreement needed and you can have them call you monthly to set up service or you can call them on a as needed basis.

I definitely recommend them.
