Love my local Starbucks. It is seriously fast, even in morning or lunch rushes, and the employees really do keep this place moving like a well-oiled machine every time I've been in, just as Jill M. has also observed. 

I've only ever had an order screwed up once, and it wasn't even a deal breaker (heating a cold item, no biggie). The staff puts up with my mumbling COFFEE GIVE NOW morning attitude and really provide killer service that makes the rest of the day go smoothly.
