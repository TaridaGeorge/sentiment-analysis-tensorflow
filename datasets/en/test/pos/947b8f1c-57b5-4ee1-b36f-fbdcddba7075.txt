We love this place, been going here for years, gonna hit it up today as a matter of fact!  We have had several bday family gatherings here and the food is good, the staff are nice and the price is right.  I love their Peking Duck and walnut shrimp, but they are usually only available for dinner and on the weekends at an increased price, so that kind of sucks, but the fresh sushi bar is well worth the price every time.
