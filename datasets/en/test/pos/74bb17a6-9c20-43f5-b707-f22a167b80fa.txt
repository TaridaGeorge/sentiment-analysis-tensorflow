Amazing selection of beers that i have never heard of with in my opinion the best music section in scottsdale! The place is very comfortable and the food is great. How to go about getting a beer was confusing and then became a process but if you are chill enough to wait for a server to realize that you are there then they pretty much stay on top of you all night. Its definitely a cool place to check out if you're in the area!
