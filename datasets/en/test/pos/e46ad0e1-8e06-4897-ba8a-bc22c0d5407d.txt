This is a great restaurant! There is something for everyone....spicy for the adventurous types and flavorful for the rest of us. They have a full bar too, and an assortment of beers from India. Our waiter was awesome...very friendly and kinda funny. Everyone was very attentive yet not to the point of being annoying. They have the buffet for lunch and also for dinner, so if you can't decide on what to get, do the buffet and sample a bunch of things. It was a very good experience and I would recommend this place highly to anyone. Finally something other than a chain! Give it a try!
