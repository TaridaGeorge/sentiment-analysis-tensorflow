I really liked this place! Went here for happy hour with some coworkers and a few ordered food which smelled good, though I'm not sure how it tasted (I didn't hear any complaints).

The outdoor seating areas were really cute and comfortable with lots of space for any number of people in your party.

The drink menu was really inventive -- I had the Blueberry Lemondrop and it was DEEELICIOUS, with muddled blueberries. Yum!

I know it's weird to give 5 stars for a bar/lounge but if you think about it, they deliver on the main points -- good drinks, great prices, tons of seating -- makes for a great time!
