Food is great.  Portions are modest and flavor is spot on.  Take out and dine both offer great experiences.  I will agree that the dining in experience is a little quiet, no music no TV's.  This part though I have decided I like.  The staff are very, very friendly.  This resteraunt has become my chinese resteraunt of choice over Changs.  Food is equal if not better, Wait Staff is Friendlier, Price point is unbeatable.  

This location will only get better as it ages.
