I can't understand what happened with Patti's group???

I've been eating here for I don't even know how many years.

Originally opened by Christo (yeah, *that* Christo with the restaurant up on 7th St.), this is an absolute fav for a business lunch or dinner. or dinner on the way to the theater, ballet, symphony, etc.

Not unusual to see Gov. Napolitano, Mayor Gordon, business & civic leaders and somebody in jeans at the same time.

Great service!  Wonderful food!  You call it & I'm there!
