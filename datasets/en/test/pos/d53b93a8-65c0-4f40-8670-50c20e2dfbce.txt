If your in the Tempe area and are looking for a good breakfast or lunch, do yourself a favor and stop in to Munchalunch.  I love going here because the menu has great variety and I can always find something tasty.  I also have to say that its a great value, all of the items are well priced and the portion sizes are generous.
