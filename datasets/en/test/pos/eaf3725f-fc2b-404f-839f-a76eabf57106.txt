I was referred to Dr. Kim Lucas by another doctor who was her patient. In the 5 years I have been going to this practice I've never had a bad experience or been mis-diagnosed. Dr. Lucas and Nancy Erdman are amazing women who I completely trust with all my health concerns...menopause, diabetes, anxiety etc... I highly recommend this practice and will not go anywhere else!
