Wow... i went to dinner with hubby tonite and it was a great experience. Friday and Saturday nites are busy but it was worth the wait. I had a Large Hot Sake, hubby had a vodka with cramberry.. for dinner we shared the house salad, tempura roll and the california roll and we were in love. the food was fresh and tasty. and only cost $26.78 = tip during happy hour..we are so coming back every week.
