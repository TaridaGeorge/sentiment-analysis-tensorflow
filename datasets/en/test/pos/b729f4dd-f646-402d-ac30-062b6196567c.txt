awesome little hole in the wall tiki bar, with no-nonsense bartenders who take good care of their regulars!! This place gets packed on Tuesdays and Saturdays bc there are usually a handful of djs spinning some sweet tunes! Oh and the pitchers are mad cheap! You haven't experienced the real downtown phoenix until you've been here!
