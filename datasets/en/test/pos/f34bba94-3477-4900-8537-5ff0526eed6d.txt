So it was through Lo-Lo's that I was introduced to the concept of chicken and waffles. The peculiar mash-up had sounded a bit odd to me, but not beyond trying. I'm not sure if they even have other items on the menu as I've always just had chicken and waffles. I've had Lo-Los to go and eaten on-site numerous times. If you eat in, they serve the drinks in mason jars, and the overly-attentive wait staff never leave you with less than a half-full jar before offering you a refill. 

The fried chicken is the best I've ever had period! It's even better than the stalwart California chain and institution, Roscoes. The other day I had fried chicken at home and found myself putting Frank's Red Hot and syrup over it before I deemed it worthy to eat. Lo-Los made me do that.
