If more people would only go here they could afford to be so much more!  Probably the last thing worth going to left on Mill Ave. Well the book store is still cool.  This Theater has been around for decades and shows a lot of great indie films and old school movies.  Sure they show a few flops too but hey, thats indie cinema for ya.  Its small but most of the times the movies they are showing wont be airing anywhere else.  They do great horror nights, just did a John Hughes festival, and it's just a shame all those college kids with mommy and daddy's money dont know a thing about preserving historical assets.  Theyll get up in arms over some shitty frat houses, but anything of value . . . They just want more urban outfitters.  Ick.
