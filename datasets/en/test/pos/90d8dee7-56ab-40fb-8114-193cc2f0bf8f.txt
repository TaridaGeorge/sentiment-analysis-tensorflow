Finding Cibo's was a great experience. First time in Phoenix, very hungry  thirsty and needed to find a good place to hang out to plan the day. It was Sunday morning & a lot of places were closed for the day. We were so grateful for their Sunday hours! 

Well, we just loved the place, but I'm partial to restaurants in old houses! The music and decor were delightful and relaxing. Menu options were very interesting and authentic and our brunch omelets were delicious! Our server was very pleasant. Only wished I lived in the neighborhood and could stop by regularly; Cibo's feels like the home of a good friend. And luckily, that friend is Italian, mellow and a great cook....
