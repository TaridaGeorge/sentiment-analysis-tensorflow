Much smaller than the Whole Foods a bit further up north off Scottsdale Rd and Mayo...so a slightly smaller selection overall, and a much smaller selection of freshly-prepared foods.  BUT that means a fraction of the customers at the other location, easy up front parking, great service and NO lines at the cashiers!

Dionne at the cheese counter is especially wonderful!  They have a nice selection of sampler cheeses if you will (my term, not theirs) of smaller hunks for sampling.  Plus, if you want to try something new, Dionne will not only slice up whatever you like, but suggest others for you!  Felt like a kid in a candy store...only with delicious cheeses!

Here's hoping the Raintree location is able to stay open.
