Just an incredible experience. We dine out a lot for business and we had visited Marcellino at its prior location in North Phoenix, but had not visited the Old Town Scottsdale location. So, we decided it was time to try that location, and wow, what a killer meal and evening we had!

If you're not familiar, Marcellino features a dazzling authentic Italian menu with house-made pastas such as squid ink fettuccine, and a great wine selection. We had an incredibly fresh and creamy buffalo mozzarella and also the Scallop al Pesto. 

I enjoyed a delicious ravioli filled with pureed choice beef, and one of our guests enjoyed a stunning seafood fettuccine with half a Maine lobster. Beautiful dishes. 

The three hours simply blew by, and our server Jeff was a true delight. I highly recommend Marcellino!!
