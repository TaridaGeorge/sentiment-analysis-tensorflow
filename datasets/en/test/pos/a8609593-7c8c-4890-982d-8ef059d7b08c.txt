BEST PHO IN THE EAST VALLEY! well, i think so, anyway. 

This place is a gem! don't let the neighborhood fool ya. khai hoan is in a weird little strip mall (as are many of the best restaurants in az) on the other side of haji baba. they redecorated the interior recently so it's not as gritty as it used to be, but the food is still as delicious as ever.

my favorite dish is the #5, well done and tender beef pho with tendons. the broth is superb, the meat and vegetables fresh, the atmosphere authentic. the selection of beverages is also good, with the taro teas and the required drip iced coffee. they even have fresh coconuts and salty lemonade.

it's convenient that the light rail runs right by, but i've been known to drive all the way down from deer valley just for that soup.
