love love love it! What a quaint little piece of heaven. Located south phoenix...I wasn't sure what this place would look like as we kept driving south but as we walked onto the property it felt as if you were no longer in the big overcrowded city. We went to the morning glory cafe for breakfast. The food was wonderful and the presentation was great! I highly recommend it. It would make a wonderful place for a baby or wedding shower!!
