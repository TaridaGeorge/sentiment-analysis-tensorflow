I have now gone to Paul three times first for just a cut then the other two times cut and color. Every time I come out very happy. I have long thin flat straight hair most hair stylist don't know what to do with thin hair but Paul puts in layers and cuts it so it has a little more volume he also never cuts to much off.  Paul is AMAZING when it comes to dying hair, he knows what colors will look best on you and can work with you to help you find the right color. I have blue eyes and red skin tone in my face; Paul dyes my hair colors that take away the red in my face and bring out my eyes. I'm very happy that I found Paul he's defiantly the best hair slyest I've ever been to.
