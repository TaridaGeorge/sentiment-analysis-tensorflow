I have been going to Jocelyn at Biagio for quite a while.  I can be a bit particular about my nails.  Before I found Jocelyn, I would go home after a mani and reshape my nails. Don't have to anymore!  Jocelyn is AMAZING!  
     I was used to cookie cutter nail salons with tacky decor and nail techs that barely speak to clients.  Biagio is not the norm. The salon is beautiful. It has a spa like atmosphere and it is spotless.  And Jocelyn, well I don't even know where to begin. She is a doll!  We have great chats and she is a master of her craft. 
     So if you're looking for a fabulous place to take care of your hands and toes, go see Jocelyn at Biagio. Word of advise.... Make an appointment with her in advance. She's a busy bee.
