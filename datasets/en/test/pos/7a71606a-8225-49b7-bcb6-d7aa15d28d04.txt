Me and my son went in there on Saturday to catch a flick. 

Had a while until the movie started so we went to the Starbucks in the same plaza.
I had finished mine but he was still workin on his and he said he would bring it in to the movie and they better not give him any sh*t or else.

I told him what was about to happen but he didn't care and tried it anyways.

Which of course they promptly threw him out.

So, five stars because that was pretty funny.
