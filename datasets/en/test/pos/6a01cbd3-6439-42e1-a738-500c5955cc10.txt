Love me some Boba Tea House. The girls working here are always nice and full of energy and the selection of teas is incredible. I always get the Almond Milk Tea with Boba and it's a great rush of sugar if you don't feel like downing a stomach sized cup of Starbucks to get your rush. 

It's not that expensive compared to a lot of Boba places around town, and the taste is great.
