Love at first sight. Lust at first bite. And now I'm drunk with a red curry pasty infatuation. I don't know how it could have taken me so long to eat here, I've been eyeing this place since I moved here 3 years ago. This is my jam. This is what I look for in an eatery. This is where I want to hide out, drink beers and chat with my tatoo artist about the next ink-scursion.

Small, narrow, dark, perfect level of noise, good music, cool waitstaff, fun kitchen peeps, inexpensive, and friggin delicious. At 9:30 pm there was a line of about 10 people waiting for tables. Yep the food is that good and the joint is that cool.

New mission: try every veggie pasty on the menu and all sweet pasties.
