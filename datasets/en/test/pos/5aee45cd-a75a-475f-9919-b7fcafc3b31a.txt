You may be wondering why the heck someone from Vancouver, Canada, is doing here, when I live in the home of Lululemon?

Hello, sales!!

I was in Biltmore for more shopping this trip, and my eyes came across a Lululemon.  This is one of the brands that is cheaper up north so I don't usually buy any Lulu when I visit the US.  But the sale rack here is huge!  Perhaps it's because it's not as big of a part of the Phoenix lifestyle, but I was blown away at the colors/selection that were marked down.  Seriously, any size 10 or 12 girls should come here and you'd in heaven!  There was not as much selection in my size, but I happily walked away with a few things on sale.  Very friendly and helpful service.
