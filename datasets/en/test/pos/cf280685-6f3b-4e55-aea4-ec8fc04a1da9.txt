This is my absolute favorite middle eastern restaurant.  I have only been there 2 or 3 times, but for some reason I'm always treated like family.  The place has never been crowded and you get individual attention from the waiter/owner.  Everything on the menu from soup to shawarma is top notch.  The only downside to Byblos is that they do not make their own pitas from scratch as they are regular ole store bought ones :(
