Last week, I had my first appointment with Simply Dentistry. Doctor Tran and her dental hygienist were both really nice. Dr. Tran gave me my cleaning and it was very thorough. I've never had the actual dentist give me my cleaning. I was wowed by their modern equipment to view x-rays. The office itself looks and feels like a spa. The plastic used to make the toothbrush that hey hand out is recycled from yogurt cups and when I'm done with it, I can send it in to be recycled again. They also commented on how they are almost entirely paperless and do their best to make "green" choices. Needless to say, this is not your typical dentist office and I like it!
