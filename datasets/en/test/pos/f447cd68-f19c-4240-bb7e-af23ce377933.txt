I have been going to New World Nails for about two years now and have never had a bad appointment. I usually walk-in and the longest I've ever had to wait is 10 minutes. The spa pedicure is amazing and they do a perfect job with waxing. Plus, they have a bonus points system where you can earn free money towards services just by signing up! LOVE this place!
