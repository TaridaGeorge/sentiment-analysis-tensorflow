When I found this place through Yelp, it reminded why Yelp is so awesome. I was visiting Phoenix and never would have found it otherwise. The sandwiches and charcuterie were simply wonderful. I had a salami sandwich and my bf had a mortadella-fig sandwich.  For some reason, mortadella scares me and I never order it... I have no idea why. But after tasting his, I wished I ordered it. 

This place is good - a great location (next to Lux) and great gourmet sandwiches at a cool price.
