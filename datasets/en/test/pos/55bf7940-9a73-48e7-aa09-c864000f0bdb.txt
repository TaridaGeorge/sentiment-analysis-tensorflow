Sweet salvage is only open the third Thursday of the month straight through Sunday. There are many different vendors within the building so there is something for everyone. I have been two months in a row and have to say I love the Steampunk AZ section as well as Flert. Flert offers custom subway art as well as many other things. Steampunk AZ has some great iron pieces as well as some retro items.  FYI if you venture out on Thursday get ready for a rowdy crowd of treasure hunters!
