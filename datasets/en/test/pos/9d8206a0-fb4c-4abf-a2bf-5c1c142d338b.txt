This restaurant has become a lunch favorite at my work. It has great food (their yellow curry is fantastic), wonderful customer service and reasonable prices. If I had to critique anything, it would be their location. They are located in the huge shopping center that used to house Basha's and Target...now empty. It is somewhat of a ghost town but don't be fooled! This is a family owned restaurant that you will be glad you visited.
