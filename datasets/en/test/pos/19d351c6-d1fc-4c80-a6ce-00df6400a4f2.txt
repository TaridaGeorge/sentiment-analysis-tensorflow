I've only been there twice but would definitely eat there again if I was wanting to eat something in the Central Ave. corridor.  The owners also own Ticos and Fez I believe.  Out of those three restaurants I would have to say Switch is definitely my hands on favorite.  The only plates I have eaten was the hummus/pita dip and Mac and Cheese..This is probably best described as "high-end" Americana  but will not make a dent in your wallet.  The service was good for the most part and the ambiance is perfect.
