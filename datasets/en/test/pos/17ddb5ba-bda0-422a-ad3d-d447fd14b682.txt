I've been bringing my critters in to see Dr. Joel Ruehs at Bell Ridge Animal Hospital for 8 years now. The staff is so friendly, the facility is clean, and Dr. Ruehs is very well educated on little critters (which can be difficult to find in a vet!). I do wish they were located a bit closer to my home, but it really is worth the drive to to have good quality medical care for my four-legged babies.
