Went here for the first time for my 23rd B-day w/ my family. It was AWESOME! we got spring rolls and Pho and some very  tasty drinks.  It was January so we had to sit inside but they do have a nice outside patio.  We all loved our food and have been back many times. If you like Vietnamese food this is one place you really should try. The service was great and have to say that the bathrooms are cool. haha :) If you are going to be w/ a large group i would call ahead and have a table ready for you.
