I love the gelato from this place.  The sea salted carmel is ridiculously awesome!  It is also so great to purchase a pint (or bigger) to take it home to ration out over the week.  I've started branching out to try new flavors but always get a sea salted carmel for the road!!  The location in San Tan Mall is convenient because I can park just west of the shop and easily pop in and pick up a pint togo if I have unexpected dinner guests and I want to impress them with and easy dessert (With the pint you also get extra rolled cookies to put on top).
