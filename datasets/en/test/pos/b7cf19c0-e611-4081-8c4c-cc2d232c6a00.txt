My fiance has been raving about these tacos, so this past weekend they were at the Scottsdale pavilions and so I had to go try them! at first I thought it was strange that it had a Japanese flair on their truck and had Japanese drinks as well. My fiance ordered three different tacos (for him self) and since I'm a fan of chicken I got the chicken. they were AMAZING!!!!! my chicken ones were so awesome I wish I would have gotten more, I had a try of the others which were pork and beef and they were equally amazing. Even tho it is different they are awesome!!! next time we know where they are we are sooooo going back, Id highly recommend finding them and getting yummy good awesome food!!
