Tarbell's is top notch in all areas!  Food quality, service, ambience, amazing!  I recently took ten business associates there for a meeting, and I got nothing but compliments the next day on such an excellent choice of restaurant!  

Definitely try the Spaghetti & Meatballs as well as the Mac N Cheese, and even the Pizzas are to die for.  And the burger too!  You really cant go wrong here.  Warning the deserts here are HUGE (yet amazing).  One desert is enough for 2-3 people!
