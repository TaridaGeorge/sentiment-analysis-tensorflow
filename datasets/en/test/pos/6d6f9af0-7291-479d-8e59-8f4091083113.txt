Cool little shop in Tempe. Talked to Ryan about converting my SS back into a geared 29er... The price was more than fair and they assembled it and told me they will help maintain it since I bought my parts there... Build took a little longer than planned but they gave me a loaner so I wouldn't be a loner! Ryan is a great guy and I would recommend him and use him for future builds.  Thanks Ryan!
