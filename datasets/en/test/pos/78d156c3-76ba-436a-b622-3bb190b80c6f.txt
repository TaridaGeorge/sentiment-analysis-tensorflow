What's not to love about Sauce?
It's a fantastic concept - pizza, salad and pasta (three of my favorite food groups) in a comfortable, stylish setting. The pizza crusts are paper thin, so they aren't too filling. The bread rolls they serve with the salad are yummy.
The service is impeccable, with great attention to detail, which is a norm for all of Sam Fox's restaurant concepts.
I have to say, I am a little biased - my husband worked here for 2 years and I have been coming here for 6 years. But it has never let me down!
