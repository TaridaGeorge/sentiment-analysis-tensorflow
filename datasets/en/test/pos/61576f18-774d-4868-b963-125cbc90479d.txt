Best lunch deal in town!!! Hands down.
Authentic NY style pizza - slice sizes that are what you remember.
Be sure to try the Calzone and the Strombolis.
Tough place to go with large groups - neither location is well suited.
They do offer take out as well as delivery and that mey be the next best thing!
