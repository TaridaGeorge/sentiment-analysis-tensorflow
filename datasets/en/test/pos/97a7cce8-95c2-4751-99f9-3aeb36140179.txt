Over the years I have been to Hillstone/Houston's over 200 times and I can easily say that everything is out of this world. The spinach and artichoke dip, cheeseburger, ribs, fish, french dip, hawaiin steak, the apple cobbler dessert...all amazing....They do everything right here and all for a great price. I never decline an opportunity to go to Hillstone. Did I mention they have a sushi menu? Be sure to get the coconut shrimp roll. It has sauce on the tray that it comes with but be sure to ask for extra!
I always imagine if they were to have a brunch/brekafast menu, what it would be like. I think I would cry of happiness if they ever did.
