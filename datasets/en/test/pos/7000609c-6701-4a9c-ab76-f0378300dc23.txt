Don't believe the haters; this place has the best pizza ever.
Sure, you have to wait 3 hours if you don't make a reservation, so make a damn reservation! The best way to do it is call exactly a month ahead of time about an hour before they open. It's a bit of a hassle getting the minimum amount of 6 people together, but it's well worth it, and it can make a fun event out of going to an amazing restaurant.
