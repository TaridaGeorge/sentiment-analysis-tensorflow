In my hood. Always consistent good food. Service has gotten better. The Miami Ham ( Cubano) hello! All day long! My daughter loves their Chick Noodle Soup every time. The place is simple and clean.  Here at least once a week. The egg salad sandwich is just like my Mom use to make. They have an amazing marble rye. The Sunday morning specials are awesome!! It's always busy these days, but I'll wait. It's nice when people know your name. :)
