I just went to Donovan's on a date, and we had an amazing experience there! The food was delicious (although very expensive); I had the salmon and oysters, and he had a 10 oz. steak and wedge salad. The service was fantastic, and the ambiance was refined and elegant. Definitely a great place to go for a special occasion. I'll be returning for sure.
