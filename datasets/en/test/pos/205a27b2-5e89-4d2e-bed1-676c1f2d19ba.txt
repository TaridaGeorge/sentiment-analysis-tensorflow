We all know I love Sundrops Nail Spot and want to live there....because I can't (code violation or some non sense) I have been bugging Stephanie where she got the flower arrangements on the bar. They look so real! So, I went to the French Bee and low & behold was able to buy an arrangement for every room in the house. My favorite is the yellow rose arrangement that I have on my kitchen table....to increase wealth according to my feng shui handbook.  Great place, not cheap by any means but I won't have to buy fresh flowers that only last a week!
