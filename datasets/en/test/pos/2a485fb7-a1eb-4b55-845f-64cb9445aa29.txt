My wife and I had a great dinner here on a stormy December night.  The French "lodge" like interior was very cozy and comfortable.  It would have also been nice sitting outside on a night that was not rainy.  The food was great (my wife had duck and I had a pork belly dish).  Really yummy.  We had a vanilla souffle for dessert, and it was also good.  The service was very good and our waiter very friendly.  I would come back here again!
