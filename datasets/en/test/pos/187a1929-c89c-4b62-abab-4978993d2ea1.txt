I had the privilege of meeting Ms. Tammie Coe on Sunday while out with my husband just peeking in the store. She was lovely and so kind - sharing lots of little samplings of her delicious baked goods with me. While 9 months pregnant it was a true treat to enjoy a few of her tasty delights :) I've purchased her cakes and breads many times before but after meeting her I'm completely SOLD on supporting her local and passionate talent.
