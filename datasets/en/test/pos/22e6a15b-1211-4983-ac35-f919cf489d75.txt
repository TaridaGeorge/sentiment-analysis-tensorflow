Went to Cowboy Ciao based on all the great reviews and it didn't let me down.

The Stetson salad is 100 of 100!  I had doubts after reading the reviews.......because how good can a salad really be?   But they were all right!!

I had the buffalo carpaccio and it was a 100 as well.

The filet mignon was a the best cut of meat I've ever had but their demi glace was a bit much.  It over powered the steak.  

over all a solid A
