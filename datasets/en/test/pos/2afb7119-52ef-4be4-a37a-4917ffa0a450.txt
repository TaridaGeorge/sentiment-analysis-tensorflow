This reminded me of being home in San Francisco... nice local coffeehouse with a cool Indie vibe.  The barista was real and friendly.  I hung out here almost all day and got a lot of work done.  They have lots of power strips and free wi-fi.

I had a kick ass veggie burger.  And I had awesome tea, chai, and a cappuccino in a Small World coffee cup.

I'd go back anytime.  Thanks, guys.
