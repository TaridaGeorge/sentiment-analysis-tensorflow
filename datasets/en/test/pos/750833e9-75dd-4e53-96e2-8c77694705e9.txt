Great selection of vitamins and supplements, good prices and I can get the special treats our cat likes while I'm picking up the goods for myself. Plus their rewards program is pretty straightforward.

I also like that they are not "all over you" like the other local chain is when you walk in the door. 

I highly recommend the Vitamin Shoppe on Camelback!
