Having recently eaten there several times, I can see why Jim's has such great reviews. I was in Phoenix metro for the first time and staying at the Motel 6 ASU in Tempe just a stone's throw from Jim's.  Just the same, I used yelp for somewhere close with good ratings.  Imagine my delight when I could look out my motel room door and see Jim's. The first time I went, my friend and I walked in 2 minutes before closing and were NOT given the bum's rush.  Awesome waitress took our to go order.  I had several meals there and everything I ordered was super good!!  Great staff, casual, friendly environment and good food reasonably priced.  What more could a guy want?
