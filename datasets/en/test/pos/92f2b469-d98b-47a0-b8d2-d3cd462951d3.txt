D'lish is just that D'lish, I can see why they named it that!!!  I have become a regular not only for the best Green Tea in the area but also the Men that always great you with a smile and a sparkling attitude whether they are swamped or you are the only person in the place!!!  Everything I have eaten there is D'lish but my personal favorite is the Turkey Club...  If you haven't been here it is a must try!!!
