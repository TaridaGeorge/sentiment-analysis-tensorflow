This is the best place for fresh produce and bulk for me.  I can find practically all my grocery needs here and the price is always right.  Even the organic food is abundant.  

The store is extremely clean and neat with a very comfortable temperature while shopping.  The staff is always very nice and knowledgeable and I could only wish other businesses could have cool peeps like em.  

Oh yea and the fresh meat and cheese selection rawks at the best consistent prices...sale or no sale.  A good wine and beer selection at typical Scottsdale prices...but good buys can usually be found on sale.  Great pastries, baked bread and other baked goods are always a must during my visits...but get there in the mornings for choice picks.  It's also the best place in S. Scottsdale to get bulk coffee from a large assortment at an always low bulk price.
