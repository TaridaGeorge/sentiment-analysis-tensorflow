This place and the people there are AWESOME!

My daughter was playing there for an open mic session on a Tuesday night... so we thought what the hell,why not!

The food was great.The service was great.And the management went out of their way to make us feel welcome.

Yes~this is a divey bar...but it is a kick ass divey bar!

(oh,and I paid for drinks all night for 10 and my bill was only 100 bucks!)
AND~we drink a lot....
