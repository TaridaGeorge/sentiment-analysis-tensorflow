These folks are a staple in the Phoenix area and don't really need my review. Good healthy eats in a happy hipster vibe. Super reasonably priced with an eclectic Mediterranean based menu. They've got the to-go process down to a science. *they have to-go Sriracha on the ready!!!

If you've been to any house party, BBQ, or bat mitzvah in the past decade you're probably as tired of hummus as I am. Skip it. Try the baba ganoush or the garlic dip. Super veg friendly. Love you.
