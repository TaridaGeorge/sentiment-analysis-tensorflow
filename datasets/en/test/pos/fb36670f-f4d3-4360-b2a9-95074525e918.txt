I've used Moore and Sons a few times and have always been impressed with how punctual, honest and knowledgeable Gary (the owner) is.  He is licensed in how to clean carpet, tile, restore your house, etc and it definitely shows.  

This time around he cleaned my tile and saved me about $200 over competitors, since he didn't do other steps that he deemed wouldn't clean it any more than it was.  I appreciate his honesty and you can just tell that he is a nice guy.  I highly recommend!
