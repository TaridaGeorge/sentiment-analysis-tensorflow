This place is absolutely adorable. It's perfect for lunch. They have a little shop with an assortment of things - from notecards and miscellaneous to drinks and food and snacks. You can also order off their menu from the counter. Seriously, you can't go wrong here. The food is always great, the drinks are tasty and when the weather's nice you can grab a little table outside and just enjoy it.
