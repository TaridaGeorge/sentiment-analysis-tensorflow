I am suprised that anyone would have anything negative about this restaurant.  It is by far and away my favorite place to eat in the valley.  The steaks are always cooked perfectly and the service is impecable.  I failed to mention  that the staff is also very attentive and knows my name.  I have not found a favorite server there but they are all very good.  The wine list offers so many different choices it is easy to find what you are looking for.  And if you are a chocolate fan like me, you must try the chocolate lava cake, it blows any other cake out of the water!  I enjoy a more personal dining experience and not somewhere that is only after my money.  I love Fleming's and think you should all try it!
