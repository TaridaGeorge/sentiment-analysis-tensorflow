Weather & Coffee is now closed. They locked the doors last week without any warning. I've heard a few things, but don't know what's what so I won't say anything. But here's the official line from their website:

"Weather & Coffee has served the best coffee, tea, smoothies & pastries for almost three years. We are proud of our products and services and have enjoyed serving our customers. Sadly, we have had to close down our Bell Road location. The rigors of being open 7 days a week is one of the many factors in our decision. But now we will have more time to devote to our family and elderly parents."

It's a shame to see another small business owner go out of business.
