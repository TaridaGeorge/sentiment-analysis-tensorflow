I accidentally posted this review under the Gelato Dolce Vita yelp, but it belongs here.

One of the true gems of the East Valley. Walter is a true character, and is very passionate about good food. I told him his food was amazing and he said "No, Not amazing. Normal! People are just used to bad food." Seriously, just eat whatever he suggests. They have the real deal meats and cheeses. Guanciale, Bresaola, Finochiata, Gorgonzole Dolce, Pecorino Tuscano, Borchetto al Tartuffo! Great simple Sandwiches, amazing raviolis!

The list goes on and on. Here's a full review of one of my visits: http://forkvsfood.com/?p=126
