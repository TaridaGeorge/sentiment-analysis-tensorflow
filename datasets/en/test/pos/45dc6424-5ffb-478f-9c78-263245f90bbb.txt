I really like this place.  The decor is great, the receptionist and staff are very knowledegable.  

I took my husband here to zap off some broken capillaries around his nose and under his eyes before our wedding.  His face was clear and beautiful for our wedding (after the bruising healed).  

While I was there, I wanted to have some hyper-pigmented spots zapped by a laser and being responsible and ethical...they refused me because my skin is too dark.  I have to commend them for that because I have known other people who have gone to doctors only interested in making $ and ending up with some bad scars.  

I would totally reccomend...Dr. Van Dyke's office is top notch.
