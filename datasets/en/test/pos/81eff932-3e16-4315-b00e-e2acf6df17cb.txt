My 3 children and I had the pleasure of taking this tour with Tim and a great Aussie family.
This otherwise long 4 hour ride was fun and entertaining. Tim kept us interested by providing us with tons of facts about AZ and joking with us the whole way.  We stopped for lunch at the Indian Reservation and did some light shopping.  The Grand Canyon was spectacular and Tim was so accommodating taking our pictures along the way.  
Tim was the highlight of the trip.  He provided the visiting Australian family with tips on visiting Sedona and showed us some great things along the way.  He had a supply of water he kept encouraging us to drink. My daughter left our camera in the car and he graciously returned it that very night.  Thanks Tim and SouthWest for providing us with a great experience.
