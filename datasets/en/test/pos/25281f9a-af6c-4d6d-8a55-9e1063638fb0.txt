I can't recommend this shop highly enough.  The small local dealer where I bought my BMW recommended them to me and I'm so glad they did!  Local family owned shop, and everyone there lives & breathes BMWs.  Very reasonable labor rates, friendly and approachable environment, they remember your name, and aren't trying to rack up your bill.  The only downside is no "free" car wash like at the dealer - but I'd rather pay $10 for the car wash around the corner than suffer through jacked up rates and shenanigans at the dealer service bay.  I love this little shop and totally trust them with my car!
