this place had superb service. everytime the dishes are brought, they swarm to your table at the same time and put down the dishes at the same time. reminds me of the scene from beauty and the beast when they sang "be our guest"!
the food was cooked very well and the seafood was very fresh. its a long meal so prepare for that.
if you want your food togo, make sure to tell them before they take it away though.
