The employees here are VERY friendly! I really love this Waffle House in particular because my (current) boyfriend and I came here for our first date, (it was beautiful). ...not that anyone cares...but Music from the jukebox is always playing, and the employees are easy to speak with, and the food is always hot and yummy!
