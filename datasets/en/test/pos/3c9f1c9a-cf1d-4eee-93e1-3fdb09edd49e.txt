This place is a awesome fro-yo destination for Sunnyslopers.   When it's nice out they get rid of the whole front wall (glass garage doors).  This place is usually jumping every night but you never have to wait.  

Wednesday night is pajama night and they give you 50% off if you're in there wearing pajamas (I suppose calling it pajama night is explanation enough haha)

Great selection of flavors and toppings and really helpful staff.  I wish I could control myself but I always end up completely overdoing it.
