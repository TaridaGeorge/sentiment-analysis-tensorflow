Hi. My name is Yvett and I'm a Sanrio-holic. Hello Kitty is my weakness. It all started back when I was about four years old. A family friend gave me a Hello Kitty piggy bank for my birthday and the whole obsession started there. I love, love, love all things Hello Kitty. As a result, I've sort of forced this upon my daughter as well. If I could've had this Hello Kitty wedding, I would have. . .

I could seriously spend a fortune at the Sanrio store if I had one to spend. Given the choice between a meal and something from Sanrio, Hello Kitty always wins. Always. I'd like to divulge further into this obsession of mine, but like all good addicts, I want to keep it as private as I can.
