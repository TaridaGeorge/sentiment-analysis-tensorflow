Love Famous Dave's!!!

The smoked brisket just melts in your mouth and the pulled pork is equally FAN-FREAKING-TASTIC!!! This is typically what I order when I go there for lunch on the weekends. Their lunch menu, which is available all the way to 5:00 PM, is a great deal. I usually get the two meat one (already mentioned which meats I prefer), with a side of slaw, green beans as a replacement for a corn cobette, and a corn muffin. Usually scaled down lunch portions are not as satisfying as their relative dinner portion. This lunch portion, however, is more than enough food to stuff your gord.

Will I go back to Famous Dave's, specifically the one at San Tan? You're darn right I will again-and-again-and-again.
