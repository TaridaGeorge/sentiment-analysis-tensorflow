We love Nello's in Ahwatukee!  We usually do take out (as the place is often crowded).  Everyone is so friendly and they even know my sister and I by name (and order) :)

We love the Classic European pizza and our new fave is to get it with an order of garlic bread with cheese and tomatoes - yum!

Can't go wrong with good, quality pizza and great service with a smile!
