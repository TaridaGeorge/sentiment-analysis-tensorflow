Our family has used the services of Data Doctors for many years, first in Tempe and now in Scottsdale. The service at the Scottsdale location on Pima and Pinnacle Peak is outstanding. Both Dale and Mike are very patient and knowledgable. They diagnose the problems with our PCs and communicate the issues and solutions in terms we can understand. They offer several options for repair, some that we can do ourselves at no cost. 
When we needed a new computer, we bought one built by these guys and it's fabulous. All data was transferred and setup in a format that required very little re-training on our part. Because it is evident that they are not simply trying to sell their services, but rather save their customers money, we are loyal customers for life. 

Thank you Mike and Dale
