I bought a Groupon for a $14-30 min massage. I was put with Casey who was INCREDIBLE! Upon first glance I didn't expect to get the kind of massage I got. I guess I just assumed that since she was tiny I would get a good massage but instead my massage was hands down the best one I have ever gotten. I was quoted the regular prices at the end as:

$65/1hr
$35/30min 

and a 10% discount if you buy 8 in advance. I'm a little confused about that now since the only other review for this place quotes 20% off if you buy 8 in advance. Either way...CASEY was awesome!
