Jake is my auto guy and is over at Shuman's Auto Clinic. For years I have trusted Jake with my personal vehicle's and Business van. He is working for Mike over at Shuman's and I didn't think I can trust a car guy like I trusted Jake and then Jake introduced me to Mike and his crew over at Shuman's and they are great. They fix what needs to be fixed and they look over what other things look like they need attention and let you know the REAL Story, not a strong arm sales pitch, just real honest advice and GREAT work. Thanks Jake and Mike!!!!!
