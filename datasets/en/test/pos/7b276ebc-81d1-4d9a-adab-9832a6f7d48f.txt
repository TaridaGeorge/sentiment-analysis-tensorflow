I used to live in Beaumont, TX which is about 30 minutes from LA. As a result, I would eat killer cajun food. Since I moved from there I haven't had anything as good UNTIL I came to Flavors of LA! U gotta have the boudin balls but have them roll them in cornmeal instead of flour. The catfish is great and the red beans and rice to die for!!!! Enjoy
