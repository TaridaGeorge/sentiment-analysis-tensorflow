Great theater to see 1st release movies. Cine' Capri is AWESOME! Get there early or go on Monday morning to avoid crowds. Other theaters are more than adequate for watching end enjoying any movie. Local area restaurants are varies casual to mildly dressy (it is Scottsdale after all). Senior discounts are offered too.
