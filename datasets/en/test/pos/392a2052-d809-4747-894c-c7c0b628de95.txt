This is the spot for some of the best Italian food!
 Hands down, THE BEST RAVIOLI, with a  lovely marana and a touch of cream, it melts in your mouth, like nothing I have ever had before, it is one of their specialties, made fresh every day, it is A MUST...
 The veal marsala is FANTASTIC, tender and tasty, the marsala sauce is smooth and sweet. Linguini w/ Clams is just DELICIOUS, you can taste the freshness in the clams( Hard to find in Phoenix)
  They end each meal with a sambuca lit on fire, Nice Touch!!!
  They have a great wine list and a full bar.
 I love it, have been going for about 6 years, It is a little pricey, so the visits are not as frequent as I would like.
