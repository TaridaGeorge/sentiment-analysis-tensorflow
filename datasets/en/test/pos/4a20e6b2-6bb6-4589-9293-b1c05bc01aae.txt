Great coffee, kind people, fun and kooky shop. 

Great place to work, although I always bring ear plugs because they have music on. 

Yes there are some hipsters, but it's not an overwhelmingly hipster establishment. It's a good balance of hip and weird. 

It's hands down my favorite coffee shop in Tempe.
