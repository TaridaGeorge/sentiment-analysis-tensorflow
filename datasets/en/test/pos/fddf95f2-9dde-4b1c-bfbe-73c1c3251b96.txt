What an absolutely perfect and adorable collection of local gems!  The concept is fantastic - I love the "mini" versions of some of my favorite places.  My favorite?  The British Bicycle Company.   Those are the most insanely beautiful bikes that I have EVER seen.  And the owners of the shop are some of the nicest people you'll ever meet.  If you need a bike, don't go anywhere else!

I'm very excited to try out the restaurant and Royal Coffee in the future.  A return visit is in the very near future.
