This was an excellent night out we had  it just took me a while to get around to writing a short review.      The atmosphere here is king,  the steaks are yummy and the staff is excellent. 

Josh our waiter was there when we needed him and he gave great suggestions and took care of all the people at my table.    

The Mac and Cheese was my favorite,  make sure you try it.

Add this Sam Fox location to you list for Steaks.
