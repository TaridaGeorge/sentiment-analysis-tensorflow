Total wine totally takes a crap on Bev Mo. This store has everything! The employees are also very knowledgeable. The other day we went in and my husband insisted I try red wine instead of sticking to my usual Riesling (I don't like change). So we asked one of the employees and he asked me a few questions then suggested a bottle of Malbec. The Malbec tasted amazing! I was so happy. For those of you who don't know, it's not only wine! You can find everything else. Total wine has helped us stock our bar and entertain our guests. Also, don't forget to chill your bottles before you leave!
