Yay Phoenix. You did this one right.

I've always been able to find what I need. I'm not sure that I love or hate the architecture but I did read about it in Dwell which is always just a bit impressive. 

My only beef is...why isn't there a cafe? Does that make me a yuppie for wanting a coffee house in my library? I promise it's only cause I desperately need the caffeine! Either way...I love espresso and a good book. But this library is top notch if you ask me.
