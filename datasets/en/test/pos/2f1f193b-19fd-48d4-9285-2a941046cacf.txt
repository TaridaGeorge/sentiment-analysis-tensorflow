I've passed by prestige nails in walmart 100s of times but never really thought of having a pedicure there (even though they are always busy!) As I stared at my feet, long overdue for a pedicure, I thought it was about time to try them...since walmart rarely let's me down why should the nail salon inside?

To my surprise I got a wonderful pedicure or $23 not too bad this day in age...my to mention it was just as good as going to the more upscale salon just across the street! 

I'm glad to be the first to review them they deserve it! Now if only they did facials at walmart and hair I'd be set!
