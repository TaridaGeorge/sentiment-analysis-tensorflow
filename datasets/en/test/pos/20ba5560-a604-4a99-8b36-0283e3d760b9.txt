Ok, so I've probably been to this restaurant more than any other place in Phoenix.  Every time its truly a great experience.

Roasted Corn Pizza absolutely rules!

Make sure you go next door, pick out a bottle of wine (very reasonable prices and no corkage fee next door) and buy some English Muffins for later.

When you're done wash it down with some truly awesome gelato.
