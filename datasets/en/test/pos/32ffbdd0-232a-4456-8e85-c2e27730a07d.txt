As someone who moved here from New York, I am very picky about my bagels. This is the BEST bagels I have found in Arizona yet! The staff is really friendly. They have a great selection of bagels, sandwiches and deli meats and cheeses. Not to mention they serve alcohol!? Bagels and booze...does get any better!?

Just make sure you go to the new location, I went to the old one because Yahoo still has up their old address when you do a search. Also, the old strip mall complex still has their sign up outside of it. Make sure to check the website for the correct address.
