We stopped in after a movie to check out the "soft" opening.  They have it together with friendly and attentive staff.  Pizza was excellent--great flavor and fast delivery out of their great looking wood burning oven.  Their local brews taste great--the cream ale is spot on--also nice guest brews on tap--leg humper hefe is next best thing to a Franziskaner.  Lots of parking in the back--expect this place to do very well.  Simple menu, good value and cold beer!  Check it out--
