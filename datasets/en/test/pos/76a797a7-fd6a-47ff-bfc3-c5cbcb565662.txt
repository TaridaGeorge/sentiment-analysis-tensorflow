How can you not want to eat here?! The sign says "Breakfast, Lunch, Bacon"!!!

I had a chorizo and egg burrito that was really tasty.

I also had a maple bacon donut that very nearly put me in a (delicious and satisfactory) sugar coma!

The patio was wonderful, the service punctual, and the company was the best!

I will be back!
