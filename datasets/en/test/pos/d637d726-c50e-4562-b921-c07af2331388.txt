This Old Town landmark still serves the best ribs in the valley.  Been going here since we moved here from Chicago in the 80's.  If your from Chicago the Carson name (Don of Don & Charlie) is the definition of ribs.  After all these years we get the same quality of food and style of service we did back then.  My wife loves the chopped liver & rye you get to start the meal.  If your looking for a great steak or rack of ribs, pass on the Scottsdale giltz & fashion show you pay for at most places and head to Don & Charlies.  If your a sports fan it will be a special treat.
