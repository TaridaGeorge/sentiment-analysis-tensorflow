Friendly, very knowledgeable, and quick service. You are greeted by a smiling face when you walk in the door, and it won't be longer than 10 seconds before a rep comes to see if you need guidance. I love it that you can make a purchase without standing in line or going up to the register! They have little traveling register keypad thingys. I stood in the middle of the store in the software aisle while paying for my iMac, very cool! Oh, and he carried it out to my car without me asking for help. :)
