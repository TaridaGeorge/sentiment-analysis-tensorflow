I was in late on a week day evening. Staff was attentive and knowledgeable. The wine list is unique and varied. I had the butternut squash soup which was superb. My friends ordered a cheese plate that seemed to be perfect. Ambiance is loud, vibrant, and bustling. 

Good option in Old Town for some wine with friends or a date.
