This is an awesome place to go with friends or a date! Made me feel like I wasn't in  Arizona anymore. The vibe is super hip and classy. A group of my friends and I went on a Monday evening and loaded up on their $20 bruschetta and wine deal. The bruschetta was the best I've ever had! Plan to go back for brunch!
