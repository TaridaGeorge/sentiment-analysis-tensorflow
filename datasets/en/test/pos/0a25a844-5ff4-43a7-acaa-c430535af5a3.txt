I have been to several different dental offices over the years and never found one I liked all that much. I tried out Imagine Dental a couple of years ago and I am SO glad I did! They are the dental office I've been looking for that I didn't think existed. The office staff is helpful and friendly, I absolutely adore Keri (the dental hygienist) and Dr. Foreman is awesome. I feel comfortable and cared for there and actually enjoy my visit rather than dread it. And most importantly, my teeth look better than they ever have! Thanks Imagine Dental! I would recommend you to anyone!
