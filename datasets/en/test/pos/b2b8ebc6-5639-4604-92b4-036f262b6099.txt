For Mother's Day brunch it's a hit at my house and has been for two years running.

The good measure of any breakfast brunch is the Eggs Bene, it's a tough dish to get right and even harder when they have to sit out.  At this buffet they don't sit for long.  The eggs are cooked great and they take away the old ones if they have been there  long.  

The rest of the selection is great with everything you would expect: crab legs, sushi, salmon, pasta, carving stations, omelette station, and desserts galore.  Champagne of course.

The service is great, the ambiance is relaxing, and the outdoor patio is great in the spring.  

See you there next Mother's day!
