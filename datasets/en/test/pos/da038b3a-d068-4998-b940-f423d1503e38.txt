Holy cow. We came here for a drink, and although it's expensive ($30 for a glass of wine and a specialty drink), the view is absolutely amazing at night. We came just as the sun was setting. Pretty awesome. See picture. I don't think you can beat this view in Phoenix. You can see mountains and the city. Very nice patio that is huge with a big fire pit and fountain. Service was fine, friendly and prompt. They only valet though so bring a couple bucks to tip the guy. If you want to be cheap just order beer to see the view.
