One doesn't need a long review for this place. If you're out to get the best steak and seafood in the valley, and price is no factor. you will not do better then this place. We frequent it several times a year when we bring clients in, and they are money every time! Meats are cooked to absolute perfection, and they have an extensive wine list. Always 5 stars!
