So good I almost have to go back and lower the ratings of 5 star restaurants just to emphasize that this place isn't playing around.  Service, food, drinks, atmosphere, and location this place had it all. Being the foodies that we are my wife and I picked our hotel in Scottsdale not based on how close it was to the event we were attending but based on the surrounding restaurants. This gastropub did not let us down, we started off with the pork belly it was so tender and perfectly seasoned that I almost contemplated ordering another one for my entree. But the rest of the menu looked so appetizing and our waiter was so enthused about the rest of the food that I went with the duck and my wife went with the restaurant week prix fix menu.
