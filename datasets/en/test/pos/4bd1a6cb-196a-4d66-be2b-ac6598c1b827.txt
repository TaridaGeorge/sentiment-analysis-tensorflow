A friend and I had a delightful experience here. We ordered an avocado roll and pad thai. The avocado roll was simply to die for. It was soft and creamy - and I'm including the rice in this, too. It was an avocado roll all other avocado rolls should bow down to. It slid down the throat so deliciously gracefully, an addiction was created in one bite. 

And the pad thai we ordered with chicken instead of shrimp. Another wow moment. Sweet and savory, melting in the mouth, just the right bit of everything, and an abundant portion of it. Will definitely return for more.
