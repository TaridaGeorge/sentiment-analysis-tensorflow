Since there are soo so many long reviews for LUSH, I'll make this quick
LOVE LUSH. I'm what you'd call a "Lushie".
Bath Bombs=incredible
Face masks=indispensable (my fave is BB Seaweed)
Toners=sooo refreshing (I keep a small bottle of tea tree in my purse in the summer, a great way to freshen up without messing up your makeup)
I would not call it cheap, but it's deffinately worth the money.
Also, the sales tactics are somewhat pushy, yes, but it's so much easier to navigate the store with someone by your side! 
Ask for samples, they're generous!!
