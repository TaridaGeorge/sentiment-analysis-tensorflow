I'm not a big brand name gal, however when I heard there were great sales at Coach I had to check them out.   This last weekend there were purses on sale for 50% percent off the already reduced price.  I bought a super cute blue coach purse for $40 and I love it!!  

I better not become a "Coach snob" now!!!  haha

The store was very clean and the associates were all very friendly and helpful, especially Deb.  She gave me lots of information about different bags at Coach.  

I recommend this store to anyone who likes Coach!  It's very bright, clean, and everyone is friendly!  Happy shopping!
