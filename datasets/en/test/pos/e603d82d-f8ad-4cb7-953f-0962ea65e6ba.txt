I have to agree with Alexander- when you walk in to the Tally Ho it's like a time warp - in a warm fuzzy kind of way.
My grandparents owned an old tavern and I loved the way it smelled - I think this is one of the reasons I love the Tally Ho. 

From the outside it looks as though the place is going to be dark and seedy. It's not at all. It's bright and clean. The service is great and the drinks are cheap. 
It's a great place to have a few beers after being at the pool all day or stop in for a night cap.
Totally the Regal Beagle of Scottsdale.
