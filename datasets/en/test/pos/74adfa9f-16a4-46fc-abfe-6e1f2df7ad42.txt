Incredible. We actually were 100% fine with waiting for an hour for a chance to experience this place. It opens at 5pm and you better get there at 3:30p or 4p to ensure you get in during the first round of seating.

I have been to Italy. 5 different cities. This pizza and atmosphere were as close as I have gotten while in the states. They have a decent wine selection and an authentic cappuccino.

Not only would I recommend this place to EVERYONE I know, I will be going back OFTEN.

Worth the drive. Worth the wait. Worth the price. Worth the food.

DO IT.
