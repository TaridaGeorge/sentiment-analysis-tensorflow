Ate here with my mom, whom I was visiting.  We had a yummy, yummy breakfast.  I had an omelette with so much goodness: bacon, ham, olives, mushrooms, onions, black olives and sour cream.  Not only was everyone there polite and cheery- our waitress brought me a cup of coffee to go as we didn't finish the carafe on the table!  Loved it!
