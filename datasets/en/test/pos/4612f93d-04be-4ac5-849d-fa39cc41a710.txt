I am fairly new to town and needed a place to take my Westie for routine check-ups. I am very picky about my dog and Az Spay put my mind at ease. They treated him like a VIP! I wish some doctor's offices would treat me that good! It was a little more $$$ than what I was used to, but it was well worth it.
