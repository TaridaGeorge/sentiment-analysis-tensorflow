I have only visited the DC Ranch location of this place, but, needless to say, i love it. From the excellent coffee to the creative food to the delicious bakery to the cute decor, I love it all. The food is new american with an emphasis on fresh ingredients and local foodstuffs. Lunch and brunch are the main meals, and everything I have tried has been wonderful. My husband loves the rosemary steak sandwich and I love the corn and goat cheese flat bread. We both enjoy the sweet potato chips with curry and the chicken chili. And, no herb box trip is complete w/o a trip to the bakery, where the raspberry crumble bars are outstanding. The caramel apple bars are also wonderful and hit just the right tart-salty-sweet note.
