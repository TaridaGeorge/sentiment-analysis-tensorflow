Great place for lunch. You can't beat the price, and the food is very tasty.

For Chinese food it is pretty good.  I didn't like the place a few years ago when it tried to add sushi among other things.  Now with new owners and menu it seems to be just right.

I now go there once a week or so to enjoy the savory lunch.
