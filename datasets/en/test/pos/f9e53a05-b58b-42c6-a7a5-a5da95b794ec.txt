This place is just amazing. Good prices, consistently excellent food and friendly/helpful staff. 

First off, you pick your own salsas, whaaa!? the salsa bar - strawberry salsa! pecan salsa! cilantro salsa! so so so many to choose from and always fresh. 

My favorite burrito is the Mahi mahi specialty, but the Mole, and veggie are also a hit. 

I have been going to this restaurant since I moved out here over 1 year ago and continually recommend it.

Make sure you get a Horchata if you are in the mood for a sweet drink. It has melon, strawberries and pecans in it! Delicious and worth trying!

Now go and tell all your friends about this place.
