This is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. I wish I lived closer to it so I could go more often. And I wish the sangria wasn't so good and so strong so that I could actually come here and be able to drive myself home. All of the food is amazing. I've never had anything that wasn't and I've been here countless times. One of my favorites is the Very Berry Turkey sandwich. It is so good. And the portions are huge so I always have half to eat the next day. The red Sangria is also amazing, and again the serving size is incredibly generous. Prices are reasonable, atmosphere is great, service is always wonderful and the food is awesome! I you haven't tried this place you are missing out and I feel sorry for you.
