Very Cute and Cozy Place! 

The Food was AMAZING! 
Seriously I have been thinking about it all day and whether my diet likes it or not I'll be returning very soon! 

I got the Appetizer Platter which came with a Pupusa, a chicken meat pie, a chicken tamale and beans. (see pics) 

Everything was wonderful and fresh and oh so Delicious! 

I would have to tell anyone who has never had this kind of food, do not be intimidated, go for it you won't be sorry, my particular meal wasn't spicy or greasy it was just the best thing I have tasted in weeks and it's definitely budget friendly!
