I remember trying this place 2 years ago and I was not impressed. About a month ago I decided to give them another chance, and tried the Kung Pao Chicken, and since then I have literally been back 6-7 times. For the price it's the best Kung Pao I have ever had. The vegetables are fresh, the sauce is unique and there's plenty of peanuts, an ingredient that imo makes or breaks a good Kung Pao. Their lunch and dinner combos come with fried rice something I don't care for but their fired rice isn't bad at all.
