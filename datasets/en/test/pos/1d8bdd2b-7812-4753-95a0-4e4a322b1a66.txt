I have been to a few concerts at the Dodge and can honestly say I've enjoyed every one of them.

The theatre location is great. The design of the theatre itself is superb...as in not a bad seat in the place. Sound system is excellent. Parking across the street in the City of Phoenix building is handy. (Park, a few flights of stairs, cross street....and you're there.) (Show over....leave theatre, cross street, few flights of stairs, and you're on your way home.)

For some reason I love the huge flashing sign out front. Makes me feel like I'm actually going to 'a show'. And be sure to check out all of the rock memorabilia lining the lobby. Some great stuff to be seen if you're a music fan.

Glad there is a more intimate theatre to see nationally touring music acts than US Airways in downtown Phoenix.
