A fine dining experience or a drive-through window for fast, delicious Thai food!  Everything I've tried on the menu is delightful!  My personal favorite is the Evil Jungle Princess noodles.  The chef allows you to select "mild, medium or spicy" for your entre.  The appetizers, particularly the fried tofu, are delicious and perfect for that short wait before your main dish is served.  Most menu items are under $10.  There is virtually no wait ever for seating.  They have several wines and beers to choose from, in addition to their enormous menu.  This is *five star* dining at *two star* pricing!
