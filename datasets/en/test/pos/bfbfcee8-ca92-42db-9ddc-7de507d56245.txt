I absolutely LOVE Kiss the Cook. It is the cutest little place for breakfast and I love going here.

The quaint little restaurant is decorated with country antiques and most of them are for sale. It reminds me of a place you would find in Prescott.

I have had a few things on the menu and have always been delighted. The coffee is a little week, but then again, I start each day with a quad espresso so it may be unfair for me to judge.

While you wait for breakfast they bring out a variety of VERY tasty muffins and bread... so, so tasty!!!!

Good service and prices. No complaints from me :)
