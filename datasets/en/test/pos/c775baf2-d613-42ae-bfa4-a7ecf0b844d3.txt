Have long lamented the lack of a true independent theater in Phoenix, and we were so excited when FilmBar opened! We have been to several movies and the staff is welcoming, the drink list is long, and the price is more than reasonable. 

Please support this establishment...we need more than just AMC and Harkins here!
