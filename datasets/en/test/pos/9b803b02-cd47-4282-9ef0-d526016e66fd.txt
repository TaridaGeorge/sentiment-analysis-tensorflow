As a woman, it's scary taking my car anywhere for repairs. I was tired of dishonest mechanics overcharging for what were probably unnecessary repairs at times on my Euro car.  Found Mile Auto Repair online and was pleasantly surprised at how honest and quick they were.  They got my repair done in no time and the price was extremely fair.  I highly recommend them to family, friends, and anyone looking for a good, honest repair shop.  I will definately be a customer for life.
