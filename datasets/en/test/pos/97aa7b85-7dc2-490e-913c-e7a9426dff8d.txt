The food is great, I have tried so many different menu items I've lost track. I've also had some really great drinks, the bartenders know how to pour a nice alcoholic beverage! When corn is in season, unequivocally order the corn. Frasher's catered my Bachelorette Party, there was so much food, it was all fresh and tasty.  The owner is affable and very accommodating.  Stop by for a drink or dinner, you won't be disappointed.
