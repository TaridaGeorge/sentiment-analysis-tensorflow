Being from the midwest I always crave In-N-Out when I know I am traveling to a place where I know they exist.  This location provided the fix.  They had a fantastically clean restaurant, very friendly staff,  and the classically great food that I count on from In-N-Out.  

As always, a MAJOR recommend. Especially for people who don't live in areas served by In-N-Out.
