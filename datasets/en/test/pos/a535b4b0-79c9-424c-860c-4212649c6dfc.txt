Alright, I've only been here once, so I don't know the full depths of the exquisiteness that is FEZ. But, what I do know is that the FEZ Burger is probably the best burger I've had in my life! And I've had a lot of burgers. Something about the magical combination of ingredients they put on it...but every tastebud you have will rejoice with delight.

The hummus is very good too. As are the fries -- especially the rosemary garlic ones. And someone at our table mischievously ordered the cheesecake...wow! And again I say "wow."

Like I mentioned, I've only been here once, but I am most definitely a fan! I will most assuredly be back.
