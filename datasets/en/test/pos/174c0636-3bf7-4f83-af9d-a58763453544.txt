I love to hike Sunrise Trail, but my favorite is the backside of the mountain (to get there, you just drive all the way east on Via Linda until the road ends at the gated community). There's enough people out hiking that you don't feel completely alone out there, but I've never had trouble getting a spot in their little parking lot. (A nice departure from the craziness of Camelback and Piestewa Peak). The backside of the mountain is a shorter, but steeper hike than the other trail. There are gorgeous views of Phoenix, Scottsdale, and Fountain Hills (you can see the Fountain Hills fountain going off in the distance). This time of year is especially beautiful when the wildflowers are in bloom.
