Everyone always wants to call his/her dive bar the greatest dive bar. But my vote wins (for reasons known only to me). Bikini Lounge is truly the greatest dive I've ever been to. Pool table? Check. Cash only? Check. Filthy but comfy? Double check. Great DJ with Rock 'n' Roll music that you can't help but dance to? Oh yeah.

I had such a great time at Bikini Lounge. Cheap beer, fun atmosphere, great people and good music is what I want. Is it required to dance? Of course not, but it makes you feel good to join in. No judgment, just good times. I'll be back soon.
