This store saved me from starvation on this trip!

Before heading out to the middle of nowhere for two weeks AKA Globe/San Carlos, AZ, my colleague and I stocked up on fresh produce and other goodies like we were preparing for a natural disaster.

While filling up our cart with the basic food staples, I was stoked to find that they sell unpasteurized orange juice! If I remember correctly, it might also cost less than the unpasteurized oj at Trader Joe's.

But the real highlight of this shopping adventure, I found that they sell packets of Justin's Nut Butter for $0.79!!! http://www.justinsnutbutter.com Yay for vegan-nutella! :)

This visit makes me wonder why I don's shop at the Fresh & Easy stores in L.A.
