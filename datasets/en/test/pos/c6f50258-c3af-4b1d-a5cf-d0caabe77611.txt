I love all the homemade products at stinkin' Cute Soap Company. 

The scents are awesome!!!!  I especially love the Margarita lip balm and the Creme Brulee soap!!!!!  YUMMY!!  So much better than bath and body works!!!! 

My niece and daugther love the Raspberry Lemonade soap.  

The website is great.  

They have grat stocking stuffers and gifts.
