This is a fantastic radio station.  Wake up and listen to news on NPR; fall asleep after a long day at work listening to great jazz.  Plus, the selection of jazz the station plays is fantastic, including a nice variety of jazz vocals, which I've never really heard much on other jazz stations.  I'm not big on modern, free jazz (a la John Coltrane), but I haven't heard much of that on this station, so I'm happy -- this is definitely a 5 star radio station.
