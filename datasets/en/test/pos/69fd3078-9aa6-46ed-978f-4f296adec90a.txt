If every Fry's was like this one I'd frequent them more often.  Between the covered parking, bulk selection, and good prices I personally think they are better than the Whole Foods down the street for staple items and while their prices are higher for some of the esoterics that actually helps in my case to prevent me from buying more oils, vinegars, spices, etc that will sit in my cupboard indefinitely.  

Employees are friendly, the store itself is nearly spotless, and it is within walking distance of my current residence.  No complaints.  None at all.
