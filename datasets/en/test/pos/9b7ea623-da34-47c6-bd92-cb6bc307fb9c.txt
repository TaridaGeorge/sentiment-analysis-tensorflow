Matthew Gallegos is the best; professional, friendly, and an expert barber.  This is the best cut I have had in years.  I don't know why the $$ rating on Yelp--his prices are extremely low ($16 for a cut).  The atmosphere of his shop is great as well.  I was in town on business and I'm glad I'm coming back to Phoenix so I can get my hair cut by Matthew.  Go see him and you will not be disappointed.
