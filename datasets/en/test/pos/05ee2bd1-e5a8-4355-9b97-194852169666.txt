Not only is this place supporting all local ingredients but the wine list is 100% Arizona as well.  Pavle is brave but wise my friends.  I found the food to be creative and great tasting.  I had the chicken one night and it was finger licking good.  Chef Charleen has it going on, as well as the rest of the staff.  If your looking for a great night of food and wine try this place you won't be disappointed.  This place is quickly becoming a hot spot so call ahead for RSVP, the place only has 36 seats in it.
Cheeers,
