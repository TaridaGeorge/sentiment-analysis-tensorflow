Now this may not be for everyone, but for my wife and I, it was great. It doesn't look like anything special from the outside, but it's flair makes up for it inside. There is great art all around the hotel, to stimulate the eyes. Great personal service when we checked in. I recommend the two room suite, they have a view of the pool. The rooms feel like homey even though it is nothing like my home. The roof is a great addition, with a romantic feel, great view of the city skyline.  
This is not a jwmarriott but a great small hotel. Try it out.
