I went to Carly's today for the first time with my wife, daughter and son in-law. I was immediately struck by the downtown charm and colorful building that housed Carly's. I loved everything about this place....it was very chill. Our server was very nice and treated us with a familiarity that you would expect from a friend. The food and drinks were amazing. Carly's will definitely be one of our frequented places to eat!!
