Jolta Java is my new favorite coffeehouse. It's close to my school so I can stop in on my way there and get an awesome cup of coffee and the best breakfast sandwich around- bacon, eggs, and cheddar on a croissant. Heavenly. The homemade coffee cake is also incredibly rich and delicious. They are open early and have great staff who are friendly and fast. By my third time in, I was greeted by name.

I like the customer number system- no cards to be punched and lost- and every 10th drink is free. On Mondays you can get a free extra shot in your coffee- an awesome perk on the right day. Another thoughtful touch are the stickers they put on the lid opening to prevent spillage and loss of heat. 

Jolta, I'm so glad I found you- you have another regular, for sure!
