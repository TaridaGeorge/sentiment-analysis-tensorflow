A great breakfast and lunch spot in an unlikely location - hidden in an industrial strip. I used to work right around the corner and this is where we always took our clients and had our company lunches. The salads, sandwiches and soups are great. Everything on the menu is homemade and delicious. My favorite items on the menu are the Roast Beef Avocado Melt, Pecan Honey Dijon Salad, Cream of Spinach and Artichoke Soup, Chicken Tortilla Soup. If you're in the area, drop in.
