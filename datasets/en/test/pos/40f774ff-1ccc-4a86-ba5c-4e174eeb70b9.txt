I think I finally found a good cleaners here in Phoenix!  I have tried a lot of them and I think American Cleaners has finally gotten it right.  The prices are amazing... $2.25!  The lady who helped me in the AM was super nice and chatted with me about the Voice and American Idol.  The shirts came back to my liking!  I am coming back here for all my laundry needs and to get a couple of suits dry cleaned!  Thank you American Cleaners!
