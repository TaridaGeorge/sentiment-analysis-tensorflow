I started hearing about this place a few years ago.  However it is a bit of a drive from Glendale.  Last week I was querying some friends for an herb I needed to fill an old recipe.  One of them suggested Penzey's and after looking on line to see they carried it and knowing I was going to be in the East Valley today I made it a point to stop in.  I'm hooked!  I saw so many things that I had looked for elsewhere in the past and could never find.  This will now be the first place I head for for those items you just cannot find anywhere.
