Amazing place! Took my wife here for her birthday back in May and we sat outside under the misters which turned out to be a very pleasant place to sit. I had been a little worried that it'd be too hot. The staff is very nice and fairly quick to respond, I don't think my water glass was empty for too long. We had a few nicely mixed cocktails and ended up never making it past their amazing appetizers.  I think we ordered most of them on the menu and enjoyed them all.
