I've been getting manicures and pedicures for years with Suzanne - The Nail Goddess. She truly lives up to that name and does a flawless job every time. Suzanne is fastidious and takes her time to make sure every nail turns out perfectly. Her technique also helps nail color last weeks, which I really appreciate. I'm Suzanne's loyal customer for life!
