This place deserves all the 5 star reviews is it has.

Esther, the server, was excellent. Timely, friendly, she knows the food, and made great suggestions. We tired the pofpofs, meat pies, yassa, curried chicken, and fufu. Everything was very, very delicious. The meat pies, and yassa where my favorite. Very good quality food, especially for the price.  

If you are not scared to try new things, put a leg out there, this place is for you. But even if you are a more conservative person, try it, the best things in life are always unexpected.
