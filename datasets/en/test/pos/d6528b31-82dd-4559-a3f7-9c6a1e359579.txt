This is my favorite place to catch a show hands down.  The outdoor venue is the pinnacle of why I moved to Arizona.  The soft grass, great sound, and excellent bands mesh together like a mini Edge Fest.  The only thing I could do without would be the Festival Prices of the drinks.  Mesa Amp gets great bands, and I can't wait to see another show there soon.
