Had to drag my niece from Ohio to my fave cupcake place.  She normally does not like frosting, but she inhaled the frost off the cupcake at Sprinkles.  LOL!  She loved the milk chocolate one.  We got 6 (all chocolate) for us.  We shared the other 4 with her brother, grandma, and uncle.  My nephew loved it so much, he inhaled a second one.

Chocolate marshmallow - new flavor for me - OMG, hello happiness!
