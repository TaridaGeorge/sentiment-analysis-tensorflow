Best brewery in Arizona. Period. End of story. 

Great bar food, absolutely awesome beers. My favorites are the oatmeal stout (my winter time pick), SunBru (summer time), and Kiltlifter (year round), and hefeweizen (year round). On the food side, the chicken rolls are my favorite.

Don't miss out on this gem. Beer is supposed to have flavor! Put the beer flavored water down and get to Four Peaks!!
