i was a HUGE fan of this place when i was at ASU!  very hearty portions, a of meat too.  usually makes for 2 meals.  oh, and cheap!

the owners are super friendly and remember their regulars.

i believe they are linked too the japanese market over in the corner of the same shopping center... which is also a GREAT place.
