I have taken my children ages 10 and 1 to Dr. Gina Montion at Pediatrix since they were born and I can't express how wonderful she is!! We never wait more than a few minutes and Dr. Montion ALWAYS takes her time with my children. My son has ADHD and can talk your ear off, but Dr. Montion listens to his every word and not only does she explain things to us, but she takes the time to explain things to my son that are helpful to him. She always follows up with us and is truly an excellent doctor. We live about 35 minutes away, but we wouldn't dream of switching to a doctor who is closer to our house!! If you are looking for a truly amazing and genuinely caring pediatrician, Dr. Gina Montion at Pediatrix is who you HAVE to take your children!! She's THE BEST!!
