I work nearby and come here multiple times a week for lunch. I love the freshly-sliced meat and my sandwich is ALWAYS tasty (I get turkey or ham with provolone on wheat).

All of the employees there know me by now and are ALWAYS friendly, fun, and helpful. Couldn't say enough good things about them!

May not be gourmet but it's fast and easy, close-by, healthier than all the surrounding fast food, and a nice environment. I will definitely keep coming back!
