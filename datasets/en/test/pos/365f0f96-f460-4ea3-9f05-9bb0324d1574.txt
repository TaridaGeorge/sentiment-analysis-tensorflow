This is the best Mexican market I've been to in Arizona. It's enormous...like a Costco decorated with colorful hand-painted wooden signs everywhere you turn. Unfortunately, like Costco, it can also be packed. Granted, this location is new and attracting a crowd with some of its specials, but I have a feeling that the number of customers won't wane too much any time soon. Not only are the prices super-competetive for any and every Mexican food product you could desire, there's a fabulous fresh foods section. This includes a juice stand, a yogurt stand, a salsa bar, a carnitas/pollo rostizado/costillas section, a guisados and platos combinatos line, tacos and of course freshly made warm tortillas. Plus outdoor grilling. Pretty much like Mexico, except cleaner and they accept credit cards for anything. :) It's heavenly.
