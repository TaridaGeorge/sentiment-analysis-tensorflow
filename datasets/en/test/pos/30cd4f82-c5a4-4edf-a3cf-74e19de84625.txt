When I moved to Phoenix from Chicago, I honestly shed a little tear at the loss of my beloved Starfruit.  I didn't think my addiction to frozen treats would ever be completely satisfied again.  Enter Mojo. 

 For the same reason other people bitch about this place, is the reason I love it.  Tart, icy consistency, and not overly sweet.  Until recently I had only had the fruit flavors, but since these days I can't seem to keep chocolate out of my hands, I decided to try a sweet flavor. Choco-berry and birthday cake.  Ohmigod.  I didn't even need the toppings.  The deliciousness  spoke for itself.  I finished it in approximately 37 seconds, and immediately wished I had gotten the gigantor size.  

As a matter of fact, my impending real estate purchase is suspiciously close to this Mojo location. Hmmm...coincidence?  Nope.  Just obsessed.
