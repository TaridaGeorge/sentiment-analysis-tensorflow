I LOVE LOVE LOVE to eat here!  

I never had an InO burger til I was a student at UCI in 1991.  From that point on, I was hooked.  In 04 I moved east and every time I'm near an InO, I have to stop!  

I got off the plane yesterday and asked the rental car lady how to get to the closest one.  I'd been once before but couldn't remember the directions.  My partner and I jumped in the car and zoomed over.  We were on a mission.

As soon as I walked in and smelled the burger grease, I knew I was home.  I showed some restraint in only ordering the cheeseburger combo (I normally get the double double).  I inhaled my food and left.  

I'm plotting as to which day I'll be returning this week--and I will get that double double.  

YUM!
