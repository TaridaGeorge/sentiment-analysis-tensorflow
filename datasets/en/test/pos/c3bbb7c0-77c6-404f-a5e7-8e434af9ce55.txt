So I have this terrible addiction. Every time I go anywhere near downtown, I have to go to Zoe's. 
I LOVE their limeade and have often wished I could just order the whole pitcher and leave the place with it. 
I'm a big fan of the chicken pita with loads of Feta, caramelized onions and chicken. 
I know I should probably branch out and try something new, but nothing beats the limeade and chicken pita with pasta salad. 
Oh, and don't even get me started on the chocolate cake!
