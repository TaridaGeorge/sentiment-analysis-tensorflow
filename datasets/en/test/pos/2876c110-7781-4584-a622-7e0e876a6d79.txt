We are big Thai Rama fans... from the Thai BBQ Chicken to their several varieties of curries to their wonderful Pahd See Ew, Thai Rama offers outstanding food at excellent prices. On top of it all, the friendly staff makes sure everyone enjoys not just their meals but their visit, as well. It's not only a regular place we visit, but a "must do" place we take family and friends when they are visiting in town.
