LOVE this place.  The shopping and the food and the outdoors of it all make this place worth it.  The shops are upscale and well maintained and serviced and the staff is wonderful and I visit many of the stores on many different times/days weekend or weekday and it just doesn't get better.

The food is also top notch. Some Fox Concept restaurants like North and some chain like Cheesecake Factory or P.F. Changs there is a great variety in food and in price ranges as well.

Walk around, enjoy the scenery and shopping and it will be a wonderful day at Kierland.
