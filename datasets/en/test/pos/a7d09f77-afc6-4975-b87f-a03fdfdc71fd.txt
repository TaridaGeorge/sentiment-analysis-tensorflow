As someone with no children, I haven't been in many baby stores.  A friend was registered here, so I headed in to get her some gifts.  It was easy to find the registry and someone was right there to print it out for me.  The store is clearly organized, and seems to offer something for all price points.  I was able to find most of what I was looking for, and then had someone quickly help me find everything else.

What took this experience over the top was the fact that they have FREE GIFT WRAPPING!  Sure, you have to do it yourself, but still!  There are two tables with supplies like boxes, tissue paper, scissors, etc.  LOVE THAT!  

I think I may have to return when I have that bun in the oven myself!
