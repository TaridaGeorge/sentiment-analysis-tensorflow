I have been a patient of Dr Fry's for 3 years now. I love having a doctor who actually listens to what I am trying to tell him about my health instead of being a "know-it-all" and blowing me off. 
Because of him, I am alive today because he caught what all of the other doctors "who knew better" did not.
