So good it makes you want to raise a dog of your own just to have the off chance of having it named after a new featured dog of the week recipe. I had one of their dogs for lunch the drove across to valley to have another for dinner. Calling these culinary concoctions gourmet doesn't begin to describe the goodness found in every single bite.
