Surprisingly helpful staff on Black Friday... Didn't think it was possible! They helped me order the products that were already out of stock by the time I got there, and they took off the mail-in rebate on site! 

Went to pick up the products today, and the customer service was wonderful again. Gotta love good retail staff!!!!
