I called about 2 weeks before our 1 year anniversary, regarding the top tier of our cake. Kevin said no problem & that we could pick it up Saturday, our anniversary was on Sunday & they're closed. We couldn't decide which flavor to chose so I told him to pick it for us. I also asked if it could just be covered in buttercream instead of fondant.

The top tier looked so cute! They chose the white cake infused with almond flavor with almond cream cheese & strawberry fillings & it was AMAZING! The random dots of fondant were a nice touch & the cake was so moist & delicious. Can't wait to get our 5th anniversary top tier!
