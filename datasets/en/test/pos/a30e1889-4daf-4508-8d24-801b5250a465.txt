Here's your plan:

1. Park in the lot, valet is easy to drop off, but such a pain to pick up.
2. Order a Petron Marg from the bar, it'll be $15 but look around, enjoy.
3. Take those few sips so you don't spill.
4. Walk the grounds, if the fence is closed, no matter, just pop it open, you won't be the only explorer in the late hours of the evening.
5. Wander around the pools, enjoy, sip your drink, enjoy your company.
6. Post wander, lurk around the couches that lead from the bar to the pool area until you pick one up.
7. Order some more drinks.
