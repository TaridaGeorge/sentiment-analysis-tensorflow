Walked into a few Bridal Stores but didn't try on anything because the selection was either too overwhelming or the staff was very pushy. 

Carrie was so helpful and sweet. I never felt pressured and loved their selection of dresses. Very organized and clean.It might be more on the pricier side but it is well worth it for the dress you will get.

I absolutely love my dress! This place gets a 10 out of 10 in my book!
