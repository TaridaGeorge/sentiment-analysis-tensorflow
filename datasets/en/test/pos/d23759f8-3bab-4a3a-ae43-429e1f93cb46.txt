A really fun place to go hang out and have a few drinks. I went last night with some friends and we had a blast! It is really cool inside since it is a Tiki hut! The food was really good: I had some potstickers, macaroni, and chicken wings with plenty to go around and great to share. Also the sweet potato fries are really good too. I would definitely recommend this place!
