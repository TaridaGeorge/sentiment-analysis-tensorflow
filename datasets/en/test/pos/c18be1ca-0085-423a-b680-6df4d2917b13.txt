I buy all of my work and evening clothes at Nordstrom Rack. Here's why: convenient location (Frank Lloyd Wright/Scottsdale), great selection, and AWESOME prices.

They have everything you need at great prices: shoes, suits, dress shirts, ties, casual shirts, jeans, and underclothes. There is a limited selection of watches in the front by the cash registers. 

The store is organized pretty well and the selection is great. The difference between this place and a Marshall's would be the quality of the products. This is nice stuff.
