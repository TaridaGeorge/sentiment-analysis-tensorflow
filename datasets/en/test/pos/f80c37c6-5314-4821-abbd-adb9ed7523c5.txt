I love sushi. I love Sakana. First off, their sushi is typically on point. I've only ever had one item I disliked and that's the seabass. Not a fan. One item that's a must have is their house smoked salmon nigiri. Holy effing awesome. I always want to eat like a dozen orders of that stuff. 

The best reason of all for Sakana though, is that they are open on Sundays and have a happy hour. For some reason I am always craving sushi on Sundays and there is a huge lack of good places open. Sakana saved me and I will return the favor by telling of its awesome.
