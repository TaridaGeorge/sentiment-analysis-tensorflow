I LOVE this place!!! We found it about two weeks ago and have been there about seven times already. I love getting the daily entree/lavosh pizza on facebook (wish it was posted earlier in the day) and heading in for dinner. I've never been there for morning, only dinner but I love their 1/2 priced wine nights (Mon and Tues) but the best deal is Wednesday for their $20 wine and bruschetta deal. SO worth it! I love the vibe. It is definitely not a place to go for a quick dinner which is actually perfect for us as we like to take our time to enjoy our food and enjoy the ambiance. I simply adore this place and will miss Jen when she makes her move.
