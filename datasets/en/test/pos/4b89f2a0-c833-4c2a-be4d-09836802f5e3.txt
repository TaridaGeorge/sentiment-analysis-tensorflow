Sauce is great. The pizza are perfect for lunch. They come in one size with a few topping combinations ranging from traditional (pepperoni/mushroom) to original (proscuetto/melon). They offer solid salads and paninis, but missing out on the pizza is a mistake.

Prices range from $8-12. Seating is sometimes tight.
