As a local resident, I am always excited when new non-chain restaurants/bars arrive in our neighborhood.  BLD does not disappoint.  Their bartenders are friendly and quick.  The beer selections are always good.  Their patio is very nice (although it could use a TV perhaps) and the inside of the restaurant is very comfortable.

Their everyday twists on bruschetta are always unique and delicious.  Oh, and the chicken and waffles are to DIE for!!
