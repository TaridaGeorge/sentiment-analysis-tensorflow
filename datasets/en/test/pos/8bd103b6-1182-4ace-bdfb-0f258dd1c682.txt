Joe's NY Pizza is a good place to get some real NY pizza:


During a lunch break at work I stopped by to grab a slice to try it out. Iv'e heard much about the "best pizza around" so i figured it was worth a shot. 

You walk into a small room which has the ever magical mirror wall to make rooms appear larger. I was surprised it had an open kitchen, which is always good that you can watch the process. 

I Got one slice of the Margarita pizza, (olive oil, basil, and tomatoes) it was damn good! The crust was thin but had a bit of a crunch to it which is rare for Az pizza. The kind I chose wasn't too greasy but I cant speak for the pepperoni or sausage pizzas.
