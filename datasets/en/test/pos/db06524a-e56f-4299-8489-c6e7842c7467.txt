If you ever decide to try Roy's, I would encourage you to dine at the bar. The bartenders are attentive, experienced, and very friendly and it is quite a different experience from the dining room... much more relaxed and fun! The last time I dined there, the bartender began by shaking my hand and introducing himself, asking me my name as well which he used throughout the entire meal. He even made me a few new drinks that he had invented himself and didn't charge me for either of them. The food was amazing and the dessert... even better!!! The design was modern but felt comfortable, and the ambiance was lovely and very clean. I only wish I could afford to eat there on a weekly basis!!!
