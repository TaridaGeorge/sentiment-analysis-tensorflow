Another fun wine tasting in the books! The fella that hosted the Arizona Strongold wine tasting was awesome and we want to thank Todd for selecting some fantastic cheeses for us. The tapas plate was pork belly and blue cheese stuffed dates....incredible!  If you haven't tried a wine tasting here yet, put it n your to do list!
