I've trained with Chrissy for over a year, both one on one at home and in her group fitness classes at the studio.  She is innovative and keeps the workouts upbeat, challenging and I end up sweating more than I  thought I could. 

And when you want a real challenge, keep your eyes open for one of her upcoming 4 hour challenges.  They are my tests to see how much I have improved in strength, endurance and flexibility.

There is something in her program for everyone - including YOU!!!!
