A little bit out of the way, but this is definitely worth it. Their personal pizzas are available with thin or thick crust, but both are excellent, and priced right, starting at around 5 bucks. I'd go with the Spicy Italian, or maybe the Get Meaty, with 4 different meats.

For dessert, both the good old cannoli and the apple serenata with vanilla bean gelato are very good ways to end a great meal.

Service is always fast and friendly, and the place just seems very inviting.

The hours are a little weird, so check that out before going - it's caught me off guard more than once.
