The oatmeal cookie yogurt is out of this world!!! I also tried the cake batter, chocolate and peanut butter flavors (since it's self-serve) which were all pretty good. They have around 50 toppings to choose from, from fresh fruit to chocolate covered cherries. The chunks of candy bar are huge, instead of like some places where the candy bar is almost powdered.
