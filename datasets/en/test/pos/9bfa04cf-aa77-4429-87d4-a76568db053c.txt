Wow-A-Palooza!  Talk about a metamorphosis!   Jeff, you had the greatest coffee joint in Phoenix... now after this move/renovation you may have the coolest joint in the country.  Talk about hip, cool, and perhaps the warmest most comfortable place to hang out.  Nooks and crannies, little rooms, sections, all with their own vibe, feel and energy.  You have completely outdone yourself and everyone else man!

If you are someone who either has never been to Lux or haven't been in a long while, then you MUST GO (and go again and again and again to take it all in).  

And oh, by the way... besides the comfortable atmosphere, both the coffee and food is over the top.  Katie (the chef), you're talents, passion and energy are appreciated by so many.
