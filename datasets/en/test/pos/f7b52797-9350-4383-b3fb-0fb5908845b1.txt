Every single time I walk into this place it's as if they Angels sing!  Make up? Yes please! Fragrance? Yes Please...give me more!  It's all there...in one place! Primers! Lip Stains! Mascara! Liners and brushes! It's like crack for me.  Hi.  My name is Ella and I'm an addict...

The gals and guys here are very helpful when I'm searching for a new mascara or fragrance.  

I truly appreciate the fact that they will give you samples of any fragrance to take home and try it before you buy it.  This lets me weed out the granny smelling scents from the ones I know will "bring the boys to the yard..."

Make up consultations are always helpful too!  They won't make you look like a triflin' porn star either...I mean, unless that's what you want!
