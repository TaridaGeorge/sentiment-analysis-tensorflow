OMG I found the best and huge pizza in town.

It is 18" cheese pizza with red peppers and mushroom. I got 50% off coupon so I tried the back door pizza. The pizza tastes so gooddddd with lot and lot of different kinds of cheeses. The red peppers and mushroom were so fresh and not too dry or too over cook from the oven. The owner is so nice and tease me that he thought that I got lost since I did not show up within 25 minutes.

I had dinner with Aiello's before but their pizza is the best. I'd definite call them to place some orders again.
