I love this place they do the best job, I even drive 45 min because I moved and they are worth it! I'm always happy with the results. My nails don't lift or chip. I have also had a facial their and it was amazing. It was my first facial however I was happy and it wasn't expensive. I would recommend this place to anyone. Just bring cash for your tip, they do take cards but not for tips.
