They have machines that work really well on my clothes, even when I come in with 15 loads of laundry.  (They have multi-load machines.)  The dryers are super fast at drying, and my clothes are practically pressed when they come out.  Free Wi-Fi and television are available.  They also have a friendly staff who told me about several deals they have going right now.  I did 15 loads of laundry last night for under $20.  Nice!
