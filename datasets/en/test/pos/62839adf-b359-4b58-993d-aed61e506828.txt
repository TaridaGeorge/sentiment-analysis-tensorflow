For Chinese food, THIS PLACE IS THE BOMB! It's not a fast food greasy take out joint!!! This is a little cozy spot, very low key but Oh man let me tell you the food is great! My kids get the beef broccoli and usually I'll get the sun devil chicken or the orange chicken with steamed rice, It's not over breaded and the meat is all white no skin! Soooooooooooooo yummy! Prices are super good too, very inexpensive meal! I promise! Abacus you rock!
