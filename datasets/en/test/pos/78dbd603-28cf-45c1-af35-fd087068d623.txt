Have I lost my mind? Did I really order a brisket salad.....in....a gas station? YES! And did it completely blow my mind? YES! The Campfire Bistro is the dining portion of Tom's Thumb Fresh Market. And it is unbelievable. You can come here for breakfast (yes, they serve brisket at 7:30 am), lunch or dinner. The old gas station had closed down and a very enterprising man opened the new and vastly improved full service gas station, food counter and gourmet market. They have fresh and delicious baked goods and a (mostly) full coffee shop. It was a real treat to come in and experience the wonder that a gas station can offer. In fact, I would say that you should come here for the food, and get your car filled up with gas while you're at it, instead of the other way around.
