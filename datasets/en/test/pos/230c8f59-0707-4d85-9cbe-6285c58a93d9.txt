I will drive to this Fry's every chance I get!  This is the Grand Daddy of all Fry's stores!  YES!  It's got covered or valet parking, they'll bring your groceries out to you curbside, they'll even get your car washed while you shop!

The bakery is to die for but unfortunately they make nothing gluten free.  They have whole bars of ready made dinner type items.  The olive bar is massive as are is the sitting area near Starbucks.  Leather and massive yummy chairs.  I jokingly said to my Mom that I might start hanging out there all day with my laptop.  Seriously.  Seriously that nice.

The whole store has wide aisles, massive choice and excellent customer service.  Gourmet chocolate, why yes.  Organic section?  YES.  A jewelry store, bank and a huge area of home accessories and furniture items.  Clean, well lit, flowers, odd fruits, cooking classes.  That too!
