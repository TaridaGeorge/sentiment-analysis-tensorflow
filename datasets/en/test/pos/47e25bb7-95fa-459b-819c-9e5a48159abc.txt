Great sports grill! Huge menu with great food! They have  indoor and outdoor seating, tons of televisions to watch games, video poker, and great drink specials!

They also have karaoke on Saturday nights---this can be a good...or a bad thing!

I would highly recommend Santisi for large parties or happy hour get togethers--they have tons of space and can accommodate large parties easily!
