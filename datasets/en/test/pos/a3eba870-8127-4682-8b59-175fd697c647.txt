I visited this unique little flower shop recently and was so impressed. The minute I walked in the door I could tell this was my kind of flower shop. It was clean, welcoming and the staff was so friendly and helpful.

This flower shop not only has great floral arrangements, it has really unique items for a special events, decorating or for gift giving! 

I'll be back time and time again!
