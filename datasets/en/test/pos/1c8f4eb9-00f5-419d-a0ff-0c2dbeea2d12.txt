We took our two Aussies, Colby and Sweet Pea, to get groomed here yesterday and we couldn't be happier.  We received a great service and saved over $30.  We USED to go to PetSmart and we have now found a better place.  We recommend  everyone who has a dog to take it down to this establishment and get great service.
