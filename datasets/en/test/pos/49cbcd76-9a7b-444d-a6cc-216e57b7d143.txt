This is a dentist office that knows its clientele.  There is a large door for adults and a small door for the kids to enter.  The fast ipad registration is great to get the appointment started and be on your way.  The play tower and video games are also a bonus.  We have never waited more than 5-10 minutes to be in the chair and having a cleaning.  The dental assistants are kind, gentle, and extremely tolerant.   Kudos to Dr. Tim and his enthusiasm for Halloween!
