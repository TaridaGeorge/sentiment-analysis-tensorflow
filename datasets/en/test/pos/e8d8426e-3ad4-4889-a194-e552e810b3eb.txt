THE place to go in Scottsdale to find people who aren't out to be seen.  This place is 1500 square feet and it s always packed on the weekends. The house band plays Thurs, Fri and Sat and with no cover charge at the door, this is one smokin' deal.  Only warning is stay with bottle beer--the mixed drinks are more mix than drink.
