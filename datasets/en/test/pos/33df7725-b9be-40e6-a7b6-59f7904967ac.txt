Get here early if you want to grab seats and table...otherwise, after 9 or 10, the place is jam packed. The place is really rowdy and loud and the crowd and piano players get really into the music. I love that they play all kinds of music from Journey to TI... LOL! The only thing is towards the end of the night, they tend to recycle some of the same songs. But I guess those are what everyone requests.
