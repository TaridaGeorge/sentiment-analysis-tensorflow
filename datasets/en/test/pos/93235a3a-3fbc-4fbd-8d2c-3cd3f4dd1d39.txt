I have been going to baseball games & events at BOB aka Chase now  since 1998. The park is pricey for it's beer to the point of crazy town but all parks have you there just like my beloved Disneyland so you pay my friend. My experience hasn't been bad yet.. knock on wood. I have had great luck at the park with my nose bleed seats to the Owners suite I was in last Monday for an event. The food is good, the food service fast, the stands staff always helpful. I think this park has it's game on every night no matter what the event. YAY Chase!
