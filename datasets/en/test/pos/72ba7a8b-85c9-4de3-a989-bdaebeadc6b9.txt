Barbara Hoose, MSN FNP-C, is by far the BEST nurse practitioner on the planet, and her staff (Jessily and Angela) is beyond awesome. I stumbled across this amazing practice purely by chance a few years ago when I lived in Queen Creek. I have since moved about 40 minutes away, but continue to make the drive because I am so impressed by the high quality of care and service.

Barbara is the most thorough and supportive FNP I have ever met... she is extremely easy to talk to, and is very upfront and honest when it comes to answering medical questions. She has helped guide me through multiple ailments by setting me on the right track, and I honestly believe she is a lifesaver.

If you are looking for true individualized, personalized care.... try Copper Basin Family Medicine. :)
