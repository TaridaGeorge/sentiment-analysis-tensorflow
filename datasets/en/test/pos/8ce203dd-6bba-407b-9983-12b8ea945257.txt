This place is awesome... it makes me forget that I'm in Phoenix sometimes.  While I can't review the whole menu, I know their yogurt, orange juice, and coffee is awesome!  Service is usually really good and friendly, and the fact that you see a lot of the same people there a lot means that they're probably keeping more than just me happy.

Check it out next time you're in the area... driving, cycling, or walking.
