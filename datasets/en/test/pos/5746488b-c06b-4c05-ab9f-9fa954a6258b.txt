Having this place right down the road is going to be a sincere issue...

I had to update, because we have now tried additional flavors and they have all been amazing! I had the famed Canadian Maple Bacon and it did not disappoint. The bacon's texture was a LITTLE off, but the overall cupcake made up for it. The frosting on this one is divineee. Also had the Wedding Cake - perfect, light, vanilla-y amazingness, the coconut macaroon (need I even say more? YUM!), and the grasshopper (not a huge mint fan, but this was also awesome!). I am officially addicted to this place...dammit!
