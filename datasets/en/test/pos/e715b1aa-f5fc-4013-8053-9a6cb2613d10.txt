I have been eating at this family-owned restaurant my entire life.  My sister once said that if I'm ever missing, she'll just go to Burrito Co. and wait for me to show up!  I love it that much.  Although the dining area is occasionally messy, the food is solid.  The shredded beef taco and all of the burritos are delicious. I do miss their previous location with the covered patio, as the new place is less quaint.  Oh well, the new place is bigger and they've managed to personalize it a bit.
