I was working in Phoenix for a month and really wish I had found this place sooner. By far the best pizza I have had in a really long time. Good prices, relaxed atmosphere and good food. What more could you ask for. The owners made sure to greet us and came out to the table to check on everything. I would highly recommend this place to anyone in the Phoenix area looking for some great NY style pizza!
