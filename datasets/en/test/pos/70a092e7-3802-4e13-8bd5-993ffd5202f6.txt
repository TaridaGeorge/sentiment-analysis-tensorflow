Holy crap this place is good! I can't believe I've driven past it 89 times and went, "Meh, not just yet."

The people working there are super friendly, and you can tell they have a lot of regulars. The decor is spotless and tasteful.

The food. Mmm boy. Yes they have most of the "typical" food found at a Chinese restaurant, but guess what? It doesn't taste like they got it frozen off the back of a Chinese delivery truck like at other places. Really fresh, nicely prepared and presented, and delicious. I've ordered kung pow chicken at probably in the neighborhood of 50 restaurants, and this was easily the best. They also have specials written on the wall that look like unique and delicious creations, like spicy eggplant with prawns. I went with my standby meal to start, but I'll surely try something new next time.
