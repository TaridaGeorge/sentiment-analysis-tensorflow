Excellent food and service!!!  We make a point to visit this restaurant at least once a week.  I always order the Famous chicken salad or the French dip but my husband orders many different things on the menu and they are all wonderful.  Dessert is a must!!!  The White chocolate bread pudding is the best bread pudding I have ever had!  The white chocolate brownie is very rich and tasty.  The cheesecake is by far the best cheesecake in the valley.  The only thing I can complain about is they use to serve a coconut cream pie as a special desert and we have not been able to get this is a very long time.
