Dr. Rusicks office has a soothing, relaxing atmosphere.
I have been treated in his office for last 4 years. I have been very pleased with his office staff. My children see Dr. Rusick as well, he is great with children.  I went in just this morning with pain in my right shoulder and feel a lot better now.  He truly cares for his patience well being. Thank you Rusick Chiropractic!
