Delicious! The shaken beef and curry are to die for! This is the only place around that I have found true spring rolls. If you don't know what one is have the shrimp and pork  spring roll in rice paper and you will be a fan. Plan on being here awhile in the weekends as it's busy and service is a bit slow, but the food makes up for the service!
