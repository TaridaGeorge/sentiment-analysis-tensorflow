Very delicious.  My gf and I had the prime rib and rotisserie chicken.  Both awesome meals in the taste department.  Food arrived lightning fast.  Server Allie was awesome.  Very attentive and never overbearing.  Red velvet cake for dessert.  Everything perfect!  I have nothing bad to say about this place.  It's a winner all around.
