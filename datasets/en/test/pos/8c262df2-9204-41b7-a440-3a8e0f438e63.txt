Quality always-being-tweaked menu, attentive staff and hands on management.  Upscale yet still reasonably priced - and friendly !

Gorgeous rib eyes, best Veal dish ever (chef's special - not on menu yet) and my favorite burger in the state (on-premises hand ground best-of-class beef).  Yup it's true.  Beats even the excellent Blu Burger, and Zinc Bistro offering.  Fresh made buns, large single fried onion, thick, tasty, juicy - just perfect.

Haven't tried it yet, but going back for their new Sea Bass FIsh n Chips.  Heard rave reviews from other guests over it.

Excellent views across the FH lake to the "world famous" ;-) fountain - bound to go off at least once during your meal - even lit up at night.

Will extend this review with more time and visits - but it's a nice change of pace and just a couple of minutes off of Shea.
