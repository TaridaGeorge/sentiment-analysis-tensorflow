Durants, you are truly amazing. When I come to dine, I want to be my best-dressed, wittiest self I can be, because dining at Durants is an event deserving of the best. Be on your A-game because Durants is all A game.  First, coming through the kitchen never gets old, no getting around it, you feel like you're part of a very cool club and the vibe just continues as you approach the hostess. Every time, she always acts like she had been waiting for me and my party all night. Then there is the decor.  It's better in person just go see it. Finally, the best thing about Durants is the food. The sides of spinach, potatoes are incredible but the steaks are what makes Durants so amazing. Truly incredible. Channel your inner Marilyn, grab your best man an have a meal that sends you to the moon.
