The Hero is on the top ten list of the best sandwiches I have ever had.  The meat is cut deli-thin and is excellent quality (not Subway gross meat).  The bread is fresh and warm and perfect!  There is some kind of mustard sauce that is always just the right amount, and it all comes together to be DEEE-licious.
Also delicious is the meatball sub. The bread and all ingredients are FRESH and so good!
Fun drink machine, the staff is friendly, so what's not to like? ((The only sandwich I didn't love so far is the new summer Hawaiian pork thing. It had too many fatty pieces, the cold slaw wasn't so great, and the whole thing made me miss the tasty Hero.))
