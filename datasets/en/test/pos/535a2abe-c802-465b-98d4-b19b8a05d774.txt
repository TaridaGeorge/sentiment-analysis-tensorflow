What an atmosphere! The house is beautiful and the surrounding garden is the perfect backdrop if not the focal point. I ate the brisket sandwich and sweet potato, chips? I am not sure what they are called but I couldn't get enough. Everyone at our table wanted a second taste. When I am back in town I will definately visit to get my fix of your sweet potato crack, I mean chips. Thank you for a wonderful culinary experience.
