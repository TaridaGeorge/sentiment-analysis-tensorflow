We showed up after they stopped serving breakfast but they said we could order off the breakfast menu anyways. Off to a good start! The hard part was deciding what to order. I asked the waiter to lead me in the right direction and he said his favorite was the white flannel. I am a huge fan of corned beef so I ordered that and topped it off with some cheese. My other dining companions ordered monkey cakes and a garlic mushroom omelet. I had a bite of the monkey cakes and they were ok no big deal but the garlic mushroom omelet was awesome. My corned beef has was perfect and I ate all of it! I was really impressed with this restaurant. Orange Table is my new obsession!
