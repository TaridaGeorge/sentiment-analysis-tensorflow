This place is great for getting a decent priced sandwich and not walking away hungry.  Sometimes I get a half sandwich and the Wisconsin cheese soup in a bread bowl, which is really good.  I've tried just about every sandwich they have and they have all been great.  The bread is soft and fresh.  It's definitely worth a stop if you're in the area.
