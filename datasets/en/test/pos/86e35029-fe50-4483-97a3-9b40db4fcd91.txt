This place was the highlight of  our 4th of July 2010 San Francisco to Tucson (and back) road trip. Let me tell you that the promise of DD coffee an hour into the drive is the ONLY thing that will get the bf up at the crack of dawn. God bless Dunkin' for it's reliable cup o' joe and good old fashioned donuts! Wish you were in California.
