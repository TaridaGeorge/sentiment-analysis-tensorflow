My wife and I had lunch at Pars. Ate on the patio which is very nice and private. We shared the Hummas for a starter which was very good. The pita served was delicious. This was followed by a very large entre. I had the salmon with a salad and rice and my wife had a chicken meal. They both were delicious and far more than we needed to fill us up.

The server was excellent. We eat slowly and we were not rushed at all. We found this jem on Yelp and we will certainly be returning.
