This is absolutely the best place to go for a tasty and cheap Middle Eastern lunch. Its lemonade is to die for, and its falafel is my favorite. Afterward, I always like to check out the market, and buy an exotic sweet. Its low prices, casual vibe, and proximity to campus make it a favorite of the ASU community. 

Tip: Buy a bottle of rose water and add a capful or two to your homemade lemonade. Mmm-mm.
