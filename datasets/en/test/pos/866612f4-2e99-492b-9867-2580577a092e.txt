Salon Izzy is such a warm and wonderful salon!  Darci is the absolute best stylist that I have ever had do my hair.  I have followed her to Salon Izzy, which is so much nicer than the uptight and overpriced salon that she left.

Darci is a master at her craft and she is so affordable!  She listens to what I want, shows me what's possible and then makes it happen.  I have the curliest hair of anyone that I know, and Darci makes it look great, whether it's straight and sleek or curly and fun!  She has a warm and loving personality and I would follow Darci anywhere!  She is truly a magician!

I am Mark's wife, but she does just as great of a job on his hair as she does on mine!
