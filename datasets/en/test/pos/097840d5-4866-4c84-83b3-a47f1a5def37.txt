The next two reviewers obviously either, A) Have never actually eaten at Red Tomato, or B) Are ex-employees fired for incompetence and/or lost a wrongful termination case.

To be blunt, the pizza at Red Tomato is one of the Top 5 in the Valley. And not that that organic, paper thin Bianco %$#@ that gets great reviews for absolutely no reason whatsoever. This is the real deal for people that LOVE pizza. Fresh ingredients, piled high and cooked to perfection in casual, hip surroundings by people that truly care about your dining experience.

In short, you could take a number and wait 45 minutes just to order a joke at Pizzeria Bianco - or - go to Red Tomato for an orgasmic experience for less money in half the time. You'll thank me later. Go.
