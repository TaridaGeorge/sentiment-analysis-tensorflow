I went in a group on a Friday night once and it was still pretty decent. Lunch is slow on weekdays and the alcohol menu is full of options. I keep coming back for the Green Turkey sandwich. The staff rushed us once, but other than that they're all nice and quick to provide refills and answer questions about the beers. I keep coming back for more and highly recommend others to do so as well.
