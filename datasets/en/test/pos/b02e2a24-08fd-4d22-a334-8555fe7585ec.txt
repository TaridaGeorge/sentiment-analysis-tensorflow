I just opened an account at this bank after many years of banking with one of the national large chain banks. MidFirst reminds of the local community bank your parents banked at where customer service is key and the needs of the customer are a priority. 

The product offering is highly competitive and I earn a very competitive rate on my checking account compared to other banks that require a significant amount on deposit. Additionally, I can use my ATM card anywhere without incurring fees.
