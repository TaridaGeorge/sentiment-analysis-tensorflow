I have never ordered something, I did not like!!!!!

There soups, sanwiches, bread, bagels, sweet treats, and salads are GrEaT!!!! If you arrive at 3 or later, you can order some awesome pasta. I suggest the butternut squash rav., it is a bowel of creamy goodness.

The place is clean & the staff is friendly. It is also a great place to study or do work. They have free WiFi. Now that the weather is cooling down they have some outside tables to sit and enjoy your yummy food.
