After seeing good reviews on Yelp for Biagio, I decided to try it out this morning.  I did the mani/pedi combo with a shellac french manicure.  I was seated right away and really enjoyed the ambiance of the shop - granite countertops, large massage chairs, and overall classy decor.

Kevin was my nail technician, and he did a great job with both the manicure and the pedicure.  He was super friendly, offered me bottled water, gave a great massage and seemed to enjoy his job.  

Everything combined was about $50, which in my book is reasonably priced (albeit not overly cheap).  Since I've had some less than stellar nail experiences in Phoenix in the past, I wholeheartedly recommend Biagio to those willing to pay a slight premium for a more pleasant mani/pedi experience.
