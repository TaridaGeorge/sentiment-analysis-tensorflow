Ok Every Starbucks have a great coffee, tea, great snacks and free WiFi, but this one is special one (in a positive way) and I would drive to here although I have other Starbucks on a walking distance cuz of the great patio that they have.
It's in the mall, and always crowded with nice people, I've met few nice friends here. 
The best thing about it is that they have outlets for laptop chargers next to every table outside (unlike other starbucks who dont have outlets on their patio's), which makes this place smokers paradise :)
The mistes on the patio are on all the time during hot AZ summers, and it's real refreshing experience having your coffe and do some work on your laptop here.
WiFi is fast and reliable too.
