I LOVES ME SOME BUONO'S!!!!  I used to eat here at least once a week and I was 30lbs heavier.  Now I'm skinny but I still love to go to Buono's once in awhile, order a large cheese, and sit on my couch in my underwear and eat the whole thing.  I don't have a binge eating disorder -- it is just THAT GOOD.  The sauce, the crust, the cheese...all of it is perfect.  The cheesesteak is the best I've ever had.  

Service can be a little dodgy at times, but whatever.  I'm there for the food.  And if anything it just adds to the real New York/New Jersey ambiance.  I LOVE YOU BUONO -- whoever you are.
