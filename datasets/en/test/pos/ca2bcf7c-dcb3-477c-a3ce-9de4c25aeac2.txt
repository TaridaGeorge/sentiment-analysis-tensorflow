It took me seven years, but I finally made my way to this train park, and I was very impressed!  My eight month old son was too... it was his first time on the swings!

We met some friends there super early, so there weren't many people there... but because we were so early, the train wasn't going yet and neither was the carousel.  The restroom was open though, and it was clean.  

I will definitely return during normal hours to see this place in action... hopefully before it gets too hot!
