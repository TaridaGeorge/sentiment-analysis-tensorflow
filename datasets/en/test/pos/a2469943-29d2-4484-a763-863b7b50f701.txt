I found the Stockroom today because I was trying to support National Small Business Saturday and what a delightful find it was! Whereas it is definitely not as big as a Staples, I was really surprised by the wide variety of supplies they did have - they definitely cover all the basics. But more importantly for me is that the entire staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Even though this was my first time in the shop, they made me feel like a regular. 

I got everything I came in for and even better than that, I was able to support a family-owned and local business. I highly recommend you stop by the next time you are in need of office supplies and/or shipping.
