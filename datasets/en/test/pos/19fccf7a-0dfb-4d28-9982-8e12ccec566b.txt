I absolutely love this place.  I bought so much and such a reasonable price. As an interior decorator, this is the place to go for any look.  There are tradional styles, young and funky, ecclectic, definately one of a kind.  And the prices? Almost unbeatable.

It is now a year later and I'm still shopping here.  I LOVE it, it continues to amaze me at how cool their stuff is.
