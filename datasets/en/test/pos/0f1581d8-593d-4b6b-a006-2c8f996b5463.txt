Work conference sent me to the deserts of Arizona, or what my pal Natalie G. likes to call a microwave oven.  We headed over to this very relaxing hotel in the middle of nowhere this week.  I personally had a fantastic time here.  I don't know if it was the whole atmosphere itself but the hotel had a huge rack of decent amenities.  Maybe I'm use to paying city prices of 300+ with not much more than an ice box of a room.  But this room was huge including a kitchen, living room, bedroom and two flat screen tvs.  The pool was open pretty much all day and all night too.  The free happy hour and breakfast was lovely and the whole hotel made me feel very relaxed and comfortable.  Had a great "vacation"!  I mean work trip....
