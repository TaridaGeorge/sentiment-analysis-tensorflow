I went here in 2010 at the recommendation of someone with similar natural hair to mine(3d/4a/4b). She had a Brazilian Blowout and was able to retain her curls thanks to the expertise of the stylist at Apricot Lounge Salon. This salon is very professional, courteous and are experts at what they do. I not only got a Brazilian Blowout at this salon but also a nice hair color/shine treatment. 

Although I opted not to continue with the Brazilian Blowout due to chemical content concerns, I highly recommend the Apricot Lounge Salon to anyone of any hair type that wants great hair in a great atmosphere.! They are Top Notch!
