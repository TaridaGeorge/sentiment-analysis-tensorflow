Do I really want to add to the love-fest? Yes I do.

I've been here twice, and gotten in once (the wait got me the other visit). But now that I've made it inside, I can tell you that the wait is well worth it.

M had it as simple as you can get: A single egg, scrambled. And it was light, fluffy and perfect.

I had the Honey Lemonade and wish I could have it every day. 

I also had the waffle & Bacon, both were amazing. The thick cut peppery bacon is soo good. I don't eat a lot of pork; so for me to love bacon, it's a big deal.  The waffle is the best I've ever had. the exterior is perfectly golden brown, and the inside is like eating a cloud. A tasty tasty cloud.

Wait it out, it's worth it.
