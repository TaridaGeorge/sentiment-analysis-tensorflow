One of the best beer selections in the Phoenix area.  Papago's own brews are fantastic. The Mandarin Hefeweizen tastes like a creamsicle, and the coffee stout is amazing.  There is even a coconut stout.  You can take a growler of beer home with you too, which is a fun way to try Papago's variety of brews.  

There are so many on tap and in bottles that it is always tough to decide which one to order next.
