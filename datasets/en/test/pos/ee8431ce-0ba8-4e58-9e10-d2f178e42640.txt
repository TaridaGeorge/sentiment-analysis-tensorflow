I would give this 4.5 stars and not 5 stars because sometimes the head cashier chick gives me the stink eye when I go in.

They have a great selection of dog and cat food. Not just the standard stuff that Petco and Petsmart have, but real organic and high quality stuff. Of course, that means some of their food is more expensive than you will find at Petsmart. However, they have some stuff that are less expensive for your pup or kitty, such as collars, toys, catnip, treats... Its kinda dark in there, and smells like a barn but worth going in and checking out. Plus, its right next to grovers park :)
