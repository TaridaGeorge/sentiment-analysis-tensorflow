The whole feel of the place is one of knowledge and empowerment while healing. Every one is helpful and really good at their job. I have been going there for 8 months to work on my achilles tendon. I have also transitioned to their personal trainer, Rich, who has been able to help me get my strength back while understanding and working within my limitations. I highly recommend this facility to any one who needs either physical therapy or a personal trainer.
