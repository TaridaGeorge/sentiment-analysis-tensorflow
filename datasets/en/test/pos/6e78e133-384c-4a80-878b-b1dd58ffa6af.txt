prepare to spend a few hours here and really have a romantic experience. the food is divine. the service is laid back (in a good way). the chef runs the whole show and plays all hats. the menu is forever changing and when you make a reservation he will ask you questions so he can tailor your meal and experience to your needs. probably not a good first date place because if the date goes wrong, you will be stuck for a while. perfect spot for an anniversary or something. or even just to have a nice meal with people you know and care about.
