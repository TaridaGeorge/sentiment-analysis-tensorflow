It's little gems like this that make me love Phoenix. (Phoenix can sometimes be a bee-ach from hell but if you're patient, she rewards you.) The only drawback to this place is parking. And since I can't get here on the light rail I have to drive. And if I have to drive, I have to park. But when I can't park, it's a hassle. 

However, once you achieve parking success, Postinos is awesome. I love that it's in an old post office. I love how the garage doors open, like a giant Arizona room. I like the drinks, I like the laid back lounge atmosphere, I like the service. It's a little pricey, but hey, this isn't McDonalds. I remember that I really liked their bruschetta. I've gone to Postinos to welcome friends back to Phoenix and sometimes to say goodbye. It's a great place for both.
