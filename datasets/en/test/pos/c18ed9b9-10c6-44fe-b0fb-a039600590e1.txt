I can't believe I have never reviewed this restaurant.  If you like middle eastern food then you are missing out if you have never eaten here, seriously.

We have been coming regularly for over 12 years.  One of our all time favorite restaurants.  We almost always bring company in town here.  The food is amazing.  The cost is so cheap!!

Always order the same thing... Vegetarian combonation plate.  Comes with 2 stuffed grape leaves, 2 falafil balls, babjanoush, tabouli and yogurt salad.

For the appetizer we always get Lebni and the plate is literaly licked clean.

I can't encourage you enough to order hand made pita bread with all of your items.

My husband and kids also love the chicken and beef schwarma as well as the chicken kabobs.  They always order the carbonated yogurt soda- yuck!!
