Still love love love this place!!!! Great bartenders with their cool Irish accents and exceptional service. This place is so chill and just a great place to be to grab a nice cold beer while listening to a live band or watching a game. We come here about 2-3x a week...yea  I sound like an alcoholic... but can't help but come back for the good grub & beer. If you haven't tried this place, seriously ...go grab yourself a drink with a side of chicken tenders...you won't regret it.
