Went to the Brewers/Mariners game on Monday and had a blast. 

Bought my tickets on online....and somehow ended up getting 2nd row right behind the Brewers dugout. Way cool. 

For a small ballpark it has a lot of concession stands and lots of restrooms.....granted I went on a Monday afternoon but it's the only time I've NEVER seen a line outside a women's restroom at a sporting event.

Parking was $6 but the lot is just a short walk from the main gate.

Loved how the announcers mentioned it was 37 degrees in Milwaukee at game time. (And loved that the Brewers won a great game, too!!!)

If you're a Brewers fan or a fan of the team they're playing, I highly recommend going. You'll have a great time.
