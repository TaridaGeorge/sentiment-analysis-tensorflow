Another place my friend and I have wanted to try. We enjoyed everything. We spilt the warm Italian grinder and thank God. It was huge. No way would I have been able to finish it all by myself. We also split the chopped vegetable salad. Every thing in it I love.  It was awesome. There are several other things I want to try. Like the warm potato chips and French onion dip. The shaved prime rib. And the 36 hour pork ribs. Bring it on. 

The atmosphere is nice too. I can't wait until its cooler so I can sit on their terrific patio.
