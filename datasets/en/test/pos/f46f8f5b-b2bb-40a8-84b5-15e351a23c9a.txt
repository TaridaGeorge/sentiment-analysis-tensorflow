Whyyyy did I come here on a Monday? Well, it was *supposed* to be to study so I can kick ass at finals... that didn't happen.

I drank way too much of their delicious coffee... and the fabulous bartender convinced me to add Baileys - bad idea.

So, study session goes out the window. Music + drinks =  a social gathering with fellow lushes, such as myself... and now I'm posting tipsy Yelp reviews. Thanks Lux Cafe!
