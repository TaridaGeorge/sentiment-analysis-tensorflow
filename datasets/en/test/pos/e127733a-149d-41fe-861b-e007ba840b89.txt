I'm like most people. I figure all Insurance is pretty much the same just give me the basic products at the cheapest price. Well I found out the hard way that talking to a different voice on the phone everytime I called is more than frustrating. Ian and his wife are real people who will sit with you and discuss what's important and take the time to answer my questions untill I understand. It turns out those cheap rates had me under insured. Ian showed me how to save $600 per year ! by bundling all of my vehicles, home AND motorcycle.  Less expensive isn't always Cheaper !   I pass 3 Allstate shops on my way to Grandidge Allstate, because Service makes a difference.   Cheers Ian !
