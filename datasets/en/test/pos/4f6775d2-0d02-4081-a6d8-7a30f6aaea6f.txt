I absolutely hate toasted subs.  However, when visiting friends in Phoenix I was taken to this spot.  I was hesitant, not really a big sandwich fan, but I ended up having the Club, and substituting the bacon for roast beef.  The sandwich was basically the best thing I'd eaten my entire trip.  
The staff are nice and friendly, and the food is amazing.  
This is a must hit up place whenever you are in Arizona.
