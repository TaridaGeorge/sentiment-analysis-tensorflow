This place has atleast 30 different donuts to choose from at any given time. The coffee is ok and the service is friendly, though slow at times (patience is a virtue!), but the reason you go there is the donuts and they are the best in the valley period. My favorite is a french cruller that DD has been butchering for years...but they do them right here. The buttermilks are exploding out of themselves and are one of the richest things I've ever had in my life.
