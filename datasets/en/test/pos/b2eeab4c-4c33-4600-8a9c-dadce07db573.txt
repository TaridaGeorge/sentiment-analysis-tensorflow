Yum!  Yum!  Yum!  I am so thrilled to have a self serve yogurt shop within driving distance of my house.  Now if it wasn't almost a 20 minute drive it would be even better.  I have already been 3 times in so many weeks.  I am a fan of tart frozen yogurt and got to try the original and mango tart.  Both were yummy.  My kids also have a great time picking and adding topping to the yogurt.  I had to limit them to 5 toppings each per visit because they got sick the first time after adding 20 or so!!!!
