My husband, in-laws, and I decided to go to Mastro's as a last minute, casual dinner with not much expectations. We were in love- the meat, sides, service, and the warm butter cake. 

Note: Mastro's surpasses Morton's in comfort, food, and just about everything else.

When I had a bite of the warm butter cake, I had a Ratatouille moment, and reminded me of eating my mother's cake as a little girl. 

My husband and I will be back next weekend...This will be a more frequent spot for us. Enjoy and fast before Mastro's!
