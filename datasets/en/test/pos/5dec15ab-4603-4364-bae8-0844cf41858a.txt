This is a great hotel. We stayed a week in August. Hot , but great deal on the room and had the pools virtually to ourselves. Service is professional and friendly. My daughters and I had a riot on the pool slide. I have traveled around quite a bit and this is definately in the top 10 of places I have stayed. Great location, can get to anywhere in Phoenix, East Valley, region. Great views of the Estrella's and South Mountain. Did not golf , but course looked great.
