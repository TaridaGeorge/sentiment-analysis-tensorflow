Have you been here? No? Then GO!!!! 

They have an awesome beer selection from local, AZ, breweries as well as other breweries. Their food is A-MAZING. Seriously, so good. We've been here 2x and both times it was excellent. 

It's kid and dog friendly. You seat yourself and the beer selection is written on a chalkboard. They have brunch, and if you go, try the french toast and the breakfast burrito. OH MY, sooooo good! For $10 you get a beer (or mimosa) and whatever they are serving for brunch. Dogs are welcomed in their back patio. They also sell growlers, score!

Service was awesome, both our waiter and the manager came to our table several times. 

We'll def be returning soon!
