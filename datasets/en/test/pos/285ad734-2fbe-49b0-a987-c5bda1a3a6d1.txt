I walked in and was immediately greeted by the waitress and was seated in a booth. Chairs are all wood and a bit stiff, but not that bad. I ordered the bun bo dac biet and a Pepsi. The waitress was kind enough to answer all of my questions as well as help me pronounce the name of the dish.  Food came out quickly enough, and.... OH. MY. GOODNESS.  The food was amazing.  I had never had Vietnamese food before, and I will FOR SURE be returning to try more things on the menu.  I was hoping that the price would be a bit lower, but it definitely is good for the food that you get.
