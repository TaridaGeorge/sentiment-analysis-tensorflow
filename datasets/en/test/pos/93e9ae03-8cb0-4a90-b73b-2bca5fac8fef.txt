I love this restaurant (even though it's a chain and I can hear my brother saying it's just a "glorified Red Lobster"). 

I ordered the Crab and Lobster Bisque soup and am drooling thinking about how much I wish I could eat it right now. For my entree I ordered the Atlantic Salmon (stuffed with crab, shrimp, and brie cheese) which was unbelievably amazing. I also had some scalloped potatoes which was basically in the shape of a brick covered with cheesy goodness. I wanted to eat the apple pie for dessert because it looked so delicious, but could barely breathe after eating all that food. 

The service was outstanding, although the manager stopping by the table several times throughout dinner was annoying. 

I can't wait to come back here.
