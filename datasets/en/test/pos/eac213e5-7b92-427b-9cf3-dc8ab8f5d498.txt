Sexy meets casual meets deliciousness meets something new that Scottsdale was missing. 

From the upscale look and dim lighting, it fits right in with the Scottsdale crowd. But the best part is, you can go here to just relax too. They have lots of great seating whether it is intimate or larger group. The music is playing, the game is on, and there is lots to look at. Did I mention the food is incredible?
