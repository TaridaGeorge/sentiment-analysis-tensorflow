All I can say is THUMBS UP...or FIVE STARS for the Dim Sum!

The Chinese Guy & the Hostess at the front counter were very cordial, friendly, and they both spoke English too. Usually, you don't even expect a smile at any Chinese restaurant.

If you want Dim Sum to-go, there is a check-off list at the counter which you can mark down the quantity of what you want. Most of the dishes were $2.18 each. The take-out was very fast!

Plenty of carts in the dining area making the rounds, Dim Sum was fresh and hot, clean restroom, and most importantly they received a SILVER AWARD from the Health Dept (which I ALWAYS look up before eating at a place).

I live in the West Valley and I would drive back here again to have more DIM SUM, it's worth it to get good Dim Sum. FANTASTIC!
