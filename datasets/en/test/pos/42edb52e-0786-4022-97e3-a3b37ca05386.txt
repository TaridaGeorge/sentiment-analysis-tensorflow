I checked out this place yelp because I wanted falafel and this is what pops up. Thank goodness for yelp because it has just introduced me to a wonderful love of middle eastern food for CHEAP.

Place is awesome, chill, laid back, and CHEAP. people that don't like it sound like they are a bit snooty, 

Actually, the falafel was good, hummus was... eh. but that falafel, it was GOOD, haven't had a good one since I returned from across the pond, eh eh eh!
