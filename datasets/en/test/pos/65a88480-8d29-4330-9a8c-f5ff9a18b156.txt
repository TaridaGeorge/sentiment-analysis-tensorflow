This is THE place to go for rock T-shirts. They have punk, metal, industrial, goth, new wave, classic rock and other genres covered. And the staff is insanely cool.

I visit each time I'm in Arizona, and I buy at least two shirts per visit. Most recently, I snagged Bauhaus, The Smiths and The Pixies.

Need patches? They got 'em.
Pins? Yup.
Boots? Covered.

Lighters, posters, tapestries, rock fashion accessories and more are all under one roof. And that SMELL, that Shirts 'n' Things smell, is one of a kind. It's the scent of rock'n'roll.
