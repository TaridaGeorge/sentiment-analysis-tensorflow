Really cozy atmosphere! If you wanna try something new try the cevapi(chevapi), I went to Bosnia this summer and its the best cevapi Ive been able to find around here!! I also love their crepes! If you like to cook like I do you will also love that they have a little market area with food and prducts from Europe.
