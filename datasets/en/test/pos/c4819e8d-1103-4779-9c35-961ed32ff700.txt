We tried Gelato 69 or whatever it is that opened on the NE corner of Dobson and Warner.  No way it can compare to Angel Sweet.  Angel Sweet puts them to shame.

The staff is more than willing to let you sample a variety of flavors.  

My only gripe:  make the Valentine's special, Hugs and Kisses, part of the regular offerings.  I LOVE IT.
