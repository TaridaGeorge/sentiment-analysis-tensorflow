This is the best workout I have found! I like to workout on my own but don't push myself enough. I like that the classes are small enough to still get attention from the trainer if you need it or you can blend in too. Every workout since I started here just doesn't compete on the intensity level for me. The prices are a little expensive but I think its well worth what you get. The staff is always there to help out and are just great!
