WoW!

Im very impressed with the outstanding service provided by the entire staff.  The manger introduced herself and she was so cordial and attentive.  The waitress provided phenomenal customer service with a sincere and bright smile on her face.

The food is amazing. You got to try this place.  You know the food will be good when you first bite into the salad and the salad is outstanding.  I coudlnt wait to dig into my entree, the grilled cheese portobello.  The combination of flavors along the heavenly tasting focaccia bread makes you want to go back for more. The bread melts in your mouth.  

Kudos to the staff and manager for such an amazing experience!!!
