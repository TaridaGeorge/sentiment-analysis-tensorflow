Went there yesterday for the first time and was there early before they opened.  They were so nice, they came to the door, let us in and got us drinks until they were ready to open, what service!  

The food is so good and for the price in unbeatable.  You get a bowl full of meat and vegetables and then they cook it up for you.  I rate it a 5 star for the following reasons:

1. Healthy Eating- Lots of Protein and fresh vegies!
2.  Enough food that I took it hopme for 2 more meals lates and stayed delicous
3.  Service went way above and beyond, they really did care and wanted my business
4.  Very clean!

I'll be back soon!
