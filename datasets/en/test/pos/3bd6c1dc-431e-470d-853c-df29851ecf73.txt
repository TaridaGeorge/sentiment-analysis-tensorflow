These burgers pack a wallop. Seriously.  They are big, fresh, succulent, juicy, tender, and melt in your mouth, with the different textures of the toppings (depending on what you get) all perfectly complementing the meat.  Can't say enough about this place.. while there's something to be said about the bun (can get a little soggy on the bottom), this is definitely the best burger joint in the valley.  Get it medium-rare for the full tender experience, and an order of five guys-like fries (same lightness to it, but is crispier and fresher).  Plus a Sierra Nevada.  You won't regret it.

I do find myself occasionaly feeling a twang of guilt looking at the big happy cow in the field of greens on the back wall... but that instantly subsides after taking a bite out of a burger.
