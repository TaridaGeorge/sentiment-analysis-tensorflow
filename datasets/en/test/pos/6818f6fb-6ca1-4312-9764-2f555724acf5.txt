Have only eaten here once, but man...it was incredible!  Perfect for a romantic evening or with family and friends. Wait staff attentive, personable, and efficient. 

Olive oil to die for with the bread, amazing wine selection, mouth watering food. Daniel's has it all! I had a grilled veal chop, with an arrugula salad. Washed it down with a chianti reserve. Ended with a classic tirimisou and coffee. Perfect!

Want to try something new? Want to try someplace that impresses without even trying? Daniel's is it.
