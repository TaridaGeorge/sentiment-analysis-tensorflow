Love Costco!! It has everything! Usually buy my fruits, veggie and meat. Also end up buying stuff that were not on my list. Hard to resist the deals and great price they have. They have a pretty good selection of wine, spirits and beer. Costco is also great w their returns. Ive returned something that was used because it broke. Had no receipt and they went back to my Amex connected w Costco one year back!!! Best part are the there free samples!! Portions are enough to make you full if you try most of them! Only downfall is I end up paying more than I anticipated because I end up buying more things than planned!!!!
