Lo-Lo's has some of the best food you can find in Phoenix, and they honestly make the best Southern food I've ever had.  Their fried chicken is absolutely fantastic - it's just so moist and flavorful.  Their Mac 'N Cheese is also excellent.  Honestly, everything here is just really good - the only thing that disappointed me was that the cheese grits weren't quite as cheesy as I had expected them to be.  Still though, they were delicious.  If you're looking for good Southern food, this is absolutely the right place to go.
