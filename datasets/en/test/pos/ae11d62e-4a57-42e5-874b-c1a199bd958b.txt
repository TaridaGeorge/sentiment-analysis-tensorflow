For those who may remember the original Lowdown Cafe on 24th Street, heads up.  They've relocated. The new space is much more zen then the former strip mall location next to the sketchy 7-Eleven.  Below is my original review of the 24th Street location.  Every single word is still absolutely true.

Lowdown offers healthy homemade wraps, salads, and freshly prepared soup.  My favorites are the "Grilled Veggie Wrap" and the "Corridor Princess Salad."  A box lunch will cost you 6 - 8 bucks and comes with your choice of sandwich/wrap, a drink, chips, and a homemade cookie.  And they deliver for free!  Breakfast is pretty good as well.  Apparently, the two gals that own and run this little gem are Silicon Valley burn-outs who left after the big crash.  A little taste of Cali in the Valley.   I highly recommend Lowdown.
