Went on Friday night with a friend for dinner.  Ordered lemonade.  It was interesting but I wouldn't order it again.  Something about the rose water in it did not make it refreshing.  Then came out the babganouj and pita bread- just okay not nearly the best I've ever had.  It wasn't garlicky enough for my tastes.  Next was the lentil soup.  Oh.  My.  Gosh this was by far the best tasting soup I have had in my ENTIRE LIFE.  I will crave this constantly until I can return to have it again.  The thin little noodles and the yummy flavor in it.  yum!!  Next I had a falafel sandwich.  Was very good and well worth the less than $5 it cost.  I couldn't even finish it.

I highly recommend eating here but you must order lentil soup!!
