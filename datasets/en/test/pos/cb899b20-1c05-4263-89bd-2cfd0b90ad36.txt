This is by far my favorite sushi place.  The atmosphere feels more family run.  You never have to wait for a table, and they have $20 all you can eat.  The selection on the all you can eat menu is extensive, and I'm always satisfied.  The wait staff is friendly, but it can get a little slow if there are too many people at the table.  I find if more than 2 people are sharing an all you can eat menu then it's iffy if everyone at the table will be eating at the same time.
