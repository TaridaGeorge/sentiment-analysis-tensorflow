This is one of the best burger joints in the area, it's a built your own burger, so you decide your toppings. For 6 bucks you get a jumbo sized burger and handful of fries, make sure you ask for extra napkins because its a big juicy messy burger. I have to admit, the location is not the best (behind a closed blockbuster).
