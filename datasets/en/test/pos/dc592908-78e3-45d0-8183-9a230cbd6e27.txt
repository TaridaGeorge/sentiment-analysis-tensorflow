Pleasantly surprised by this restaurant.  It's nice to see a place that fits this atmosphere and doesn't charge an arm and a leg for it.  Everything on the menu was great (although the mushroom pizza had a pile of spinach on it???) and the service was friendly and efficient.  Everyone recommends the planks, as well as La Bocca themselves, and there's no wonder why.  They were fantastic.  Sit on the patio if it's not 100 degrees out and have a great evening.  We'll be back for sure.
