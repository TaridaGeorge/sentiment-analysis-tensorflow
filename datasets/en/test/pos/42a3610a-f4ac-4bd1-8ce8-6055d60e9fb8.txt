Everything about this place was AMAZING!! The food, the sakes, the service, and the ambiance exceeded my expectations. We decided to do the tasting menu and had it paired with sakes. The chef came to our table and asked if there were any restrictions. From there on out the food and sakes started flowing. Jason was the chef and Wes was our waiter. They both took very good care of us, but everyone on the restaurant staff was very friendly. I will definitely be back on my next trip to Scottsdale.
