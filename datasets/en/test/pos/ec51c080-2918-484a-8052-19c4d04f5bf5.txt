I read the reviews and couldn't believe we hadn't tried The Deli with it being so close to home.

This place has it all. Great service and a new take on fresh local food plus a little cocktail lounge on the weekends when there is a long wait for a table.

The hummus with warm freshly made crackers is a must order. I ordered the half sandwich and chicken and corn chowder it was so good, but I couldn't finish it because it was so filling, but not in a heavy greasy way - just very satisfied with a delicious meal. We had to try their homemade ice cream and it did not disappoint either. The Peanut Butter ice cream was YUMMY! Everything that we ordered surpassed our expectations.

If you haven't tried this place - stop what you are doing and go check it out!!!!
