If you can get past the worn exterior, you are in for a treat.  This is easily one of my favorite restaurants in all of Phoenix, and I often made the trip down from Peoria to eat here.  

The menu is very extensive to say the least... I was very impressed by their hard-to-find fusion items, such as Ika Mentaiko pasta (squid with spicy cod roe).  If you have an eclectic appetite, I recommend you come here!  Though I've never tried any of their more typical Italian offerings, their sushi and Asian noodle dishes are delicious!  They've also got an assortment of interesting cocktails--Saketini, anyone?
