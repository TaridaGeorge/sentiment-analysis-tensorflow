Introduced to D'lish today by a friend. I'd already had breakfast (although the menu looks great, lots of delicious sounding, healthy options) but he suggested a Chai coffee. I don't usually like Chai Tea, but I thought I'd give the Chai coffee a chance based on his recommendation.

When I ordered, the server suggested a "Sexy Dirty Chai", which as lurid as it sounds means adding vanilla. The Sexy Dirty Chai Coffee over ice is hands down now my favorite coffee drink. The place is tiny, has a really cool, funky interior and also has a drive thru- a true local gem. The service is friendly and energetic and I plan to start my day here again soon :)
