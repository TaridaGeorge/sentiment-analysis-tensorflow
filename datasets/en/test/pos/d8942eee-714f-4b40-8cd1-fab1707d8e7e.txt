Simply put:  Dr. Iain fixes me. I get back and neck adjustments. A couple times I was in deep trouble, back-wise, and I was so thankful to walk out of his office feeling so much better.  He has been very patient and flexible for me to get in to see him. I think I've been going to him for almost 10 yrs.  He is very capable and he and his wife, Evelyn are very nice people.  I recommend highly.
