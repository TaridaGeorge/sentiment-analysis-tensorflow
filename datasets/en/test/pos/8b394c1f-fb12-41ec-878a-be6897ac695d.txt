I have to say that Scott's is simply the real thing as far as Jewish style deli's in Phoenix.  I ordered the corn beef and matza ball soup.  It was quite delicious.  The atmosphere is one of a deli with both intimate and group seating available.

The service is excellent with an extensive menu.  

Enjoy........
