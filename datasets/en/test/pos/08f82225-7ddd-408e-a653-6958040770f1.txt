I can't say enough about Melissa at Canvas Salon!  I have been going to her for color and cuts for over 8 years and at least twice a week a stranger comes up to me asking who does my hair  It's so crazy that at Motor Vehicles when I went to update my license, the photo girl asked if she could take pictures with her camera for her stylist!  Actually, the same thing happened at my doctor's office.  
If you need PERFECT color from the expert, call Melissa today!
