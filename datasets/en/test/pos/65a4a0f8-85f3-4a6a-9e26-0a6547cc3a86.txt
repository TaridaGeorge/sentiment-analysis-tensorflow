Craving takeout food, this is our go to place.  Curries from the red to the sweet are delicious.  Noodles, my kids love Pad See Ew with beef, Pad Thai and even the Chow Mein.

I really have yet to try anything here that my family and I do not enjoy. And prices are reasonable. Staff is friendly, helpful and service is fast. Should you choose to dine there, the place is well maintained and clean.
