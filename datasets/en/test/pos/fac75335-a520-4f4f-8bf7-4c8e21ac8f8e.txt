Wouldn't normally give a fast food burger place 5 stars.  Here is why I gave Smashburger the honor:

1.  When we arrived all the tables were full.  A couple exited a table right as we finished getting our drinks.  We swooped on it.  Even though we began cleaning the table ourselves, a staff member STILL came, wiped it off with a rag, and gave us a smile.

2.  The food was DELICIOUS!  My chicken sandwich was hot, fresh, and had great toppings.  The bun was even good!  DH loved his 1/3 lb Smashburger and devoured it in less than 5 minutes.

3.  When we were leaving, even though we attempted to bus our own table, yet ANOTHER friendly staffperson came by and grabbed our stuff for us.

An inexpensive meal with a positive and friendly staff... and food that was worth eating again and again.  

Way to go Smashburger!!!!
