Yummmm! I am so glad we decided to come here on our brief visit to Phoenix! My husband and I both LOVE Thai food and since there seemed to be so many places in the area, we went with the one closest to our hotel with the best rating. What a find! The food was excellent, wonderful service and a decent price! I especially loved that they had sake on the menu...an extra treat! I got the pad thai which was delicious and my husband had the Chee Choo seafood which was outstanding. We both wanted to lick our plates at the end of the meal. I highly recommend this restaurant if you're in the area and hungry for some delicious Thai food full of mouth-watering flavors! If I lived close by I would go weekly for sure.
