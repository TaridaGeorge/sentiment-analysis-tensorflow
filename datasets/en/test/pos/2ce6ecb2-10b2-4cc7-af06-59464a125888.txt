I am throughly impressed by this market. I found some amazing deals and used it to my benefit in several ways, including making an amazing dinner dish for this evening. 

Try to stop at the butcher area for "Managers Deal". I found "buy one, get one". Great beef selection deal. The staff is friendly, professional and the market is clean. I was very pleased.

What throws me way off is their name: "Fry's". Hello???? In California we have a Fry's Electronics and this market Fry's has the same logo for the name. ODD right?!
