Went to Radio Milano for the first time this evening.  Being in the radio business I was curious by the name.  I love this place.  First of the decor is fun, very contemporary with old radios on display throughout the restaurant.  The service was great and the prices are very reasonable.

We started out with the chopped salad and we had halibut, veggie Lasagna, meatballs and tuna.  everything tasted fabulous.

Looking forward to my next visit!!!
