Best Hefeveisen here...4 oaks i think it was called from Sedona Brewery...the only downside is, can i ever buy it at a local liquor store in Phx? We also had the appetizer sampler with babganous and pita sqares and some other dips, it was yummy and it was fun sitting at the bar..there was music outside and in but we had to get going for work and couldnt stay too long. it was fun and the bartender was real nice and we enjoyed talking to him. Its a quiet cool place to hang out with friends and kind of hide out.
