I've been regulary visiting Qcumberz for a few years now, and I adore this place.  Part antiques and part "stuff" plus the new book section, there is always something new to be found!  I especially like that the items carried in this store are very reasonably priced, and it has helped me immensely to outfit my 1924 Spanish style apartment.  Now that I travel up and down 7th Ave every day for work, it's made stopping and visiting much more convenient!  If you're looking for some great (unique!) items for your house, this place is definitely where you want to go.  And on the rare occasion that you leave empty handed, I'm positive you'll have had fun browsing!
