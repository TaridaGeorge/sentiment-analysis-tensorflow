...I like Wal-Mart and I don't care what that says about me - and with that being noted, this is a really nice Wal-Mart with an extensive selection, self checkout, and huge local produce selection.  For the limited things I need from a store LIKE Wal-Mart, this one has them all in plethora.  However long I remain in Phoenix this will be my most frequently visited store, no doubt.
