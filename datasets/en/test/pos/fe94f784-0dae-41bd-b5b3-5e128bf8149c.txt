When I usually go for sandwiches I am disappointed when fries are nowhere to be found.  Scratch is the exception.  This is a healthy place with side salads.  I say this joyfully.  My sandwich had generous mounds of brie cheese, argula, and olive oil nestled between two fresh pieces of fluffy bread.  I left lunch not bloated like usual, but feeling full and airy.  The prices are a little Scottsdale-ish, but the quality of the food makes any meal here worth it.  It is hard to find though.  It's tucked into the very back of the shopping center north of Indian School.
