Why I love Grazie:
1. Family owned and ran. Maurizio (the owner) is a super nice Italian man and knows how to run a great restaurant. His daughter is a waitress, her boyfriend is the bartender. All in all a wonderful family feel. 

2. Italian classes taught by Maurizio. Learn a new language and drink wine at the same time.

3. The food. Order anything with the carmelized onions. The "steak on a stick" (Speidini al Forno) is insanely good. The vesuvius calzone/pizza thing truly is a giant volcano of deliciousness.

4. The atmosphere is casual but classy at the same time. Beautiful patio, quaint bar, candlelit tables.
