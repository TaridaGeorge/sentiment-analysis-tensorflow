Thank you BILL!

If you own a Vanagon in Phoenix do not go anywhere else.  Bill will walk you through the basics, advise you on your next steps and even let you know how you can do things yourself.  He has the solid knowledge and track records on Subaru conversions as well.  

They also have a nice surplus of parts and he will do whatever he can to get you the best quality used or new parts for your van.  

Since Gwynne S. pretty much covered all the based in extensive and accurate review, I will leave it that!

This is the DUDE!
