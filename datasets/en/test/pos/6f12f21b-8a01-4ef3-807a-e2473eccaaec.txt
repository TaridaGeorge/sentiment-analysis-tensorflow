Excellent food! There are so many different things on this menu that are delicious. The green chile pork stew is definitely not your usual appetizer, but it is worth trying. The green chili mac and cheese is a must try. I have also ordered or tried the fried chicken, short ribs, filet mignon and the long bone rib. All are great, to be honest I have never had anything bad there. 

The restaurant itself is interesting. It has a bar menu, which I have not had the chance to try, but would like it. The service has always been pretty good, not too great, but not bad. The drinks are also good, they have an extensive menu to choose from. Even though it is an expensive meal, it is definitely worth a try.
