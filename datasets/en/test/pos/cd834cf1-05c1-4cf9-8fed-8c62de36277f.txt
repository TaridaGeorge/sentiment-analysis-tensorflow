I've been coming here since I was in high school. The employees are always super helpful and the selection is great. One time my boyfriend purchased salmon sashimi from there that was less than desirable. He didn't have to bring it back or even have a receipt. The manager apologized to him and let him come back for a free slab of salmon. That's a rare find in a business. 

Today we bought sashimi and they included a block of ice so it didn't thaw on the drive home. Super cute :}
