AMAZING!  I decided to take some photos for my boyfriend as a birthday present and I was a little nervous to say the least.  Amy and Byron made me feel super comfortable and at ease. I wasn't sure how I would feel with a man behind the lense, considering this was my first experience, but I wouldn't have had it any other way! They're such a great team, I felt like I knew them for years.  Amy helped with my makeup and made me look glamorous without looking too "done up" and helped me pick out an outfit that flattered my ( size 12) curvy figure.  Needless to say, the pictures came out gorgeous!!!  My boyfriend loved them!!  He tells me everyday, literally, how they're the best gift he's ever gotten!  Thank you Amy and Byron, can't wait to do it again!
