We were is Scottsdale during Thanksgiving week, and went to one of my favorite restaurants in town -- Rancho Pinot Grill. Their lamb chops are the best and I was salivating over them. As usual, they were excellent. Their salads are so fresh tasting that you would think they just pulled the veggies from the garden! Hoge, the long time manager at Ranch Pinot, is a delight to deal with and is as knowledgable about wine as any sommelier. Don't let the strip mall location fool you, as I dare you to find a better restaurant in Scottsdale!
