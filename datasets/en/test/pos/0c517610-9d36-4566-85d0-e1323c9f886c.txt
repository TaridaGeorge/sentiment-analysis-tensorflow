This is one of my favorite restaurants, and I seek them out any time I travel, hoping upon hope that this city has one.  It was just as good as I remembered.

We had lobster lollipops and cocktails for a starter.  My Chopin-Vodka Dirty Martini was perfect.

As usual, the Macademia Encrusted Mahi Mahi with a side of rice and the Chocolate Lava Cake (that you have to order at the beginning of the meal) were the stars of the menu...to me anyway.  They're just so damn good, I can rarely bring myself to order anything else...although I have before, and it's all good!

Beautiful view and friendly service.  1 Appetizer, 4 meals, 1 Dessert, and 2 rounds of drinks cost around $250 so prepare for about ~$60/pp or maybe $40pp w/o drinks, appetizer, and dessert.

I would also recommend the Award Winning Clam Chowder and the Mixed Grill.
