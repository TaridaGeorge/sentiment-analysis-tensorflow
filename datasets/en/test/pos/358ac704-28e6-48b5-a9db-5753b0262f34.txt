I seriously could eat here every day. I love that everything is organic and locally grown and follows the anti-inflammatory diet. Its healthy and delicious. The fresh juice blends were delightful, and the food is flavorful and filling. I like that you find dishes that are within just about any means of a specific diet i.e. gluten free, vegan, vegetarian, dairy-free. The flourless chocolate cake was a great ending, and my inner health nut shouted cheers of joy at finding a healthy and delicious place to eat at. Anyone who thinks healthy food has no flavor and taste will be converted by one bite of any of the dishes at true food kitchen.
