I went here for a night of boozing with some friends this weekend and I must say it consists of 3 things:

1. Homey - one of the friendliest places I have been to in Scottsdale.  You need to come here if you want to hang out with your friends and make new ones.
2. Down and not so dirty - This place you can get down on their dance floor and all around the bar and do it with a good amount of cleanliness around you.
3. Beer Acquisition - You can grab a beer in about 3 places around the bar and the bartenders do their job well.

KUDOS!
