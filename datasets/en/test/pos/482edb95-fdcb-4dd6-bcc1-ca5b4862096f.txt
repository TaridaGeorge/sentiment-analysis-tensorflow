I am pretty sure I am exclusively clothes shopping here from now on. Such a nice atmosphere with super low prices on Nordstrom brands. I just love the quality and style of the clothes and shoes. The place is brand new, super nice, and as others have said, very organized, right down to the clearance racks.
