We just moved to the Valley and knew nothing about AZ landscaping and irrigation systems.  We called a few companies and they either didn't get back to us, tried to schedule us weeks out or sign us up for a contract.  Hank came out the very next day spent hours with my husband teaching about the irrigation system and plants at no cost!  He emailed us an estimate to complete the landscaping, repairs and winter grass that same night and was back making our backyard look amazing within days!  We couldn't have had a better experience!  We highly recommend Hank!!
