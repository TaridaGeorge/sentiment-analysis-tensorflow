This place is pretty good. I have been here a few times and enjoy this place a lot. The price isn't too bad, and the food is very delicious. I usually get the jambalaya, it is so tasty! They also have very good salads, and the burgers are also very good. The service is great and the atmosphere is quiet a bit dark so no one should be sitting at the table with sunglasses because that would just be creepy. Check this place out, if you enjoy a nice quiet place to enjoy a nice fine meal.
