We left town early enough to make it here before closing.  It's our favorite place for fresh fish.  Every time we come, regardless of the season, the food is always top notch.  The service is just as good as the food and tonight was no exception. 

For months we have been waiting for this trip, knowing we would be eating here made the planning even more exciting, and we finally got our most favorite desert, the carrot cake cheesecake.  We had tried this a long time ago and been waiting for it to come back on the menu and we were lucky enough tonight.   

We love this place so much, we always end up buying gift cards for family members to enjoy it too!
