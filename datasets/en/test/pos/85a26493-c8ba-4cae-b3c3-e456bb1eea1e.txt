Have enjoyed going to Zipp's for years.  The wings are friggin' amazing, they have some pretty nice beers on tap, and the staff is super friendly and cool to talk to.  The outdoor patio is great for large parties, love going there with a group after work to decompress and/or watch a Suns or D-Backs game.

5 Stars - All day long.
