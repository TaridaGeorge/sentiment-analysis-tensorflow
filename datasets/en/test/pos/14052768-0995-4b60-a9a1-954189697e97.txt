Went back to Ticoz on Monday night and had a terrific experience.  I honestly really love this place.  The atmosphere is great and the food never let's you down.  This night I had the New York steak with chimichurri on it.  To wash it down I had a Lychee mojito which I have never seen anywhere else.  There drink menu is extensive with flavor options which make it really fun even if you are just out for cocktails.
