This place does exactly what it sets out to do which is to provide comfort food at a great price. Portions are huge. I had the beef stew served with a thick slick of buttery toast and it was outstanding. A big heap of mash potatoes in the middle of it. My son had the Tri Trip, which he gobbled up. The food arrived maybe 4 minutes after our order was placed. Very, very fast. This is great value if you like comfort food and a lot of it. Tried the desserts also and they were outstanding. We had a berry cobbler and a chocolate lava cake. Staff was friendly and efficient.

Excellent. Fast service. Huge portions. Comfort food.
