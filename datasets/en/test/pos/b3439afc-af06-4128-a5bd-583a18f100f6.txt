Best lettuce wraps anywhere. Best tom ka gai soup anywhere. Pad Thai Satay is so completely inauthentic, I mean COMPLETELY different than real Pad Thai, but you know what, it's so damned good that I could really care less, and order it almost every time I go there. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu.
