I know I should let Dominic Review this but.....

Great place from a girls point of view.
Nice fun waiting area. Kinda casual sophisticated. Friendly staff, minus the blond receptionist that took pictures of herself while we were there. Dom got a cut and a hot towel, oh yeah and a beer. 

They offer drinks and he didn't pay anything extra.

There was an empty chair and the gal let me and Lennon sit and chat while she was cutting. Big salons have a frown for having your company sit and wait. 

Sorry for getting girl all over your manly barber place. 
You probably will see us there again, I have recommended it to many guys already.
and yes I nursed there.

We walked there on a Thursday afternoon. Me Dom and Lennon.
