Liver pate plate automatic appetizer is excellent.  Prime rib medium rare done perfectly, thick cut.  Classy calamari appetizer breaded lightly, not at all over cooked.  The servers get it and so service is excellent, with icewater served immediately, slightly esoteric requests accommodated instantly (e.g. request for an extra fork resulted in server immediately handing one from another unused placesetting at another table), pace of service timely but not rushing, and waitstaff frequently attentive.  Expensive, a fancy steakhouse for a special occasion.
