This place is awesome. Everything from the ambiance and the coffee to the ipad credit card signing app makes you feel good about being here. They have an ice-coffee item not on the menu that's already cold coffee, i like to get that. I think its called a totty. Ask for it! Also, the cookies and muffins are great too, definitely not a disappointment.
