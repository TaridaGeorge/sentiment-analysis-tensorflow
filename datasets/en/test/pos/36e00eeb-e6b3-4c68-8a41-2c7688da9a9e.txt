Absolutely love this record store. 

They always have a great stock of new releases, especially vinyls. 

The staff is very friendly and make great recommendations.

I just have a minor gripe with the store and that it is kind of small, but it's just a minuscule problem. When attending Record Store Day, it get's incredibly cramped, but to me that's ok because I love to see the support for a local independent record store.
