Mr. Graves is an excellent attorney. He helped me with my trust and some other legal matters. He really knows his estate planning. Every year he updates me on the changes to any laws that affect my estate. I feel much better now that I have all my ducks in a row. His staff is very kind and professional. They took me by the hand and helped me assemble all the pieces for my trust. Without their help It would have taken me forever to get it all in place. Super people, very trust worthy always available to his clients.
