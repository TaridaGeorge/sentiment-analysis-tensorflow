Sadly I'm going to rate this restaurant based on my recollection of Homemade Ginger Ale and Fried Cheese Curds... maybe I should stop now... Hmm.  

Location, Food, Ambience - neat little place.  I eat at plenty of places but rarely two months later can a recall anything specifically about the experience, but Tuck Shop had fried cheese curds... really good fried cheese curds - I was in Wisconsin for a while so I've had my share, and these were probably the best I've had - usually you just end up with a fried cheese stick but here they did the cheese curd justice - and then you get some tasty home brewed ginger ale to wash it down...

Yeah, Ginger Ale and Fried Cheese Curds...  Hmm, I probably shouldn't have written this...
