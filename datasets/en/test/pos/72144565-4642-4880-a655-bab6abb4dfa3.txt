This place is so fun.  I love how it's never super busy, but just enough people to make for an entertaining night.  It's definitely not your typical Scottsdale bar. Much more low key with super friendly patrons. It's pretty small, but there is a cute outdoor seating area in case you want a little more space.  They usually have a live acoustic music to entertain you. The bartender Doug, is great.  Never have a bad time and they have great specials even after happy hour.
