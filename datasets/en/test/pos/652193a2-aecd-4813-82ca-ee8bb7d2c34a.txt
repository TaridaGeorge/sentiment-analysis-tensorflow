I went here for my recent birthday dinner w my significant other. The view is amazing! The place itself is top notch and very elegant. We were greeted by two hosts both super kind- then had a balcony view outside near the bonfire pits- Our server was a gentlemen- very social and knowledgeable about the menu. Our food was delicious! I had the sirloin steak w potatoes and salad. The server brought me chocolate cake and ice cream for my birthday at the end! Overall this lace is def romantic and the service is extraordinary! The restaurant inside is very classy and the bathrooms spotless! Our dinner came out to $160 including a $25 tip- so not bad at all for what you get!
