They have the best herb filled and parmesan sausage around, not fatty and all flavor. The sandwiches rock, the groceries sort of pricey. It may take an extra 10 min or so wait but this is not subway. Good value too. Expected them to have an excellent giardineria in a jar, it is still good on a sandwich but AJ's has the best and I could eat it out of the jar plain!
