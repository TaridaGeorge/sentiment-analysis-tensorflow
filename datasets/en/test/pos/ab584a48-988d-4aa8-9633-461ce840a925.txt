I love this place! awesome food, great beer/wine selection. A really relaxed atmosphere. Thursdays they have .75 ice scream scoops, and they're kid friendly. Generous pour when you order a glass of wine, always a good thing in my book!

Jenna and Brooklyn are the only two that have served us and both and fantastic!!!
