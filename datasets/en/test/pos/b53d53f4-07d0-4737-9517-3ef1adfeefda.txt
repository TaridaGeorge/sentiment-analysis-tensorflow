Bunky Boutique is simply ah-maze-ing :) First off, this little house looks like it was remodeled and designed by HGTV's finest (no joke!). I love how they have kept all the walls up in the house and divided each room into a different sections. This place is trendiness with a capital T. Everything in here is fashion at it's best, and best of all it's from REAL and local designers. The accessory selection is among the best in Phoenix. It is a little on the pricey side, but not too pricey that one cannot afford. The service was great, the lighting and atmosphere was pretty chill. I'll definitly be returning ;)
