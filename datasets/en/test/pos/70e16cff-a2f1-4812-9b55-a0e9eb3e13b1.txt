The Parlor is amazing. On your way in there's an herb garden growing towards the door. Inside it's all music washed in candle light and everything that smells good. The food is always fresh; my absolute, die-hard favorite is the Farm Greens salad: roasted chicken, baby greens, tomato, pear, gorgonzola and spiced pecans. Don't forget dessert. Find a nice red from their versatile wine list and pair it with a piece of chocolate cake. Holy yum.
