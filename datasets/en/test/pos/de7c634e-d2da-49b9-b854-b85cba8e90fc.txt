I think it is high time for me to write a review for Coleen and phil's place. I have been a regular for over 10 years, ever since they only did subs and salads at the old fbo.  I enjoy many items on their menu, but my favorites are the New Yorker and the Sentimental Journey.  The New Yorker is a huge rueben sandwich on panini toasted marbled rye.  And the Sentimental is a great hamburger!
The restaurant hours vary by season and a simple call ahead can ensure that they will be open if you are flying in.  When i fly, part of my preflight is to check if the restaurant is open before embarking on a $100 hamburger.  
Gateway airport has the most unique blend of general aviation, corporate, commercial and military aircraft of any airport I know, please stop by and top off your tank!
