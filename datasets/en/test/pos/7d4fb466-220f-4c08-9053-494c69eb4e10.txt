Rating: 4.5 Stars. A real, true, legitimate coffee shop!

What I Liked: Coffee was decent (ordered an Iced Mocha). The fresh-out-of-the-oven Cheese Danish was AMAZING though...and definitely worth a trip back. The atmosphere was peaceful, the staff was friendly, and I LOVE that they bake their own goods in-house (a rarity these days).

Room For Improvement: The coffee was decent...it was good...but I was hoping for outstanding. I prefer a stronger, smokier roast. Also, the wi-fi was deplorable. It was beyond intermittent--it would be on for one minute, then off for 5. Very frustrating.

Overall: If they improved their internet, and I ordered stronger drinks from them, then Copper Star is/would be the perfect coffee shop. I'm a fan; if you live anywhere nearby, you owe it to yourself to frequent this place. ...Why can't we have a real coffee shop like this in Ahwatukee!?!
