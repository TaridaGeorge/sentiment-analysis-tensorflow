Been going here for months--take out only.  Always consistently delicious, great service.  WHy bother with Malees?  This place is soooooo much better.  I am stuck on Penang Curry with chicken--thai hot!  So many places when you ask for hot, you get not!
Please give this place a try--they seem to be slow for the summer.
