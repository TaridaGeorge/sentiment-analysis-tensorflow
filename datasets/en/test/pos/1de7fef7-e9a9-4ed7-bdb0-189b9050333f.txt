They make their own chips here and they are delicous. I got my order to go and they gave me a big sackful, yum.  I dropped by late nite and everyone at the bar was hammered so it was really funny waiting for the to go order...the people watching in this place is excellent. The bartenders are very polite, its a friendly neighborHOOD place
