This is straight up, the best sandwich place for carnivores.

Long ago, when I still ate meat, I ordered the Club and was floored by how good it was. At the time, I was quite the Club Sandwich aficionado, I guess you could say I was a Club Sandwich Member (har har har). There is so much meat on this thing, that it's near disturbing, and the portions are huge. The half sandwich is literally about the size of a typical full sandwich.

Besides, the name is Bison Witches, get it?
Bison Witches ...Buy Sandwiches!
That's just plain clever.
