Wow! This place is amazing! I was visiting Phoenix, and drove to Chandler just to check this place out. I'm glad I did! 

I went here specially for their jerky. There were three flavors: Turkey, Cajun, and Regular. I asked Ralph which flavor does he recommend, and he gave me huge samples to try! They were all delicious, but I chose the Turkey and the Regular flavors. The turkey jerky was so tender and very lean. The regular jerky was smoky, just the way I like it! 

I wanted to try their steaks, but since I live in California, I obviously couldn't buy any to bring back home! Next time Von Hanson's, I will be prepared for you and bring ice packs and a cooler! No, I'm not joking.
