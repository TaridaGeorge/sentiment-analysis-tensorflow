What a great way to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon , floating down a scenic river with family and friends. The river was not to crowded and the water was beautiful . Where else can you have so much fun for $15, heck it cost more to see a movie. There were six in our group which included two kids and everyone wants to do it again. I would strongly recommend this to anyone wanting to have fun.
