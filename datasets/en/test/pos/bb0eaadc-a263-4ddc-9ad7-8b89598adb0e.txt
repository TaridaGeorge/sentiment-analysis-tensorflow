Okay...Getting a vet that will actually talk to you and discuss your pets health and history is remarkable in this day and age.  I was very impressed with Dr. Clark and his genuine care for the health of your pet.  

One thing that I really appreciate is that the office seems to take into account that you are the customer and you direct them to the level of care your pet needs.  I agree they didn't  seem overly anxious to sell me services that I really don't need, but, also emphasized the importance of things like heartworm medication.  

I recommend Dr. John Clark and the staff at the Orangewood Animal Hospital.
