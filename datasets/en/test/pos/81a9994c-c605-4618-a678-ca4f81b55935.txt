Domestic Bliss also has in house designers that are AMAZING! Now I can bring the look of the store to my own home. They have custom everything and because the owners are always on the hunt for the most "blissful" items you know that what you get is unique and not something your neighbor or friend will have. I have been to many of their events. AWESOME!!! check out their blog, they are always up to something fun & fabulous!
