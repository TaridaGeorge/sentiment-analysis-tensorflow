I was a big fan of Char's on University and Rural. After they closed Char's, I had to search for another Thai Restaurant where food is not sweet.After quite a few disappointing trails, I finally decided to trust in random picks. That's when I googled for Thai food and found La Thai. After the first visit, I knew that I am going to be a regular. The first time, the food was tasty but not spicy and I had to spice it up a bit to match my taste. The cook/waiter remembered that and when I went there next time, they made sure that my food is extremely spicy... that's when I realized that my search is finally over. Now I have a thai place where I will be eating at least once every week!
