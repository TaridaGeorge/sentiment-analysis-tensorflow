Adorable!  The inside of the store is quaint and has the most adorable selection of local goods for sale.  I completely fell in love with the collection of handmade frames made by a local artist. The outside is well maintained, the chickens fun (the coop is clean and the animals are happy!), and the picnic tables scattered around make it a fun stop.  I'll definitely be returning to this charming place!  

Well maintained, great selection of local goods, friendly service, and quaint setting.
