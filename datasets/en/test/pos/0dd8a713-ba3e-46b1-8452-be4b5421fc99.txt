We leased an apartment here about eight months ago with our daughter (we live in Bellingham, WA most of the year) and have been extremely satisfied with the Verandas.  The management and maintenance couldn't be better, although we're holding our breath now that recent staff changes are in the works.  The apartments are very quiet and we really like the location.  Fry's, Trader Joe's, LA Fitness and many other stores located within a mile or so.

We highly recommend the Verandas for folks who want a quiet, working class environment in a central Phoenix location.  If you want a party atmosphere - head over to Tempe or Scottsdale.
