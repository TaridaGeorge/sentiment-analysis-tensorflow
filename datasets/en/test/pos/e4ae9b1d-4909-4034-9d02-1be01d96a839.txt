I'm giving this 5 stars mostly because of the decor and feel of this little ghost town.  I did not do the mine tour or check into every place.  Just walking through this little town is very cool though.  You really feel like you are back in the old west for a little bit.  They don't have things like this where I'm from (Seattle, WA) and probably not in other northern cities as well.  So I would highly reccomend this for out of town people.  We didn't stay long, but it's a neat little walk through some cool scenery.  Would be a fun place to come grab lunch.  They also did a cowboy show when we stopped in.  Next time I would like to try the mine tour. The view of the mountains is also very cool.
