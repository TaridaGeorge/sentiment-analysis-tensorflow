I found this place courtesy of my fellow yelpers and was pleased to find the ratings were genuine. 

The owner, who was originally from Philadelphia, came to Scottsdale in 1974 and opened the deli in 1977.  Yeah, I am a nosy guy.

The hot pastrami sandwich was really exceptional.  I came back the next day to try the Italian Hoagie.  I looked inside the sandwich and found capicola. Yummy!  I took an extra sandwich to go, but it was soggy the next day.  So you need to eat the sandwich right there.
