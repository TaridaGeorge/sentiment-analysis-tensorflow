My wife and I visited Robyn about a month ago and got solid, no nonsense tax advice from a very knowledgeable CPA.  

If you have ANY questions about Federal or State taxes, Robyn is the CPA you should be going to.  Not only is she knowledgeable, but she's willing to take the time to help you understand the advantages of various parts of the tax code.  (She actually thinks taxes are kinda fun! How weird is that?)

I'll definitely be using her as a counselor to my family and small business in the future.
