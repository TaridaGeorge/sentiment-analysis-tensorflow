My networking group has just started meeting at Seasons 52 on a weekly basis in one of their private rooms. The menu was great, the food delicious and the wait staff very attentive. I am so glad to have this new restaurant the Biltmore area. I will become a regular patron outside of my networking events. As an interior designer, I find the decor to be elegant and very pleasing without being over the top. Well done!
