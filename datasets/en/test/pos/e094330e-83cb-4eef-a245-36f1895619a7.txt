The She G-spot has become a regular stop for us lately... it seems we're falling into a routine where every time we eat dinner at Pita Jungle, we stroll over to the G-spot for dessert.  Every now and then I can stay strong and just sample Jared's pick (usually lemon and raspberry), but last night - i felt the need to have my own!  I went with coconut and savored every bite!  It was the perfect creamy sweet treat,. and it had just the right amount of real coconut too... yum!

I love G-Spot even more for all of their 'People Love Us on Yelp' stickers in the shop - if you haven't noticed them, you haven't been lately... go check them out!
