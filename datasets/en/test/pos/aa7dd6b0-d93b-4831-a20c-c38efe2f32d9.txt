Hands down--best sushi I've had in Arizona. The tuna sashimi tempura was amazing. The flavors and textures were simply amazing. Top 5 sushi rolls ever.

The sashimi tasted like the sea and was very tender. We had the toro = also amazing. 

Sit at the bar for quick service with the occasional joke from the chef.
