I love the library and I love books. Whether I'm looking for cookbooks, how-tos or a good novel, I go to the library. A couple of years ago, for a short while, we had no satellite, cable or internet and I found great DVDs to check-out. We watched all the Chef Ramsey TV shows and I found a fascinating and short-lived drama about WWII. I once borrowed a work-out video so I could learn country line-dancing. Now that was a work-out!
