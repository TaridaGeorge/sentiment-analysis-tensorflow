I'm new to Scottsdale and have been working from home (which means out of coffee shops) the last couple of weeks--and have been pleasantly surprised by all the great indie options in Old Town (Sola, Winfield's). Echo is no exception.

Equally great atmosphere for doing work or just hanging out, Echo has the added bonus of a made-to-order lunch menu. To top it off, my americano came with a tiny little bite-sized sugar cookie, just enough to satisfy my afternoon sweets craving. I'm sold.
