Short and sweet comes to mind when I think of Cost Plus World Market. This is the only place in town that I've seen Bundaberg Ginger Beer. It is the most amazing ginger ale I've found. If you're in there some time looking for some imported furniture, beer, candy or such and walk by the ginger beers, stop and get a pack of Bundaberg. It's pretty much the best reason to even go in there.
