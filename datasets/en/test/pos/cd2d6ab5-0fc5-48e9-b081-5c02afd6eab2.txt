I was an out of town buyer and Brian represented me for over 2 years on my home search (6/2010-5/2012).  He has a commanding grasp of the Phoenix metro, very skillful and is very well connected to get deals done.  Moreover, He never gave my wife and I 'hard sell' tactics and always gave us the necessary space to make our own decisions.  Additionally, Brian worked very well with our mortgage broker and our closing went seamlessly.  Brian Flatley is a dedicated and true professional who we highly recommend.
