what a great experience! downtown really needed this: boutique hotel and great dinning!

I went there for lunch and we each ordered an entree: salmon, steak, and bbq pork. They were each delicious. I can't decide what I liked the best. I really enjoyed the artichoke hearts with my steak however, the bbq pork was to die for. Since I am a dessert lover we ordered the Peanut Butter and Chocolate one and the Peach Tart. Both were delicious..the peanut butter chocolate one was sooo rich, you should probably split it!

I'll definitely be back...thank you Province!
