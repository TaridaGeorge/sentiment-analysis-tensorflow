Pretzel Fondu is a must.  Besides the fact that I keep calling the place, "The Arrogant Bastard" instead of Butcher- I just love the name.

I had the fish and chips, which were pretty spectacular, not greasy, but perfectly fried and crisp with a ton of flavor.  

The setting is excellent, the ambience is relaxed and plentiful.  Just lots of space and coolness to it.

They have private "meeting room" dining areas too that closes off to the rest of the restaurant.  This is something that is needed downtown for the many private lunches that take place.

The bathrooms were really fantastic too- user friendly, I like that about a restroom.  Big flat-screens above the bar area too, which is good for the evening crowd.  

I can't wait to get back!
