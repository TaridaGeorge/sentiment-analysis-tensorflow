This is a great place to get a great tasting soup or sandwich.  The bread choices are all delicious and they have a variety of soups that change daily.  The staff is friendly and you can tell they really like being there and they are happy that you dropped in.  I have had more attention here than some restaurants that you would expect great service at.

They also have free wi-fi which is always good.
