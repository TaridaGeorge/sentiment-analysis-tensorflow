Great Trail! I love how you can do a full loop only backtracking for about 100 yards of the trail. The trail also offers connections to other more challenging hikes like Sunrise Peak, etc...

Bring your dog as there will be several other adventure pups for him/her to meet. 

The best part of this trail is the wildlife. In the past three months alone I have seen several lizards, rabbits, chipmunks, coyotes, and two large deer. Oh - and I almost stepped on a very large rattlesnake so be careful during the summer.  My foot landed about 5 inches from the snakes head. Most of his body was in a bush, however the snake didn't seem to mind that I almost stepped on it. Apparently they don't bite unless you aggravate them.
