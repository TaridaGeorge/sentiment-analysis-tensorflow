Quaint place.  The coffee here has skyrocketed in the last year with the hiring of some better baristas and the use of better coffee.  This was our place to frequent in the Mesa area, and left something to be desired in the past - now it's little less than a go-to place, worth the trip.  Great eats here too.  The owners are incredibly friendly and are always open to a good conversation.
