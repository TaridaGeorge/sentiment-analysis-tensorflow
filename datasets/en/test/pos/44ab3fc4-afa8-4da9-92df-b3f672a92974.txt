We were just there last night around 7pm for dinner, Dec 25th 2012.
It was a bit of a confusion with getting on the waiting list since no staff was at the front counter for the longest time even with tons of folks standing around, but eventually things got sorted out.  I am from Southern CA, Chinese, and am extremely impressed about the food!  
Wait staff (owners daughter and an middle age lady) was extremely friendly, even under the madhouse pace of trying their best to serve everyone.
I would go here every time i am in PHX.  There might be a wait, but the staff and food is excellent.
