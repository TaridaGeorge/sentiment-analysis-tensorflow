I thought that the foods would be to vegetabley but it wasn't! It was soooo good! Everything was fantastic!!!!! The woman at the ordering desk helped us out a lot! She was great! A little spicy but GREAT! This resturant is also great for kids! There is healthy foods in everything, but you can't tell because it was so good! My favorite happened to be the Paneer Butter Masala. Everything was really good!
