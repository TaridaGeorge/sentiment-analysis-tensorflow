I got a deal on LivingSocial about this place. I had passed by it many times but never knew it was there. I got the Mississippi Fish & Grits. It was delicious. I know my fried catfish and this was up there with some of the best I've had. Ideal brunch fare for sure. Huge portions. I'll probably be back before the end of the week!
