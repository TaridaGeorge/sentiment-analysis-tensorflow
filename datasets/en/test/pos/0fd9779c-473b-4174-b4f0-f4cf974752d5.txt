We have never had a bad thing to eat here.  Oh, I take that back. Over the years, things can't be perfect but on that rare occasion that something wasn't right or didn't live up to our expectation, apologies were made and the issue corrected.   Tonight, I had the pastrami sliders and a caesar salad..  the pastrami was fjantastic, not at all fatty. I was served 4 sandwiches which was a surprise based on the price and past experiences. I had only expected 3.  
Glad we stopped in again and I know we'll be back again.
