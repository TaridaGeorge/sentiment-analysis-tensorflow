Hands down, best steak of my life. We split a bunch of side dishes and they were all excellent, I especially loved the crab & truffle gnocchi and the lobster mashed potatoes (I know, that might have been a little too much). The service was fantastic. One thing to note is that it's very loud, we had a party of 6 and had trouble hearing each other. Don't let this stop you from eating at Mastro's though!

Take this advice: no matter how full you are, order the butter cake for dessert. I promise you won't regret it. I can't wait to come back here - hopefully sooner rather than later.
