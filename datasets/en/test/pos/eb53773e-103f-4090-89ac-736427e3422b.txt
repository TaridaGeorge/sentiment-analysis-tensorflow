In my opinion, the Chuck Box is One of the few places that, if you're an ASU Student and you don't go to, you didn't do ASU right. The burgers are brilliant and/or life changing and cheap. It's simple. Not exactly 5 star atmosphere, but you're not going for a classy place with candles, ties or suits. Hell, they have potato sacks on the ceiling. The place isn't pretty at all. If anything it's reminiscent of a sty. Still, you're not going there because it's pretty, you're going there because they have some burgers that can make you squeal with joy and push the limits of your belt buckle. These burgers set precedent for all burgers everywhere. It's part of the college experience at ASU.
