I can't say enough good things about Dr. Deka and all the wonderful staff at Paradise Valley OB-GYN.  I was originally referred to their practice from a very trusted friend who also happens to be a doctor.  Her whole hearted recommendation to use their practice as the "best around" was all I needed to hear and they have certainly lived up to the praise!  Dr. Deka oversaw my entire pregnancy and postpartum visits.  Her assistant Grey is also wonderful and very reassuring.  I've since referred 2 other friends who are pregnant to use her.  I couldn't imagine using anyone else for my next pregnancy.  She made every visit special and I'm able to look back on the entire pregnancy experience with the best memories.
