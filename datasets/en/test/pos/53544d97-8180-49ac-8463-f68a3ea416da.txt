Stopped by for a light dinner and drinks on a Thursday night.   Seated immediately and served some warm bread.

Drinks were great and didn't skimp on the alcohol.   We ordered a half dozen of the premium oysters and they were awesome.  Worth every penny.   The horseradish that came with them was really, really, really great.

Had to try the lobster bisque based on other reviews.   It was very good.  Not the best I've had, but very creamy and filling.    

Service was top notch.   Manager even stopped by to see how things were and chat.  I would eat here again without hesitation.
