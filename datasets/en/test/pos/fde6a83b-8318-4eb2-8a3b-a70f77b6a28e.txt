SUCH an awesome coffee shop!  

Very cool atmosphere, staff is super chill and friendly, free wifi, great drinks and a scrumptious selection of food & pastries.

DRINKS:  For those vegans or with food allergies, they have Soy, Almond, and Rice Milk.  While the americano and cappucino are good, the Green Tea Smash and Dark Chocolate Smash with almond milk are my favorites!

FOOD:  I've  had the Hummus and Tabouleh, a Turkey Cranberry Sandwhich, and a Pear & Jam Flatbread that was all amazing!  Also, they have lots of Gluten Free pastries (GF cookies, biscotti, twinkies).
