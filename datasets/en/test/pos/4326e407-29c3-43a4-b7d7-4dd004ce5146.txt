I live in CA but travel to AZ quite often for games. The owner worked with me on some special orders to ensure we could pick them up on game day when we arrived in town. I have been in the store a dozen times to pick up ASU gear. They have a wonderful staff, a great selection and decent prices. The best part? The store is owned and operated by an ASU Alum. This is my go to spot for any and all ASU gear purchases.
