I simply LOVE their asparagus and fontina cheese panini!  I ask them to add ham which makes it even more tasty and filling.  I tried it with chicken once and didn't enjoy it as much.  I usually eat a half and take the other half home for another meal unless I'm really hungry.  I also love the mini cupcakes that cost only 50 cents.  Such a deal and the red velvet ones are my favorite!  Yummy!
