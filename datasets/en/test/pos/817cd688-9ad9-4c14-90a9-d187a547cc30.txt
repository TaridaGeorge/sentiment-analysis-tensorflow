I had heard of Carly's through a professor at ASU, and he certainly did not let me down by recommending this place. The sandwich I had was really good, and there were plenty more on the menu that I would like to try. They had a decent beer selection, and I tried something new, which was actually pretty good.The atmosphere was laid back and kind of indie. Again, I am finding that this is one of those great downtown places that was practically empty on a Saturday night! How can this be? It was so good. I'm starting to wish more of Phoenix and surrounding areas would venture out of suburbia and discover the gems hidden downtown.
