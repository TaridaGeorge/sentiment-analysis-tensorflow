This place is a real gem!  I feel so lucky that it's right across the street from my house.

Fido's Funhouse is a wonderful doggie day/overnight camp, groomer and boutique.  I've taken my pomeranian there on a couple different occasions for both grooming and daycamp and I'm so impressed.  The place is immaculately clean, the staff is knowledgeable & friendly, and the dogs are well taken care of.

Day camp consists of either a full or half day of supervised play in their indoor playground (separated into big and small dogs).  Overnight means your dog gets 12 hours of play in addition to their own sleeping cabin and fleece bed (no cages here!) and 24-hour supervision.

Stop on in and take a tour of the place, it's so cool!
