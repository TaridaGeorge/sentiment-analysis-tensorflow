I had my hair done last week by Christa and it is the best hair extension micro link install I have ever had. Actually, it's the best hair extension install in general I have ever had which means something coming from me because I have been wearing hair extensions for over 10 years and have probably had extensions done by over 20 stylists. She took out my old extensions and put new ones in. There was no discomfort in the application and it doesn't even feel like I have extensions in. She laid them just perfect and had my 5" hair 22" without it looking like a really bad mullet. Everything blends well, I do not have that shelf look which can happen when one has short hair and long hair is added. I love my hair and will continue to use her as my regular stylist.
