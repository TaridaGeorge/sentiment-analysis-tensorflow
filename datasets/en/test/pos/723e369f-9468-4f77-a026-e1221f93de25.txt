Nearly a buffet of free appetizers (tabbouleh, hummus, soup, fresh bread, tzatziki) come with any of their kabobs and $5 for two gyros which are delicious as they are large.  The three of us walked away with more food than we ate and spent $25 for pretty much a four course meal... Not to mention it was all completely delicious!  Don't let its hole-in-the wall looks fool you!  If you like greek/middle eastern food you are doing yourself a disservice by not eating here.
