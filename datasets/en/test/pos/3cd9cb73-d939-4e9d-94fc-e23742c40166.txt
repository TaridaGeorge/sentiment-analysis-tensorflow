Yum yum yum.  Humus- unbelievable. Mojito - best ever. Salmon- delicious.  Steak tacos- I die ( gotta say that like Rachel Zoe) Apple cranberry crumble dessert with maple ice cream - I'm stuffed.
Best yet? You walk away patting yourself on the back for being a good boy/girl and eating a healthy ( but certainly yummilicious) meal.  Mom would be proud.
