Wow!  This is a very nice place.  Fancy upscale hotel with long winding hallways (you can get lost trying to find your room).  I enjoyed a bath in my room's oversized bathtub.  The bed was so comfortable...I slept so soundly here.

Downstairs is a bar with six TVs and lounge chairs/couches.  Outside  they have a lazy river pool where you can lounge on a tube and float down the waterway.  I walked into the gym just to check it out, but didn't take advantage of its cardio equipment or weights.
