I was totally impressed with this place! It is super clean, tons of machines, several change machines, and even games to keep the kiddos busy. The woman working (didn't catch her name) put all of my clothes in the dryer for me, so that was awesome. I saved so much time and was able to get some errands done! I would recommend this place to anyone who needs to use a laundromat once or every week!
