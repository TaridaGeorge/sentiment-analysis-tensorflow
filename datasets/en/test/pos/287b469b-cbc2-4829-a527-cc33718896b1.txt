this is our favorite bar in phoenix, we usually come a few times  a week. the bartenders are all awesome and they mix our drinks awesomely strong. also, the drinks are totally cheap. also, the karaoke on friday and saturday usually rules.

AND they finally got darts and a pinball machine back, so that's awesome. except, the pinball machine they have is the simpsons, which is super hard to get free games on. they should get addams family or twilight zone. 

as far as dive bars go, you can't really top this place: divey, cheap, strong drinks, video crack, pool, darts, pinball, jukebox, karaoke, nice people.
