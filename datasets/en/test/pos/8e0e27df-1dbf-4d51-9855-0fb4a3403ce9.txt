Colin M. did a masterful job filling you in on the facts about this business, so check out his review.  I can only second what he said.  

This is a real camera shop, stocked to the gills with lots of top-of-the-line stuff.  It would be easy to be intimidated but don't let that keep you from going into this fine establishment.

I have bought a few things here and they have always been very helpful and friendly.

You can find better prices on the internet, but no instant gratification on the internet.  And who is going to help you with a problem or answer a question when you have one?  Who will repair or clean your camera for you?  No, we need to support our local shops and if it means paying a few percentage points more, it's worth it.
