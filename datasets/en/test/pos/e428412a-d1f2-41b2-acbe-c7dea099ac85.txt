Generous sized piece of white meat chicken, southern fried (with zesty spices) laid on top of a oversized biscuit covered in white gravy. Just like my grandma used to make. So full of flavor, so filling. I could only eat half before my belly expanded beyond the reach of my pants. Best $8 I've spent all day! I'm going to Facebook stalk them so I can partake in some more of their other southern goodness!
