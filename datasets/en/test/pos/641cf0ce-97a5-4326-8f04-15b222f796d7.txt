What a great place! The owner is really friendly and knows his menu. Never been before, and his suggestions for my wife and I were excellent.  Value is outstanding, but be prepared to get messy as the beef is juicy and delicious. 

The place is very clean, the food came out quickly and looked great. 

Also, this place serves better burgers than The Habit. I just wish they had onion rings.
