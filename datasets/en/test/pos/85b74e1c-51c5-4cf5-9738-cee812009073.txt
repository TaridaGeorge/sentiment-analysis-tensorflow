This restaurant is a must when you're visiting the area. It's got a great vibe and ambience, the wine list is out of control, food amazing and the service is just above and beyond. We had the tiger prawns, Filet Mignon and sword fish...soo good. Take your time and enjoy yourself when you get the chance to visit cowboy ciao :)
