SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO glad this place is here in Casa Grande.  The owners (SUPER NICE) are from New Jersey which is where we are from.  The sauce on the pizza is like back east.  It is GREAT and VERY FAMILY FRIENDLY (which is helpful and nice).  Outside dining is HUGE and ATTRACTIVE.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT!
