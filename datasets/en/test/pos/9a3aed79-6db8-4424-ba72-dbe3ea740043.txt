What can I really say bad about this place, every time my wife and I go we get great service, great food and great pricing. I always go with there chinese chicken salad. My wife usually gets a chicken dish or the fish which both are amazing. She also gets the chicken sandwhich. I am not a huge cheesecake fan but I can see why everyone loves it so much. 

This place rocks, never had a bad experience here.
