HUGE parking lot.  Looks like TWO domed tents from the freeway.  Spacious and clean interior.  I enjoyed the giant projection screens in the poker room.  My eyes like to wander when I get bored with the game.  

The poker jackpot rules are different in AZ:

Aces cracked: $100
Full house cracked: a portion of the jackpot

Those are great odds.  My full house was beat by another, so I won $4700, the 'winner' won the pot AND $2350.  The seven other players at the table won $350 each just for witnessing the damn thing.  

Jackpot odds are never like this in NV and CA.

Downside: Had to file a W9 with the IRS.
