It was a quick trip to check my daughter after an accident at home, it was a very fast ER to DR visit and the entire trip was less than one hour. People were friendly and everything was explained in detail. It was very clean and they have a very nice setup for a new hospital. If you have ever been to Banner Gateway its almost the very same layout. In the future I would not mind taking a trip back here but I am in no hurry if you know what I am saying. Its a great place to be near to your house a state of art facillity.
