I really like trader joes. Lots of healthy affordable choices. Good organic selection. This store is very crazy though. Always busy and I swear the people shopping here are oblivious to rest of the world.
Maui short ribs = so good on the grill
With organic frozen jasmine rice! Great meal.
Maybe I'll try shopping late fri/sat night to avoid the crowds....
