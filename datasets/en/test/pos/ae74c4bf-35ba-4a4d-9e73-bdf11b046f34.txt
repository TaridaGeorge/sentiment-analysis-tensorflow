I have been to over 3 dozen Chinese restaurants in Phoenix area, this is by far the best.  On par with some of the Chinese restaurants I've been to in NY and SF.  Reasonably priced, the food is first rate.  The service is wonderful, with the owner usually on site to add a personal touch to each and every table's meal.  The interior is nicely set up as well.  The only down side is it's location in a strip mall.
