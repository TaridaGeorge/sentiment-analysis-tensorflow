Showed up on a Fri. night and was told the wait would be about 20 mins, which was expected. What was unexpected was that they were holding a complimentary wine tasting in the Java Garden so I would have a free buzz going before even sitting down. The house sangria was delicious and we split a couple of pizzas - the avocado and another vegetarian one that I don't recall the name of. Both were very good and I wouldn't hesitate to have either one again although I will probably try something new next time. It is very worth the prices, especially if you are buying wine by the bottle.
