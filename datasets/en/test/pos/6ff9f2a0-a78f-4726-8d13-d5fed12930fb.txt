Can you believe I've been here in the Valley for over 5 years and I discovered this place a year ago!  Zoinks!  Kazimierz Bar where have you been all my life - it was meant to be!  Totally awesome place especially on Mon, Thurs & Sun nights - live music foo!  Thursday nights are my favorite since I totally dig the jazz there.  Their wine flights are magnificent and so is their Antipasto dish - Bang!  Kazimierz has that underground feel; there are no windows!  Plus, it makes me look like I'm part of some secret society when I bring a frist timer.... :P
