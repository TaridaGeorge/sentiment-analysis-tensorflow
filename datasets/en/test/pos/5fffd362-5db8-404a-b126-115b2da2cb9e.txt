i loved it here! walking in it was really nice to see that almost every table was filled and that everyone looked pretty happy. we decided to sit at the sushi bar where we were greeted by the nicest sushi chefs ever! they were super friendly, talkative, and created some really delicious tasty goodness. it instantly felt like i was in someones living room having some really good food. 

shimagamo also has what looks to be an outstanding happy hour. i havent tried it yet but i plan on being a regular so i'll let you know how that goes :).

definitely the best sushi experience i've had since moving to Phoenix. love it!
