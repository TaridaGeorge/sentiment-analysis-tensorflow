I'm a visitor in town for a convention and I stumbled upon this place on yelp.  Just the location alone is awesome.  Really convenient to get to.  I've been here twice so far and have been more than satisfied with my food.  It's fresh and good.  Lastly the price wasn't bad at all either.  They are pretty reasonable and I give them credit for not trying to take advantage of the tourist or college students.  I would definitely recommend.
