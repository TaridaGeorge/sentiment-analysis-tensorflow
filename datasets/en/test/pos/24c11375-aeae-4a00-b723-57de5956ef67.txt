I love it...its better then Mojo, yogurtini, yogurtland, yogutology....its great!  All the yogurt places have the same toppings, but the actual yogurt is my favorite!  I love the plain flavor and I like it with strawberries and captin crunch cereal...or I like the plain with raspberry sauce...if I could eat this for a meal I would!  I am glad they put one nearby and its right next to pita jungle so it makes it even better!  The owner is very nice and is always very sweet when I have gone there.  Not to mention the prices are great!
