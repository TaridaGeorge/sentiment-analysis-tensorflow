Everything I have ever ordered here is AMAZING!!
I even turned my 'meat & potato's' husband onto this place who had lunch with me here  'just to please me'.
He now eats his lunch here EVERY Wednesday like clockwork!
We are both addicted! I adore the thai peanut bowl and hubby loves the mexicali burger. The garlic hummus is also YUMMY as is the No Harm Chicken Parm!!
My only gripe is that they dont have a 2nd location in North Scottsdale!!
(hint-hint!!)
