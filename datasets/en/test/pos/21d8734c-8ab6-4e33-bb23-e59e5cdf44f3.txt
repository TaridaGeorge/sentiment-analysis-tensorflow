I absolutely love the pizza here. It's made of sourdough thin crust and it's so delicious! We came here as a recommendation of a friend and have become regulars. The ingredients are so fresh and when they bring it out to you, that first bite is just glorious. I would highly recommend this place for all you pizza lovers out there.
