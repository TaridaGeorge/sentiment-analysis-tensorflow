I have to say that this place is the best of the best. I come here regularly, and the servers always recognize me (I don't know it that's a good thing or bad thing). It's a great place to enjoy wine and dinner before you head out for the night. Also, a great first date place. I brought my boyfriend (from a small town in Michigan) to Cibo for dinner, and he absolutely loved it... nothing like this in his small hometown. 

And the best part about this restaurant... the CREPES. Yes, they are absolutely delicious. I recommend the strawberry and nutella with whipped cream... YUM!
