I went here with my friends, took my mom, she loved it, and she is hard to please when it comes to food. The selection here is great. The simplest foods are made on the next level here, fun to come at any time if day, but at night it is especially fun. The environment is fantastic, modern design, great music, classy, and just a entertaining feel. I love their pita and hummus! I'd be happy with that, a friend or two, and some of their desert!
