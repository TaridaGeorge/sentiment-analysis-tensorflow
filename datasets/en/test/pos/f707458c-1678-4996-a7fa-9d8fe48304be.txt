I first tried out Pure Sushi at the South location, which I loved. Just last week, we ventured north to this location, and it is equally amazing. Nobody does it better (not RA, not stingray, not Kabuki, not Sushi Roku). The fish is exquisitely fresh, and the artistry is amazing. My favorites are the salmon sashimi, the white monster, the dragon, the philadelphia (with raw salmon), and the rainbow. Maybe especially the rainbow. The mango ice cream for desert is also fabulous. 
I just love this place.
