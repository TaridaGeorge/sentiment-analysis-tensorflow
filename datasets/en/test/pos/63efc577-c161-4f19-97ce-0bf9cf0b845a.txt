We ate here this past weekend while visiting Phoenix.  We enjoyed the food very much.  I ordered the Ahi Tuna Sandwich with garlic fries, my wife ordered the Chicken Pesto sandwich with onion rings and a chocolate malt, my mother and stepfather ordered burgers with sweet potato fries and fried zuchini and my 2 1/2 yer old got a kid's cheese pizza.  Everything was really good.  We all tried some of each of the sides.  Everyone loved the garlic fries.  The onion rings were very good.  My wife and mother liked the sweet potato fries. The pizza had really fresh sauce and the crust was quite good.  My wife's chocolate malt was the best we have had in a while.  The food was all very fresh and quite tasty.  We will definitely eat here again when we are in Phoenix.
