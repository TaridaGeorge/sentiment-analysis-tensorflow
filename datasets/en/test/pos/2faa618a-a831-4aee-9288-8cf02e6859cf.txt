Fabulous dinner experience!!  The staff was very attentive without being annoying.  Both the general manager and the head chef came to the table.  I'm a sucker for crepes and these were fabulous! One member of our party had the hanging meat at was flamb√© at the table.  Hard to find, in the parking lot of a defunct big box store, and very worth the search.
