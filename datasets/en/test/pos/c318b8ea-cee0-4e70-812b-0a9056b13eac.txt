I had an out of town friend in for a work conference who happened to be staying at the Biltmore.  I decided to bring her here, and I was glad that this was my selection.  We both thought that the atmosphere was great, and enjoyed good conversation while people watching.  We got a table that was not exactly outside but on the edge of the inside, which was the best of both worlds.  

We enjoyed the silly Vig entree names and both enjoyed our meals.  We had the guac and chips as an appetizer and I had the Hot Chick as a meal.  The guacamole was alright, but I'd probably only suggest my entree.  

This place is a drive for me, but if I happen to be in that part of town, I'd definitely visit it again.
