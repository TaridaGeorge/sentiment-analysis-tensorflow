Walking this place is like walking into Willy Wonka's fairyland.  A million beautiful flowers?  Check.  A mile of produce, much of which I've never heard of (and I watch Iron Chef)?  Check.  Amazing sushi samples?  Check.  Samples of EVERYTHING? Check.  Starbucks, amazing deli, smoothie bar, olive bar, salad bar, cheese department, bakery, fresh cinnamon sugar tortillas... Yes, yes, yes.  Covered parking?  Yes.  Valet?  Yes.  A soda machine where you can put some cherry syrup in your sprite?  YES!  AH!  TOO MUCH!!!

Employees in the store always offer to help me.  Maybe they work on commission and think I'm an easy sell when I'm walking around with drool coming out of my mouth.  Who knows?!
