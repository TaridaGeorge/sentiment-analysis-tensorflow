I'm Italian. From the NorthEast. 
Places like DeFalco's are all over the place back home. So, living in AZ (outside of the insane culture shock I went through when I moved here) left a void in my life!
But then, husband and I found DeFalco's.
The cheesecake! The lupini beans! The sandwiches! The pizza!
and OH MY GOD THE PROSCIUTTO!

When it's Friday night and Husband and I don't want to go out - we run to DeFalco's, grab some grub to snack on and watch a movie at home. Perfect!
