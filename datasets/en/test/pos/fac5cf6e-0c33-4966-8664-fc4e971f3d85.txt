I love this place! My favorite venue/bar in the Phoenix metro area.

Things I like:
- Owner and waitress: Jason (I think) and Taniesha - provide great service!
- Drink prices and quality: perfect! 
- Shows: GREAT bands come through here!

Things I don't like:
- ...sometimes it feels small when there are popular bands playing. I can live with it.

Yep, I will keep coming here! Definitely a cool, laid-back place to have a few drinks and see some good shows.
