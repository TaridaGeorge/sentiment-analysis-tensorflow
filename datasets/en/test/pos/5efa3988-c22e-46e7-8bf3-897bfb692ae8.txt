I don't think there is anything else to be said about Delux, it's been around and they offer nothing but great food; the Classic Burger and the Delux burger are both very delicious.  I like Delux better and I do recommend medium rare; the quality of the meat is unbelievable.  Love the sweet fries; I do prefer the mixture of both sweet and regular fries.
