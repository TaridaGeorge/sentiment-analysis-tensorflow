I've been here a few times, and every time has been impeccable.  This is, by far, my favorite fine dining restaurant in the Valley.  Fresh local food transformed into the most delicious meals by an amazing chef.  

If you are looking for the most romantic setting, or the best Phoenix food, or amazing service, or some combo of the above, please check out this restaurant.  You will be amazed!  I HIGHLY recommend the Farmers Feast with wine pairings.

And if you haven't been to the Farm, come a little early and wander around the Farm and check out the chickens and flowers and lovely pecan trees.
