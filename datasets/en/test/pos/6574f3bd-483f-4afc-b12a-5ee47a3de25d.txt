I have been here a few times now...its always clean, employees are always helpful and if you want a fantastic show...ask for Collin! He is so fun to watch. His skill throwing the scoops and the ice cream...best dessert show anywhere. He always has a smile and ready to help. Check it out...you will not be sorry.
