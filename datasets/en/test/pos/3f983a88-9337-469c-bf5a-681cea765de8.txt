I've been obsessed with this place ever since it opened. Whenever I visit Phoenix, I literally drive straight to Stax...no joke. The menu is unique (Mac n jack, sweet potato tots, every grind imaginable), the staff are friendly and on-top-of-it, and the environment makes me feel like I'm sitting at cafe on the beach, and not in the middle of pretentious Scottsdale.
