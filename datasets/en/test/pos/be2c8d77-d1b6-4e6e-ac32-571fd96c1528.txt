Ok.  So I read all the reviews on Yelp before usually making a final decision to visit a place.  The Gelato Spot, however, just so happens to be right by my work location, so it has become a convenient stop and a staple to my lunch locations.  The surprising thing about this place....
Not only is their gelato my favorite of all places around Phoenix/Scottsdale (try their seasonals - my fav was Canteloupe) they now serve phenomenal light lunch food.

First time we did lunch, I tried the margherita pizza, and the italian panini (ask for it warm).  mmm mmm....  mozzarella, proscuitto, home-grown basil... everything is so fresh!   I've now been back to try out their salads, paninis and other pizzas.  

This location is more touristy, but its worth a visit for a nice lunch and a yummy treat!
