I don't live in Scottsdale, but I do visit for work on occasion. I decided to treat myself to a massage this time and I am sure glad I did! Not only are the prices very reasonable, but this was definitely one of the best massages I have had. Chad is very personable and professional and he really got all of my deep knots out. This was no pure relaxation massage (although i am sure that they could do that for you), I liked that Chad knew which muscle groups he was working on. I left feeling much less tense. I will be going again next time I am in Scottsdale!
