Swung by Red Seven's Scottsdale store Grand Opening with some friends on Saturday.  I was impressed, although I shouldn't be.  I'm a repeat customer of Red Seven in Tempe, & Michael & his crew are a class act.  The new store is very well done & it was fun to get the tour of the store, see the work stations & check out how it all works.  My friends were intrigued with the no hassle computer leasing, the perfect solution for a couple of them that are not computer savvy.  If you, yourself, are not computer savvy, it's worth a call to Red Seven to find out about it.
It was my lucky day too - I won a nifty prize in their raffle!

Great location, easy to get to & a no-brainer when you are in need of computer service.
