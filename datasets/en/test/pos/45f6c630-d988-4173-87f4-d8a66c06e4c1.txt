I learned SO much on the 1pm tour about Cresote bush and its what has that fabulous desert smell. There were hummingbirds there and we also went through the butterfly exhibit. It was wonderful, you are up close and can take pics and they sometimes sit on your shoulder and in your hair. All the cactus were flowering when I visited in April and the whole place was beautiful and blooming. They apparently had an awesome Groupon for membership and stated they had hundreds of new members! They keep the place beautiful and after learning of the plant types there, you can see everything up close.
