Best tacos in Phoenix! I spent a summer in Guadalajara, Mexico, and these tacos remind me of a gourmet version of their street tacos. Soooo delicious! I go here at least once a week! I recommend the Pernil tacos and the Carne Asada, but I just recently tried the Empenadas and found them to be the tastiest that I've ever had. The people are great there and the cocktails are exceptional. They have some very unique cocktails like one with wasabi, but also have old favorites such as house-brewed sangria. Come at Happy Hour when everything is really cheap: $3 tacos and $6 cocktails.
