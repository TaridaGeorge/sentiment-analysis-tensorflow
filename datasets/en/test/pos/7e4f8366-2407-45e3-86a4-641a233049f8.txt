I loved hiking here. It is getting a little more crowded but is still very dog friendly. Parking off Coral Gables is a good idea. Lots of fun little trails to choose from but prepare for possible mishaps. Fun to boulder. The shortest trail is only 1.1 miles but there are plenty of opportunities to add on.
