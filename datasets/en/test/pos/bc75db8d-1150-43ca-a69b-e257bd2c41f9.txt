Omg...I'm telling you, the  grilled artichoke at Wally's is the absolute BEST in TOWN! 
In addtion, their Pot Roast is consistently one of my favorite dishes, and is so tasty I dream about it (sad, but true).
Today, for the first time, I tried their French Dip Two Ways, and elected to have priome rib for the meat, instead of short ribs), and it is bar none the best french dip in this town (so far!?).
Wally's french dip has a lot (and I mean A LOT) of prime rib, deep fried onion strings, swiss cheese on a soft, fresh roll. It comes with a side of fries, and you can choose the type of fries you want between regular, sweet potato or a mix!
The atmosphere here is always perfect, friendly and the food is fab!
