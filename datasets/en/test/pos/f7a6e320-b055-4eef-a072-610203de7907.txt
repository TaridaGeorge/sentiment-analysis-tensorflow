I HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH THIS PLACE!

I go on my way to work, and just love all the different smoothies that they have.  I think I have almost had everyone on the menu and I love adding the extra goodies like Spirulina or Whey Protein.  The person who owns it and their staff are hard working and put alot of effort into there stuff and you can taste the results.

Every sandwich on the menu is entertaining and not boring or the same ol same ol.  The bread used on the sandwiches is very fresh and soft as well.  The flatbead sandwichs are good too.

My favorite is the island combo where you can get half a sandwich and a smoothie for 6 bucks.  Just awesome.

oh, and also pick up a club card.  I have gotten a few free smoothies already.
