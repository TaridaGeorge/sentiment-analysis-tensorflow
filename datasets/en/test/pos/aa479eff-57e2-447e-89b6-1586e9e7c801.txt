last time i went here i had a small tiny issue.  But alas i was craving their delicious chicken!!! I went here along with my friend again and wow they have really upped the ante. The food was nice and fresh. I was pleasantly surprised in particular at how nice, fresh, and crisp the tomato and lettuce were unlike most quick food joints now a days (though i think chick fil'a sorta stands out at the top of the bunch).  The chicken was seasoned just right!!! (im sorta of a food connoisseur when it comes to these sorts a'things hehe).   workers were very kind and friendly. (ahem...MY PLEASURE...lol they're always suppose to say that when you say thanks, cracks me up everytime)

so overall not bad! now i think i'll tag a long when my friend goes here for lunch! also their sweet tea is awesome! A++
