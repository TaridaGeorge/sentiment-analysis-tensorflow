What a lovely place to drink in the little pleasures of life.  Sitting on the patio catching up with old friends on a beautiful afternoon, sipping on wine and snacking on cheese...you'll want to sit here for hours slowly eating and drinking.  I loved this place and definitely plan on returning. 

Pros:
-the food/wine
-upscale and relaxing atmosphere
-the patio

Cons:
-small parking lot
