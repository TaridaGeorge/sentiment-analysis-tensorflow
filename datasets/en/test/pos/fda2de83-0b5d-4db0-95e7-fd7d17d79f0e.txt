I absolutely love the freedom that Anytime Fitness gives you to go whenever you want. I go anytime I feel like it, even if that happens to be at 1:00am! I don't feel pressured to sign up for more or to get personal training sessions and I can workout the way I want to. The bathrooms are very nice and have personal showers and scales! Plus when I'm on vacation, I can go to the gyms there too so there really is NO EXCUSE not to workout.
