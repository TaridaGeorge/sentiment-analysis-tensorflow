It wasn't as much the appetizer and entree I ordered that was impressive as it was the amuse bouche  and the surprise gruyere popover.   The amuse bouche as an amazing chicken liver pâté and crostini that was the best I have ever tasted.  The Hamach starter wasI a unique preparation with the freshest of ingredients.  The rib-eye was seasoned perfectly, and done to perfection.  The nice touch was a roasted bone with marrow that did a nice job of enriching the steak.  The accompanying jalapeño potatoes were the perfect side.  In case you can't tell, I dig this place.
