I only enjoy the finer pizza's in life and this place is amazing.  Its more of a grab a slice for lunch or order take out for the family place rather than a sit down dining experience.  The pizza is amazing, I am a vegetarian so I usually hit the regular cheese or the veggie pizza and they are both awesome.  Enjoy!  Go for the big Jimmy... I dare ya!
