This is a really lovely place to get your nails done. It's put together well, it's clean, and the staff is so hilarious! They are so nice every time I come in. Pedicures are $20, but extra scrubs cost more. However, they'll ask you if you want them while they're in the middle of the pedicure, so be prepared to say no if you don't want it to end up costing more than $20. You don't need to make an appointment, I have never waited more than 10 minutes. This is a great neighborhood spot to get your spa on!
