Okay, so anyone following my reviews may know that most of them are 4 or 5 stars. This is because I tend to only review places I like, rather than become a complainer and taddle tale on my bad experiences. With that said:

The Yard House is by far the best place to find gourmet beers and gourmet food under the same roof in the West Valley. Their selection of beers is staggering, and the bar tenders know their stuff!

The food... well... I wish I had a thesaurus handy because every dish I've tried here surpasses my vocabulary involving deliciousness!!!

I would not only recommend the Yard House, but ask you please to visit.
