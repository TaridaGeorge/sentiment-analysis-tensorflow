Double Double Animal Style.  Love it.

4 things ons the menu, it is not about selection, it is about quality, and I really appreciate it.  And generally house my meal.

As usual the place is clean everywhere, people working here like working here, and the food is cooked and served quickly.  Everything is fresh.

The restrooms are ridiculously clean for a fast food joint, private stalls, stocked and checked regularly.  4.25 Flushes.

p.s. The combo menus do not save you any money, they just make it easier to order.
