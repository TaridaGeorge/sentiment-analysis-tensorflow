I went here for lunch the other day and loved it.  At first I was a bit skeptical, since the entire menu was on my placemat, but once we all ordered and I tasted their pizza, it was absolutely amazing.  The crust was thin, not cracker-like thin, and very tasty.  Our group got a couple of regular pizzas and one white pizza, which was out of this world.  I was not able to try the desserts or any beverages of the alcoholic sort (since my VP was at lunch with me), but I would say that next to Pizzeria Bianco, this is the best pizza in the valley.  Service was great, atmosphere was wonderful, and some of the best pizza I have ever had.
