Great hotel with excellent staff. Clean, easy to locate, great location, comfortable bed, nice shower and adequate pool.
Negative: there are no drawers in the room. Literally, no drawers. There are some shelves in the bathroom, but there is not a single drawer in the whole room. 
We had a 3 month old infant when we stayed here for 4 days and the drawers would have helped. However, not a huge issue.
I read some reviews that were annoyed with the air conditioner. I am a REALLY light sleeper and I had no issues with the air conditioner. 
Also, rooms on the west side are nicer because you get a sunset view of Tempe Town Lake.
