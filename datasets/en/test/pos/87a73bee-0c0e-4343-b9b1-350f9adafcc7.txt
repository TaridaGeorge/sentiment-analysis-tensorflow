this place is the reason why i had the wonderful idea to open my own coffee shop. 

they have quality coffee, not bitter, very smooth.  they have cute names for the drinks.  though i don't like banana, it's rad that the banana mocha is called the monkey and the engineer.

their pastries are very large, decent price.  haven't tried them though.

they close at 6pm, so it's best to just stop by in the afternoon, sit out back and just chill.
