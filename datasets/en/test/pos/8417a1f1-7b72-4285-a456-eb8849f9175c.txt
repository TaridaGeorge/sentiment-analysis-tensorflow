This place is amazing!!! The best Greek food I've ever had. We went for lunch on a Sunday, great service, friendly staff. They were out of the chicken I ordered but the server offered me an alternative and worked with me to accommodate my diet.  Everything tasted super fresh and very flavorful. Although we didn't have dessert, the special for that day was jalape√±o chocolate cheesecake, which I thought sounded very interesting and I will have to try when they have it again. I recommend this to anyone who wants fresh Mediterranean cuisine.
