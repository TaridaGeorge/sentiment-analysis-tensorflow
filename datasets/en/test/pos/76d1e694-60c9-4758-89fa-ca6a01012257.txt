The Greek's Grill made me feel like I was at my grandparent's house.  The owner greeted me so warmly, shook my hand and had me meet his wife, who was cooking in the back.  While the greeting was a lovely warm-up, let's be honest, I was there for food.  I don't know much about Greek food, so I found an item on the menu that looked delicious -the chicken caesar pita- and it was!  The pita bread was warm and soft and the chicken was out-of-this-world.  It had so much flavor and was so tender.  I would order a bowl of just the chicken and eat it.  My husband had the salmon pita and he raved about his order, as well.  The charm of the owners is a rare find among businesses and the food is fresh and delicious.  Definitely give the Greek's Grill a try. You'll thank me.
