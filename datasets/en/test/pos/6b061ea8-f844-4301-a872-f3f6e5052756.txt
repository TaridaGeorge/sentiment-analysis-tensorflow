Durant's is a throwback to early Phoenix - which is great if you like the time travel element. The food is great, though a bit expensive. 

Regarding the last review, they're right - stay away from the seafood. If you want lobster, go to the Salt Cellar in Scottsdale. For Steak and martinis and seeing the way things used to be out here, Durant's is a LOT of fun.
