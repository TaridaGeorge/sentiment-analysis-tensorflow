Locally roasted beans. Really great espresso. French pressed coffee. Made-from-scratch baked goods. Servers know coffee. Fun jazzy soundtrack. Free WiFi.

What more do you need? I've been going to this place on and off for ten years, and their espresso has always been among the best. I just wish I would've been smart enough to buy a house closer by!
