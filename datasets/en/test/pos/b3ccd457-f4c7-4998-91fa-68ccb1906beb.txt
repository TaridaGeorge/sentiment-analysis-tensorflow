Mmmm mmm good!  After going today I'm mad at myself for not going sooner because I've been missing out!  I ordered the Monterey omelet which is 3 egg whites, turkey meat, bacon, tomato, avocado and cheese and it comes with country potatoes and an english muffin.  All of those things were DELICIOUS!  The textures and flavors of the omelet just blended perfectly together, soooo good!  The country potatoes were awesome as well, a little crispy on the outside but still soft and fluffy on the inside and they had a great flavor as well.  I'm getting hungry just thinking about it again so all I can say is go check it out yourself!
