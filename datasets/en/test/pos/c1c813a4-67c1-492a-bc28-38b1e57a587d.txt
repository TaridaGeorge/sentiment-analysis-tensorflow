Blood orange mojito is purrrfect. I hate sickly sweet drinks but this was perfect. As were the empanadas, spinach salad, and horchata bread pudding.

SO WISH they were in Seattle!... 

Don't be discouraged by the random location (It's a bit scary); the actual venue has the cutest, sunniest courtyard and intimate indoor seating area too.
