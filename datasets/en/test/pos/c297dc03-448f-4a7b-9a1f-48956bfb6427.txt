Last weekend my husband and I returned to Firebirds for lunch. I had the most fabulous barbeque chicken sandwich. My husband got the barbeque burger but was less than satisfied. He requested to have his burger with a little pink in the middle but when it came out it was definitely overdone. The waiter and manager immediately made things right and got him a burger that was the way he requested. They also insisted that we choose a dessert to compensate for the mistake. We ordered the carrot cake that comes with salted caramel on the side. Needless to say it was AMAZING! The waiter told us next time to definitely try the ribs since we loved the barbeque sauce. I think we will be returning soon to try it!
