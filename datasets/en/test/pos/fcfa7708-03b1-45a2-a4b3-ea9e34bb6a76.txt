I LOVE ELIANA'S.

I grew up in Phoenix, and I have been going to Eliana's for as long as I can remember (all the way back to their old location.) The food is delicious, the atmosphere is warm and inviting, and the people are really nice. 

I love the chicken breast with red sauce and cabbage on top, and the beans are fantastic. Of course the tortillas and pupsuas are amazing too! And Eliana's lemonade is delicious in a way that I can't quite put my finger on.

Eliana's is always one of my first stops when I'm back in Phoenix, and it definitely deserves five stars!
