So I'm near the back door area.  And there are these women hovering and waiting for the latest items to come out.  The Ebay mafia is there too.  They guy gets 5 feet and people are grabbing stuff.  

Later on as I leave the store, there are women on the stairs discussing their hauls.  References to how they tell their husbands they went to Curves.  But of course they shopped.  Those ladies hadn't seen the inside of a gym in a decade. Not only did they live in doube-wides, they were double wides.

Still a great place for the occasional deal.
