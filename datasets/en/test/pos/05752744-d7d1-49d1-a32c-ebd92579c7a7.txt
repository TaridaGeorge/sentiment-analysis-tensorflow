Awesome location to just go hang out and grab dinner and drinks. Love their late night happy hour and you really can't beat their chicken wings - golden and mild, please! My husband and I tend to here about once every 2 weeks but one weekend our friends were in town and we found ourselves here 3 days in a row....they loved the wings just as much as we do. Bottom line - always a great go to spot for casual dining and hanging out. Put it in your rotation, like, now.
