best Chinese food in the valley. I pretty much don't go anywhere else.

I don't really understand what that other reviewer's problem is with the lack of windows? it's not like the place is a dungeon. it's a somewhat dim, peaceful restaurant.

Golden Gate special shrimp with walnuts is one of the most delicious things to eat, ever. their hot & sour soup is bomb. and their fried rice is delightful & not overly, disgustingly greasy. this place is so much better than the myriad of stupid "Chinese" chain restaurants or nasty take-out type places. for realz.
