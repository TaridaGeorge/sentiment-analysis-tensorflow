This place is hidden, and hard to find for someone whose not familiar with the area.  Great people, great martinis and great customers.  My favorite bar in town.  The people who work there have been around for a while.  They know you by your name and they feel comfortable to shake your hand or give you a hag......  Sofia Lauren Martini and some oldies are one of my favorite drinks at Merc.  They have another one in NY which i have been there but i prefer the one in Phx.
