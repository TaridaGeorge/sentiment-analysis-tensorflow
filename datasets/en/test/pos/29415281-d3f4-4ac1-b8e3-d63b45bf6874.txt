One Liner: 100 Beers On Tap!

Food: (scale of 0-4) 3.2
Anything that starts with 100 beers on tap automatically gets 3 stars before I even get into the food. The food was great. First of all, the firecracker wings had one of the most creative sauce that was sweet sour with a nice kick at the end. Then comes the Chilean sea bass. It was perfectly cooked with a soy based sauce on it. The baby bokchoys were also nicely done. Consuming this food while trying one beer after another, you just can't beat that even in 120 degree heat.
