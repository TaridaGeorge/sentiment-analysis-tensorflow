I am so glad to have rediscovered Sahara at its new location! I've been on a quest to discover the best hummus in Phoenix and when this place closed at its old location, I was sure that the best stuff was gone forever! But it's back, still run by it's original Iraqi owner, and just as delicious as before. The tahini-rich hummus and babganoush are the best around and the grape leaves are stuffed with saffron rice and lots of herbs and spices. My favorite thing to do it order a couple of lemonades, the vegetarian platter, and one of the pits sandwiches (the kuku is pretty tasty) and share it all with a friend. The baklava isn't bad either. Oh, and it's cheap!
