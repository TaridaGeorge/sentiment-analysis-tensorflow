It's been 5 months since my last review of this one, so just a note to say that I still think it's great!  Today I enjoyed unlimited tossed Italian Salad, a bowl of Pasta e Fagioli Soup, a bowl of Zuppa Tuscana Soup, a bowl of Chicken & Gnocchi Soup, & several bread sticks.  Their soup is just unbeatable, & all this was only $6.99, with more of everything available at no extra charge if I had wanted it!  Just right atmosphere & service too.

Woohoo!     :-))
