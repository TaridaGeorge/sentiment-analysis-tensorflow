Had another fantastic lunch at Blue Adobe Grille. 
Chips and Salsa were fantastic...love that spicy fire-roasted salsa.
Had the Carne Adovada, which is tender pieces of pork simmered in a really great red sauce.  Served with some really flavorful rice and delicious beans, along with their fresh tortillas (ask for an extra tortilla, because you'll want it).  I love to tear off a piece of tortilla and use it to grab some meat/rice/beans and pop the whole thing in my mouth.  Delicious!
Had to take 1/2 home and ate it for dinner!
