I really enjoy this Starbucks and wish it was closer to my home. Most Starbucks are created equal as far as product goes but this location offers superb customer service. The employee working the drive-thru is always incredibly friendly and makes small talk..a nice gesture that doesn't happen very often anymore. Will return whenever I can for my caramel macchiato!
