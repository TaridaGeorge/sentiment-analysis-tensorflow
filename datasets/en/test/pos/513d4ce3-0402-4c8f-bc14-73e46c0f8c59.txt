The coffee here is anywhere from decent to good, never had something burnt tasting, and the tea selection is really nice for people who like to have a tall, icy or hot, cup of refreshment! 

This location also accommodates larger groups really graciously, with friendly and professional staff that is fast and great about getting everyone's orders in order. 

They have a good selection of delish pastries, muffins, and while I have not tried any sandwiches I hear they are good too! 

Really good spot to duck in to from the chaos of the big shopping center and enjoy some quality coffee time!
