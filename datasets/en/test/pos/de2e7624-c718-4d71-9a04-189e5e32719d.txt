really too good to try anywhere else. i think i will go somewhere else and give 'em a try, then the disappointment when they do not come close has sealed the deal for me. i will only do bobby q for bar be que from now on. 
until they slip up or something goes amiss i will give them my loyal patronage. they didn't even mess up a take out order, so any and every is top notch here in my little tasty intake. yummy in my tummy and that's a big tummy!
