They will forever be my favorite place to eat when I'm wanting pasta!
Let's start with the bread. It's alway fresh and the butter is easy to spread
Then the salad is great with the pesto ranch yummmm! 
Every pasta I have gotten I've never been disappointed with. My favorite is the mizithra cheese on one side and meat sauce on the other. AMAZING!
