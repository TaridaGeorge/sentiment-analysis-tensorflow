When I lived in Chicago, I felt like I was starved for good Chinese food in my neighborhood. I was close to Chinatown, but could never get organized enough to be the crowds.  But in Phoenix, I have Flamingo Palace. AND they deliver. What is it with delivery in Phoenix? When I'm lazy, I want food at my door. And I'd like to have more than pizza as an option. Anyway. I love their beef skewers and their moo shu pork. Their beef and broccoli is also yummy. I've tried lots of other things, but these are my favorite. And I think their chicken fried rice can cure the common cold.
