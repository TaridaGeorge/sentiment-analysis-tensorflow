Totally delightful. On a nice day/evening, this is the best patio to have breakfast (only on weekends), lunch or dinner. Everything is good. They have loads of vegetarian options and if something comes with meat they are down to accommodate. Some of my highlights: The Margherita pizza is legit, nuff said. Quattro Formaggio pizza add balsamic onions for a total treat that is kind of like the best french onion soup ever. The antipasto is so good (I get it without meat). The Burrata is really creamy and delicious, I sub the meat for tomatoes with pesto. Ho shi! Last recommendation, the crepes. Any of them. Oh, if the day is less than delightful, inside is completely charming as well. Basically, just go. You'll love it.
