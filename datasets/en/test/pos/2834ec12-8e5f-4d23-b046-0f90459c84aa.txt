Favorite theatre by far. I love the feel of the location and even enjoy the walk to the theatre by the fountain and fireplace. As for the theatre, great as well. 

One of my favorites is their Summer Movie Fun program that allows me to take my kids once a week to watch a film. All shows have been family friendly and best of all my kids love them. It is very cheap (around $1 a movie) and a great way out of the heat for a couple of hours!

Plus they have multiple flavors of that popcorn seasoning that is just to die for !(:
