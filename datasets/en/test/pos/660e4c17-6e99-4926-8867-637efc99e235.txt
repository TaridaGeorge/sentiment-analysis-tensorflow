Another trip to Arizona and another trip to Roy's. Certainly a different experience than I had the last time. Friends were talking about the "Aloha Happy Hour" from 4 to 6 pm so we stopped by. Their outside patio is probably one of the nicest spots in town. 

Everything on the happy hour appetizer menu is $5 and trust me my party tried them all. They also have a special 'cocktail" menu (everything is $5) if you are looking to expand beyond wine and beer. 

Happy hour can include anything from crispy lobster potstickers, lobster spring rolls to mini burgers or tenderloin tips. All delicious and certainly enough to fill even a hearty appetite. Our server "Rebecca" was not only very attentive but also very knowledgeable and helpful in making our menu and drink selections. 

A sure "winner" and probably one of the best deals in town.
