Do you miss NYC and the neighborhood Bagel shop...Well it moved to Phoenix.

Bagels are great with a crust/shell and soft insides, not just browned bread.
Excellent base for Spreads and Sandwiches

Want to support a local business, this seems to be a family run business.

Sandwiches are great  as are the cream cheese spreads, smooth and tasty.

But I think the best part is the owner, welcoming and friendly and he remembers you after you have only been there ONCE.  I think he is from Jersey so it must be Jersey hospitality,,,Great to be welcomed into his business every time you step through the door.

No need to tell you so support local business, go get the best NYC bagel in Phoenix.

Just  happens to be in Awatukee.
