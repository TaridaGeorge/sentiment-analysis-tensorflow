This place is so awesome! You feel like you're in a little, off beat restaurant in Chicago or New York, instead of Phoenix! The service is very friendly. It's a small place but the food is excellent and big! If you've never had a pasty, you must try it! It's like a pastry filled with love! 

I usually get the Cajun Chicken Pasty which is filled with spicy chicken, bacon, ham and swiss cheese! Today I'm trying the pork sausage, potatoes and cheese!
