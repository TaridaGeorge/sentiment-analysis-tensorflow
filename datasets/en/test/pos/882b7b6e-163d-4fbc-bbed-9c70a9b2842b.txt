What a fun little place to visit while I was on my spring break vacation! The building was an old house that just as fun walking through as looking through the delightful selection of vintage clothing.There was so many clothes to look through, vintage western shirts, dresses, coats and an AMAZING selection of jewelry. 
The owner is very friendly, nice to talk to. I am definitely coming back to Cheap a thrills on my next vacation. Oh and don't forget to look in the building next door that has furniture and a scattering of home decor and fabric.
