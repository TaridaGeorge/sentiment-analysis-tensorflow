My husband ate here one day for lunch, and wanted to go back that night for dinner.  It's THAT good!  

I tried it the next day and I would have gone back the same night for dinner, too, if I wouldn't have still been so full.  It is THAT good!!

The front parking lot is tiny, but there is a gravel lot in back, and the dining room is a bit small, so if you plan to eat there around regular lunch or dinner hours you might be better off ordering pick up.
