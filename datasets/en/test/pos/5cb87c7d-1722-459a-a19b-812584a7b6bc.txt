I love this store! The staff is always helpful and friendly. Their produce prices are the best in town and usually super fresh. I love their fish counter and all their meats. The bulk bins are great, good selection, always fresh and great prices. Check out their spice bulk jars too! They have great selection for no- dairy, vegetarians, and gluten free diets. I highly recommend this store! They also have a sandwich special at the counter for lunch everyday! Eat in or take out!
