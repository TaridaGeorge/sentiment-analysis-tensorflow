so we returned tonight for the annual "buy one entree, get the second free" labor day special, except this time, we made reservations. 

i had the seared redfish which was absolutely delicious....so buttery, flakey, and crispy. side of snap peas which looked like they'd just been picked and glazed were totally sweet and crunchy and delicious. also a side of the truffled mac-n-cheese: rich and creamy, earthy and filing. 
my gal had the swordfish and the little 'salad' that comes with it made it a salty/sweet delectable meal. 
my apple and walnut salad was good....
i only ate half mine to save room for dessert- the p-butter and chocolate smore....hot damn. i love dessert.
