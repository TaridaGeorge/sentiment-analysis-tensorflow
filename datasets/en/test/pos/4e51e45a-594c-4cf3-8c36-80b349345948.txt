Very excited to take more classes here.  I took my first spin class on the RealRyder leaning spin bike and loved it.  I just bought the special advertized here on yelp for the month so that I will have no excuse not to come back to CoreBalance Studio to try the other classes that they offer.  This is a new space... right now they offer barre classes, spin and yoga.  These are all the things I love now if they would only add Pilates my life would be complete (wink, wink)
