We were quickly seated, promptly served and the waitress was very attentive.  The manager came by making his rounds to make sure everyone was being taken care of.  Their rolls were just like Grandma used to make. I had the 8 oz filet medium rare w blue cheese and It was so tender it melted in my mouth like butter.   Soooo good.  Will definately return !!!!!
