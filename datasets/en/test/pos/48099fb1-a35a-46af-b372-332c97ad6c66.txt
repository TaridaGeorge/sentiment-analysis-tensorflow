Great happy hour, I can't believe I'm saying this, but their sushi is definitely better than their sister restaurant Stingray, where I USED to be a regular until I came here. Happy Hour is 1/2 off house sushi, appetizers and drinks. The prices are similar to stingray but with a much bigger selection, not only for the sushi but for the appetizers and drinks as well. I will be back...ALL THE TIME!  Try the Astro Boy!
