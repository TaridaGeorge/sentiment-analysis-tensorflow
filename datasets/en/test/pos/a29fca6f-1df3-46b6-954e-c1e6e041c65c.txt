It didn't smell funny when I walked in!  Staff was really helpful, especially when I spotted the Kate Spade bag in the case.  Of course, being the purse whore that I am, I had to buy it.  
They had high-quality used and vintage clothing as well as electronics and appliances.  There's a stereo receiver I eyed for next paycheck.  $40!  Wait, I didn't tell you that.  DON'T BUY IT.  
I spend about $50 on the purse, a skirt and shirt.  
Oh, and if you need a fondue set, they have one.  Just invite me over when you use it, K?
