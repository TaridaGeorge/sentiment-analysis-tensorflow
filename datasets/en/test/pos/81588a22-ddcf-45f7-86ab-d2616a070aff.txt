This place is utterly fantastic! I had been missing good Turkish food since Efe's closed, and then I found the Turkish Kitchen which is owned by the original owner of Efe's. I agree with previous reviewers --- the bread is fabulous. All of the grilled meats, especially the ground lamb dishes, are tasty and flavorful, and everything is arranged nicely on the plates. The option of having bulgur wheat instead of rice is a bonus. Highly recommended!
