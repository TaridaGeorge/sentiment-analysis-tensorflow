I have ordered flowers 2X from Rachel and both times I have been 100% pleased with the results. Rachel listened to exactly what I wanted and didn't try to upsell me on a more expensive bouquet. She makes the ordering process easy over the phone, and I always feel confidant she will deliver a beautiful arrangement. 

Both times I needed them for delivery and they were always delivered on time or ahead of schedule.

Highly Recommended!!!
