A perfect Sunday night consists of Streets of New York Hawaiian Pizza + My Couch + A Bottle of Red. 

Now, I'm drooling and it's only Tuesday. There's something about their pizza that is perfect. The consistency, the thickness/thiness of the crust and the flavors of the ham and pineapple. I love it. Plus, their ranch and peppers for dipping and extra sin are the way to go. 

Be sure to look in those cheesy coupon packets that come in the mail - Streets of NY typically has good coupons which help. They're a tad expensive but so worth it. I think the 18" Hawaiian (don't judge us) is $23.
