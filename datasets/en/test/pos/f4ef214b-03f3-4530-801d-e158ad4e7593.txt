Be advised, this review is based ENTIRELY on the beer selection that Papago has.  The food and service are merely OK and leaning to the "Meh" side.  But the availability of truly great beer is a thing of wonder.  And, the best part?  You can serve yourself to bottled beer in their refrigerator cases.  It's almost like getting up and going to your own fridge.  Except my fridge doesn't usually have Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA or Rogue Chipotle Ale.

Papago also makes their own beer, but that require actually going to the bar and waiting for someone to wait on you.  And, really, who has time for that?
