I don't get it.  Why did people dislike this place?  I used to go out of my way to come here, simply to avoid the crowds.  I didn't have to worry about seating, and I thought it was a nice enough theater.  I remember going to see The Weather Man there; I was the only person in the theater, and it felt like my own private screening.

Oh well.  It's closed now, so I guess people have gotten their wish.  Still, I'll miss this place.
