Once again, love Green! Tried the diablo red rice bowl with mock beef. SO GOOD! I don't know why I think I can only eat half and take half home with me. Their food is so tasty I end up eating the whole thing! 
Friendly counter staff, quick turn around time with the food, good sized portion, great selection. I have yet to try any of their desserts, but I was starring at a couple customers enjoy their soy sundaes and it reminded me to try one of these treats next time!!
