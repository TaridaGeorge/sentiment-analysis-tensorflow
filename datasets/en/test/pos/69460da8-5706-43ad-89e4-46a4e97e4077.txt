All I can say is WOW! I've lived in Northern Italy for a year and have been looking for a pizza to compare and have never found one...until now!  It is exactly like the pizza in Italy... all the way down to the crispy edges.   Too bad I'm not from Phoenix or I'd eat here every day.  The place is small and everyone goes there so go early.  You will not be disappointed.
