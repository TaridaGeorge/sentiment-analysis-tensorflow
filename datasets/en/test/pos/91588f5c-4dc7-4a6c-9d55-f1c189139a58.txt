I just did the photography for Yelp's "Little Yelp of Horrors" halloween party last night at 12 West Main. The event turned out great! I don't think it would have been quite as fun anywhere else. The Staff at 12 West Main are kind, friendly, and super easy to work with. Coming from a photographers prospective 12 West Main is a great location for weddings and all sorts of special events. It's industrial chic design leaves the doors open for so many different options. This place has great texture with red brick walls and beautiful industrial concrete floors. A versatile venue offering excellent catering, full service wet bars and more, 12 West Main is the Bee's Knees!
