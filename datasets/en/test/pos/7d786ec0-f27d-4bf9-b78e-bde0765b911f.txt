I LOVE THE Pink Spot!  
IT is so cute inside and smells soooooo good! the staff is ALWAYS nice! The ice cream is to die for, where else can you get a home made ice cream taco or cookie sandwich, chocolate covered bannana, and bond bonds.... Last night I had my first European Sunday! YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
