This store is so cute. Always so organized & neat, and very reasonable prices. All of my garments from here have lasted for months through multiple wears, washings, & dry cleanings (which you can not always count on these days unless you pay high $) The woman who works mostly M-F during the day, I can't remember her name :( is so nice and helpful. Always informative regarding sales, etc. and I never feel pressured to buy things or spend $ I don't want to. Definitely check it out for cute, cheap (around $50 & below) dresses and darling accessories!
