Always a great experience at both locations. The food is great, menu options are excellent.  If you don't want a burger they have salads.  Great toppings and they are so fresh and they have ranch as a side for dipping or adding to the bun. Love it!!!!  Oh and the RICE CRISPY TREATS are the bomb.  I always have to get at least 3 when leaving. Yum Yum.
