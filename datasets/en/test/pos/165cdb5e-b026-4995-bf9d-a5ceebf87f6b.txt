I just ate another one of Lee's terrific Sandwiches. Here's a [place that sets itself apart by baking all of it's own bread. That may not sound like much until you bite into a fresh Baguette that wraps around your sandwich. Whether it's a traditional selection, or a grilled pork or chicken sandwich you won't be disappointed.
My Favorite is the Special Combination or "Dac Biet" Which is totally different unless your Vietnamese. It's worth driving out of your way just to eat at the terrific Sandwich shop. Prices are very reasonable, the foods great and the service is terrific.
