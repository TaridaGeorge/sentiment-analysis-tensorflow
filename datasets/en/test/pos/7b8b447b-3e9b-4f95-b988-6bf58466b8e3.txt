Went in on a Wednesday around 1:30, it was nice out so we sat on the patio. We were in a rush and the server was great, he pointed out the fastest items we could order. Ended up having the "naan-which"; a chicken for him and a tofu for her. LOVED IT!! The server told us all about the fun events they have and can't wait to take advantage of the "date night" special! The wine bar looks AWESOME. 
This Indian food with a modern twist is a perfect balance for a couple like us. Thanks for the mid-day pick me up Bombay Spice!
