Saw this little shop while driving in phoenix. Stopped on a whim and am SO glad that we did. Very creative stuff and the prices are not bad at all! Talked to Leonardo and we were mesmerized by him- full of creativity, great vibes, and a kind heart. Don't come across people like him or places like this very often- check it out if you are in the area, or if you aren't!
