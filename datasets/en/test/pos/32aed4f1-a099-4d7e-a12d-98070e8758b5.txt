So um we really, really wanted some Swedish meatballs one day. Then low and behold we landed at Beaver Choice. Best. Accident. Ever.

This is a family owned business. We were the only guests. The Scandianvian son fawned on us. We had to sample EVERYTHING. I mean we had two heaping full plates of samples, before we were allowed to order. He insisted! It was so amazingly awkward. 

Truly though, very gracious people. It's a gem of a place.
