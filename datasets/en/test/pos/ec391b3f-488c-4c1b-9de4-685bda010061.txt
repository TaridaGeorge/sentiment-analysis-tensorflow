What can I say, I'm light rail hard.  I'm a public transportation junkie.  

It has kind of replaced the red line if one is on a venture to the depths of the west side.  It is much quicker than taking a bus.  It goes from Tempe to Downtown Phoenix, which is the ride I'm abusing right now.  It runs smooth, and I only saw it be incredibly packed on the first days of it's opening, when everyone had "light rail fever".  The fare for it is cheap and the all day works on the buses too.  There's really nothing I can say bad about it other than that I want more.  More distance, more directions, more light rails.  Don't let the petro-chemical anti-environment puppet masters control you and take the light rail.
