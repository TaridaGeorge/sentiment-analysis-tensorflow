I traveled far and wide, convinced many friends and get myself to this cute little wine bar. The outside patio is gorgeous, especially in the spring and fall. The inside is just as beautiful with a warm and comfortable modern feeling.

The menu is so uncomplicated with delicious bruschetta and cheese plates. I require not much else other than these when drinking copious amounts of wine nectar. However, I remember a special I believe on Mondays with half price bottles and pizza from across the street. It was unbelievable. 

The staff was so nice and gracious when minor mistakes were made. It is definitely worth the trip when I was staying across the valley and would go again and again.
