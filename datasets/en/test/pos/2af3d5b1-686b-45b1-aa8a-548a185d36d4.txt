I discovered this restaurant a few years ago and have yet to find a better Thai restaurant in the greater Phoenix area.  The restaurant is surprisingly slow considering how fantastic the food and service is.  It's not often that you find a place with amazing food and no wait for a table!  My favorites are the tom ka gai soup and curry noodles. 
Nearly every time I've gone here, the hostess/waitress always remembers us and is very courteous & friendly.
If you like Thai food, you have to check this place out!
