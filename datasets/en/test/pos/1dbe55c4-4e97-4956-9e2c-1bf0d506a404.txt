The Gyro is HUGE, piled high with meat, served with fresh tomatoes and onions and a just right tzatziki sauce.
I am a big guy and can eat my fair share but this is almost to much for me to eat in one sitting, you could easily split one in half and share it.
The staff is friendly and welcoming, while we were waiting we were given a sample of home made lentil soup that was simply amazing and a terrific start to a great meal. I wish other places had this level of quality and customer appreciation. Its a little out of the way for me, but well worth the trip every time. It tops the standard by which Gyros should be judged.
