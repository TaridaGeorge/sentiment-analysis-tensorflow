If Ruths Chris is too pricey and pretentious this is your kind of place.

The ribs are delicious fall off the bone tender but what restaurants call a full rack isn't a full rack so if you want a rack like you buy at the store you wont get that here.  The T bone and Rib Eye's are amazing, could use less salt for me but excellent steaks.  The service is warm, friendly and attentive NO COMPLAINTS, well worth $60 (including tip) for a T Bone, prime rib and fixings plus a beer and a frozen drink.
Ended up with enough food for 2 to have lunch the next day.  Dressing is made fresh, if you don't like cheese on yoru salad order without or get the Cesar its fantastic, ask for extra dressing and put in your doggie bag for the next day! its that good!
