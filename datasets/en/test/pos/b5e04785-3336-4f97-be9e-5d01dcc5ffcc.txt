This is the best BBQ and pulled pork I have had since Virginia! I was told it was good but could not fathom it until the first bite, then the second and third.......... The flavor carried over to all of their meats served and everything else at the buffet was worth the 20 minute lunch wait. I got the buffet not because I actually eat enough to get a lot of food but so I could try a little of everything. Too bad only open for lunch but in today's economy that tells you something if they can make it only serving lunch.
NOT greasy as some have tried to say - I cannot stand greasy food and it's a BBQ joint of course the meats got sauce........
Now GO!!!!
