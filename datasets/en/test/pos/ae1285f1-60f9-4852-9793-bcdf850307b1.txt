This comfortable little cigar shop is hidden in a strip mall next to an off-track betting bar and a nail salon. The leather chairs are perfect for enjoying a smoke after rifling through the well-priced selections in the humidor. Mike, the owner, is incredibly friendly and doesn't mind if you want to pop in a movie (which they have quite a few choices readily available) on the flat-screen and eat your lunch while you kick back. 

Keep an ear open for when they have a customer appreciation day. The last one included free pizza, a cigar, scotch tasting, and a soda. Can't turn down a find like that!
