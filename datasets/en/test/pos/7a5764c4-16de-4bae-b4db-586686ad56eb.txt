What else do you need to know?  Go check it out! Fez is a cool place to drink and app, it's that simple.  It's a place you keep going back to.

I join the ranks of reviews who were there for a Yelp event and they nailed it.  I think you can call that the mark of great service, can you handle a huge group.  It's restaurant service on steroids.  

Cool inside, cool outside, good food, good drinks.  I like the "partitioned" style of the place, the big bar/lounge area, the tables area, and the outside, good.... Good!
