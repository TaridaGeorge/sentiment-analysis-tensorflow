I used to go to Robek's a lot. One day I decided that I'd give Maui a try since they were right next to my home. I absolutely love them now and will not go out of my way to return to Robek's. They're service was over the top. Cheerful and friendly with complete product knowledge. They made it very easy for me to make a decision from their menu on my first vist. Any other time I've wanted to try something new; they offer me with great suggestions. LOVE it! Love my tiki cup! These people rock! And so do their smoothies and coffee drinks! Always a delight!
