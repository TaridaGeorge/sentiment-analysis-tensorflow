Stopped in here with a friend last week for lunch.  We were both nursing some pretty severe hangovers and thought bread and pasta would be the perfect cure!!!  We were so right!!!!  We both had the chicken parmigiana - as my pasta side I had the fettucine alfredo and he had penne with meat sauce.  The chicken was so good - it was crucnchy on the outside and juicy on the inside - yum.  Our waiter was very generous with the soda refills - which I desperately needed.
