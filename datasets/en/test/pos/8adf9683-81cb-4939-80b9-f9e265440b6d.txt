I've been by this place many times, but didn't stop in until after reading the reviews here.  I was missing out!
I am a fan of the yogurt/cucumber dip.  But I'd never had it with fried pita bread.  I could have stopped there, it was so good, especially on a hot summer day.
I had the beef pita sandwich, again, the fresh pita bread was outstanding.  The beef was so tender, just melted in my mouth.  
I've seen other reviewers say they felt the meal was expensive.  I say, for the quality and quantity of what you get, it's well worth every penny.
I'm going back.  I'm craving the pita bread!
