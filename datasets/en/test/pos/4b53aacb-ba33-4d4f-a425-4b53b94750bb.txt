Hands down 5 stars to this Costco!!! I'm new to the area and I am so thrilled this one is close to home. I took advantage of their $7.99 car wash! It comes with a thorough exterior wash, washing under the vehicle and to my amaze when I stepped out of my car, my tires where also Amouralled and then I was told it also comes with a car wax!!! Say what?!?! SWEEEET! Everyone was professional and friendly from the Costco staff to many of the Costco customers. I'm very much enjoying my stay!

Special request to Costco:
Can you please bring back the Hebrew National Hot Dogs? Sorry but I am not digg'N the Kirkland brand at your concession service. They are very greasy. Boo. Please reconsider. Thank you!
