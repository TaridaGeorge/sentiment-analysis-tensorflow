Owner/stylist Alex M is a delightful professional who knows her stuff and gladly shares it with each individual client, with none of the product-pushing or "oops--gotta hurry to get to my next customer" that you often find at bigger salons. She puts you at ease and doesn't make a single cut until you are comfortable knowing what you're going to get. Her shampoo massage was awesome! Call for directions--it's on 24th St. just N. of McDowell, but it's a little tricky to find. I believe that if you pay cash (vs. credit/debit card), there is a discount--a very reasonable $40 for cut and style as of June 2009. I expect that will go up when people discover this talented lady!
