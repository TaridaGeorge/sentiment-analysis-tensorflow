Arcadia Farms is one of my favorite places for brunch.  Especially for getting together with the girls.  This is not to say it's a "man-free zone," but, it is super cute.  It has a cozy English country garden kind of atmosphere inside, and on the patio.  Not only is the motif absolutely beautiful, but the food is super yummy too.  My personal favorite, from the lunch menu, is the Raspberry Salad with Fossil Creek Goat Cheese.  It's delicious and refreshing.  All I would add is that in my opinion, one goat cheese medallion is more than enough.  Thus far though I really haven't gone wrong ordering anything off their menu, it's all been wonderful.  

I definitely recommend this as an ideal place to relax, chat, and enjoy some delicious food.
