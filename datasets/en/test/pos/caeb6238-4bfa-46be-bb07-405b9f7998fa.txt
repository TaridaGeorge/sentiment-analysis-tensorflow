The patio at Cibo is so perfect that I haven't wanted to try eating inside.  I thought the interior couldn't possibly measure up to the allure of the patio.  Well, I was wrong.  The inside may be a little noisier, but it's still charming and a great place to grab a bite.
   
Cibo is a one-stop restaurant that not only has great pizza, but also fantastic salads and desserts.   And cheap wine.  I'm partial to the margherita pizza with the fresh basil followed by a nutella and strawberry crepe.  That way, I can say I've had at least one serving of fruits and vegetables for the day.   Add a glass of wine for heart health and it's a healthy and delicious meal!
