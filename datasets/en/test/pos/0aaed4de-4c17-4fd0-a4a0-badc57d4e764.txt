This is the best place for an outdoor hike.  My wife and I stayed at the Phoenican for Memorial day weekend and had the bell desk drive us up to the trail head in their SUV.  Bring lots of water, because it gets hot and sweaty up there.  Its a hell of a hike but great views and lots of fun.  You have to get on all fours towards the top when your scaling the rocks, but you can do it and its a lot easier going down. (the mountain that is)  

Its about 1 1/2 hour up when your at a medium pace and 1 hour to the bottom with 15 minutes at the top.  I hear people get to the top in 30-45 minutes, but they are solo usually, great shape and running the whole way.  Bring good shoes to avoid a sprained ankle.
