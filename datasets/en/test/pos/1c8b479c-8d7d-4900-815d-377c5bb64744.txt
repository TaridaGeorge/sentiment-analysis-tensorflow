I give this place five stars despite all the other reviews...  I have only ever ordered to go from this place and I get the same thing every time, pho tai.  This is a great place for pho in this area but if you are easily turned off from a restaurant by the looks of it this may not be the place for you.  It is definite an older place and would probably benefit from a makeover but bottom line is that the pho is wonderful, the people are always nice and its a great price ($7.10 out the door - recently raised prices).
