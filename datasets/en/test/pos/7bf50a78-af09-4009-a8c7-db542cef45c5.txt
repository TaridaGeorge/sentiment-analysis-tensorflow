THERE IS A NEW KING OF SLIDERS IN TOWN!

Boomer's Sweet Home Chicago takes the throne, the crown and the award for the best Chicago Style Slider in Arizona.

I visited Boomers with my son and man those just went down so easy tonight.  I knew something had changed for the better.  It was the bread!  Boomer's is using a new bread for the sliders and it is softer and quite frankly just works. 

This awesome restaurant just got better in my book and now the only thing I can say that I do not like about Boomer's is that they are closed on Sundays!  How dare they take a day off with good food like that just waiting to be served!

ROCK ON BOOMER'S!!!
