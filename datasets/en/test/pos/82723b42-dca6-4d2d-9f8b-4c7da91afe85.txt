I am a Breakfast Nuts - it is my favorite meal of the day ... so I always look for a place that has a unique taste and then I usually find my favorite dish and that is what I wake up craving!
At The Dragonfly it is Sonoran Hash (I believe tha is what it is called) - wonderful flavors and textures and the potatoes are awesome (and I am very picky about my potatoes!)
