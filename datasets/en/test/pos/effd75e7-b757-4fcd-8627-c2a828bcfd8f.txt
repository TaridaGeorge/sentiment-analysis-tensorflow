I cant say enough good things about Cibo. 

The food is always good, but most of all it is in an old house in the center of Phoenix. The atmosphere reminds me of being invited over to an Italian friends house for a home cooked meal....except for the 30 minute wait list and crowded interior and exterior seating areas, but that only tells you how great the experience is. I highly recommend Cibo.
