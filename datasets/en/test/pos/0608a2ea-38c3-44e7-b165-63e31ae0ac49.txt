Switchblade salon is by far one of the best salons in the state. It's staffed by two of the most talented and creative stylists I've ever met. I switched to Switchblade from Toni and Guy about 7 years ago and haven't turned back since. Melinda always makes sure I get exactly what I want, no matter how long it takes. She is a styling perfectionist, and I always leave happy. Amazing considering I am also a perfectionist when it comes to my hair, and have left salons in the past in tears. The salon itself is very sheik and artfully decorated. I am always offered a beverage and Melindas head massages are awesome.
