I took my wife to eat at Twin Peaks after I had eaten in a South Carolina Twin Peaks. My wife and I were both happy with the service even though we arrived an hour before they closed. We were advised that we needed to order immediately if we wanted to eat because the kitchen was about to close. We ordered immediately and I ordered the wrong item. The waitress offered to give us the item at no charge and immediately resent our order without making us feel bad. The Beer was great and Ice cold. I cant say enough about the service out here. Thanks ladies for working so hard.
