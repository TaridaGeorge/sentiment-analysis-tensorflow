I love The Cider Mill! Where else are you going to pick up an organic bath scrub along with an insanely delicious reuben sandwich? The chili with noodles and cheese is really good too. This place serves the height of comfort food, but with yummy little twists. Plus, they have butterbeer. Butterbeer, people! Some of us really need to pretend we're in Harry Potter sometimes, don't judge.
