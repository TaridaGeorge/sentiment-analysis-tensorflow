For someone who has never had a pair of shoes repaired, this was a first for me.  The guy, who I can only assume is the owner, fixed a favorite pair of shoes in a couple days.  He repaired cracked and worn soles, fixed the uppers where they were separating from the bottom, and even cleaned the shoes and replaced the laces all for $30.  This is very much an old world shop as another reviewer said, the type of place that you just don't find very often in Phoenix, regardless of the industry.  Great find and one worth trying.
