We went for the first time and LOVED it. Both the service & food were top notch. Lots of great vegetarian & gluten free options, everything was very well priced, a bunch of affordable options on the wine list, and the cocktails were creative and delicious.

We had & loved:
* Smoked Gouda Mac n Cheese
* Urban Market Salad (no bacon)
* Butternut Squash Enchiladas (Awesome! huge plate!)
* Pear and Gorgonzola Flatbread (delicious)
* Basil ice cream (mind blowing)

We'll definitely be back. The food is awesome and it's very affordable, especially for the area. Thanks to the Herb Box!
