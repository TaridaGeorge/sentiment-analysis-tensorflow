This place is totally worth the drive from Tucson to Phoenix to get furniture, especially since it's so hard to find the furniture we needed, curio cabinets, in Tucson for a decent price.
Not only did we find a great curio cabinet, we found some LEDs to put in the cabinet at a great price, a lamp for one of our guest rooms, and plug-in lights to help light up a dark spot near our back door. We got all of this for under $300.
Just walking through the store gave us all kinds of ideas for furniture for our back yard and our office. We will definitely be back to get these once we have the money to do so.
