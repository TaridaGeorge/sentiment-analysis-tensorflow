My friend suggested we meet at Bad Donkey in Cave Creek, off Tom Darlington. The name alone gave me a little chuckle.
Entering I realized its not your little place... There are 3 sections! Food, Drink, Dessert... AMAZING food, Inexpensive drinks, and DELICIOUS ice cream. 
Definitely suggest stopping in, and having a quick bite followed by dessert ( for sure grab a beverage if you drink) and then enjoy the rest of your day up in Cave Creek. 
Loved it!!!
