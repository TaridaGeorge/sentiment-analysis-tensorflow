Went for my friends birthday. You really can't go wrong with Melting Pot. This one stands apart for its service. We had a fantastic time and every single person wished her a happy birthday. It was very sweet. Our water glasses were never below half, and our "dippers" came out with perfect timing. They also made three special plates for us since we had some food allergies in our group. I really think you should try this one just based on service alone. We had Lisa, and she was adorably sweet.
