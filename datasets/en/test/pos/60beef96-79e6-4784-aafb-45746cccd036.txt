Back in Seattle, it was really hard for me to find a place that did shoe repairs near to where I lived.  Here in Phoenix, The Leatherman was right down the street.  However, there were no kinds of reviews on it, so I didn't know what to expect.  I ended up being very pleasantly surprised.

This is a real nice place, run by a very nice couple who did an amazing job on a pair of shoes I brought in - the worn shoes I brought in look like new.  Better than new, even.  Great service all-around.  I highly recommend The Leatherman if you need some shoe work done.
