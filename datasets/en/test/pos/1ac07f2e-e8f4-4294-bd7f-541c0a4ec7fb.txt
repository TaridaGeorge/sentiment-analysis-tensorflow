You can't go wrong with anything on this menu. I haven't had a bad dish here. Phyllo packets, fez salad, fez burger, kisras, all melt in your mouth.  If you like real garlic-e humus, give it a try.  It's awesome!  Oh, all the martinis are just great too.  Candice is the best sever there just in case you care.  They never disappoint!
