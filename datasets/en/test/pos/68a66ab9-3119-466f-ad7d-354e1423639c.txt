Just picked up my catering order for 25 people at work and I couldn't be happier! Ryno the GM at the 44th Street & Indian School location, helped me personally and was so nice. He helped me get the most bang for my buck and offering to package our pitas "open face" saved me from an annoying afternoon of coworkers complaining because they didn't want this or that on it. 
The hummus is fantastic and the veggies crisp! 

Thank you Ryno and the staff there, we'll be putting you guys on our regular lunch order rotation!
