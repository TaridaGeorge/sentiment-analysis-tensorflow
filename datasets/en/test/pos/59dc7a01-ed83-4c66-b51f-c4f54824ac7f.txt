Toddy coffee anyone? Wait... what is "Toddy"? Toddy coffee is my new found FAV! It is iced coffee that is naturally so smooth and delicious that I don't even add cream like I normally do with regular coffee. If you haven't tried it, what are you waiting for?! As if the coffee hasn't already won me over... I love the quaint, artistic, warm atmosphere this place has!
