Just went to this relatively new theatre and it was a great experience.  The movie was great as well as the sound.  There were no packed seating, so we had the seats we wanted and it was nice that so many restaurants were right across the street.  Who knew Olive Garden, TGI Fridays, Red Robin, and others were up in this part of town.  It was a very enjoyable day.
