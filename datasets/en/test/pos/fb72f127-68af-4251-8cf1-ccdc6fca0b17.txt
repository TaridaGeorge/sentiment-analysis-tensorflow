Three cheers for FroYo!  

Always a variety of flavors (although I wish they kept Taro around all the time instead of sporadically).


They have flavors ranging from sweet to tart! The toppings are awesome! Mochi, lychee, mandarin oranges, fresh fruit, these little sunflower seed things that I love! They also have typical toppings like chocolate chips, nuts, etc etc ETC! There is no shortage of toppings here.

It is always pretty busy with the movie theater nearby, but it's worth it.  You can catch a movie and bring your ticket stub in for 3 free ounces after the flick. 

You might feel overwhelmed with all of the flavors so feel free to ask for a few sample cups! While you enjoy your yogurt, grab a free cup of water, it's usually flavored with fresh fruit! 

Enjoy!
