I recently relocated back to AZ from the Washington D.C. area. It was there that I got into Bikram yoga -- love the heat! Well, this hot yoga gives you the detoxifying heat that you love from Bikram with power moves like planks and push ups . What a fabulous work out. The instructors are excellent and each class is different and challenging. I'm so glad I found this studio.
