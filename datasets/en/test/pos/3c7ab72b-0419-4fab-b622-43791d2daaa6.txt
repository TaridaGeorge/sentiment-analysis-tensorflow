I LOVE YOU THAI HUT!!!
:)

i must admit, yesterday was sunday and you were closed 
so i cheated on you with the thai elephant. 
i now realize that even though it was delicious and fun,
YOU are the only one who can satisfy my red curry needs.
will you please forgive me??

p.s if you start opening on sunday i promise to make it worth your while.
