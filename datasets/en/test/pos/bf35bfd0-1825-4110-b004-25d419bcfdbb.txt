Andrea is wonderful!  Probably the best facial I have ever had.  I first went with my daughter and then went back for myself.  She takes the time to understand your skin and offers healthful suggestions.  Her techniques for massaging the face are incredible and she clearly loves what she does.  I have not yet tried the waxing, but that's next on the list.  The only drawback is that her location is in sort of a weird complex.  It's easy to find, however, just not where you might expect a "spa" to be.
