I love the Crepe Bar. We were waiting for them to open and when they did they did NOT disappoint! I have gotten the vanilla custard crepes every time I have gone, and an iced vanilla latte every time, and it's a perfect combo for any vanilla fans out there. Their coffee is good and strong and not bitter and their crepes are soft and caramelized on top. I submitted a few photos and one of mine was the main one for a while, so you can see exactly what the food looks like. I will definitely be going back! It has been a weekly jaunt for my breakfast crew ^_^
