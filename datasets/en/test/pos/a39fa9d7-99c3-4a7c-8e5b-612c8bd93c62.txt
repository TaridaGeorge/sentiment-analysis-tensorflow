I went to Moon Valley as a repeat customer.  In selecting two trees for my yard, I was not really happy with the result after the trees were planted.  The trees were planted properly, but I was not happy with the tree species selection.  I had signed off on everything and Moon Valley could have easily said they had met their committment, which was true.  However, when I went into the McKellips store and spoke with Derek, he said he did not want an unhappy customer.  We discussed the tree selection and Derek sent out Billy and his crew to swap out the trees.  They planted two of the most perfect Live Oak trees and I am thrilled with the result .

Thank you Moon Valley for making this customer a future repeat customer!
