I am so grateful to say I have had the famous Rocket Burger.  This place gets so much Yelp praise and for great reason.  

The soda selection is off the hook every soda you grew up with and then some all in coolers in bottles the even got YooHoo.

Fries are all natural cut and amazing there is just something great about fries with the skin on them they just taste better. 

The burger was Phenomenal I had the Santa Fe which had the amazing Rocket Sauce, bacon, and fried green chili.  It was outta this world good.  

I will be a loyal customer and I am sure will post numerous updates to this review cause this place is just that good.
