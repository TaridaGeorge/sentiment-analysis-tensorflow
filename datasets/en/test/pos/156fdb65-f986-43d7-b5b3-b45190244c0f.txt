Loved it here for lunch. Must come back for dinner. 

Ordered the Cafe Clubhouse Sandwich for lunch (sliced ham and turkey breast, bacon, provolone, swiss, and mayonnaise on a ciabatta square) served with fresh seasonal fruit. The first bite into the sandwich was AWESOME! The combination of the meats, cheese, and bread was SO good. The bacon crunch put it over the top. The fruit was delicious. For those that know me, I ATE fruit and I like it! So sweet and fresh. WOW! 

The service was great. She was quick to refill on drinks. She even got splitting the checks correct. 

Once one mini con, the parking. But for this place, I will park anywhere!
