Very good.  I had the Hana Dog and a new dog that I cannot recall the name of.  Each of them were super tasty and light (for hot dog standards).  

I also had the slaw, which is very good.  It had coconut, which I normally don't care for, but it was a good compliment to the slaw to make it unique from other places.  

The owner is a super nice guy.  Many of these creations came from his creative mind.  I would definitely recommend stopping in here - it has a fun theme inside!
