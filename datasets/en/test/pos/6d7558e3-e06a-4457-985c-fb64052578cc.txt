Seriously good and good value. Went there for the first time this week because we saw it on a jog. The worker was very nice and informational and the food he suggested was amazing. Like others said the crab angels are a must!!!! We were told this place has been open for 19 years with the same owner and menu so it has to be good! It was so worth it!
