This is the BEST BBQ place that I've found in the PHX area.  Everything I've tried here is amazing.  The BBQ sauce is the perfect blend of tangy, sweet and smoky.  Ribs are amazing.  Baked beans are awesome.  Corn bread is incredible.  The service is always top notch.  Ambiance and setting is really cool.  

You can't go wrong at Bobby Q.  Try it.  You will be going back every time you are in the mood for BBQ.
