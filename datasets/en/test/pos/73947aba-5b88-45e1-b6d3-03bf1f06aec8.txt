This is my wife's favorite Resturant.  I really like it, but she absolutely loves it!

There is no way that either of us could finish a meal at Lolo's, so we team up on one of these delicious meals. Chicken & Waffles with eggs and grits! What a feast!

I love the kool-aide! Go for the Grape, you will enjoy the ice cold "mason jar" ... It's huge AND you get free refills.

If the food is great (and it is) then the service is even greater... Seriously great attitudes flow is this wonderful eatery!
