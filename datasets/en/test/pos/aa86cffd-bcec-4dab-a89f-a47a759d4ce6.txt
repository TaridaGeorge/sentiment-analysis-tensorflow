This quaint little cafe was just what I expected! Friendly service, good food and reasonable prices. 

A friend and myself brought our Argentine friend for lunch and we all loved it! We had the fresh lemonade and freshly made meat and spinach empanadas. They were piping hot and delicious!

Our Argentine friend loved the place and plans to return one day in the future to try out the sandwiches. Looking forward to returning myself as well.  

Great customer service too!
