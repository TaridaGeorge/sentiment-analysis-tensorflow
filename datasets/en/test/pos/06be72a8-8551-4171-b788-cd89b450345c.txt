We are repeat customers and never had a bad experience yet. Charles and the staff are always hospitable. This time around we ordered the house chow mein, garlic green beans, salt and peppered pork and shrimp fried rice and everything turned out great. 

The only issue is the location. Not exactly down the street, I'd say good 15 min drive. There are others nearby but J&K is well worth the drive as the others don't measure up at all.
