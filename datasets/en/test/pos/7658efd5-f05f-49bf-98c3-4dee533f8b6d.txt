1-star review because they forgot your fries? That stuff happens, what matters HERE is how the food was.

In-N-Out is a SoCal institution, STILL family-owned by the Snyder family for their entire history.. every location is company-owned, there are NO franchises and no "big corporation" behind the brand.  Simply put, this is THE best fast-food burger in the land, bar none, IMHO and of many, many others.  They use nothing but fresh ingredients - nothing is ever frozen - and their employees are the best in the industry, no doubt the fact that they're the best-paid in the industry has something to do with that.  If you've never had one - drop by for a Double-Double and experience true burger bliss.
