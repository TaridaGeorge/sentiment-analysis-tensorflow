A former coworker and I stumbled upon this place for lunch. As the other reviews said there is limited parking (park across the street at Arby's), the neighborhood is sketchy with guys hanging around outside, and seating inside is limited - but it is worth the obstacles to come here. We ordered the Margarita pizza and it was absolutely the best I have had this side of Naples. 

Fred M. mentioned he was downgrading since the bread and tapenada was gone - time to give that point back because they were served with our meal.The staff was friendly and the pizza was incredible. Reasonably priced too. Give this place a try!
