Wow - Now that's good BBQ!!!  We were at the BBQ festival in Scottsdale yesterday - Bobby-Q had the best brisket, ribs and chicken!  Their brisket is moist and juicy! and the ribs are fall off the bone de-lish!!!  I should have taken a picture of the bare bones so you could see just how bare they were!  Everything was outstanding!
