This place is the real deal.  Excellent Italian food on the quick.  Everything from pasta to pizza and huge Italian sandwiches.  We can't get enough of their cannolis either.  The place has excellent customer service and offers such a unique dining experience because of it's location within an Italian market.  Great finds to take home and cook as well.

I recommend the cheesesteak, the chicken parmsean sandwich, any pizza, anything with their Italian sausage.  They also offer an excellent craft beer selection including local beers and awesome wines.
