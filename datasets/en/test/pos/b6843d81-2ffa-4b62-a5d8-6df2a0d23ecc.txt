This place is super cute and the employees are pretty friendly.  The vibe is laidback and neighborhoody, making you want to hang out there forever.  They make an excellent Iced Chai Tea Latte and the giant cupcake that I had was delicious as well.

I only wish I lived within walking distance of Copper Star so that I wouldn't have to worry about parking, which can be a bit tricky at times.

Definitely check out the cool bathrooms (I'm guessing the men's is as nice as the women's) before you leave.
