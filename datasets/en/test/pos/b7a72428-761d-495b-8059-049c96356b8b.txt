Easily the best breakfast food ive ever eaten.  And i eat alot of breakfast. I ordered and sampled 5 items with a buddy. The "waffle dogs" are by far the best thing ive eaten ever. They were featured on food network like 10 times!! I now know why. Awesome place and friendly( if that matters) unreal food!  Nuff said would travel 2 hrs for there food.
