We used some Dunkin Donuts coupons on our visit today and were very pleased with the service and the coffee! 

My first coffee was the toasted almond but I didn't like the taste, so I asked if I could switch it out for a Pumpkin Iced Coffee and Crystal was so wonderful and politely said she'd change my order. 

We also ordered the 50 mini donut holes and Crystal gave us a sample of all the different flavors. They were out of chocolate ones, but had them make some especially for us - and I'm so glad she did, they turned out to be my favorite! 

In addition to changing our order and putting together a nice spread of mini DD's, she gave us a free sample of the white chocolate latte. 

Thanks so much Crystal!
