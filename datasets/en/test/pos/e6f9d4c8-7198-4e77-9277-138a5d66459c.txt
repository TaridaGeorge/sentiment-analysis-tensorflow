How can you not love a place with great people, and cheap beer? I... really don't have much else to say about it. I mean, the servers have always been great. The beer has always been delicious. And the regulars are always welcoming. Hail Mary's has quickly become a staple for the long days at work when the only thing that can soothe an overworked soul is copious amounts of booze, and a great time with fun people. Trivia/poker/ and when I'm not content with spending enough money at the bar, why not blow it on something I know nothing about? No, not  women. Off track betting. 
Drinking alone at Hail Mary's is impossible. Come here for great time and leave with some new friends.
