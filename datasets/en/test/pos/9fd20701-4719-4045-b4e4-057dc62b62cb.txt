My family and I ate dinner at Meatballz tonight. The service was fast, the food was tasty,  the portions were very generous, the kids were happy, the owner insisted on making sure we were enjoying ourselves, well fed, and had boxes to take home what we couldn't finish.

It's not a romantic little Italian cafe with candlelight and linens; it doesn't claim to be with a name like Meatballz, but it's a happy little place for an informal family dinner.
