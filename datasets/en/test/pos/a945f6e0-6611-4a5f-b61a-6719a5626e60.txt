Thank goodness I am a total barfly. I was waiting for IcePics to open, and got tired of sitting in my car. So I decided to drive around the area.

Just a few doors down, I found Standard Restaurant Equipment. I did a Dukes of Hazzard-like screeching turn around a broken down bus and careened into the parking lot.

I love kitchen gear. But I am underemployed, and was afraid I'd spend a lot of money inside. But no. 

Check it. For under $20, I got a half sheet pan (on sale for $6 -- down from $23!), 2 squeeze bottles (72 cents a piece!), a muddler, a turner, an ashtray, and a dough scraper.

Hell yeah! It's Williams-Sonoma for welfare losers like me.
