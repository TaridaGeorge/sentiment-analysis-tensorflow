I have had a couple issues with my Buick Lecross. I purchased it at another dealer and their service department was terrible. I went to Yates Buick and met Nathan in the service department, he told he take of me and he is man of his word. The service department at Yates is incredible and I will purchase and have my cars serviced at Yates. I will be a customer for life!!!!!!
