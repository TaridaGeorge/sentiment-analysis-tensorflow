We stayed at a local hotel and asked for a steakhouse recommendation and am so glad we got got Mastro's City Hall Steakhouse as the place to go.  The steak was definitely the best steak I've ever had in my life (i had the porterhouse).  Also had a dessert, lemonchello sorbet, which was great.  The service was as great as you'd expect.  The price is up there, but we got more than we paid for.  Final note is this place has a hefty military discount.  Even if you are not military, it is worth patronizing a place that has such respect for our service men and women.  If there was a heavenly form of meat, this is it.
