Dropped in here one morning to get a latte and a sparkly blueberry muffin at about 8am on a week day and it was DEAD.  

But I bet this place is happenin' at night on the weekends.  There are a ton of seats, checkers games, books, magazines, comfy chairs... and it's huge so there's plenty of room so you aren't in someone else's space when you just want to friggen write a report.

I got the toasted marshmallow latte... yummy.  I kinda wanted it to be a little creamier, but it was still tasty.

I also had a sparkly blueberry muffin.  They get their muffins from someplace in Tempe who puts sparkles on their baked goods... and it really was good.
