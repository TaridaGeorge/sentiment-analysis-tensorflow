This was my third times went there (2 Saturday dinners and 1 weekday lunch). I love that place. Every time I will find some new dishes filling up my stomach. Besides my regular chooses such as crab legs, sashimi, and strawberry yogurt, I try walnut shrimps, roasted duck, cocktail shrimps and mango ice cream. Food of Jasmine Tokyo never let me down and looking forward my next tasty adventure.
