Great upscale casual food at a reasonable price. We a few blocks away and visit this place often. We have never had a bad meal. The service is always great. I would recommend sitting at the bar where you will have the pleasure of meeting their wonderful bartender Ryan. He is very friendly and always in a great mood. They have a very nice patio with a fireplace.
