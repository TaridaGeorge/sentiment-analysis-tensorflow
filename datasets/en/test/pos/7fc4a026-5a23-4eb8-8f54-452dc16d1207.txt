Our number one place for drinks and eats in Tempe. Always the spot to go for birthdays, celebrations, and post sporting events. We haven't had a bad beer or a bad meal here. Outdoor seating (with heaters in winter) is a nice option and you can reserve the back area for large groups/parties. In the last few years, they put out a hostess stand and there is a longer wait for seating, but at least you can take the buzzer to the bar while you wait. The parking lot is very small, but you can find a spot on one of the streets nearby without too much effort.
