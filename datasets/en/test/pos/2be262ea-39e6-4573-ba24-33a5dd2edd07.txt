This hidden gem is my new favorite breakfast spot! The staff is SO friendly, and their menu has the right balance of unique choices along with the classics. They make everything from scratch and try to use organic ingredients whenever they can. My fave breakfast dishes are the brie-fig-spinach omelet or their southwestern omelet with chorizo and jalapeno cream sauce. Average entree price is $10.  I wish I could eat there every weekend!
