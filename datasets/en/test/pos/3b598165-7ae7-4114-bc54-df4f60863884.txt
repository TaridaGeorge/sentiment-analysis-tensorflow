Awesome!

Growing up in Scottsdale, I never went to the botanical gardens. I mean come on, what's there to do there? It's not the same as going to the zoo.

But now, it's a must. Go around dusk or check out their website for one of their events. The Chihuly Exhibit was pretty cool last year. And that's what I like, they're more than just a bunch of cacti. 

Bring a camera.
