We live here in the Arcadia area, and I am so thankful I don't have to leave my 5 mile radius! We used to drive so far for indoor play! It's $9 for the day which is very reasonable when you consider this place is intimate compared to the chaos at the children's museum. And, it's super close! You can also leave your child there for a few hours for $10 per hour. That's a steal! I can get some errands done, or go to yoga. My son loves loves this plays. EVERYTIME we drive by he says, "there's koko beans"
