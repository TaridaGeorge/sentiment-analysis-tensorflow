This place is very small and inviting. I had to wait for a little while for my table, but it was worth the wait. The Sea Scallops were amazing on the appetizer menu and I had the BEST Bolognase with HOMEMADE Fettuccine pasta - They actually made the pasta in house. 
Wine list was great too - good mix. I will become a regular here for sure!
