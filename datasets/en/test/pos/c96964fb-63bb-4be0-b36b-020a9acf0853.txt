After months of listening to a coworker talk about how amazing this pizza was I finally gave in and went for lunch. I had a small pep and cheese, which was the perfect lunch size btw. I have to admit that this crust was nothing short of amazing. They were not shy with the toppings either, which made it even more amazing because cheese makes everything awesome. I even found myself thinking about the crust after I left, and the next day as well. I am not sure what they put in that pizza but I am addicted. It would be dangerous if I lived close.... I will definitely be back.
