This place rocks...it's simply the best neighborhood bar, with the greatest old timers hanging out there. I always enjoy my food, my drinks and the company - no one drinks alone here.  Where else can you find a salad bar from the 70's still up and functioning with bacon bits...

There is a great burger deal on Tuesdays (I think) and they ahve a neat little patio with a TV.
