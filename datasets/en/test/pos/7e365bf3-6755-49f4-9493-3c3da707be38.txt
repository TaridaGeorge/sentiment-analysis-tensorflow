I would eat at this restaurant every day of the week if I could. I love the idea of the conveyor belt sushi. The prices are insanely reasonable. The selection of food and beverage choices is wonderful. I can't say enough great things about this place. It's heaven. 

You are charged per plate of sushi (or whatever) you pull off the belt. At the end, the waitress tallies up your plates. No plate is over $2. You can't beat that!!! Honestly...I love this place. Love it!
