Entertaining the folks in PHX for a last meal together before the red eye back to Florida...major delivery from LGO!  Will definitely return next time thru PHX...which won't be soon enough.  If you have to drive even 30-40 mins to get here...it will be worth it.  Aaron served two seniors and two kiddos as part of our group of seven...and didn't miss a beat.
