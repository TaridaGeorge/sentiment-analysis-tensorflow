Only a year old, this hotel boasts tastefully decorated, clean amenities and a very friendly staff. There is a complimentary breakfast in the AM's from 6-9:30am which serve eggs, bacon, sausage, fruit, toast...even gravy and biscuits! (if you like that kind of thing...which the hubs does) 

And in the evening from 5-6pm, they offer a complimentary cocktail hour where they serve beer and wine. And the owner/manager converses with the guests to ensure they are enjoying their stay or to alert them of local attractions.

This is really a great (and SUPER clean) hotel in a perfect location. Guests can walk across to the library, lake, tennis facility, museum, waterpark or next door to the stadium. Or just take a leisurely day to lay out by the pool in the sunshine!

If you are staying in Surprise...THIS is the place to stay!
