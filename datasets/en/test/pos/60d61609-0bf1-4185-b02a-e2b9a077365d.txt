This is my favorite breakfast & lunch place in Ahwatukee. The food is excellent. The service is friendly and they do what they do perfectly. This isn't a place to go for elegant sit down service. It's the perfect blend of self-service meets top restaurant quality food. 

Have the Croque Monsieur--or add an egg to make it a Croque Madame. You will not be disappointed. The bread and the baked goods are so good you could make a substantial meal off them alone.

Finally, this is a small local business that truly cares about its community. They have shown up at two community fund raising events with huge boxes of warm, freshly baked cookies to donate. I'm grateful to have a place of this caliber in my neighborhood.
