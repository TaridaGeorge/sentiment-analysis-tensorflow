Lemy's is the best! The massaging chairs are amazing, all the staff does a fantastic job and I've never once been disappointed!  I would come every day if I could afford it!  

My only complaint, and its small, is that you can't put tips on your card.  So make sure to bring cash for a tip for Lemy's amazing staff!
