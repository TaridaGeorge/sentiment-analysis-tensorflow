Loved this place with its mod yet minimalist decor.  My friend wanted a spicy roll with scallop but didn't see it on the list.  When we asked the waitress, she had it made for us.  

We also ordered spicy salmon & tuna rolls, salmon and yellow tail sushi and a large bowl of seafood soup with soba noodles.  The fish was great & the rolls were also fabulous but I wasn't a big fan of the soup.  The noodles were over cooked and too thick but the broth was flavorful and light.

The fish was about $3-5 for 2 pieces and rolls were on average $4-5.  All entrees seemed moderately priced.
