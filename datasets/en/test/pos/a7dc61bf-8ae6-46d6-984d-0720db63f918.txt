Love this place! A group of us (8-10 guys) have tried 3 different SoNY stores. This one really works thanks to Danni. She really knows how to be attentive. We come in every other Thursday and are THRILLED when we see her waiting our table. Hard to believe, but Danni actually remembers our names. Manager is cool/fun too. Great patio when weather permits.
