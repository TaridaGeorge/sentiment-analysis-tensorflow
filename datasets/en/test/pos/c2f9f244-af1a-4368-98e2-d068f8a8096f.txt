Always great service and excellent food.  As someone else said, one of the toughest things here is deciding which dish to go for.

My wife usually goes for one of the crepe or similar dishes, and I've always had one of the steak options.  The "hanging man" steak is simply amazing.  The flat iron steak, covered with garlic-herb butter and perfectly caramelized onions, is simply the best flat iron steak I've ever eaten.

On top of this, you get a selection of rare beers on tap.
