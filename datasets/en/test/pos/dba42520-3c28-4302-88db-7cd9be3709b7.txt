I had a regular A/C guy.  He replaced a capacitor about 4 weeks ago when my A/C went out.  It went out again.

My man got stuck on an appointment, so I had to look around and found Cool Blew.

My first contact after a very personable receptionist was Jonathon, Gen. Mgr.  I explained my situation .  He asked for the model number and serial number and found compressor, and the capacitor, which I recently replaced were still under warranty.

Chris, the tech, came out within 2 hours after the first call me and found the problem within 5 minutes.  A wire on the part replaced came loose and shorted.

Within 5 minutes, Chris had it fix and reattached.  All for the 69.00 service call!!!!

That's why I gave them 5 stars!!!!  Kudos to all there!!!!
