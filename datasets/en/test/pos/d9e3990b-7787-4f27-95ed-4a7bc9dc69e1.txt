Lollicup is pretty awesome, and I can't decide if I like them or Boba Tea House better.  Lollicup's boba is a bit more chewy, while Boba Tea House's is a bit softer.  I like the softer boba, but Boba Tea House's boba is almost completely flavorless while Lollicup's has this very subtle sweet flavor that's just awesome.

If you like new and interesting things, I'd highly recommend the Ginger Milk Tea.  It's very gingery and a bit spicy, but it's probably unlike anything you've ever had and is just really different in a good way.

Don't forget to get a punch card so you can get free drinks if you go here often :)
