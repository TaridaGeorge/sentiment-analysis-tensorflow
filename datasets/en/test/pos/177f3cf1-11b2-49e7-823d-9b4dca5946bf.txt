Love this place... It's a lighter more contemporary Italian.  The asparagus Bruchetta is amazing.  I travel across the country thinking of it often...  Great wine list, love the patio on a warm day... With a bottle of water the Bruchetta, maybe the rosemary chicken and vegetables for dinner... Great place to visit with friends. Upscale and casual all at once... And one ofvmy favorite from fox restraunt concepts...
