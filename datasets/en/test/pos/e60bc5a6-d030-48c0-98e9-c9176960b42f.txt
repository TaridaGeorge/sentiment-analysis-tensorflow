Got me in quickly when my puppy was not feeling well... I was afraid I would have to take him to the emergency Vet (which is extremely expensive), but East Maryland Animal Hospital got me in ASAP and was very attentive to my little one. They are a little on the expensive side- but it beat the Emergency Vet fees
