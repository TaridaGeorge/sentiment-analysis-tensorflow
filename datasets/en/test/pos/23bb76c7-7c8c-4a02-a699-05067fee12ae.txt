Dr. Lidieth Libby and her staff are so awesome!  She treats my special needs child with such great care!  She has special treats for the kids like movie tickets and drawings for kids who have no cavities.....my daughter is not afraid to go to her appointments!  This is amazing!  We drive a long way for the excellent service they provide!

Dr. Libby really cares about her kids and it shows!
