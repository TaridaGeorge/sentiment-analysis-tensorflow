Parking seems crazy, but I always find a spot after a few minutes, they keep the flow moving nicely during the lunch hours.  

I love this place.  From the little coffee bar, to the delicious gourmet sandwiches, from the sweet gifts you can look over while waiting in line, to the sweet deserts behind the counter.  

My personal favorite, (being someone who doesn't cook nor eat fast food) is the curb side take out.  After a long day at the office, I call in my favorite Kale Salad, drive into the parking lot and pay as if I just went through a drive-through, but am rewarded with a gourmet salad.  Perfect fast-healthy dinner.
