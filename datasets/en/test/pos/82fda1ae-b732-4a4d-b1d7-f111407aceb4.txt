Really cool place.  You can find amazing deals here on the cutest clothes, shoes, bed items, bath items and even makeup.  Nordstrom Rack is freaking fabulous and if you haven't been, you're missing out.

If you're wondering, this store is nothing like Factory 2 U- for anyone who was once poor enough to have to shop there and actually knows what I'm talking about.  Unlike the horrific Factory 2 U, the clothes at Nordstrom Rack don't have holes, broken zippers, tears or defects.  Instead, they are perfectly good clothes at discounted prices.

They even have a high-end boutique where the designer clothes are still pricey, but a lot less expensive then what you could buy at the real Nordstroms.

I forgot to mention that they also sell sunglasses and handbags. And now that I've been talking about this place, I suddenly have the urge to go shopping!
