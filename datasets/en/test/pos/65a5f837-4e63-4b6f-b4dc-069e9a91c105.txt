I just got my hair cut here and LOVE IT. My brother comes here and recommended that I try this place out. He said they know how to cut Asian hair, and that is so true. The guy who cut my hair (not sure what his name is) was funny and patient. There was somewhat of a language barrier when it came to casual chatting, but he understood everything that had to do with my hair. Will definitely come here again.
