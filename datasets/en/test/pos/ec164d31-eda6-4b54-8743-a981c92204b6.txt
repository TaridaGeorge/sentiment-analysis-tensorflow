AMAZING service, food, home made sauce and atmosphere. The menu is a mix between vegetarian and meat dishes over rice or noodles. YUM! This place is a wonderful quick spot for healthy lunch. When they cook their veggies, they do not come out soggy or salty, they are still packed with their nutrients and have a great crunch. The food is prepared very well. The business hours vary, so make sure its open if you are in a hurry! They have home made sauces as well as a mix of hot sauces and the dreaded GHOST PEPPERS! Fantastic little stop and very affordable.
