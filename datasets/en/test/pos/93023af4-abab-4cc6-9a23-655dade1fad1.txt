The first time I went to AZ88 was on a date... well, I got lost, as usual..but it can be tricky to find..or maybe its just me being blonde?? BUT I loved this place.. the entire place is hopping... Ive been there 3 times in the past 6 months..and its always hopping! Love the bar... the patio.. I love the drinks...which are all on the girly side, but I love it! The trendy decor of NY cabs.. super cool and unique.. Love the fries with the dipping sauces..Ive had salads here..and burgers..and its a great point of start for what follows on date nite...OR not.. you can always dump the date..and sit at the bar..trust me, everyone is friendly...so you wont feel like the single single... Watch the bathroom doors....sober I have issues getting the dang doors open...and not feeling like the dumb blonde of AZ88..
