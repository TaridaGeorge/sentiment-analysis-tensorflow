I love trying out new restaurants, BBQ in particular. Ive eaten here several times and have had great experiences. The ribs are perfectly cooked with the just the right amount of smoke. The mac n cheese is oooey gooey goodness! ! The menu has something for everyone. Their homemade sangria is refreshing/delicious. They have great specials for happy hour monday to friday which i intend to check out . And of course I cant forget to mention the courteous servers. Great location and always plenty of events to check out in Old Town.
