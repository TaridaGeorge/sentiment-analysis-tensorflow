Oh my goodness, Hank is awesome! We've had nothing but problems with landscapers and we finally found someone we'll be sticking with. Hank is very professional, knowledgeable, responsive, prompt, communicates thoroughly and is very reasonable.  And by the way...he's actually there doing the work! Trust me, we've gone through them all and I had almost given up hope.  Hank has been better than expected - we almost don't want to tell anyone so he doesn't get too busy for us!  :)
