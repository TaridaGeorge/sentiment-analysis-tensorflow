After my first dining experience at Beckett's Table I have absolutely NOTHING I could complain about. The food is amazing. They had dishes that were creative yet homey.  The chef/owner is extremely talented but also very nice and personable. The servers were very kind, helpful/knowledgable, and on task. The food is a little expensive but it's well worth the price. They also have an excellent wine selection!

I can't wait to go back!!
