Amen for yogurtini!!!  This is my favorite treat shop. They have quality and healthy. I jones for this place. The selection of toppings is dynamite!!!!!  Dang it now I want some. Looks like I have to make a trip!!!!  I suggest the blueberry yogurt and top it with all the fruit options. If you feel like being bad get the chocolate and top it with all the candy bar and chocolate options!!!!!!
