One of the really cool things about REI is that you can rent stuff.  Another cool thing is their selection of books, specifially on Arizona.  And one more cool thing is their staff, they're pretty knowledgable yet not all up in your face and following you around everywhere.

I would say that REI is one of the more expensive stores of it's kind.  But that's also because they have quality products.  When I find something I really want there I'll check out other stores to see if they have a better price and usually, they don't even carry the product I'm looking for, REI is unique that way.  I bought some gear here for my Grand Canyon backpacking trip - everything held up and I was well prepared.
