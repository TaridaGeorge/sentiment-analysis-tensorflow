Ok, this is a store I cannot live without.  So many gourmet quality foods with affordable prices.   And lotsa organic items too.  I really love it.  

I don't ever complain about TJ products!  Well, OK, one exception, the triple berry bran muffin mix.  Way too healthy for me.  :o)

My husband loves buffalo burgers, so this is where we go to stock up.   Where else can I find this??

Two thumbs up, TJ!
