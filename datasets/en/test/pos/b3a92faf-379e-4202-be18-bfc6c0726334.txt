The owner's and staff at Nails R Us are great. The owners are so accommodating, they will open early or stay late when needed. They do a great job at HALF the price some of the nail salons in the same area. The shopping center is a bit lack luster but it's never hard to find parking the grocery store there has a coffee shop inside so I will usually grab a coffee then go take a seat in the salon to be pampered. They do foot massages, callus removal and masques for no extra charge. YOU CAN'T BEAT THAT!!!!!
