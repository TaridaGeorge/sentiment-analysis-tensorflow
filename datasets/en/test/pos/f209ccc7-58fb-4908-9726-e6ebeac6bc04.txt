Golden Rice Express has become my favorite go-to Chinese restaurant! I was referred here a couple of years ago, and have been going ever since. 

It's a small place great for grabbing a quick bite or ordering take out and the food is always ready within 10 - 15 minutes. They also do delivery, but I've never experienced their delivery service since I live close by and am not lazy. 

Portions are large, food is really good and authentic, and the prices are cheap. They also get 5 stars from me for their excellent service - the guy who is always there (who I think is the owner) is super nice. I'd recommend trying their chicken with garlic sauce or sesame chicken.
