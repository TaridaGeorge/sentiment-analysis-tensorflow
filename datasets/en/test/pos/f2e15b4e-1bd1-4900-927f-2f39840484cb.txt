Lot's of new inventory all of the time!  The prices are pretty good and the clothes tend to last.  Many of the fabrics are super soft.  Great place for sexy sundresses and flattering skirts.  I was there today and found a fabulous best...it is a source for accessories...men's clothes as well...and fun odd gift items too!   Today they had alot of shoes...sandals and boots!  It's a fun and fruitful experience!  I like the Scottsdale store but Tempe is just as large and loaded with things.
