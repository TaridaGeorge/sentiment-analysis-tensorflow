We frequent Flemings alot and have since they first opened.  We have ordered a variety of foods and everytime it is perfectly cooked.  The service we receive is outstanding. We have never had to wait more than a few minutes to be seated.  We haven't ever had any problems with the food or service.
I think that this is a five star restaurat.
