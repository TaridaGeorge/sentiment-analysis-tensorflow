This is THE NICEST Walgreen's I've ever been to. The staff was friendly, and the store was extremely organize and well laid out. You will not find anything out of place or messy looking in the widely set aisles of the store. It was bright and well lit. The workers mentioned the manager takes a lot of pride in how the store looks, and they put a lot of effort into maintaining it. Corporate Walgreens, take note of this store, and spread the word to other Walgreen's managers in the US!
