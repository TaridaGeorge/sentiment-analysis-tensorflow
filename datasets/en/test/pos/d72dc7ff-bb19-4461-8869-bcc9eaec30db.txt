A visit to this place is how I treat myself! 
I love, love, love the pho, sandwiches, bun, and spring rolls.  If you are undecided on what to order, go with the special-- it's a little sampling of everything.  

I know this place "Americanized", I've had more authentic Vietnamese before, but it's still quite tasty ;) It's also very consistent-- something I value in my lunch take-out places. Service is quick and very friendly.  I'm very appreciative of the speed-- when dining in the restaurant, we are able to get in and out during lunch in less than an hour.
