INSTANT 5 stars for being open at 7:30am on a Sunday, to acommodate a bunch of crazy Chelsea fans! I called ahead the night before just to check, but the owner assured me that, yes, he would be there to open up early for the English Premier matches. They even served us breakfast as soon as the first of the kitchen staff arrived! 
The place doesn't look like much from the outside, and the fact that you have to park and enter in the back just adds to the sketchiness... but once you walk in, you find yourself in a very warm, inviting British style pub! They even have a seperat game room that would probably be cool to reserve for big events and games!
We will definitely be back... hopefully a little later in the day next time....
