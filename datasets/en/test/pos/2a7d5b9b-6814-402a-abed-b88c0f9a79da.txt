Been there twice so far! Cannot wait to go back again! We have tried 4 of their sandwiches. They are ALL AMAZING! Quality meat! Local bakery! Local Produce! 
We have really tried to support every restaurant that has been in this corner. My husband always says, "If you give them what they want they will come, no matter what the location" etc etc. Well these guys are doing just that. There is parking at the back, BTW. We were so happy to see a line out the door to pick up, eat in etc. 
This place is going to be here forever! I would not be surprised if these guys open up 5 more of these thru out the valley!!!!!!!!!
