Is super awesome! You come there, check your bags, hangout, get on the plane and leave. When you comeback you repeat whole deal in reverse. Get it? 

As Graham C. said "I have a 100% success rate of leaving Sky Harbor on an airplane.

Stop reviewing the fucking airport. "

I ditto that - Stop reviewing fucking airport!!!

PS: So, let's suppose airports sux. Ok, fine. What are you going to do?? NOT use it and drive to Chicago, NYC or Florida? Yeah, right! Who cares if its good or not - there is no other option!!!
