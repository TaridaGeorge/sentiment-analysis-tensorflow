As a third generation hillbilly once removed, I am always on the look out for good biscuits and gravy. Not dry heavy bread balls with bacon fat, but real b&g. Slap my Grandma and kiss my grits if these aren't the best you've ever had! The biscuits are light and fluffy and the sausage gravy is perfect. You won't be sorry but you may need to lie down after you eat.
