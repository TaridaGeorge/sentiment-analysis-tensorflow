I love my Royal latte. There is no denying it, no way around it.

The space is exquisite... mint green with wood accent and polished silver. While the look is similar, it is also a different vibe with unique coffee cups from Alessi (store inside Biltmore as well), a quieter tone (nice escape from the stuffiness that Biltmore imposes at times) and relaxing music accented with smooth espresso and warm oatmeal.

The staff is warm, kind and friendly--per usual. 

I am anticipating their expanded line as the new location grows (and pastries in the morning)!
