Timo Wine Bar is the best place to go anywhere near Central Ave -- and anywhere north of Camelback! It's so amazing... top-notch cocktails and wine... pizza that rivals Phoenix's other bests (there are many!)... and appetizers and other food that are beyond bread...

The first time I came here my party ordered the Tiramisu and it came in a wine glass! So delicious!!!

Probably my favorite part about Timo Wine Bar is the eloquent and highly talented staff. They have great ideas, such as contests, cocktails, and they keep the clientele both staying and coming back daily! This is more than just a "friendly place" -- it's truly a home for many, many people.
