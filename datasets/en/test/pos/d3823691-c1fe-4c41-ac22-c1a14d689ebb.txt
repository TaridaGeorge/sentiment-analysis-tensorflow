I had a fabulous stay here. I tried to book the Firesky but it was sold out, so a co-worker suggested the Valley Ho. I had no idea it was a palace of retro funkiness. Nish said it was a Shag painting come to life, and I couldn't agree more. I had a moonlight swim, a waffle at the breakfast bar, and an all-around swank time. It was swell!
