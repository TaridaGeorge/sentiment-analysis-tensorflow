Yes, all the Targets are the same, but this one has green lasers pointing at it and Leona Lewis or the Cranberries playing before you get inside. Oh! This Target is clean and the workers are friendly.  I think that Arizona has the best customer service.  Retail workers in the Bay Area act like they're too good to be working so they throw up an attitude and this Target totally proves that Arizona Targets are so much better.
