I just returned from having a dreaded root canal with Dr. Hamberlin who I just met for the very first time, and I am pleased to report my entire experience from the time the appointment was made to walking out the door following my procedure was nothing short of being the most outstanding dental appointment I've ever had!  

Friendly, efficient staff - but it was the doc himself who stole the show!  What a nice, down to earth guy - who exemplified perfection and outstanding skill throughout the entire procedure.  

The kind of doctor you'd like to clone 1 million times over!  Hard to believe - but he makes going to the dentist a pleasure!!

Highly, highly recommend!!!
