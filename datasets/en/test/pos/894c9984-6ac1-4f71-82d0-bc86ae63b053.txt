This is the best pediatricians office around!  My daughter sees Dr Miller and she is so sweet!  She has been very supportive in our delayed shot schedule that we wanted to do.  
I love that they have a sick lobby and a healthy lobby!  And they have same day appts for her when she is really sick.
Their after hours help like is awesome!  If the nurse can't help the Dr on call will call you!
