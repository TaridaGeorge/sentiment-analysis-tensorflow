This is some good stuff.  Ordered the slider meal - which allowed me to sample the chicken, pork and beef BBQ for roughly 10 bucks.  I asked for some hot BBQ sauce on the side (they did not have it out on the tables) and went to town on this meal.  The meal was enough to make me satisfied without feeling like I ate too much.  The BBQ sauce on the sliders was more than sufficient but I am one of those guys that likes to douse their meat in BBQ sauce (otherwise it just does not feel right) .   Honey Bears was bare bones in decor but for a BBQ place, I am not judging on the quality of their pictures on the wall but rather the tastiness of the meat.  I would come back to this place in a heartbeat!  Highly recommend.
