I've been to Anthem more since this store opened than I have since the entire outlet mall opened. The sales are just sick -- once in a while, the entire store is 40% off. If you sign up for the emails, they send all kinds of crazy coupons. The clothes, admittedly, aren't as nice as the regular BR, but the overall flavor is very similar for a tiny fraction of the price. Last weekend, I got a pair of work dress pants, two chiffon tie-neck tops, a very expensive looking cowl neck top, and a button down shirt for my SO -- for about $115. That's insane!
