Little hole-in-the-wall pizza and sandwich place that reminds me of the way Scottsdale used to be before it went completely upscale. The pizza and meatball subs are delicious and reasonably priced and the staff is friendly. Definitely a great place to go and they even deliver if you live in the area.

Highly recommended!
