This place has a great little vibe and fantastic music. I have to admit, I'm not very hip when it comes to the Blues but I definitely enjoy listening to it when given the chance. It was a nice change to look into the crowd and see 21-year-old college students, to middle age moms, to retired couples all getting down and dancing. You rarely see such an eclectic mix of people, from every color of the rainbow, and all ages, just enjoying the music. The few times I've been there have been quite an experience, and I always leave very happy to have found a place like this in Phoenix. 

The drinks are super cheap, the sound is good, and the music is wonderful!
