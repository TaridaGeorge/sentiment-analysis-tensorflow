I sadly walked in this place to "finally" check it out on their last day of business.  Despite closing, the service was awesome, upbeat and professional. Their prices are also quite good. While I waited for my espresso drink (very good by the way), I enjoyed the ambiance of the cafe.  I hope they re-open somewhere nearby -- possibly Elliot & McClintock they say.  It's nice to have more locally owned places around, especially ones with great doughnuts.  Not that I need to eat them regularly, but it's nice to know of a "mom & pop" selling them. Thank you Cherubini and please re-open.
