All you people who dont like Barcelona need to get over yourself, let loose, and have some fun. It's a great place to go to dinner or pop in later in the night for the live band. Perfect for big parties...had my birthday there with 50 people...they did an amazing job. Such a fun place that offers a lot of different things...restaurant, night club, and lounge.
