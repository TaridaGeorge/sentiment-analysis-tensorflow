Based on all of your reviews I went on a wimb last Sunday and I got a same day appointment with Mary and she was AWESOME!!!  WOW!  I went with a sore lower back and sore legs from a hike I did the day before.  I left and my lower back was no longer sore AT ALL!  
I was surprised how much they worked on your upper body front and back, pleasantly surprised!   I just thought they worked on your feet.
I do have to agree about the noise from other rooms, but I felt so good the other noise did not bother me to much!
I will be going back and definitely asking for Mary!
