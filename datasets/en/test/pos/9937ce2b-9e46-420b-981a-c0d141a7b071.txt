They make really good wholesome sandwiches! The baked goodies are also yummy. The store is nice and the staff is friendly.

Okay, I want to update my review and say, "wow" this place is really great and if all owners/employees contacted their patrons to find out how to improve their stores, this world would be a much better place. I will be back to try out the salads and soups. Cannot wait...
