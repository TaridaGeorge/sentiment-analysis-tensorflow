I gave up Starbucks for lent, mostly to save money, and I decided to try this place, after passing it by several times. I've been here 3 times now and the staff are consistently friendly and they have hooked me up every time with some sort of discount! They have everything in a fat free, sugar free version also! It's my new favorite place!
