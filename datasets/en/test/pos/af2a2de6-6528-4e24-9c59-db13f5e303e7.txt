Stayed here with my sister the night before she got married - and what a perfect place it was! Not only did they accommodate a super late check-in, they sent up chocolate covered strawberries when they heard my sis was getting married.  We stayed in an enormous suite (for about $400/night) complete with wrap around patio that was perfect for the bridal party to get ready in - all 10 of us! Pricey but worth it! While we didn't partake, the pool was pretty and looked like a ton of fun. It was a perfect beginning to my sister's wonderful wedding day!
