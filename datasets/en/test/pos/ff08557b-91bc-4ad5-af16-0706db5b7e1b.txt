GREAT COUNTRY STYLE RESTAURANT! This place is a diamond in the rough. All the food is fresh and homemade. In AZ you usually get Mexican food so its so nice to have a change. They treat you like your family. The french toast was AMAZING! This place should be on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. I never want this place to close.
