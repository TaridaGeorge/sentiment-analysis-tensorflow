Kids Nite Tuesdays! Mascot, face painting, fun and more!  

The staff was so cool with all the kids. And CLEAN!  This location brought your order to your table, removed your tray and were just all around great! I even heard "my pleasure" when another customer asked for a refill. The staff member, Eric,  took the cup, refilled it and returned to the customer's table, smiling the whole time!  Both the young men working the dining area were polite and helpful.

The food was great too!  My son and I shared nuggets and waffle fries.  Okay he didn't share the waffle fries to much, I think I got one or two.

It was a great time for my son and I!
