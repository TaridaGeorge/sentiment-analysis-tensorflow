Cool bar, bike friendly, good draught selection!  Told the bartender I drink everything and that he should pick me a good beer, the result was a great suggestion that I enjoyed thoroughly.  This building's layout is kinda odd with a loft and a couple side rooms set up with dining tables.  This results in a cool ambiance and a take-me-back-to-the-golden-years attitude.  Love it.
