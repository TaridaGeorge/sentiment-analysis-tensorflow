This store is brand new,  just opened this past Sunday!!  It is right on the edge of the F Q Story historical district.  

The store has a more traditional coffee house feel than other Starbucks have.  With the exposed red brick and the open cubbies for storing the syrups, cups and saucers it, the store really says "Come in and stay awhile".   There's is a nice sitting area with two home style chairs and a chaise lounge.

The patio is inviting with a quite grassy area and many trees.  In just a few months, this is going to be the place to hang out and enjoy life!!
