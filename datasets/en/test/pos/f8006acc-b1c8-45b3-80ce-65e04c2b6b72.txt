I love frozen yogurt. A lot. I've been to many of the froyo spots in the East Valley - and Aloha is definitely my favorite. The yogurt is really tasty and great quality, selection of flavors is excellent, and the staff are super friendly. I even mentioned once that I thought their rainbow sprinkles were weird - and I love rainbow sprinkles - and the owner actually did some research on it and started ordering a different - and better - variety of sprinkles! I can't imagine one of the chain yogurt places doing that.

My favorite of their yogurts are the tarts - especially the Peach and Strawberry Tarts. But I have yet to try a flavor I didn't like. I recommend Aloha Yogurt without hesitation!
