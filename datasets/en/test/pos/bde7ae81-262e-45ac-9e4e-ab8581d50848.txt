This place is mothereffing gorgeous. It's not a market - it's a palace of culinary delights. Bigger and shinier (expectedly so as it's less than a few months old) than its east-side counterpart, Lee Lee's on Cactus & 75th Ave has all the common East/Southeast Asian mainstays in aisles so long they look like they run into the horizon.

You'll also find a noodle shop and a small bar that serves sushi, smoothies, & boba. I haven't tried any food here but look forward to doing so. There are some decorative art items, statues, Chinese DVDs, cell phone accessories, and other dry goods for sale as well.

Always been pleased with Lee Lee's overall and will incorporate this location into my schedule whenever I'm on the west-side.
