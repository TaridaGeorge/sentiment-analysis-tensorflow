Red Hot Robot is one of the best designer toy stores I've visited! It has a great layout that allows customers peruse both the toys and art without feeling cramped. They have a wide variety of toys, prints, art books, and more, which makes every visit a pleasure. They also carry an assortment of offbeat, unique toys and customs that you may not find elsewhere. The owner/operator, Jason, is an avid toy collector himself and is very knowledgeable about his products and artists. Red Hot Robot is a must visit if you're in the Phoenix area!
