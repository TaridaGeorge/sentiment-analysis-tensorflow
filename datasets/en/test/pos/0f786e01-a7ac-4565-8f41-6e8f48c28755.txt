Ordered Mi Quang and spring rolls.  Both  were surprisingly good.  The dipping sauce for the rolls was quite good and unique...their own creation and not just a mix of hoisin/peanut sauce. 
Large, very clean restaurant even the condiment containers were squeaky clean. More of take-outs than dine in.
The food presentation was nicely done compared to typical VN restaurants.
The only minus thing was the beer wasn't cold so needed to drink with ice, other than that the place was a gem.
