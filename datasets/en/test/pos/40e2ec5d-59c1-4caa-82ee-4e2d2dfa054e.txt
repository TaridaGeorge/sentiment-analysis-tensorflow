SOOO delicious!!  We go here all the time, even get the quart sizes (call ahead to order them, it takes them a while to make the larger sizes).  It is a little pricey, but we use our "tasti" card, so we get free yogurt or money off of our order often.  Our favorites are "peanut butter marshmellow" and "oreos and cream".  Their cakes are really great too!  They know us here and it's our favorite frozen yogurt place in town! :)
