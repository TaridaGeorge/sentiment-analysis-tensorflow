My sister in laws and my mom made me a beautiful baby shower back in March. Kelly did the cupcakes and cake and everything was absolutely amazing. Not only was she easy to work with (so my sister in laws shared) but everything tasted delicious and her attention to detail and coordination the day of the event was second to none. All of my guests raved about how delicious and beautiful everything was and I'll have to agree! I have since used Kelly for another event and plan to work with her again and again in the future!
