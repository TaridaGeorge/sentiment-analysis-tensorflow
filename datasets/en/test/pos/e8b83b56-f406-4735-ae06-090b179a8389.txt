Dr. Milana and his staff made me feel at ease from the moment I walked into the office...which is a big deal for me since I'm usually not that excited about going to the dentist.... ;)
I have recommended Arcadia Dentistry to some people at work and they've had good experiences as well.  It's a very nice new office, in a convenient location to boot.
