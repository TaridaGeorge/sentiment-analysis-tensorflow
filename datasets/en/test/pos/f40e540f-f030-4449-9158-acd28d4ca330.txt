Best Chinese place and the friendliest service. Yummy Mu shu chicken, rolled up vor you at the table. Inded , yhe service with the bowtie is a great assest (isn't he the owner?). Also, this is a place that listens when you request spicy. Just because you're white, a lot of restaurants will adjust the spicyness, not here they'll a comodate the customers wishes.
