This was my first time at Frost and I was really impressed.

First off, it was Sat night, so the place was hoppin' and crowded.  None the less, the line moved really fast and the staff offering samples/tastings of everything were helpful and nice (usually, some places are stingy with samples, but here they weren't).  We chose the coconut and espresso and couldn't help but moan with every spoonful - so impressive!

They also had a young guy offering small glasses of water (to wash down the gelato) to patrons - nice touch!

The place is obviously popular and for a good reason - it's damn good Gelato!
