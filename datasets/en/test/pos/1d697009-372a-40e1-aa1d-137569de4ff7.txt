I love this place.  It's a great little wine bar right near my house, which means I can have that one extra glass before the end of the night.  The wine list isn't huge, but changes frequently and has a lot of variety.  Wines by the glass aren't cheap, but the pours are VERY generous, which makes it well worth the money.  The atmosphere is laid back, and the couches are great for relaxing and hanging out.
