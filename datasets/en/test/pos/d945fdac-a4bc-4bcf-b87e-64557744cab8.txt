Not being a "bike" person, the thought of venturing into a bicycle specialty shop is a little intimidating to me...however, they couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful, which totally put me at ease. 

They have a very informed crew working there, everyone was busy working on bikes or talking with clients, but they didn't hesitate to take the time to answer questions and educate me a bit about the products I was looking to purchase. My son purchased a "Fixie" and not only is it slick, its a piece of art really (and this coming from someone who doesn't really dig bikes!), but the price was more than fair. Not sure whats going on with some of the haters reviews on here, my experience was delightful and I would definitely recommend Bicycle Haus to novices who are looking to buy a fabulous product but need a little guidance.
