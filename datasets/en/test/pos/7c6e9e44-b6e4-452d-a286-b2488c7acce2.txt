Being from Louisiana / Mississippi I have a special spot in my heart (and stomach) for Cajun food. If you want truly authentic Cajun food then look no further than this restaurant off the I-17. Everything is great. No matter if you want broiled fish or fried seafood the taste is awesome and the price is good. The raw oysters are great. The crawfish platter is fanstastic. The crawfish bisque is to die for. The boudin is authentic and good served on a bed of white rice. The only other place in town for Cajun food is Baby Kay's. I'm posting a review of them as well.
