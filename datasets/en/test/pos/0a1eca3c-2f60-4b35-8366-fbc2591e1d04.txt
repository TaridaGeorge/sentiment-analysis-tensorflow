Loved this place!! You must try the flank steak, the churros for desert and their breakfast spread on Sunday with mimosas is just Phenomenal!! Service is wonderful also, for dinner make sure to arrive early and have a drink at the R bar next to the restaurant for live music between 7-11 nightly.
My huband loved the calamari. I had the shrimp cocktail to start and it was one of the best I have had.
