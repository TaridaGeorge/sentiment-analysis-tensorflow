First time there.  Was immediately greeted by several friendly staff for an early lunch date.  Server was delightful and walked me through most popular items on the menu.  Had a delicious BLTA, but need to go back for the Reuben ... and breakfast!  Great presentation.  Great place for a girlfriend breakfast or lunch!  It wasn't packed at lunchtime on a weekday, but our server reported that their weekend business is strong.  Good for them after being open only a month!  We love to support small independent businesses!  :)
