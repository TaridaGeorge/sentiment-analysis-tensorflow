had my pup's usual yearly check-up and shots. these people are just so great. they spend so much time with us, and my dog leaves full from all the treats they give. 

after working in a hospital all day, i'm still amazed at how people whom work with dogs are always so stinking happy at this place. coming here after work and seeing how great they interact with my pooch makes even the worst day end on a happy note!
