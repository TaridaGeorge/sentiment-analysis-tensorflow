Vicky is amazing.  My skin loves her, her facials are amazing and my eyebrows are always so pretty when she is done.  Her pedicures are beautiful as well.  She is very friendly and will work with you to get you in her schedule (if you don't screw her by not showing up for appointments!)  She is the only person in this office, so you never have to worry about getting anyone else, and her prices can't be beat.  Definitely personalized attention!! Love her!
