This place is not in my hood but would definitely make the drive to this place over and over if it stays as good as today!

I felt immediately welcome by the cook and cashier when i walked in...I asked what they recommened and both said the chicken shawarma...I ordered the sandwich with the new garlic sauce for lunch today.....WOW.   The chicken was perfectly spiced and fresh along with the pita and other vegetables.  The prices are low too.

  This was my first time, and since it's an independant shop i'm hoping will stay consistent.
