I second all the good things said here. I had them put a hitch on my new truck--took an hour and works great first time out.  Later I needed a platform for a bunk in the bed after I put a topper on. After mulling over how I was going to do that, I took it to Lewis' and for a very reasonable price they built and installed.  I'm sure it's bombproof--very sturdy and well done.  Couldn't be more pleased.   I'll take any truck work/welding I need to this shop.
