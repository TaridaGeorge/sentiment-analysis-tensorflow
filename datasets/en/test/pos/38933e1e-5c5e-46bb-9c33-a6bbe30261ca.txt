In one word...excellent!  My fiancee and I had an amazing time here last summer, when we were upgraded to a Spa Casita Suite because the hotel had found out about our engagement, which happened right before we left for our trip.  The room was huge, the grounds were beautiful, the pool was awesome, and everything there was so peaceful.  The concierge helped us with directions to anywhere we wanted to go and the location was great as well...not far from the main drag, but somewhat hidden from the outside world.  We are hoping to return soon.
