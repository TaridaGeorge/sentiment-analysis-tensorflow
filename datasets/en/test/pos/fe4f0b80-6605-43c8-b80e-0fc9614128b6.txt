This is a great coffee shop for anytime of any day. During the evenings they have live artists come in and play, and it just has a really positive atmosphere.

There are tons of comfy chairs to sit and relax in, AND it's close to the parking lot, so its so easy to get to if you're in a hurry & just need coffee or if you want to stay and hang out.
