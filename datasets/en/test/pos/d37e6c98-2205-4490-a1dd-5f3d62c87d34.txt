This restaurant is everything I love about Phoenix. It combines San Francisco sophistication with San Antonio humulity, and even features Mrs. Myers delightful brew in the bathrooms. Folks, if you can only have one nice dinner in Arizona this is the place. I would give one bonus star for their amazing lunch specials, if I only could.
