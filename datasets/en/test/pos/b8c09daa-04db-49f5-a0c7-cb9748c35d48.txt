My girlfriend and I went here tonight for a pizza.  Since she's a vegetarian and I'm not, we decided to get half of it as a margarita and half with pepperoni.  

The end result is that the pizza is amazing!  The ingredients tasted very fresh, and they weren't stingy with the fresh mozzarella.  One of the things I really liked was that rather than using tomato slices for the fresh tomato, they used crushed.  It definitely made it harder for me to pull all the cheese off the slice because I didn't bite the whole way through the tomato!

The only downside to the place was that it was small inside.  I wouldn't recommend eating in if you have a large group.
