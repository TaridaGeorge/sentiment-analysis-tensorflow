I haven't been swept up in the Great Cupcake Bubble of 2007-2009, but these are absolutely delicious. The olive oil carrot cupcake with mascarpone icing is one of my favorite treats in town. 

Owners are very accomodating, bake everything in small batches on site, and "use organic whenever possible."  The menu features cookies (mojito cookies!), cakes, tarts, and some well-crafted lunch items from Tuesday to Friday. 

The Sweet Pea brain trust decorates the airy space with local art, and the bakery is located next door to the Royal Coffee Bar -- the corner of Jackson St. and 2nd Ave. is the perfect spot to get caffeinated  and indulge in a sweet thing. 

Tip: Bring some change; you might have to park at a meter.
