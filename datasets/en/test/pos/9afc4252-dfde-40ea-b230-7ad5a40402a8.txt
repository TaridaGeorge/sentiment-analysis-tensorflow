my favorite stop during AZ restaurant week this year!

i absolutely love the ambiance - open kitchen, exposed brick, lots of wood grain - the service was top notch and the food was divine!

everything that touched my tongue was absolute perfection.  the salad was hearty but light and fresh at the same time - highlighted with avocado and corn.  the hearty serving of meatballs in sauce were the perfect accompaniment to the fresh homemade rolls. the meatloaf and mashed potatoes took home cooking to an out-of-this-world level.  and the deconstructed smore was amazing!  (peanut butter mousse smeared on a plate with graham crackers, torched marshmallows and chocolate dipped bacon!!! YUM)

highly recommended.  i practically had to roll myself out of beckett's table -full and completely satisfied.
