No doubt about it, one of the best places I've been to in Phoenix. It's a little out of my normal radius but I'll make an exception. 

The steak was delicious, thick and juicy, cooked to perfection and bursting with flavor and spice. 

The restaurant itself is tiny (which I like) but also has open patio seating. Make a reservation if you want a table inside. Or if you're a native Phoenician like me who loves sitting on a patio on warm summer nights under a cooling mist, then no reservation is needed. 

Staff was friendly and kept my water full. (Bonus points for that!) I'll try to go back for happy hour soon. I'll be taking my out of town friends here as well. It's a triumph.
