I've taken two classes at SnapFactory (Digital Photography 101 and Studio Lighting) both have been excellent!  

Mark is a great teacher, he takes complex concepts and breaks them down into easy to understand chunks using fun analogies and computer animations.  His classes use the latest in technology (videos/animations, real time viewing and critique of photos on a large flat panel, real time demonstrations of in-camera functions using live view and the flat panel, etc.) yet remain very personal.  

Mark takes an genuine interest in each of his students and ensures that he/she succeed!

I've also found the interaction with other students to be very beneficial, each class learn from each other and further friendships. 

Mark, Diane, Kelsey & the entire SnapFactory team are wonderful, I can't recommend them enough!
