I give this place a 5 star.  Reason is that it looks like a fairly new hotel and everything was clean.  Plenty of parking in front and back.  When I checked in, they had everything ready for me and it was a breeze.  Room was clean and modern and TV had plenty of channels to scroll through.  Hotel is in an industrial area but a short drive to the Fashion Center.
