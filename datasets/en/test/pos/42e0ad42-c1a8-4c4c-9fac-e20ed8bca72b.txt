So I reviewed Hula's a couple months back with a not-so-satisfied tale of my first visit. And it's true, the first time I went our waitress did not appear very happy when we said we were skipping dinner and only doing drinks... and proceeded to ignore us most of time... but perhaps it was an off night for the poor girl. Despite that night, I did not give up on Hula's and have since been back numerous times (is it bad that it's pretty much weekly?).

Why I frequent:

- Best bean burger known to man.
- Literally every cocktail on the menu is delicious...
   and served in a funky tiki glass.
- Any dish with fish can be replaced with tofu.


...all at a very reasonable price.
