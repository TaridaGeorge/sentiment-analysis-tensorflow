Incredible customer service.  They are very friendly and go out of their way to learn the names of all of their regular customers.

There is a good patio for sitting, which attracts a large crew of regulars who spend a good part of the morning there.

A line does sometime form around 8-9 am, and I sometimes wonder why they don't do more to make sure during their super rush hours they aren't better staffed.

Overall though, this is my favorite Starbucks.
