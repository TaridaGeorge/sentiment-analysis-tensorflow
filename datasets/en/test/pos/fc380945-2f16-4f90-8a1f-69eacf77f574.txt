I have been going to Nick & Candy for several years now as they are close to my work.  I go in at lunch and Nick does my nail fill for me in just over 1/2 hour!  How great is that?!  :-)  Candy gives heavenly pedicures and their prices are super reasonable (pedicures are $18, fill is $14 and a new set, including removal of the old set is $25).  They are fabulous about keeping your appointment time and not letting walk-ins take your time and then you are "squeezed" you in and making you late the way that other salons do.  I frequently phone Nick for a last minute appointment - sometimes he has them and sometimes not but, when you get a slot, you know they will cater to you during your scheduled appointment time.  Nick and Candy are both super friendly and give excellent service.
