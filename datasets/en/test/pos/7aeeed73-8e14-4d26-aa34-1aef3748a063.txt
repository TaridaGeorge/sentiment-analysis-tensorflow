This is the perfect place to enjoy a glass of wine (or a bottle) on the patio.  I can't think of another place I would rather be in Ahwatukee on a nice night.  The atmosphere is so relaxing.  

The food is wonderful.  I highly recommend the specials of the day.  All of the fish is flown in daily and cooked to perfection!  The wine list is very extensive and fairly priced.  The butter cake dessert will change your life.  

If you are in the area, you must stop by!
