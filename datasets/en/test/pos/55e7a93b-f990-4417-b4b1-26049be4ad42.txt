Went there for the first time yesterday to buy a ticket for an upcoming Jon Krakauer lecture/signing (woo!)

I was totally impressed.... it pleasantly reminded me of my favorite book store back home. The layout of the store is really fun... and easy to navigate.... and the staff is SO HELPFUL!!! and SO NICE!!! :)

Unfortunately I was on my lunch break so I didn't have much time to kill.... but I'll definitely be going back!! :)
