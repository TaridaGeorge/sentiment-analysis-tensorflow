I've been going here since high school and this is my favorite tennis club in AZ.

The pros here are top notch. Greg Prudhomme is a fantastic teacher; he is always positive and he knows his stuff. Brian is also a great coach: he makes things very easy and I always find his tips very helpful.

The part I like is they have programs that can fit my schedule and are reasonably priced. Attendance is flexible for adult clinics and we learn about two new things every time.

Courts are well maintained and lighting is good (which is something I can't say about some other tennis clubs in AZ).
