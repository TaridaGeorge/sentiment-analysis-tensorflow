Wow is the best way to put it. Since I travel a lot, and love spicy food, I frequently try to search out unique and tasty places. The food these lady's put out is among the best Thai food I have had and I have been to many. The great combination of awesome food with a friendly attentive staff makes this a "go to" place. I can assure you this will be on my list on the next trip to the area, and now I can't wait to come back!
