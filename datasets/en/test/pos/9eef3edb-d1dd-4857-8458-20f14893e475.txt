Tried this restaurant out tonight... not having the highest hopes. I mean, come on, it is a "healthy" restaurant". I was pleasantly surprised. The food is pretty amazing. I had a pizza and my friend had a rice bowl. They were both tasty and decent sizes. Not too big and not too small. We didnt have any drinks, appetizers, or desserts... but what we did eat was tasty. I will be going back in the near future.
