I absolutely LOVE visiting Pro's Ranch Market! It's like going to Mexico without leaving Phoenix. The bakery, cocina, aguas frescas (including juiced vegetables made to order), Tortilleria, and well priced produce are unparalleled. The seafood and fresh meats, include cuts you won't find at Trader Joe's or Fry's like beef tongue and chicken feet.
