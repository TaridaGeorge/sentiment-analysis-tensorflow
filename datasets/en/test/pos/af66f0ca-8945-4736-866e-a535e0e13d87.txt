What a pleasure this was for mothers day! I'm going back for Easter next year..... The bottomless bloody marys  and mimosas were worth the $29 alone. Not to mention the raw bar, omelets, prime rib and various other yummy food they had around. The dessert selection was incredible! The district is a great event place for sure. One of my biggest things is service and they really nail it. Top rate venue even with small children.
