There's something so magical about The Roosevelt, especially when it's a slower than average night and you find yourself in the front room (not the one with the entrance; the one with the giant, uncovered window overlooking the south side of the lawn). Yes, there's something magical about sitting with a couple cool people, having a very free-flowing conversation, while Radiohead and Smashing Pumpkins play overhead. There's something so relaxing and chill about this place - with candlelight and fresh flowers scattered demurely around. 

And the menu... yes, plenty of beer to choose from, including a new fave cream porter from Portland. (The wine list is pretty nice, too.)

I love the rotating tap, too. I love walking by their stock and seeing kegs of Rogue. I now love that there's a "secret" bathroom outback, for those nights that are busy and you've drank your weight in pints.
