I work in the Galleria building and I eat at Cafe Conmigo almost every day.  I tell everyone that they make the best Veggie sandwich I have ever had anywhere.  They use fresh bread from The Bread Box, a local Scottsdale bakery.  The multigrain bread is so full of seeds and they use fresh avocado that is always bright green and never brown.  The other veggies are so fresh and full of flavor and crunch.  They customize my order with no problems.  The food is consistently good.
