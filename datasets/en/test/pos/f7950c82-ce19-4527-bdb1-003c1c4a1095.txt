This place is five stars.  As a connoisseur of coffee houses I've visited everyone single one in Tempe and Phoenix and this place is the best.  Plenty of seating, lighting is great, plenty of places to plug in, great coffee.  To top it all off the tea drinks are unique and come in variety!  All the staff are wonderful, down-to-earth, professional.
