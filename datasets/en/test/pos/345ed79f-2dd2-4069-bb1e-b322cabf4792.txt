Everything about this place is to love. The food is excellant! The kitchen is spotlessly clean. You can see it behind the glass when you walk in.                                            Lots of parking, Outside seating if you so desire. A cool little pond behind the restaurant with animals. We came here again the other night. We come here a lot. Love it and very healthy. I don't care too much for the extra charge for certain toppings. However, the food is always good and always freash.
