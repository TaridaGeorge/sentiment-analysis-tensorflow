I loved the Southwestern influences and the really creative menu, so creative you wonder if it'll work, but everything we ordered did. Just looking at the dessert menu made me wish I could try them all, although "settling" for the Red Hot Chocolate (cinnamon/cayenne-spiked pot de creme with chipotle cream) was quite acceptable.

I highly recommend having dinner here the first night of your first-ever visit to Phoenix, as I did.
