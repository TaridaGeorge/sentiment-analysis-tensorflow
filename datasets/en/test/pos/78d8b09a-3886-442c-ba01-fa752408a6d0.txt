I discovered Seville Cleaners off Yelp and I've been pleased. I know that no business is 100%, and the reviews suggest that they have fouled with other customers, but not with me. They are very courteous and helpful. The prices are palatable and the work is good.  On top of that, they have late weekday hours and wknd hours so I never feel like my wardrobe has been impounded because I can't beat closing time. Also, the one day turn around at Seville has saved my ass more than once!  So...good job!
