LOVE THIS PIZZA!!

Seriously, if you like thin, new york style pizza, COME HERE!!! Originally from Brooklyn, this might be as close to the 'real thing' as it gets this side of the rockies......

I'm speaking on behalf of my husband as welll, who lived in New York and is VERY picky about his pizza. He LOVED it! Now, for my pizza, I ordered it without cheese (not by choice :(  ) and it was still outrageous!!! The ingredients were fresh and the crust was divinely crispy. As for the pizza with cheese (as it should be, I know) they use fresh mozzarella, and it didn't looked smothered by it either.

I love their outdoor patio.....it's a cute little courtyard, nice and shady....looks like little Italy. :)

When my next pizza craving strikes, I know where I'm headed!
