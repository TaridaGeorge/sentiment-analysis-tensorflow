Bad Donkey is the north Phoenix answer to Cheba Hut.  No, it's not the same, but if you are jones'n for a top-quality toasted sub it's a good place to go.

I had their "Grass on a Roll"  - whole bunch a fresh veggies, cheese with "Bad Donkey Sauce".  Good eats!

Cute place, good food and a very friendly staff.
