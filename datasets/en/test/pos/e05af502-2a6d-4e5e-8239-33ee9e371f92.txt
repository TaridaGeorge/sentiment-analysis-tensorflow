Not our first time here and it won't be our last. The place was packed tonite. This is the kind of restaurant that deserves to be packed... Not the same old assembly line chain restaurants.  We waited for a table, and waited a bit longer than usual for our dinner, but it was well worth it! And our awesome waitress Faith gets a big thanks for her excellent customer service, and not just with us. She was very busy but never stressed and didn't let you feel forgotten while waiting for dinner. She even gave us dessert on the house for waiting so long. As for the food... Excellent as always!!!!
