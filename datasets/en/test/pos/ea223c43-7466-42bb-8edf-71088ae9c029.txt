How can one not love vegan pastries??  The pop tarts are amazing.  They use organic strawberry preserves, thank goodness, because we all know how toxic non-organic strawberries are these days.  The cupcakes are great and my friend tells me the coffee is good too (I don't imbibe!).  We come here often...when we want a treat of course!  If you get there early, sometimes they have discounted yummies from the day before!!!!
