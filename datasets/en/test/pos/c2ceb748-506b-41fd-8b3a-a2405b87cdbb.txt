Unbelievable flavors, my favorite is the salted caramel,make it into a sundae w the delicious homemade waffle dishes, topped w hot fudge and can't miss the to die for homemade marshmallows toasted a bit:-) I love the other flavors too, so hard to choose 1 or 2..Jan n Helen are true artists when it comes to ice cream! Don't forget to bring home a bag of salted caramels! Yummy:-)
