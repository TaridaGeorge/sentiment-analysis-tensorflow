Cool place with nice gently used designer clothing for men and women. Not a bad men's selection either which is not common. My wife stopped in with about 10 of my shirts and some of her clothes and they gave us $60 cash which was enough to buy some jeans and a few shirts. I'll start making this a regular stop to check it out since there were shirts for as low as $7 and designer jeans for $25!  Small little place is next to Heidi's deli on the NW corner of T-bird and 83 ave.
