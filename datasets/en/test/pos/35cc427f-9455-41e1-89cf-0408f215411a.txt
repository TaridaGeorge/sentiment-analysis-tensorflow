I read the other review (at the time of this posting I was number 2).  I too followed Kelli from her old location.  It is too difficult to find someone who is professional, kind and truly likes what they do for a living.  

Lucky for me Kelli's new location is even closer than her old location and since she is her own boss she has more flexibility in regards to prices and scheduling.  I have been in Phoenix for 3 years and she is the first person I found that has made me a repeat client.
