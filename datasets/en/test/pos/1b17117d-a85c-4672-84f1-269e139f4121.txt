The only drag about LGO is the crush of people and the lack of parking. Otherwise, there's little not to like about this place.

Beyond the entire LGO experience, the Pizzeria's pies are astounding. They may not be Bianco level, but the sourdough crust is enough to set them apart and wait is rarely more than 10 minutes, even with pickup. We particularly love the roasted corn and goat cheese pizza (add Italian sausage for richer flavor). The burgers are amazing, too. Some of the best in the city.

Oh, and the white sangria. Get that. Beer-wise, the selection is limited.

Service is typically excellent, though sometimes there's a wait for a table. I recommend getting there sooner rather than later so you can find a seat and the buzz from the sangria can last the rest of the evening.
