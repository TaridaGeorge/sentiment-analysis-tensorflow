Very good gelato. Maybe not as good as Angel Sweet (I am nothing if not loyal), but close. Arlecchino is made fresh from scratch daily. It reveals everything else for the artificial-flavoring-using imposters that they are. 

The fact that the owners are transplants from Italy is very impressive. Their Cortina flavor (roasted almond with lingonberry) should be on the list of 1000 to Do Before You Die. It's THAT good.
