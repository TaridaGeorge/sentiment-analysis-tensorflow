One of may favorites in the Phoenix area. The attention to all details is apparent - seating, lay out, art work, service, back ground music - all of it is impeccable. One key criteria for a good dining experience - does it put you in a good mood once you step in? The answer re Chelsea's is a resounding Yes. They've done a wonderful job with the layout from the entrance patio to the fresh air indoor dining area to the indoor/outdoor bar that rolls out to the outdoor dining area for a Southwest feel with a fireplace. How about the food?- ribs, salads, burgers and especially the fish taco's are highlights. I've been a dozen times - for a number of events - drinks/appetizers, business, friends/family. Great people watching and terrific energy. This is one from the LGO family of restaurants.  A real winner.
