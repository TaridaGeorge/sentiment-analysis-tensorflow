Called these guys up on a Friday and was able to get an appointment on Sunday.

Joel and Juan were very nice and did a very good job at cleaning our carpet (hope we get our rental deposit back).  Comparing Sweet Touch with this other company we went with a while back after seeing a coupon in the weekly ads, Sweet Touch did a better job 10 times better.  

Their prices are affordable and don't hide any extra fees from you.  What they quote you is what you pay.  

Thanks SweetTouch!  


HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!
