Amazing. Simply the BEST breakfast place in Phoenix. Always friendly staff, super fast (not the wait to get a table), the highest qualify food. It's refreshing to eat at a restaurant that clearly takes pride in the products they buy, and the flavor of the food they serve.

Every item we've tried has been beyond delicious. The only down side is the usual wait to get a table. They do a great job of being on their game, and serving quickly without making you feel like they are rushing you. This is a MUST try for any breakfast lover. Best advice: get there early, and try the griddle cakes!!!
