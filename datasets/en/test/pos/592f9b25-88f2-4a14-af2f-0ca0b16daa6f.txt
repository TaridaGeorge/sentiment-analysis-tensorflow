So this time we ordered in bulk for a backyard wedding rehearsal dinner.  we had ordered the brisket and pulled pork and cole slaw by the pound.  Unfortunately, while we were at the rehearsal, the dog tried ALL of the brisket (and amazingly left the rest untouched) so I can't tell you how it was.  But the rest was great as always!
