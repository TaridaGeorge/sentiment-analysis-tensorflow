Seriously, the staff & Dr. Marc are more than fantastic... glorious dental care!! 

I was with them for 5 years before having to move to CA, I was so sad to leave them behind. I even had a filling that felt loose & emailed them, within 3 minutes I had a reply! When I did find a new dentist, Sher're called to make sure I was doing well! 
Very responsive, caring and detailed! Dr. Marc is so delicate with you, I have a serious fear of drills, he let me turn up my ipod as loud as I could & made sure I was comfortable throughout! 

All the hygienists & specialists are professional, down to earth & genuinely care about your dental health!
