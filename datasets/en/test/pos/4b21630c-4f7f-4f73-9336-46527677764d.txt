Villa Deli is one of the best neighborhood delis in town, bar none. The staff is ALWAYS friendly and courteous (even when I'm not in the best mood.) Best lunch in town: Their large Italian sub with chips and a drink. They've also got torrone and other Italian treats. There is sometimes a large lunch crowd, but it's never too busy that I can't find a seat. I'm just surprised nobody has reviewed this place yet: It's definitely worth a visit for those who have never been there. It's a good deli run by good people, and I'm glad to see it going strong.
