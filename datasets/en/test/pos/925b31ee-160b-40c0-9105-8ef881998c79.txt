Off the chart amazing!!! We went here for my birthday and it was literally the best Italian restaurant I have ever eaten at ( and I've eaten at my share in Italy). The ambiance was a soothing glow of gentle lighting and rustic brickwork, with Italian opera piped in. The food was a perfectly prepared collection of hand-made pastas in exotic flavors - cheese infused, squid ink colored, and wonderfully sauced. The desert was a just-right tiramisu - capping a delectable meal. Yes, it's a bit pricey - but TOTALLY worth it for special occasion food.

Oh - and come on Saturday evenings to get serenaded by live opera singers!
