I went to Zuma Grill for lunch, and it was awesome!  I have very high standards for green chile, since I am from New Mexico, and their green chile pork stew was great.  I also had their bacon cheese burger with green chile.  I highly recommend eating there.  In fact, I signed up for Yelp specifically so I could write a review on the delicious food offered at Zuma Grill.
