I love this place and am so happy I found it. The food was fresh and flavorful and probably the best mediterranean food I have had outside of Italy! Great atmosphere, tables just like I sat in in the trattorias in Italy. The owner was the nicest man, and actually talked to us throughout the meal and told us all kinds of interesting historical facts. My mom said it was the best gyro she has had and the sausage and peppers were as good as I make and maybe even better :) Can't wait till I am back in Phoenix next month to go again.
