I live down the street from Tuck Shop and really enjoy riding my bike to go to dinner. This place is perfect for that. The food is delicious and the staff is SUPER friendly. 

I've had a few of their plates and I'm not disappointed in anything I have tried there so, my suggestion, try whatever you like.
They make an excellent dirty martini too.

I hope that they get some outside seating. I would love to sit outside and enjoy the weather while I can.

I am really hoping that they purchased the little house next door. I drive by the place every day and someone is in there working on it and I did see paperwork from the city about serving alcohol outside stuck on the door a few months back after the house was sold. *Squee!!* I will be one happy lady if that's the case!
