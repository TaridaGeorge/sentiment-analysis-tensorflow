This place has amazing food, separate menus for lunch and dinner and a full bar. There is dining inside or on the patio.
I think the entire staff is Italian and you can usually hear conversations in Italian between the staff and customers, adding to the ambiance and authenticity.
The Northern Italian cuisine is truly amazing, the staff is always warm and friendly. The meals start out with a few kinds of bread and dipping sauces and vinegar and oil. I could go just for that.
There are plenty choices for vegetarians and carnivores alike.
