I had the blackberry/lavender and the spicy mango. The blackberry/lavender was good but I didn't get any lavender flavor at all. It did have entire blackberries inside, a nice surprise. It was still so good I couldn't resist trying another one. The spicy mango was definitely the favorite - intense mango flavor, with huge chunks of mango within, and spicy! I was surprised and pleased with how spicy it turned out to be.

The shop is small and cozy, so there isn't a lot of seating, but on the Saturday afternoon I was there, my friend and I had no problem getting a seat. The minimal design of the interior is great and makes it clear it's all about the popsicles.
