Came for brunch on a Saturday morning. The room was light and comfortable and very inviting. The first thing that I noticed was the hip bartender with the mowhawk and tattoos, it was fantastic. They only serve beer and wine, so our brunch beverages were beers and mimosas. They have vegetarian options as well as dishes with meat. They have a very simple eggs and bacon dish for $3. We also ordered walnut toast, which comes with triple creme brie and a house-made berry jam. This, too, was only $3 and they kept bringing us refills of it. 5 stars for delicious and inexpensive food, such a friendly server and for being generous with the portions.
