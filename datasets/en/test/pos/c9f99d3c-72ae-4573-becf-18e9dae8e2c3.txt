I'm biased, so lets get that out of the way first. That being said, the guy knows how to cook and places his customers at a level above all else. Is he pleasant to work with? Who cares, thats not why you go here. You go to his restaurant to be amazed, impressed, and well taken care of. He is an artist and deserves his reputation as one of the area's best chefs. A casual stop at the bar for happy hour or a romantic date with your significant other...its a treat. Enjoy yourself.
