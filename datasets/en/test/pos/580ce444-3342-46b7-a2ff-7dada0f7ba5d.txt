Wow, just got back from here after having middle back pain this morning.  I called and they took me right in with no wait.  They did a full test and used this awesome external EMG test that can see the muscles in the spine and show where I need work.  I thought this was the coolest thing to see.  The bench they work on you with moves up and down while they work and it's pretty cool.  Nick worked on me and I can tell you that I am glad I went since it was not to aggressive but very effective.  I have been to chiropractors in the past and left in more pain but not today.  They did a great job and I will most definitely go back.
