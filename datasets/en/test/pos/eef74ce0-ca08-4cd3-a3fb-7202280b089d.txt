I LOVE Breadfruit! The last time I went in I was bummed to see they weren't carrying my favorite bok-choy dish any longer (maybe it was seasonal?) but the food was fantastic, as was the vegan dessert. If I lived closer I would go here at least weekly. Cute atmosphere, great music and wonderful food.
