they has nice water. 



i've only been here a couple times, but every time has been enjoyable.

but last night i just drank water and tried to hydrate up. 

my most common experiance with Four Peaks is drinking their Hefe at the Roosevelt. I guess if i lived near Tempe, i could be convinced to drink here more often.
