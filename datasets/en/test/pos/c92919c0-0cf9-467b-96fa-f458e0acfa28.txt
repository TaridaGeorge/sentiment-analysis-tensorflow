I do a lot of traveling and during a quick trip to Phoenix, I was able to get two classes in at their studio. It was very clean and the people were friendly. I did think the studio was excessively hot my second class but everyone else seemed to be ok with it so perhaps it was just me. 

I would defiantly return if I were in the area again.
