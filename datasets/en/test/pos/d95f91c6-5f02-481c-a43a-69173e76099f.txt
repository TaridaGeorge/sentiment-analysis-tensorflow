The wrap (Veggie Jackson) I got was amazing.  The vegetables were cooked just right (not too soft but cooked enough to get that right crunch without it being still being raw) with the perfect mix of rice and feta cheese.  This place was introduced to me by my best friend and her husband, and they were spot on.  I ordered a side of their lentil soup and that was equally tasty.  I also like the concept of their menu - simple and fresh.  

The service was good, and the place clean with plenty of seating inside and out.

Now if only they will open a location in SoCal that will be great!  I definitely plan on going back the next time I'm in Phoenix.
