My co-workers and I  drive all the way over and wait in line during the lunch rush on our 30 min break (We'll risk it for Chicago Gyros!).  I also go there on the weekends because it's soo good and my boyfriend loves it too! I've been to other Greek Places in the area and their meat is dry and the people are rude. 

CHICAGO GYROS IS WHERE IT'S AT FOR SOME YUMMY GYROS!!!
