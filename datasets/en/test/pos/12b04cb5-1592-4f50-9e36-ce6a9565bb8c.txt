so this is what its like to be treated like a king. from the moment we took our seats til the last bite of the "chocolate molten cake" (which im going to say is a definite must), we were in awe of not only the setting, atmosphere, and delicious meats/treats.  
before our wonderful dining experience (or might i say carnivore adventure), i had no idea what to expect... but, between the delectible sun-dried tomatoes (or you could pronounce it,, sun dried tom-ah-toes) and the filet mignon there was an outstanding staff ready to serve.  
what i recommend::::::
besides all of it.....
-sundried tomatoes
-potato salad
-cucumbers
-filet
-top sirloin
-pic-kanye???
-and a must.. pitcher of sangria
amazing way to end an amazing night... happy 3 year babe ;)
