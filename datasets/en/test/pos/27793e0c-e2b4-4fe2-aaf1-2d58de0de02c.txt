I had such a great experience at the Curry Corner tonight! I was really hungry, and showed up 20 minutes before closing (I was that customer, I know), but surprisingly they were completely welcoming and accommodating! I never felt rushed or like I was inconveniencing them at all.The food was awesome too! I got the Vegetable Thali which came with several different curried vegetable dishes, rice, naan, amazing pickled onion, and raita.I was very impressed with this place, and will definitely be back!
