Tasty deliciousness! I had apple crepes which were good but I couldn't finish them... It was a hefty portion. Best hashbrowns ever! I always order them crispy and they either always come gooey or burnt, this place got it right and they have onions in too which makes for a yummy flavor. My husband got a build your own omelet which he loved. Coffee wasn't great but decent. All for 20 bucks!!! Good food great price! :)
