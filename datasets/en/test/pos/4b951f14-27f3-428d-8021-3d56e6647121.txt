I recently had the opportunity to give this place a second try, and what a world of a difference!
Had reservations with my husband for our wedding anniversary and from the beginning we had a change of heart about the place. From being handed black napkins so that we would not get lint on our clothing, to the bread service (neither of which happened on previous visits) everything was outstanding! Our server Gary was prompt, friendly, knowledgeable, and made us feel very welcome. 
I again had the Filet, which of course was AMAZING. We tried the Mac N Cheese but it really wasn't all that impressive. 
I really cant wait to eat there again, and bringing more of our foodie friends with us!
Thank you CPH crew for making me see why this place gets 5 stars!
