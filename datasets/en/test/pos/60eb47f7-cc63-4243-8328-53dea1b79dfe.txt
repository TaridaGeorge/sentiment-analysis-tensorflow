I had a busted tooth that was killing me on a Saturday,  the staff got me in and took necessary steps to aleviate the pain.  The office crew were courteous and polite. 
I hadn't been to the dentist for several years and was quite surprised at the advances in dental field.  I had never been able to say that going to the dentist was nearly painless and pleasant but that appointment changed all of that.  I actually looked forward to the remaining vists needed to bring my mouth up to date.
I have nothing but good to say about my experience with the Dental Depot.
