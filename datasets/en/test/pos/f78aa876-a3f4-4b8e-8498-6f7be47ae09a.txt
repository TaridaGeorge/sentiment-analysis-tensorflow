It is not your Vegas buffet, but you can find a tour of Asia in this west side strip mall sampling cuisine from Japan, Thai, Chinese, and Korean.  We had a party of 13 which took up 1/2 of the restaurant.  I had ordered the cha jang myun (black bean sauce with noodles) and sweet and sour pork.  It is not the typical Chinese version of sweet and sour pork.   The rest of party had ordered Kalbi, sul lung tang (a hearty, luxuriant beef broth made from ox bones), and champong (hot spicy noodle).    The dishes were huge.  I think I over ate, but it was just so good.  Our server was great and she thought of everything before we thought of requesting extra plates for our birthday cake.    They were very accommodating for a large group.  It's a great place I will definitely go back.
