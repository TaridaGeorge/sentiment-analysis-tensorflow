I thought the the menu was very inventive and that the food was great.  We had a large party of eight with four kids and they found a way to get us in.

The pizza and salad menu was very different from your average place.  Everyone at our table got something different and each pizza was delicious.  The service was good; quick, friendly but nothing that truly stood out.  The prices do seem a little excessive, especially when you consider that each person is ordering a pizza and a salad (which produced a TON of left-overs).  I didn't get to see the final bill as my father-in-law fought for (and won) the bill, but I can only imagine that it was steep.
