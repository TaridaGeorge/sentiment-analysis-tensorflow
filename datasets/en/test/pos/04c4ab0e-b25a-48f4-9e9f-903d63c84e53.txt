my husband and i LOVE this place! 

no, we cannot afford to get our weekly groceries here (although it would be terrific if we could), but we view oakville as an excellent alternative to dining out on the weekend. 

the food is delicious (think deli, simplicity, quality ingredients), and the atmosphere is comfortable and relaxing! we found that if it's too crowded inside, then it's easy enough go outside to the awesome patio area to enjoy our beer and goodies :)
