Forget Semi Homemade with Sandra Lee...it's more like Semi Homemade and Fabulous with Teresa Marie.

Seriously, I have never loved a supermarket more.  AJ's is amazing, don't get me wrong; but for everyday, affordable groceries, F & E is the place for me.  (could I have put more commas in that sentence?!)

Watch for $3 and $5 off coupons in the mail.  They don't work on wine or beer though!  Even so, I love me some Fresh & Easy!
