This pertains to the golf course.  Played here last week and thoroughly enjoyed it course.  This is a beautiful golf course.  Great shape, tremendous scenery with Camelback mountain in many of the backdrops for tee shots, lots of variety.  You never feel like you are seeing the same hole.  I have played about a dozen different courses in the Scottsdale area and for me this was the nicest I have played.
