We stopped in again yesterday for a late lunch/early dinner. We did it again where we got there in the hour where lunch specials are over and dinner specials haven't started. Its fine though because my boyfriend got a combination plate (three tacos, rice, beans for $8) and I got an egg and bean burrito ($3.75), rice ($2) and beans ($2). Once again, it was very filling and I regretted only that I'd ordered a little too much.
