I go to Tiffany & Company because they keep in stock something that I can't find anywhere else and that is Tiffany cologne for Men.  Quite frankly, I don't want to have think about whether I smell spicy, woodsy, or one of fifty other things. This cologne has a what I consider a unique scent.  It is masculine without having to prove it is anything else.   It is appropriate to wear for any occasion and I never feel like I am going to knock people over with the smell of it.   I like Tiffany for Men and that's all I need.
