Officially our new hang out spot. We have been the last 3 Saturdays in a row! The atmosphere is great and we love the live music. Plus, 65+ beers on tap and great food! They also rotate the bands nicely...each Saturday (out of the last 3) they have had a different band. The one last night was great...never seen a lead singer play the drums before!
