A fantastic lunch spot. I had a chance to show my parents the Kierland area and I chose NoRTH to feed them. It probably helps that it was a beautiful day out but as usual the food was great and the experience was made even better because of our server. I almost never remember a servers name because I doubt any remember mine but Sarah was the best I have ever had at any restaurant. She was helpful with the menu and was able to put up with my dad who usually gives them all a run for their money. She ended up sitting down and chatting for a little bit at our request and had just the best personality. They are lucky to have her there.
