Cartel is the only place in the state of Arizona to have good coffee. Jason and Amy rule so hard at life, even if the coffee wasn't good, I would still go there just to hang out with them. While traveling recently, I checked out a lot of coffee places that Jason recommended to me, but nothing compares to this wonderful establishment. I couldn't wait to come home and get my morning coffee at Cartel, every glorious day.
