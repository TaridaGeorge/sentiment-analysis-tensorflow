Quite often, KJZZ weeknight broadcasts are my escape from reality when I want to just kick back and relax.  With playlists inclusive of Miles, Dinah, Terence, Duke, Ella and Coltrane - this jazz is the real deal.

It's not my most favorite public radio station (that honor would go to KCRW in California), it could stand to grow some dimensions and diversify its music programming.

Regardless, I still love KJZZ and have listened to more Morning Edition, Diane Rehm, All Things Considered, This American Life and Whaddaya Know than you probably care to know. 

 I have also heard KJZZ jazz broadcasts also come in handy if you're looking to get lucky.
