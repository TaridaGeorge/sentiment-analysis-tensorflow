We had a client whose computers failed on-site. We're half way across the country during Thanksgiving with no way to fly out in time to get the computers fixed. I called several places, not a single one picked up, until I reached Cory. Cory was absolutely great to work with and had the PCs up and running in no time at all. 

Great customer service, fast turnaround time, very knowledgeable and rates were competitive. Can't go wrong with Plexus!
