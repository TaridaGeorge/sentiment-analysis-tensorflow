Tom, Thomas and both Marks control this house firmly and effectively.

I have made three visits to this restaurant in the Central Corridor. I sat at the bar and on a high top table. The design is superb. This stunning modernist interior boasts fluid metallic and glass but no acoustics. The staff shows a cohesion that is art in motion.

I have enjoyed the salad meals with fish or chicken on top, I guess I should diverse and try something that suggest Moroccan. My martinis are awesome. My date and I certainly enjoyed each other and Fez made it that much better. The guys sure have a beautiful dream goin on here.
