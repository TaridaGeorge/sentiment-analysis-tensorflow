I transferred a Shelby Mustang from one of their stores in Tennessee to this location. My contact was Gail Williams and I could not have been happier. She assisted me with the transfer process, test drive, all my questions, and the final purchase. 
I was skeptical going into Carmax as I had not known anyone to buy from them, however after such a stress free, wonderful experience, I will be purchasing all my vehicles from them in the future. 

As a side note, I sold them my current vehicle and they matched the Kelley blue book price which I was pleased with. 
Its amazing why none of the other "dealers" have not not matched Carmax business plan because there is a reason why carmax gets such high praise.
