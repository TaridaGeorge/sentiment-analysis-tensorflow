I'm from California so not a native fan of Cracker Barrel, but I'm converted now. I come here just for the pancakes and they are spectacular. Good Job Cracker Barrel on a delicious pancake recipe and cooking. Mama's pancake breakfast is the only thing I order and it's really very good. Keep up the good work.
