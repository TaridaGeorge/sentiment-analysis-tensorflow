When I made our reservation, I jokingly added a note that my wife and I were celebrating our 16.5 wedding anniversary.  Eddie V's, though, took it seriously and pulled out all the stops - rose petals on our table, signed Happy Anniversary card, and free dessert.  I mentioned several times that it wasn't really our anniversary, but they would hear nothing about that!  LOVED IT!  We will be going back as often as we can!
