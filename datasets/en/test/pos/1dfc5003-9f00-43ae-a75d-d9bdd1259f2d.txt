We have always loved this place and this is our favorite location unless we meet  friends who live further south of us and then we go to Tempe location. The food has always been excellent and fresh and about the only place we go out to eat

Please do not change this great place to a Soup Nazi Field Kitchen or we will not return since we went to the one in Tempe and it was horrible and like some alternate universe ST and these good ratings will be dropping like a rock as have all the other locations that changed..
