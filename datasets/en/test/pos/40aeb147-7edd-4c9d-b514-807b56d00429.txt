I've yet to find an AJ's i do not like ..but. ..I Love this AJ's ! 

What first fascinated me about AJ's was the charming little items you can find for gift giving and you can grab a great bouquet of flowers and pick up a delectable cake, bottle of wine all while you grocery shop !...oh and the BREAD ! just to look at it ( a few times) and on occasion buy a delicious loaf of Kalamata or Challah ....so good ! 

Wonderful service here and a great glass of ice tea too !
