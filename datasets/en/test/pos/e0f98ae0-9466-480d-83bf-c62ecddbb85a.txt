great place to strictly booze it up. 

show up at happy hour which is until 9pm, 7 days a week! (1/2 off drinks/$3 liters of domestics) 

or late night to hang with some hotties.

small patio. small dance floor. which is kinda a good thing.

they have a few small TVs playing sports and movie clips in between the good selection of music.

but just to drink theres nothing wrong here.
