I've traveled from San Diego to come here (well, not just for the store).
A couple of hours of your life can be wasted here but it's all in good reason.
Found a Kenneth Cole Jacket here for $30 bucks. I have the same one in a different color that I bought at Macy's for $75.
Also found another Kenneth Cole Jacket that was wool, $35.
Found unused Ferragamo shoes $80.
The list goes on...
See for yourself.
