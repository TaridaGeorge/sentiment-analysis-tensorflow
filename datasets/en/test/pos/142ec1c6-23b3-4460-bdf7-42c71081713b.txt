I love this place!! Great service, Great food, really cool ambience. When I'm at Fashion Square I always stop here for lunch. Nice small bar. Cool view.  There pizza is awesome and the meatballs are to die for. I always ask the server what to have they are very knowledgeable and are happy to give there honest opinions about the menu and the specials. I can't say enough. It's a must try.
