I had a great experience today at Sole Sports! Ryan was a super great help and was very patient as we tried five different shoes and recorded three stride sessions with different shoes. I found out I have a neutral pronation! In the 12 months I have been running (off and on) I never knew that! He helped me select on the perfect shoes for me based on my stride and comfort. I wish I had visited sooner!!!
