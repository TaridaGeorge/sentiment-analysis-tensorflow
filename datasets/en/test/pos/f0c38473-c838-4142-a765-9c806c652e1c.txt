Awesome pizza!  The first time we came, we only had drinks and dessert.  The baked cookie with ice cream is to DIE for!  Soooo good.  The bartender was very friendly and let us try any beer we wanted before we ordered.  The second time, we came for my birthday and had pizza, which was so flavorful and different than any other pizza joints.  We are big fans of this place and hope it succeeds!
