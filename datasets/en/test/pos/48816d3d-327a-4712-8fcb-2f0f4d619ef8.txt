Dr. Kanarish is an absolutely amazing vet!  He is treating my elderly cats for various conditions. He gives my cats an extremely thorough exam, and he spends a lot of time with me discussing my cats medical issues and answering my questions.  He really takes his time with me and gives me personalized attention.  Also, his rates are very reasonable.

I can tell that Dr. Kanarish loves his job and genuinely cares about pets.  He is extremely friendly and personable, and one of the nicest people that I have ever met.
