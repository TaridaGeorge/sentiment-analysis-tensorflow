Bryan took my latest headshots which I use on my blog and for promotional and speaking engagements. You can see two of the shots here: http://www.stephaniequilao.com/about-stephanie-quilao.html

I was blown away by the pictures, and by far they exceeded my expectations...which doesn't happen often because as a creative person myself I have a high bar of standards. 

Bryan has a really excellent sense of style and connecting with his subject which I think is crucial in bringing out the best qualities in a person when photographing them. He also delivers on time and as expected. I had fun doing this photoshoot!
