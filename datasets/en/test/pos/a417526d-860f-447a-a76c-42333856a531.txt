Postino continues to be a favorite of mine and never ceases to disappoint! While parking can be a huge pain, once I just accept that I will need to valet, the fun can begin. I love to sit on the patio of Postino and enjoy the enclosed outdoor area, sit and munch of delicious food. My go-to panini is the Market. Don't recognize the name? Probably not because it's not actually on the menu but available upon request. It comes with pesto, mozzarella, tomato and I personally add chicken. The best way to enjoy it is as a half sandwich, half salad combo. I could eat those every day.
