I really like Sushi Brokers.  The service is not that great, but the creative rolls are fantastic.  My favorite is the Hawaiian (it has salmon and mango on top with some kind of sweet clear sauce). It really is just another trendy Scottsdale sushi restaurant, but I like their rolls the best.  Proximity was the biggest reason I went to Sushi Brokers and I haven't been back since I moved to Glendale, but I do miss sitting at the bar during happy hour.  You will probably get better service at the bar and it's more fun anyway.  I've never had any traditional sushi there, all I know is that they have some awesome rolls that I have not been able to find anywhere else.
