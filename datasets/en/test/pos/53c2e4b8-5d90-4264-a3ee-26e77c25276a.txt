I can't say anything that hasn't been said already. Love this place. Personal favorites 8th street ale, and all of their IPA's. Chicken strips and nachos are some favorite menu items. Their dinner specials are always unique and are typically very good (even if they are occasionally overpriced for bar food). Best bar in town for hanging out with friends and downing a pint.
