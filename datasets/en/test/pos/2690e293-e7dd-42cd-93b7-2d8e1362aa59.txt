Animal Style? Squeeze me? I've been chowing down In N Out burgers for more than two decades. Yep. When Courtney had a Hole. And Friends was refreshing and not annoying. And Presidents received oral sex in the oval office. Yes, that long! But I didn't know about Animal Style on my double double...extra "special sauce", grilled onions, pickles all fried up in mustard on a flat girl. Um. I mean flat grill. Animal Style? Yep. I would seriously get down on all fours for this baby!
