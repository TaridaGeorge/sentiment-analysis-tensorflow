In my quest to find a Palatte replacement, I ate at Sapna.  Amazing.  Well crafted tasty food in non-american portions. The eggs with the tomato sauce -- the eggs were farm fresh and I could taste the carmelized onions. And the pint of gazpacho brought me back to Seville.  I did think about spiking with some good vodka for a sublime bloody mary.  Fantastic tea, great coffee, charming service, bright beautiful location. Please stay open -- I'll pay for business education classes.
