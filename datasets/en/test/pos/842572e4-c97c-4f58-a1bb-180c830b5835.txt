I've been here twice.  It is fantastic.  The only drawback is the 50-60 minute drive to get here from Central Phoenix, but it is totally worth it.

Friday and Saturday nights have the seafood buffet.  Since I've been on a quest for the best seafood buffet out here in the desert...this one is the winner so far.
