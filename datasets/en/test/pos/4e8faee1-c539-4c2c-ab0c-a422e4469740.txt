I've skimmed through most of the comments here, and a few of them are pretty accurate. If you're looking for a good dive establishment to casually hang out at with plenty of things to keep busy, Hanratty's is the place to go.

The drinks have always been solid, never weak. The selection of beers is great (but give me a Stella, and I'm set). There are pool tables, a small arcade, and friendly service. Everything is affordable, including the bar food (under and around $5) and I wouldn't choose any other bar in the area over this one.
