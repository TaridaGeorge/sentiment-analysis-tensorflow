Green is absolutely delicious. I first ate here a couple of years ago and I still cannot get enough of this place. I love the eggless rolls, I love the greenza, I love the crab puffs, I love the thyme fries and I absolutely adore the tsoynami. I wish there were more restaurants as delicious and as vegan as is this one.
