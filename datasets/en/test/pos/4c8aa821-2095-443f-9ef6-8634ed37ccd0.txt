I am  retired music teacher...I loved the four hours I spend by myself at the museum. Those that really love everything music (and you know who you are) will find this a very enriching experience. The second floor displays and audio examples of the musical sounds of our world are one of the best collections I've experienced in 50 years of listening. The first floor collections and experience rooms are great for interaction. I wish I lived near the museum to volunteer.
