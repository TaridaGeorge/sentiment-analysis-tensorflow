The Almond Danish is to DIE for but get there right when they opened because i showed up a half hour after the original opening time and there was only 1 left and no cheese danishes at all! My husband, my friend and out daughter all got the mini fruit strudels and they all loved them! the almond horn is also super tasty! All in all, i would definitely go back and recommend it to everyone!
