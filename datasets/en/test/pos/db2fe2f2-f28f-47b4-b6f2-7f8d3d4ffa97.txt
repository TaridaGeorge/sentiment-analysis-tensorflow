When I used to live on Thomas rd & 56th st. I used to make the trip up here to this Walmart because its so damn nice! Its clean, well stocked, very large and spacious, open 24 hours, and prices are great. Without sounding sexist or like a male chauvinist, the "People Watching" is pretty special here as well! I'm not too keen on their produce here, but everything else exceeds expectations. Parking can be a mess, there's plenty of spots, but you may have to find a space far from an entrance. Good place to get some exercise in as well because the joint is so huge!
