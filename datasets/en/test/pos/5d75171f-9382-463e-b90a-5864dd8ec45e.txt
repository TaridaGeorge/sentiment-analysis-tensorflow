Took my girlfriend to this right after her ironman and it was fantastic.  Did the sunrise trip and it was spectacular!  I would do it again.  

The guide (Mark) was friendly and professional.  The crew was great too.  The balloon ride was for an hour (which was plenty of time) and they served champagne and breakfast snacks (don't expect a full on breakfast).
