I'd read the reviews, and I'm all for trying the latest hype. This was just as good as the accolades it receives! We went for lunch so we could load up on ice cream, I had a sundae with burnt caramel and brownie swirl topped with dark chocolate. The perfect meal! My husband liked his apple pie and cherry ice creams too, but I forgot to ask for a taste in time, and his was gonee. I appreciated the local ingredients too, everything is made right in their kitchen in small batches. We were visiting central Phoenix and it was worth the drive to north Scottsdale!
