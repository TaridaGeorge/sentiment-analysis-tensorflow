I love this place, they always have good records at good prices. 45's & Cd's too. But their main focus is vinyl. T-shirts too. And tons of dollar records. There's always oddball stuff on the walls & cool music playing that won't send you screaming for the door. They know their stuff & pay really good prices for good records (half of what they sell it for, sometimes more). You'll get a better deal here than anywhere else. Lots of used punk, garage, rhythm n' blues, & classic oldies. Classic rock, jazz, reggae, etc. Cool destination in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale.
