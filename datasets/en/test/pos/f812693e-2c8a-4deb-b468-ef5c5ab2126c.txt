I have only eaten at Cracker Barrel once before, but this was just as I remember it - amazing! I was unclear on what I wanted I guess & the waitress didn't see me point to what I wanted, so there was a mixup. But she promptly fixed my order so I could try the most delicious whole grain oatmal pancakes. Great service, delish food, and they have such a great shop - I wish I could buy everything.
