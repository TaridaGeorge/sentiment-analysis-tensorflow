I had dinner there tonight.  I had the ribs which were absolutely awesome.  It comes dry and the sauce is a ginger base sauce on the side.  The ribs were falling off the bone and very moist.  The fried rice was awesome.  The waitress recommended a petite wine which was perfect.  But I have to comment on the service.  Five stars for service. They are really friendly and seem to enjoy being their and helping all of their guests.  Tonight they had a guy singing and playing a guitar.  Very good and suited the restaurant very well.
