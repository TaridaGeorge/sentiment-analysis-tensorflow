I have never tasted better octopus, lamb, eggplant, pork buns, himachi, snap peas, clams, & sea bass. (We went a little crazy, was so hard to choose!)  They are small bites but the dishes are to die for.  I would be happy eating nothing but their eggplant for the rest of my life.  Great saki selection, tasty cocktails, good atmosphere.  One of the best meals I've ever had.  I would highly recommend it!
