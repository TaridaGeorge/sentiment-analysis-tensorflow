We rolled in tonight at 9pm and everyone in this place greeted me!  They asked if I'd ever been to a Firehouse Subs - I replied NO - and they told me about how they do things differently.  I wasn't in the mood for a sub (I came with friends) so I got a bowl of CHILI.  It was fairly standard but good.  They added some cheese and chopped up some onions and put that in too.  I was very pleased.  And once again let me say - the people were very friendly and welcoming.  I'll be coming back soon.
