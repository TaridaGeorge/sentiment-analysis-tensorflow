As an out-of-towner, I found this place by accident and was completely thrilled with it.  The Americano was as good as those I find at home and the breakfast sandwiches hit the spot.  In a place where Starbucks seems to be on every corner, it was very refreshing to find such a fine indy coffee place.

The free wi-fi was a great bonus.
