What can I say? I've been coming here for the last six years so that should tell you something. Atomic is a great comic shop. They have everything you need as far as your comic needs go, the only thing I would say they lack is in the comic themed clothing but this is a minor problem. The staff is and has always been top notch and very quick to call their other stores to find anything they are out of.
