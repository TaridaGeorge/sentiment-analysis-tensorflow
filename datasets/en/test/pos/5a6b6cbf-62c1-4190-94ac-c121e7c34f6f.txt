No trip of mine to Phoenix is complete without at least one stop to an In-N-Out!

This location is in the Desert Ridge shopping complex and it's close to the JW Marriott Desert Ridge.  Easy to find parking and it's not as busy as the other In-N-Out location that I went to near the airport.

There's not much else to say that hasn't been said... honestly, it's my favorite fast food burger and a place that I seek out when I come to one of the 4 states with an In-N-Out.  Love the quality ingredients, the crisp lettuce and the toasted bun.  Best cheeseburger and fries meal for only $5 :)
