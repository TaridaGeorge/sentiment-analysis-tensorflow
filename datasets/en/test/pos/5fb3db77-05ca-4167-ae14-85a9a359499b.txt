Warmly greeted at the door. We started the evening with hot oshibori. I for one enjoy this, often overlooked, traditional Japanese custom. It was sign that great, no! Astonishing culinary surprises were to transpire. What followed was chef Shinji's gastronomic menu of our dreams, served graciously by Jessica in a posh and Zen like setting. For a moment we had to pinch ourselves, is this Scottsdale? The caliber of every presentation was meticulously prepared in a symphony of taste, texture, appearance, and color. A master of umami, chefs creations will have your taste buds singing in perfect harmony. Entrust and embrace the creations of the chefs menu and enjoy true Japanese fare. Gochissama-deshita
