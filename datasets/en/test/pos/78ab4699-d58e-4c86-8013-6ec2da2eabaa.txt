Alaxandra-'Hey, who wants to join me for my birthday lunch'  Me- 'I'll go'
That response was all it took and now I have 'my sushi spot' 
It is a small restaurant with a lot to offer. Every time I walk in, I feel like I am stepping into a true Japanese restaurant. You get greeted by the 'sushi experts' ;) with a big welcome -spoken in Japanese- which I have yet to ask what exactly they are saying, but they sound happy and that's all that matters.

The freshest seafood, the best specials and the most fantastic miso soup, YUM!
My goal is try almost everything on the menu and so far I am doing pretty good.
