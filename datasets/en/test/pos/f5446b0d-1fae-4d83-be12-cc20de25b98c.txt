Nello's is one of my favorite to go for drinks and appetizers after work. I just went again, tonight, and remembered how much I love it. The setting is nice, the bartender is awesome, the food is good and the wine list is pretty good, too.
My coworkers and I generally head to the Tempe Nello's for happy hour, simply because it's the only place we've found between all of our apartments. But the ambiance there is much more "kid-friendly, chucky-cheese." The Scottsdale Nello's has live jazz and mood lighting.. much cooler.
I like the eggplant bruschetta as an appetizer, as well as the tortellini salad. My three girlfriends and I always split one of each, and the sizes are perfect for four of us...
