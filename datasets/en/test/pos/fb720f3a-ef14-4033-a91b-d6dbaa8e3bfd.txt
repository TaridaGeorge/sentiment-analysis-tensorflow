this is a great place for Sushi and food! Its always fresh and the food is also very tasty! The rolls taste fresh and the pieces are well portioned! they have a great happy hour! Good prices and selection also great drinks.  :) The cook will also come out and greet you. He'll make sure you are satisfied. I also had Ro as my waitress and she is just AWESOME!! I highly recommend this place! Overall VERY SATISFIED!!
