I've lived in the valley for years and struggled to find a salon that could offer me the atmosphere and quality of service I was used to receiving in Chicago. Not only did I want to find a salon free of the typical "gossipy salon" vibe, but I wanted a stylist that would educate me on how to care for my hair - - I found this in Kim, co-owner of the salon.

Apricot Lounge Salon is an intimate salon located in the heart of Old Town that delivers big results. Kim and her co-owner Vanessa literally transform hair. They cut, style, color, do weaves, relaxers, the official Brazilian blowout... everything! 

Consultations are free and I'd highly recommend giving them a call and scheduling one. Stop in and get a feel for the salon and stylists and see what options would work for your hair.
