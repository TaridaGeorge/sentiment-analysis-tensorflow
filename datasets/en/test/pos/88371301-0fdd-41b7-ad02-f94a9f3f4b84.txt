As a California "wine country" girl I am spoiled.  But every time I go to Phoenix I am delighted by the restaurants and the quality of the food products.   Nobuo was just delicious- the small bites were all different and yet complimentary.  I ordered the Assyrtiko wine which is now a must-have in my wine collection- it paired perfectly with the fish and stood up to the more assertive dishes.  The simple things were mastered, I will never look at lettuce the same way again- because a duck salad is not really a salad. Will be back.
