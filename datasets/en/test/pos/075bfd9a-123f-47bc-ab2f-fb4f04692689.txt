Don't make the mistake and think this is a Jamba Juice clone. It is not. It is a local juice shop that has tasty, fresh vegetables and a really nice couple that owns it. I got a 2 oz Wheatgrass that was so tasty I didn't need an OJ chaser. I also ordered a 24 oz juiced veggie drink that was excellent. If you are like me and own a juicer at home, but are too lazy to do the clean up, then this is a place for you.
