Since moving to Phoenix we have been in search of good Thai food.  We have finally found it!  The owner prepares her food in a flavor packed tantalizing of taste buds!  Not sure how else to describe it.  We are regulars here and what first impressed us was the cleanliness of the whole place.  Even the bathrooms were immaculately cared for.  Now the food just keeps us coming back for more.  The owner is so nice too.  She remembered us after our first visit and always visits and likes to know what you think of her food.  I especially love the coconut soup.  It's a must try even if you just try a cup of it.  It's packed with flavor so a cup might just be enough for you.
