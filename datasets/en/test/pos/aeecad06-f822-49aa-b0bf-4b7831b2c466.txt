My new favorite Happy Hour spot! I've only been here for hh and brunch - both of which were excellent. I have been here for happy hour at least 5 times now (and brunch just once on Kentucky Derby day). The service is always great (ok, a somewhat slow waitress or two, but the drinks generally come fast so you have something to widdle the time away). The food is delicious and the price is right! I recommend the gaucamole, the sliders (esp the chicken) and the wings, I asked for mine extra hot & they delivered! Oh and they have a very good beer selection - lots of local brews.
