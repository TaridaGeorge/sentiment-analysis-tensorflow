I used to drive super far to take little Rex here...and then I discovered their Mesa location.

This location is the newest one they had at the time...and it showed. It was all gorgeous and shiny - very pretty.

From the front desk staff to the doctors, we received nothing but the best treatment, not only in customer service but also in how they interacted with Rex.

I can't say enough positive things about the Family Vetcare clinics.
