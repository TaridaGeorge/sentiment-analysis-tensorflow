I can't believe I have not reviewed this place.  I live just a mile away from this place and I stop there on the way home from work quite often.  The service is great, the food is delicious and when I order to go it is fast and the order is always correct.  I have never had Vietnamese food from any other place so I don't really have anything to compare it to, but I have loved everything I got from here,  even the tripe in my Pho!
