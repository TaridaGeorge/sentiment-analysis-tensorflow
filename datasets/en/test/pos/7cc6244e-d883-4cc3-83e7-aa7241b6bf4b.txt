I took my fiance to The Keg. I have to say that it exceeded all my expectations. The service was great, they treated us like we were people instead of a number. The environment was amazing, the lighting, music choice, and seating is what made it that way. Now the food, of course, was amazing. I had the 'Keg Sized' Prime Rib and it was delicious. The garlic mashed potatoes tasted superb as well. My fiance and I had a few Martinis as well. She had the Chocolate Martini and Kiwi Martini which she enjoyed. I had the Water Martini which was fabulous. Overall this place is a great experience. It's casual and intimate at the same time. The cost is about the same you'd spend at a Claim Jumper or any other Steakhouse. I highly recommend The Keg, I know I'll be going back for sure.
