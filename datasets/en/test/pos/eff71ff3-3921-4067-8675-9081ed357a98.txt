My 91 year old aunt has been seeing doctor Haas for years, and this doctor has cared for her with compassion, wisdom (seems she knows when to watch and wait with informed decisions and when to move to more assertive treatment, getting my aunt through some tough times that other doctors were less patient with). I also really appreciate her knowledge and conservative approach to bio identical hormones, taking into account individual nuances and dosing (this from a conversation I had with her when taking my aunt in for an appt.)
