came here in an attempt to get some work done. its a super cute and comfy place. everyone is really friendly. i love that there is a power strip that runs along the floor so you don't have to worry about finding a spot to plug in your laptop. free wifi is always a plus. the iced chai was really good too. i love this place! =)
