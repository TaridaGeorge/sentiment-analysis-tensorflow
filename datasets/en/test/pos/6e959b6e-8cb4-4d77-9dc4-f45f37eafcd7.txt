I recently moved here from Maui, HI back to Scottsdale and thought I was SOL when it came to workouts.  Giving up my daily surf and paddle surf and moving to the desert was a worry to me.  I did not know what to do to stay in shape and continue my healthy living routine.  After hearing many people rave about this trendy whole body transformation workout I just had to see for myself.  My good friend, longtime student there took me to my first class and I was instantaneously hooked!  It totally filled my void of my ocean workouts.  The instructors are personal and genuinely good people.  I am still hooked and living a healthy lifestyle thanks this fantastic business and its employees.
