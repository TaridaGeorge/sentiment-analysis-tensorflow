Going to Tuesday Morning is like going on a treasure hunt.  

When ever I need towels this is the 1st place I look. They have so many different towels to choose from, I like the nice fluffy ones.  As for bedding again Tuesday Morning has a wide selection of high end bedding.  I mean 800 count Egyptian cotton that feels like silk!

I enjoy going through their home decorating section to find treasures to hang on my wall. And in the garden section I have found some nice statues to but in my garden.

I just love Tuesday Morning and I try to visit at least once a month because you never know what treasure you will find.
