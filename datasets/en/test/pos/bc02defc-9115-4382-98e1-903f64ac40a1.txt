These people are insane to close their Tempe location.  It was always packed.

As good food is nearly impossible to find in the Phoenix metro area, I command you to go here and have some shawarma and hummus immediately.

I was usually taken here by sociopaths from work, but the food was still able to outshine their mental disorders and leave me impressed.
