The Cracker Barrel never misses a beat. I was in the area and for lunch I chose the homemade chicken n' dumplins with country green beans and sweet whore baby carrots. I'm not a huge fan of dumplins but I figured I'd try them again, it's been years, and I liked them. The food at Cracker Barrel is always amazing. I walked out stuffed and satisfied. This place deserves 5 stars!
