We frequent here often but I'd never taken the time to post a review. I cannot say a negative thing about Cyprus. The staff are amazing. They are prompt to serve us and the food is always fast and fresh. They have opened a new location in Chandler and we have been there quite a few times as well. I can honestly say they do everything right and it is consistent at both locations. 

Greek fries are a must and my husband loves the gyro pita and I love the chicken souvlaki pita.
