As good as it gets is right. I did not expect to find such a wonderful little place in PHX. This is a place you'd expect to find in SF...
Great food, wonderful staff and a charming atmosphere.
I highly recommend it for lunch or dinner.

Our party went there for lunch and we had a combination of salads and sandwhiches but I made sure to see what else came out of the kitchen. Out food was very good, well seasoned, perfectly cooked and the "observed" food looked great, too.
As European, I have to say, tres bon!
I'd go back every chance I get.
