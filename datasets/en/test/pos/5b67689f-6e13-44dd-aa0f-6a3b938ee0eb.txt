Postinos is 'that place' that I just adore. No matter the occasion or time of day, I have never been let down.

I first went to Postinos on a date, and it was incredible. (I'm referring to both the guy & the food!)

The wine list is incredible - and there are almost always specials going on so you can try something new without breaking the bank. The food is delicious - I always suggest anyone try the bruchetta planks, and any of their salads are a delicious choice. I love both the Arcadia and Central locations the same; Arcadia seems to be where I frequent the most just due to proximity of our home. If you haven't been, just try it! Great food, great drinks, great staff, and friendly customers.
