The sandwiches are surprisingly different & very good. Liberty Market uses fresh, high quality ingredients. Liberty Market is similar to (and reminds me of) many of the unique & exceptional restaurants in the Arcadia & Biltmore areas. I've passed through downtown Gilbert many times & barely realized how many excellent restaurants are present there.
