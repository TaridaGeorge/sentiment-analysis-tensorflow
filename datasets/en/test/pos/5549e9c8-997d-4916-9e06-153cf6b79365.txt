had a fantastic/delicious experience at zinc. i went with a friend for lunch, we were seated promptly and our charming and downright adorable server, aubrey, was helpful and wonderful. she made great wine pairing suggestions and made the experience delightful.

as a non-meat eater, i had to be choosy, but the kitchen seemed accommodating and everything was divine. down to the last bite of two mouth-watering desserts.
