Georgie S likes Mojo. That's because Georgie S is an elitist East Coast snob.

Yogurtland is where it's at. Flavors as far as the eye can see. A sea of tangy, tarty goodness. Like the first day of fall semester at ASU when all the women wear tank tops and short shorts. 

Twice as good as Mojo and half the price. Math is not my strongest subject but ratios and charts would undoubtedly point to Yogurtland's radness and Mojo's unremarkability. Ordinariness.
