Bobby is back!  A different name but the same outstanding food!  The service and food is the best.  When you walk in you get the aroma of fresh garlic & Italian Food cooking and a huge greeting from Bobby!    I just don't know what to order when I'm there because everything is so delicious.  The chicken parm is one of my all time favorites.  Love the pasta & salads too!  Love, love, love this place!!!!!  PS try the garlic knots.
