Last chance is totally hit or miss! There are times when I will find everything I need and more (like my most recent trip a fewdays ago) and then other times I will leave empty handed and completely unsatisfied! I think the key is to go here once every few months! I love last chance for the quality clothes and accessories on the cheap!
