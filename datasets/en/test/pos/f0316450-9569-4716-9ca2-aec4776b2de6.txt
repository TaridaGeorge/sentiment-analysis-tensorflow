Green is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix! Hands down!  I am in love with their "crab" puffs, the kung-pao noodles with "chicken", thee green salad, and they always have great specials.  Oh yeah, and they now have Daiya "cheese", which is the BEST vegan cheese around.  I can't say enough good things about this place.. If you are vegan it is a definite must.  If you would like to try some awesome vegan homestyle cooking, Green is a great place for you too.
