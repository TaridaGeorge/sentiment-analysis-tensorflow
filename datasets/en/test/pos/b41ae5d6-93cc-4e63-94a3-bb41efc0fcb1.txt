Incredible breakfast sandwiches, decent prices.

Not a very big place but I never want to sit down anyway, it's a great place to stop before work, or in the morning after a binger.  They use boar's head meat and have tons of selections. Everyone that has helped me has always been really nice. 

I'm pretty upset that I moved away from this place but just typing it makes me crave a ham egg and cheese bagel. YUM!
