Who doesn't love LEGOs? Tell me and I'll make sure they do; just playing :P.
I love Legos and to be in a store filled with expensive Legos makes me feel like a little kid in Disneyland. If I was rich, I would buy this store in a heartbeat and build everything and anything I want. 

The workers are so nice -- the first time we got Legos here, one of the cashier gave us this little lego piece for free and that was pretty awesome (well we got about $1 - 200 worth of legos so one little piece isn't a steal, lol). 

Best place ever if you love Legos!! :)
