I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!  The food is amazing and they also will do requests!  My friend lived in Thailand for quite some time and fell in love with a certain dish they didn't have on the menu, but they made it for her anyway!  They are always very nice and considerate, even though they are always swamped!
The restaurant itself is TINY so I always just order for pick up, but you HAVE to try the Thai Tea - it's awesome.  I'm slowly working my way through the entire menu and haven't been disappointed with anything yet!  
Also, I have some family members that are incredibly psychotic about the cleanliness of restaurants - and this place passes muster!  They are clean and tidy!
