Casey's is always one of our stops when out drinking on Mill. Love the bar staff, most of them have been there for years.

A great place to day drink (when the weathers nice of course).

If youve only ever drank at Casey's, you NEED to come back for lunch/dinner one day. Their food is stellar. 

Faves include: Hippie sandwich (I love that they use pesto as mayo), Potato salad, Fried Zucchini, Chipotle hummus, Reuben, Classic club, Croissant sandwich, and finally their New England clam chowder.
