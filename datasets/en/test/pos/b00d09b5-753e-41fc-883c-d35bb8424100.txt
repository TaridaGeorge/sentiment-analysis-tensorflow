This is a one stop shop for cake decorating and candy making supplies. This place reminds me of Home Depot.  There are many "shiny" things that can get you totally distracted from what you were going there for, but the staff is knowledgeable and helps make sure you get everything you need to complete your project.  There is no other place like it in the Phoenix area.  The product selection is more than triple that of any Michael's store and here the staff can actually give you recommendations rather than just directing you to the right aisle.  If you're a lover of cake decorating like I am, you will love this store!
