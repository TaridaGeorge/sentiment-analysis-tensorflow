Holy cow is this some yummy BBQ. Hubby went on opening day and stood around in the AZ sun, just to get some grub. He's been talking abt it ever since. We went today as a family and he was NOT kidding! 

The ribs, the pulled pork, the pudding...HEAVENLY. There are no plates and everything is served on a plastic tray with butcher wax paper. So don't come here expecting to not get messy. Bring your wet naps, grab some napkins or wash up at their wash station...if you don't like messy, don't come here. They also have a mini bar with condiments, a large assortment drinks (including beer) and plenty of seating indoor and out.
 
We've found our new BBQ place! Can't wait to try the rest of the things on the menu! Yummy yummy in my tummy!
