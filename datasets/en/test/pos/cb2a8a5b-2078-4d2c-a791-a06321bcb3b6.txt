I had Kristin come in to treat my husband to a massage for his birthday and got a massage as well.  We were both very relaxed and felt great after the stressful week we had.  She came to us on a Saturday, which made it extremely convenient.  My husband even suggested getting chair massages for the staff at work for Christmas!  She is excellent and I highly recommend her!

Thanks Kristin!
