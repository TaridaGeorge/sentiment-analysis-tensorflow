I am limited as to what I have tried from here. I have had both the sugar free and regular iced chais and a large number of their iced teas. All of the drinks I have had we're fantastic and anytime I am in tempe marketplace it's a must stop for one of the above drinks. 

Food wise I haven't really tried anything so cannot comment on the quality or flavor.

Atmosphere is fun. Inside is fine but the real good seats are out front near the fountain which makes for good people watching while finishing your drinks!
