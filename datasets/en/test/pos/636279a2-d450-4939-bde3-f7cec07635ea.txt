YUM! YUM! YUM! YUM! YUM!  THE  BEST VEGETARIAN RESTAURANT OPTIONS AROUND!!!!  You wont find the typical veggie burger or portabella sandwich here.  The veggie sandwich with the guac on the side...superb!  The veg sushi rolls are unlike any other in the valley.  The roasted corn pizza is AMAZING!  You will also have to try the sonoma salad with beets, dates, and goat cheese!  This little family of restaurants offer the best veg options in the valley.  

Anytime I have a friend visiting from out of town this is the first place I take them for lunch or brunch.  On other occasions, my friends and I come here on our bikes to share great food and a bottle (or two) of prosecco on the patio.  Such a wonderful place to spend a lazy Sunday with good people.
