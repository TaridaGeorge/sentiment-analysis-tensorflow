When I finally made it out to try this place I was not disappointed. The restaurant had a great vibe and atmosphere and the servers were very friendly and knowledgeable. They specialize in cooking the freshest produce, fish, and meat on a robata grill. I had blackened cod, and it was absolutely incredible. Their sushi is fantastic and so are their mixed drinks. I'll definitely be going back.
