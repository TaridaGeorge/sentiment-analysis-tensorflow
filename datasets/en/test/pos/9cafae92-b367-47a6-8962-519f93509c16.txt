My reviews are pretty much good and some of the places I don't care for ; never really in between , so I apologize .  Bobby Q is AWESOME! My husband and I drive by when going to the airport and its always strikes curiosity .  My husband picked me up from the airport and we decided to give it ago.  The restaurant was much nicer than expected and cool atmosphere actually.  My husband had the bobby q burger which was yummy and the beer battered fries ...delish. I ordered brisket and baby back ribs with the intention to have leftovers, The brisket was perfectly cooked , so moist and flavorful. The Ribs ; perfect Smokey flavor and fork friendly.  If you ever questioned on whether you should check it out or not...JUST DO IT !
