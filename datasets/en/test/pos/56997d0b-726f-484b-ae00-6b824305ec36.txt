I've had headaches for years and tried many different treatments for them with little relief, until I saw Dr. Jordan. This is my first experience with a chiropractor, and though I felt a lot of anxiety going into the appointment, Dr. Jordan took his time to diagnose and explain everything to me, which eased my mind and my anxiety. Not only is it great to have relief from my headaches, but it's refreshing to meet a doctor who actually takes the time to understand your medical history and who genuinely cares about his patients. I'd definitely recommend him to my family and friends!
