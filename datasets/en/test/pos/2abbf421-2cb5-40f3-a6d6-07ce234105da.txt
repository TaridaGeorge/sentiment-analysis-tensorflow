My friend suggested that I go see Dr. Frank for the issues I was having in my neck and upper back. I was having sporadic numbness and pins and needles (which was really freaking me out) and they were getting more frequent even after going to physical therapy for 6-7 months. He was able to look at my MRI results and came up with a treatment plan.  I ended up quitting PT and with Dr. Frank's help- the numbness and pins and needles became less and less frequent. It took about 4 months but now the numbness was gone!! I haven't had any symptoms in months and I am so thankful that I went to see Dr. Frank.  He is the best!!!
