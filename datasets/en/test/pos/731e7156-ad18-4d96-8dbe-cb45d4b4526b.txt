The 5-Star rating is a combo good food+cool place - wish Tempe could support more unique restaurants like this one!  

Had both the Oxtail (excellent) and the Jerk Chicken (really good) - the plantains are a special treat (could hear them sizzling in the kitchen).  I'm into heat - but don't expect (or be concerned by) a lot out of their jerk sauce - it's a Guyana jerk style which is considerably milder than Jamaican version.
