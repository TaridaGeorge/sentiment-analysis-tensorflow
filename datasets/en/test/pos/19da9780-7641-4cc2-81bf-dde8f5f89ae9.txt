Why doesn't every single frozen yogurt place operate this way?  You do it yourself!  Genius.  Want only a little bit of one flavor and a lot of another?  A little bit of tart, a lotta cake batter for me.  Craving some toppings layered in between the yogurt instead of just on top?  Strawberries on the bottom, granola on the top is perfection!  Not really all that hungry and just want a little tiny bit?  Actually, this has never happened to me.  

Consider all of your frozen yogurt problems solved at Yogurberry.  Do it yourself, pay by the ounce, done and done.  Everyone walks away happy.
