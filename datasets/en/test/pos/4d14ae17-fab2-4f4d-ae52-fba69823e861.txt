I met the Chef and owner Esther and she is such a delight and her food is simply scrumptious. I started with a Ginger Mint Juice this was worth every penny it was fresh and had a nice spicy bite from the Ginger but the orange and pineapple juice mellowed it out, and for my app I had the pepper soup yum is all I can say next I had the Whole Yassa Tilapia (they also serve it in as two fillets) and it was everything I had hoped it would be. I have been missing this dish i the Valley since I relocated from Chicago. I left here full and happy and I cannot wait to return. Thank you Esther for opening up Fu Fu Cuisine the Valley needed your delicious African/Caribbean  food.
