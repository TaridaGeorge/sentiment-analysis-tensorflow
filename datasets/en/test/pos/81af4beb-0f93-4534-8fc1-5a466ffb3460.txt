Today was the second time I ate at the Herb Box.  Both times, I biked there from my house (about 7 miles).  The ride is completely worth it. 
The restaurant is nestled in the sleepy Market Street shopping center near DC Ranch. They have a great patio with large umbrellas and power misters.  

Everything we have tried on the menu is best in its class.  Today we had red velvet pancakes.  They were amazing and came with yummy bacon.  We also had the pork and egg chilaquiles.  SOOO GOOD. 

This restaurant is reasonably priced.  I plan on going there every Sunday that i have available.  Bravo!
