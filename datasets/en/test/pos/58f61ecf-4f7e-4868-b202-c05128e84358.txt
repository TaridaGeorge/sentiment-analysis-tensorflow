I JUST LOVE THIS PLACE! It smells incredibly GREAT!  It's the only organic hotel I know here and I feel healthy being in it. The colors are beautiful and zen-ful. It is so cool that this hotel embraces all the elements... Earth, water, wind and fire. Being the Chief Pet Pamperer of Arizona I give it a huge thumbs up for bringing your pet there. Their chef is AMAZING and he cooks special meals for your dog or cat. The people food is out of this world wonderful too!  

This place is a hidden gem and a must go to!
