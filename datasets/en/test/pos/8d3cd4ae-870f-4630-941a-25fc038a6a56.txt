Five Stars. Why? Because it's damn near impossible to get a decent espresso pull in Tempe, and this place does it. Plus, it's close to my house (in Phoenix terms, at least) and to me, that counts for a lot.

Did I mention that the owners are really, really, really, really nice? Really. Nice. And they care about their coffee in a way I haven't seen since I left Oregon (shout out to Stumptown in PDX and Full City in the Euge).

The coffee is freshly roasted -- from Cafe Cortez here in town -- and the atmosphere makes you forget you're in a strip mall (not a bad strip mall, but still).

Please, please, please go here. Give them your money. They deserve it, and you'll be a better person for it. Promise.
