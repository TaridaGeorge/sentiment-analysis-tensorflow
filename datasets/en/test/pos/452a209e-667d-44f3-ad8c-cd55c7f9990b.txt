I originally reviewed this restaurant when it was under old ownership. I have been a couple of times since the new owners took over, and it gets better each time. They ask for input when you get your bill, and the menu has changed a bit since my  first visit under new ownership. 

The selections are great. I love the different wine flight options they have. I have only had a few things on the menu, but the bruchetta was amazing! They have updated the seating area and added a patio. The live music is always awesome, and really helps create a relaxing environment. The servers are really friendly and knowledgeable. 

A few people mentioned high prices,  but I think it's on par with all the other wine bars I have visited. Plus, the food is better than most and the service is great. Love it!
