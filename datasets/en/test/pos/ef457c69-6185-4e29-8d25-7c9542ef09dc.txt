Extremely impressive movie theatre! I was in Awwwe over the views from this AMC theatre. The Arizona surrounding mountains are breathtaking! The theatre itself is pretty special. It was my first experience at a movie theatre that has a full on menu of food, alcoholic beverages and many other items that you can order from your seat. The AMC staff was great. I appreciated their service. The seats are leather, each seat has it's own pull out table and service call-light.
