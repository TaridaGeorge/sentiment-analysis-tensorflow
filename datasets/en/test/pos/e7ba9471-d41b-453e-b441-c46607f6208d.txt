If you don't mind traveling waaaaay north (unless you already live up that way) El Pedgregal is a fantastic upscale shopping complex.  They have tons of great restaurants and shops, but they're also always having festivals, concerts, art walks and all sorts of other special events for visitors.  

They had a salsa challenge here with free margs and chips and salsa for Cinco.  And they seem to always be having wine tastings too.  

They have a stage for concerts, and the entire complex was designed with a Moroccan flare.
