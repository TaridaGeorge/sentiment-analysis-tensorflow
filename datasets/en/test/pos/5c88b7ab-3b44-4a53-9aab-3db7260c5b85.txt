This is a great local spot. If you're visiting you might miss it because it's a few blocks away from the main bar strip on Mill Ave - but it's worth the trip. It's a brewery and their Kilt Lifter beer is one of my favs. They also have a great brunch - mimosas come with a full serving of veggies mixed in. Love it.
