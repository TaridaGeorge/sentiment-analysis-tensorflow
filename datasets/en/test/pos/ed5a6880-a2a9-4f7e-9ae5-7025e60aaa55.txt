Expectations were low upon walking in. Having reviewed the menu prior to arriving, we were intrigued but not throughly impressed. Our opinion was totally turned around!!! Started with sangria and blackberry mojito. Both tasty. Moved onto the Sun Salutation....holy mosses..awesome! Cayenne/sugar rim made the drink. Avocado Love was a nice light appetizer. Totally recommend the short rib taco, the Kobe burger, as well as the Thai ribs. Don't sleep on the smoked Gouda Mac n  cheese.  We will be back for sure!!
