THE HOLY GRAIL HAS BEEN FOUND. High end Asian buffet, Sushi that is ALL YOU CAN EAT, AND MADE TO ORDER!!! YES, that's RIGHT! FRESH MADE! You go up to the dude at the sushi bar, and pick whatever you want off of the menu, and he makes it! YES! wow! Also, the food end of the buffet is top notch! MOUNDS OF TEMPURA. So thankful for finding the great reviews here on yelp!  Prices aren't too bad either - 15.99 on Friday or Saturday night, a bit cheaper during the week, and under $10 for lunch. ALSO if you mention yelp, you get $5.00 off the bill for 3 or more!!! Service was impeccable! Very clean, nicely laid out, etc.. I CANNOT WAIT TO RETURN.
