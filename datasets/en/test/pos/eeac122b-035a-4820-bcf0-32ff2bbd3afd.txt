This place is amazing and I'm going back this coming weekend.
They are known for their delicious wings and I have to admit, they are the best wings I've ever had!  The staff was extremely nice and the service was fast which was surprising considering how packed they were.  I only wish there was a location closer to my house!  People of Teakwoods, if you're reading this, please bring a location to East Mesa!!  ;)
