Awesome - love breakfast and this place is great. Love their Apple Pancake, but usually I order omelettes or just regular pancakes. They're omelettes are very fluffy and generous, and come with great sides. Pancakes are super fluffy too. I also really like the atmosphere, it's just a very homey, breakfast place - comfortable, not over done but not a hole in the wall either. It's always packed, so expect a wait for a table.
