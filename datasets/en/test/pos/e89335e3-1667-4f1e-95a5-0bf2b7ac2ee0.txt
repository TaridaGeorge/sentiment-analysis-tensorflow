I love trader joes. This one is prob my favorite location! People are friendly and ask if you need help where as others i find everyone's too stuck up to even look up from stocking and if you ask for help its a huggge hassle for them! So i like this one, and I like how large it is! Thanks Tempe T Joes for being so awesome!
