The employees here are fantastic! They're always friendly and sweet to me and every time I come in we throw a joke or two at each other. 
They always remember what I want and have it ready for me inside when they see me pulling into the parking lot. That is excellent customer service. I used to live in Coronado and would come in here almost daily. I was so bummed to move out of the neighborhood almost solely because Sunshine Market would no longer be pretty much across the street from me. I still make the drive once a week over here to pick up and few things because their customer service is so good and they have AMAZING deals on beer. I dare you to find a bodega in town with cheaper beer then they have. I DARE YOU!
