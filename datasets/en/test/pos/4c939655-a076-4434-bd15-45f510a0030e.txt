Shaun makes the best chai! :) quiet out of the way and quaint. Beautiful setting, great atmosphere! Worth the price, cheaper than Starbucks and tastes better!

I was really impressed with everything the cookies are delicious, the staff are friendly. The store is very long but the decorator did a great job making you feel comfortable here. There are chairs and booths, the espresso bar is actually a bar. lol :) The atmosphere is just great, I cannot stress this enough! Its spacious and delicious.

Check it out!
