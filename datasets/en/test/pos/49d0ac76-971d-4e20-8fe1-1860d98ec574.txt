The CS guys rock!. Table for 10 and only 1hr waiting!! We went without reservations, just to try and EUREKA! we made it. It was worth to try it and taste all the good flavors of their pizzas. We shared Rosa (by far my favorite), Sonny boy and ...name is gone. All tasty and well done. Pizza is not very large, so if you are looking the thick dough and greasy pizza for 1 dollar, forget it. 

A one time event, as I don't think I would wait again so much for this pizza...after all, good things are best kept in your mind :)
