Talk about finding good ways to save paper and save money on your wedding invitation.  I knew I wanted something different "Golf related" for the save the date and a non traditional wedding invitation that has multiple papers/envelopes.  And you know how hard it is to find non cheesy golf invitation.  

Jenny was able to help me custom design the way I wanted.  My husband and I were super happy when we saw it and got a lot of compliments.  The best part was that the last page of my invitation was a tear off RSVP post card to be mailed back.  How come no one had thought of that??  

Thanks Jenny and the Eeko staff.. you guys are the best.
