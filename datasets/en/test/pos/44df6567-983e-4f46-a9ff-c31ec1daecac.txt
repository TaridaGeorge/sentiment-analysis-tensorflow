Been here a few times. Every time, awesome service! Small place, but that's ok. I like the feel.  Brought my parents here whom were visiting from out of state, they loved the staff and food. I left my phone there that night. They called my husband to tell him and I picked it up the next day. So glad I got that back! Not many bar/restaurants where you would get your phone back. Also I highly recomment the fried pablano pepper things, or are they chili's.... I don't know. But they are good! They are my fave! Try them!
