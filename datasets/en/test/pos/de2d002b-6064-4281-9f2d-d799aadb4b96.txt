I went last weekend and loved it.  The dishes are small and are meant to be shared, but not so small that you feel like you barely ate anything.  The food was presented quite nicely as well;  the only dish I wasn't so big a fan of was the papaya mango salad.  The wasabi soy chicken and soup gyoza were terrific.  They also had spicy shrimp as their dinner special, which was outstanding (but stay away if you can' t handle spices).

I would say that, given the lighting and decor, the ambiance is great during dinner (when I went), but probably nothing special during lunch.
