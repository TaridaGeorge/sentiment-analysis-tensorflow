The colorful, quirky building seems out of place in a quiet city like Mesa. Located off of First Avenue and Country Club, the arts center is a fun place to see a mellow and intimate show. Mesa-turned-national act Jimmy Eat World recently performed to a sold-out crowd in the arts center and Valley medium Allison DuBois (from NBC's "Medium") packed them in last year when she hosted a book discussion and signing. The arts center has a lot of potential. They just need to bring in bigger people and bands to garner some attention.
