This resturant is great. The sushi good and the prices are cheap. I'll leave here completely stuffed and the bill will be like $20 for two people without drinks, with drinks its about $30 - $40 depending on how many saki bombers you have again thats for two people. the plates range from $1 to $3. If its close to closing you have to order your sushi but it is still the same price as if it was on the conveyor belt.
