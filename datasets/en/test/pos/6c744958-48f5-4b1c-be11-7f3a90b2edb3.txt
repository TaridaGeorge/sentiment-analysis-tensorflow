Always a marvelous experience. The patio area is simply lovely if the weather is permitting. The menus are always excellent and they have an excellent staff. The cheese plate is always great to start and the servers will help you pick a good selection of cheeses and suggest very good wines. The food is always very good and also unique -- rabbit is one of my favourite proteins they prepare here. I have been there for Valentine's Day and also for our wedding anniversary and the always make the evening special. It is pricey but worth every penny you pay.
