Have you had a bad day?  I did, so I went to Yogurtini and it put a little ray of sunshine in my cloudy day.  Nothing like soft serve with yummy toppings to put a smile on your face.  I particularly love this joint (compared to others) because they have mini dark chocolate raspberry truffles for a topping! :)
