It seems there is always a crowd outside Angel Sweet. This is because 1) the shop is too small, and 2) the gelato is amazing! Housed in a strip mall on the North East corner of Chandler and Dobson, there is often standing room only at Angel Sweet. Although it might be nice to sit while enjoying my tasty treat, it wouldn't make this gelato any better. 

Angel Sweet says their most popular flavors are watermelon, panna cotta, chocolate brownie, cookies and cream, and pistachio. Mine are MCC (Milk Chocolate Caramel) and ditto on the pistachio. The texture is smooth and creamy, just like gelato should be, and the taste is authentic and not too sweet. Although Angel Sweet is locally owned, the gelato mixes come straight from Milan and are blended fresh daily. 

If you are even remotely in the area, give Angel Sweet a try!
