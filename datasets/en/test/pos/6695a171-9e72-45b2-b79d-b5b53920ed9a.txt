Love this Fry's!  great prices, super friendly service, and always clean and organized.  I also (like a previous reviewer) had a hard time adjusting when they reorganized the store, but I am okay now  :)   I almost exclusively grocery shop at Fry's locations, and happen to live down the street from this one.  If I ever moved to a different neighborhood, I'd probably still drive over to this Fry's location.
