First of all, this place is awesome.  The ambiance is clear and special - open and inviting.  The menu is full of tantalizing and tempting meals, simple and just enough food to fill the belly and leave a smile on my face.

I had the caprese sandwich and hummus.  The sandwich was layered and full, but not overwhelming.  There was just enough balsamic to tease my palate and make me want more!

I hope to return on a day that I can lounge a bit over coffee and dessert rather than hurry a bit through lunch.  I cannot wait to tackle one of the mouthwatering red velvet cake slices...
