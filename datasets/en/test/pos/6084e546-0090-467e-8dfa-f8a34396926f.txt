A friend told us of this restaurant, so we drove 40 minutes south to Scottsdale (worth every minute). This is authentic Italian, homemade pasta ravioli to die for! I had the pork chop, delightful! We have been back once and have scheduled to go again with 3 friends, who have never been. All within 10 days!! It is worth the drive no matter how far!!
