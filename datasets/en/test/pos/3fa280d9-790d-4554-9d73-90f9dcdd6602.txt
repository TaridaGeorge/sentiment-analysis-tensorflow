If you're looking for a comfy place for a juicy burger and amazing fries...Here it is!

So lucky to have come across this place. The atmosphere is just perfect, tv's with sports on all the time, full far, and salad bar for you to customize your burger to your liking. 

I usually get the #4 which is the small one with some fries. Don't be fooled by the name "small one" their burgers are a pretty good size and when you add all your toppings from the salad bar, it gets even BIGGER! I have seen the bigger burgers, and boy are those huge! You are able to choose the kind of cheese and bun that you want, and that's always good. 

Heard the jalapeno poppers are good and their mushroom topping is too!
