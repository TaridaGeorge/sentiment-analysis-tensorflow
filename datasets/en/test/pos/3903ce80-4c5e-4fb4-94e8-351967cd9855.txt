This place in the Chinese Cultural Center has a very pretty and elegant bar area. I was pleased to learn that they had some very reasonable and delicious happy hour snacks. This is a good place for a Pina Colada. I had one by myself along with some dumplings and fried shrimp appetizer. Sadly I never brought anyone else here with me. It was happy hour heaven but you know? A lot of my friends in AZ pretty much hang out in one neighborhood or another and nobody I know really lives close to the Buddha.
The airport is pretty close by. This might be a good pre-flight send-off location.
