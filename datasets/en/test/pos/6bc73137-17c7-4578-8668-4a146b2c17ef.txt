i like it, i like it a lot! (you must say it like Jim Carrey in Dumb and Dumber.)

We stopped in last night for dinner and cocktails.  I left quite satisfied with the experience.

The atmosphere, service, pricing, and food were all top notch.  

I really LOVED the grilled artichoke...you must try this.

I am excited to check out the new facility that will be opening late this year.  It is right down the street (in the spot that Chevy's was located.)

Check it out..
