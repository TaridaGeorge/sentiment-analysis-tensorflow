This is a five star for me.  I am an artist that has participated since day one.  I have watched this artist showing grow from the beginning.  It is great for several reasons...the artists are new and innovsative, the bands all along the walk give it a great groove, the people that run it really do care.  I wouldn't miss it either as an artist or attendee.  You will find something special that makes great for you too.
