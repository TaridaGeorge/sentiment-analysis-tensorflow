I was pleasantly surprised with the food and service at Chart House.  As frequent dinners at Mastro's Ocean Club, the bar was quite high.  The view was rather scenic while overlooking a lake and accompanied with a sunset of Camelback Mountains. It was a great venue to hold my granddaughters graduation dinner.  Our Server Kim was attentive, friendly and aided to the experience.  I had ordered Prime Rib, which came with garlic mash potatoes. It was slightly over cooked but the garlic mash potatoes were delicious.  For desert we had ordered a few deserts but the Hot Chocolate Lava cake is a chocolate lovers dream with the Cherry Apple Crisp next. I enjoyed spending this special occasion with my husband, children and grandchildren and will be back!
