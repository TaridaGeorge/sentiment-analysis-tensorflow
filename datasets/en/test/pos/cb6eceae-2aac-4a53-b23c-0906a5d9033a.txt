No brown sauce out of a can here--as found in too many Asian restaurants.  Homemade meals with sauces that taste like they are made from the juices of the ingredients. I've had the Pho w/shrimp(the stock is delicious), the Curry Seafood w/rice, the Crispy Eggrolls and the Mango Chicken. Thumbs way up for all four. The Spring rolls are good but have too much lettuce.   Best Asian food in Phoenix for the price.
