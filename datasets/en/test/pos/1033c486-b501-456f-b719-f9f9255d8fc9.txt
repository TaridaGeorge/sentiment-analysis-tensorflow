Really nice set up. Great coffee, great service, understated and interesting layout. Almost a conservative industrial interior decoration with artistic and contemporary sensibilities. Interesting choice of art displays that reflect the feeling of the overall scene. All the staff I have encountered are very friendly with genuine personalities. I look forward to making at least one trip back before my conference ends, and will surely be back again next time I am in Phoenix.
