There really arn't any other teriyaki places around that can compete with Yogis plus the food is pretty dang good. Hence the 5 stars. My favorite thing to get is the regular Arizona bowl. It has crabmeat, cucumber, avocado, teriyaki sauce, and rice so its pretty light but filling. Ive also tried their chicken teriyaki (large) and it was good but the large is fricken HUGE! Their yakisoba is pretty good and so are their pork gyoza. Though I have never tried it, I have heard that the spicy teriyaki sauce is great. I like the fact that when you eat there, you can get as much teriyaki sauce from the dispenser as you want. The prices are not bad for the amount of food you get.
