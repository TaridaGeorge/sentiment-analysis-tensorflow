Seriously AMAZING! I hate to work something up, only to have your expectations come crashing down but this is THE best pizza I've ever had, hands down (and yes, even better than Bianco's)! The service was awesome even on an extremely busy night, the prices were reasonable and the location may be small but has so much charm to wow you off your feet. I can't wait to come back!
