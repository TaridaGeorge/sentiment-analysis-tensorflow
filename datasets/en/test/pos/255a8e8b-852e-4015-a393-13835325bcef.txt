We stopped off for dinner with our kids.  I was immediately impressed that they served Peroni on tap.  We ordered the Arugula and Prosciutto pizza and I have to say that it is one of the most amazing things I have ever eaten!  I had the manager come to our table and told him how in love I was, and at the end of our meal he brought us a fabulous cannoli desert.  We took a bottle of their house Pinot Noir that was equally impressive.  Hands down, if you are in town you MUST eat here.
