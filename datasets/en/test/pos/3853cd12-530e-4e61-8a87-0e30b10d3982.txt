um, this place is great! 

definitely for the person that does not want to compromise the aesthetics of a nice set of frames!!!

 family operated local business, I found them on Yelp and then went in to see what they were about.

I am REALLLY picky when it comes to eyewear, I have very particular taste, and definitely know what I want in a pair of glasses. I found the style of glasses I had been searching everywhere for within 2 minutes of being in the store, and trust me-no small feat! They are funky, geeky, clear acetate heaven...so pomo...aanyways, just go here! It is great!
