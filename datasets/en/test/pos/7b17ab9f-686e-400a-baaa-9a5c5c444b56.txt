The instructors at Maximum Pilates are AMAZING! They're so warm and welcoming and the clientele is very sweet and kind! I came to Maximum Pilates on a friend's recommendation that Maximum Pilates has done wonders for her knee injury & her health (she also has a cute, little figure - which she attributes to Pilates). I had injured my back and was itching to try anything to get me mobile again. Heather and her staff have helped me not only become more mobile, but my husband swears I grew an inch - as Pilates has really helped me look more lean and long. I highly recommend Maximum Pilates to anyone who either needs to rehab an injury or get in great shape. You will not regret it! Call them and get on the schedule - you will see phenomenal results.
