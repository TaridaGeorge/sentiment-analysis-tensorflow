I've been to BJ's a lot through the years mainly for lunch and sometimes for dinner. Their beers are excellent. My favorite is the pirahna ale. Everything that I have ordered is always excellent brewery food. My favorite lunch is the California Club flatbread pizza but you can't go wrong with the soup and salad or the sliders. They have a huge menu too. C'mon it's a brewery so you just know that it awesome.
