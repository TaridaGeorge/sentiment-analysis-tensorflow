My wife and I just ate at your great restaurant in Tempe tonight! What attracted me was the name, "Forefathers," wondering if it had a patriotic flavor, and it did! The Cheesesteaks and fries were amazing, and I love the pictures of Washington, Jefferson, and Franklin on the wall, along with the American flag captioned with "In God We Trust" on the outside window. The staff was especially courteous, friendly, and professional too! We're new to AZ and will make Forefathers a regular stop.
