Looove this place! Especially on Saturday and Sundays. Breakfast is so good. I would suggest breakfast taco plate or build your own burrito. The bottomless bloody mary/mimosa special on the weekends is probably the best deal. They literally never let ur glass get empty. Plus, there is a dj...need I say more? It's hands down the best time I've had at 10am
