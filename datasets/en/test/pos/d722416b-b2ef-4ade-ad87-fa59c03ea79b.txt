David and Rose own the place and it's like a home. They have the most comfortable spa chairs that feel like you are getting a massage from another person and they take their time. They act like you are the most important customer they have and ask questions and test the polish first to make sure you like it. But the absolute best part was the foot massage and hand massage Rose gives. In addition, they use hot stones on the pedicure for no extra charge, I was in heaven. The price was very reasonable and the owners were incredibly nice. This was my first time and they acted like I was a regular, it was great! I will definitely be coming back as soon as my next mani/pedi is due!
