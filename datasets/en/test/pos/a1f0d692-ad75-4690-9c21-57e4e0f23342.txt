I don't like donuts, however Bosa takes the lowly donut and makes it a pastry

The only donuts worth the calories

The Crumb and Raspberry filled are excellent

The ham and cheese crossaint is pretty solid, works nicely if you have some extra lunch meat at home you can heat up and eat alongside it, as for a couple bucks you are not going to get a ton of meat in the pastry, boars head pastrami works nicely
