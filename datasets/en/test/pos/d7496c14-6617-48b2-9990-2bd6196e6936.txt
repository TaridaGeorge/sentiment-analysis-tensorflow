This library won my interest once I noticed the modern style of this facility.  Glass, steel, concrete, and natural sunlight all surround the library's interior.  Each level seems very spacious, with many desks and chairs to sit in.  Nearly every desk has an electrical outlet.  Wi-Fi signal at the 5th floor is very good (4/5 bars).  The all-glass walls facing north/south give amazing views of the city which makes this place perfect for reading and getting work done.  One of the best public libraries I've been to yet.
