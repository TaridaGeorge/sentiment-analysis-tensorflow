As I was passing through the Phoenix airport I found this gem near gate A5. I was blown away at the service I received and how friendly the entire staff was. I was greeted, helps and thanked by multiple staff members while there. I actually forgot I was in the airport at a point. it is hard to find this rate of service anywhere you go let alone in an airport! Besides the service the place was beautiful and the food was amazing. I had chicken and shrimp fajitas which I would highly recommend. Phoenix airport motto is America's friendliest airport and they definitely meet that motto because of this restaurant!
