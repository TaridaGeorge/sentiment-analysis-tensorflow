They have tator tots!!! 

We have eaten a few times here and have never been disappointed. The Friday Fish Fry is incredible - tastes just like you are in Wisconsin. The apps are tasty too: Quesadilla, tato skins, and the lettuce wraps are the best! They have a fairly new menu that has quite a few healthier items. My hubby's favorite is the black bean burger. The portions are large but is there really such a thing as too many tator tots? The servers are so friendly as are the bartenders. You can eat outside or at the inside bar too. Great stuff.
