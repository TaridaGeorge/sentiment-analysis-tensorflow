Best Vietnamese restaurant in AZ I have ever been. Very friendly staff, excellent taste, reasonable prices and quick service are what I see. 

Crispy chicken is awesome as well as lots of pho choices. 

The only thing I'd like to say for improvement is that the inside of the restaurant woud be redecorated and be more light.
