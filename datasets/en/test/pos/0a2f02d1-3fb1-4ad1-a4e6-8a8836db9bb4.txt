Can't help but jump myself onto the FnB wagon train. Have experienced many wonderful meals here.  

I don't know what they do to the chicken but it is simply fabulous. Even simple grilled broccoli is so tasty that I actually dream about it despite my carnivorous tendencies.

Late nights on Friday and Saturday are terrific deals and a lot of fun from the kitchen.  The other night I  had the best darn pho I have ever had in Phoenix.
