This store is so great that I go out of my way to shop here. I have been going here for years and love the atmosphere and selection. The staff knows what they are talking about, and always have a cigar or pipe in hand. The prices are excellent and the walk-in humidor is laid out so that you can find what you are looking for easily. 

The lounge is very nice and has ample seating. There is a TV there, that either has sports, news, Cash Cab, DIY network, or Alaskan Gold Rush on. Everyone there is very laid-back and friendly, which really helps create the relaxing environment. I visit just about every Friday for a couple of hours, and it is the most relaxing time of my week.
