I love Camelview. Not only do they show interesting movies, the employees are really nice and the theatres are very clean. The popcorn tastes very good, and I always get a large popcorn with my mum, then bring it back next time for a free refill. Great money saver. AND the loyalty cups are totally worth the first $5.00 you spend, IF you go to the movies a lot, like I do.

Lots of old people and hipsters. Sometimes there's snoring.. I think its from the hipsters.
