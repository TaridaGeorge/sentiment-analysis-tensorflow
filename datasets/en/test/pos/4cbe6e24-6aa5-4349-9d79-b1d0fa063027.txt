Busy QT alongside the I-17! Stopped in twice, once for gas and on the way back for a sandwich and drinks. It's hopping in here both times. Before I found Yelp and was saved, I have been here before and the pumps are almost always full and people flowing in and out. It looks like they never get to breath here! But as always the pumps work, the sandwiches are tasty and good, and the fountain drinks yummy. Bathrooms are pretty clean here in comparison to most gas stations especially those along a freeway. There is a nice "side door" exit if you're getting back on the I-17 toward Tucson which avoids getting onto the main road and a stop light. 

Great place to go if you need quality gas and a break!
