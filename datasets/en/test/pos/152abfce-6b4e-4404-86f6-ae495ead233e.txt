I LOVE this place! My construction co-worker told me about this place when I was looking for materials for a bathroom remodel.
BINGO !!!! I ended up getting my cabinet, marble vanity top ($149!!!), sink, faucets, wall hardware, wall tile and light fixtures! What a STEAL! and great quality!
Rick (the owner) is so nice and everyone is very helpful! No commissioned sales people here! 
I had so much fun & saved so much money that I want to remodel my whole house! ha ha ha
