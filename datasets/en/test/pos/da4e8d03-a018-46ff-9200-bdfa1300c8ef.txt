There are RA sushi locations in Houston, I don't care for them.  Bad service for overpriced, undeserved food.  Well, I had a to spend the night in Phoenix and hungry.  There were only two restaurants opened, Applebee's and RA.  Hmm...which to choose...I don't like either.  My friend suggested RA since he likes it in Houston.  Wow!  It was fun!!  The inexpensive sake bombs and yummy sushi.  When you haven't eaten all day and your first meal starts at 11 pm...it was heavenly!!  The bartender was super awesome!!
