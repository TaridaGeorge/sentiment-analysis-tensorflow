The white pizza with pesto is out of this world and the wine list is fantastic. Always great service, the waitstaff knows the wine list and makes great recommendations. We've been eating here regularly for 4 years and have never had a bad experience.  The takeout is equally as good, they never skimp on quality. Highly recommend this restaurant!
