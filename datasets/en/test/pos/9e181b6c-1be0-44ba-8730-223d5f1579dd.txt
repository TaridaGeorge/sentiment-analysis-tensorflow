Shelley's bakery is as good as it gets. No added high fructose in her stuff. She uses only the best ingredients all baked from scratch. She is so much fun to visit with, like a friend you've known forever. She was so patient with all the changes and me stressing out over my mothers wedding cake she made this past October. It turned out beautiful and tasted every bit as good as it looked. We were all so pleased. I highly recommend everyone visit her wonderful bakery and try one of her goodies while you relax in her little sitting room and enjoy the moment.
