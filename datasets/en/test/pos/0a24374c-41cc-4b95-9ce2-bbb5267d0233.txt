I love LOVE this buffet because it is ALWAYS clean and I never feel gross after stuffing myself because it is a salad buffet. I am addicted to their chicken noodle soup, I seriously cannot get enough. I recommend grabbing a blueberry muffin and asking the guy behind the counter for the honey whipped butter (they don't leave it out anymore). Together the two are sinful!
