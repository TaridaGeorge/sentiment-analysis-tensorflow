Ode to Top's Liquor

To look upon your well stocked shelves I smile,
You let me mix n' match my heart's desire.
Though sober now check back after awhile,
As bombers, pints and fifths sure spark a fire.
This social lube you offer is smooth n' cheap,
From Champagne, Brewski, Liquor to Wine.
Clever, friendly staff if asked for help will leap,
And serve impending hangovers of mine.
They also stock cigarettes and drunk treats,
True boozehounds know selection can't be beat!
