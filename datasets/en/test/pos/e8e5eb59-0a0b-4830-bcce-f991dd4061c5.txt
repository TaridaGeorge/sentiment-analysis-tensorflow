I wanted cheap and easy, and this place reminds me of Le Pain Quotidien in how it offers great food for reasonable prices and other market-style goodies as well. I was traveling for business and was relieved to find a panera-esque restaurant on Yelp.

I ordered the Salmon/Mango salad, as well as a mango sandwich. Both were extremely delicious, and the same price as if I'd gotten similar fare at Panera. I'm super sad that we don't have these in Philly, but I'll definitely be back for the ease and taste next year.
