I get a coffee from here almost every day of the week!

Of all of the Dutch Bros in the valley that I have been to, this one is my favorite. Their customer service is really 2nd to none! They are always happy and seem to be having a great time. For any of you music lovers out there, your sure to hear a new tune or two on your visits here as they have GREAT taste in music and have something new playing every day. 

My day has always needed a coffee but no other coffee puts pep in my step quite like one from Dutch Bros!!

Try: Skinny Irish Mocha!! -  It was their March special and it's listed on the regular menu. Also, you can ask for any of their drinks skinny.
