This is one of my favorite hangouts. The staff is always friendly and have great memories and social skills. It is nice to always be greater with a smile and warm greeting no matter who is working. This coffee shop has amazing pastries made from scratch daily with a good variety. I have never had a problem finding an available outlet, which is pretty rare in a coffee house so centrally located and that does good business. You wont be disappointed. Cute and has a lot of character!
