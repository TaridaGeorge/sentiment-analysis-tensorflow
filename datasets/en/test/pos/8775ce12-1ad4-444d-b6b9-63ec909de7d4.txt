The furniture and art in Red is amazing, but damn, if I could only afford some of it.  Although I know the owners/sellers/docents can see it in my dead eyes that I am only the transient type who enjoys looking at beautiful things that my graduate degrees' debts will prevent me from purchasing, they have always been friendly and helpful to me when I have browsed around this temple to vintage teak and sleek plastic.

Okay, so my only hang-up with Red is that a lot of neat stuff does not have price tags; who knows, maybe I could afford some stuff if I knew what the price was...still, probably not...yet.
