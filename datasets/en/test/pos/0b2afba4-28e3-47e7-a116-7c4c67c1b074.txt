Stop what you are doing right now, drive to Liberty Market and try their BREAD PUDDING.  Ok, I don't typically like Bread Pudding.  It has a bunch of raisins in it (not my thing) and it's usually a bit dry and uneventful.  The Bread Pudding at Liberty Market is moist, flavorful and topped with delicious fresh whipped cream, it's absolutely amazing!  The waiter even did a little song to accompany it's grand entrance.

Service has been great on the two times I've been there.  Their bathrooms are awesome and unisex (so European, ha ha) and on both occasions that I've eaten there the food has been delicious and fast.
