YUMMY!!!  I have only had delicious and fresh food from DeFalco's....and I have been a customer for the last 5 years!!  Great food, friendly staff.  Just a heads up...because the food is so good...they can tend to have a long line and you may wait for your food for a while.  They even have a sign up that states if you have don't have 15 mins to spare to wait for your food...you may not to make other lunch arrangements.....and it is true. My advice..... If you're in a rush, call in, they will take phone orders.
