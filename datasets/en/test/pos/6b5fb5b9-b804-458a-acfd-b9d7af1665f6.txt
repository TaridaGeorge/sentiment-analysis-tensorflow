To all the goat cheese lovers out there, I have 2 words for you.... PIZZA RUSTICA.  It's to die for, with roasted red peppers, mushrooms, olive oil, mozzarella and goat cheese. I ordered the 7" with the original pan crust, it was rich, creamy and full of flavor.  It's THE best pizza I've had in the valley. Fuh gedd abou da pizza joint with the fancy yellow box,  bada-bing, bada-boom, Nello's is da place.
