This is the first time i have ever been here. My girlfriend has been here several times and really liked it. Also, my Brother and his son really like it as well. So I thought i would give it a try. I was happy i did.
The selection was amazing!   There was a lot of seafood and all really fresh and good. Ice tea and soda are addtional charge, but, hot tea is included with the meal.
Prices are good. Lots of parking, friendly staff.
