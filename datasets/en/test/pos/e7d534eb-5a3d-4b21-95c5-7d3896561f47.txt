Words can not describe the great experience one will get from dining at FnB - you are welcome from the moment you step in, it is a fun and bright atmosphere (the floor is amazing!) and the staff is top notch.  The food is fresh, local, prepared with love and leaves you wanting to sit and sample it all.  

So instead of reading about it - get your butt(s) to FnB and try it yourself!!
