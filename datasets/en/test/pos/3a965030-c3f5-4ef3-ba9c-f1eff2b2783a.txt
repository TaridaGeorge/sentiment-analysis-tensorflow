A place called Giant Hamburger, well, has giant hamburgers. And they are delicious, as well as the fries that come with them. Yet, the main reason that anyone should try this place is breakfast. I'm a hearty eater, so when I ordered the "triple" chorizo, eggs and potatoes, and 3 slices of sourdough toast, my belly screamed "yay" when they brought my plate. It was a mountain of food for a little over $8 and I would have eaten the plate had it been edible. Great locally owned business and I'm sure to be back again and again. I might even get a burger next time!
