Dr. Haddon is amazing.  I had a several badly deformed toes from a previous surgery many years ago.  I have been limping along (both figuratively and literally) for years with pain ranging from uncomfortable to debilitating.  With a simple surgery, he fixed the problem in a way that I didn't think possible.  I would have had this done years earlier if I'd known a relatively easy (though he wouldn't say his part was easy) fix was possible.  I would highly recommend Dr. Haddon.  He is just outstanding in my book!
