I love sushi, and this place has the BEST sushi I've found in Phoenix.  It's a little off-putting with its strip mall location, but I've been coming here for years and the sushi is always awesome quality.  They have a ton of special rolls that are fun to choose from.

My favorite rolls are the Cherry Blossom (salmon and avocado covered with tuna) and the First Love roll (spicy california roll covered with salmon, tuna, and LEMON!).

I think they have teppenyaki open there now, but I haven't been there to experience that yet.
