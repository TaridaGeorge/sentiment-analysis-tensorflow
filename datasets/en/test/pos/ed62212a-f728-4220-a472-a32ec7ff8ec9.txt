I know a thing or two about a good BBQ being from the midwest.  Let me tell you that Bobby Q's is a good good day. 

The doughnuts at the end are wonderful. 

I recommend hittin' this place up on a Sunday when you can get the family chicken/ribs/pork/brisket with 2 sides combo.  

If I'm ever back in Phoenix I'll be over at Bobby Q's.
