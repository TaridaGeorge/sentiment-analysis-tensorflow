Things I love about Wildflower bread company:

Potato Cream Cheese Soup
Caesar Salad
Staff
Customer service

The last time I ventured in here was after some retail therapy.

I ordered my favorite which is the Potato Cream Cheese Soup with a half/small Caesar Salad.

Wait time was so fast and they were busy! A lady brought me the wrong order and quickly apologized and brought back the right order. I didn't even get a chance to be upset about the mix-up because it was quickly fixed. Yay!

I like that if something is wrong with my order (which only happened once) they will fix it. I also like the friendly staff and great food. I will keep coming here. :)
