We were in town for the weekend and I had a cigar at this lounge.  The cigar prices are reasonable and I didnt mind paying $9 for a La Gloria Wavelle.  Service was good and the atmosphere was nice and chill.  My Wife doesnt smoke cigars and the air circulation was good, no lingering smoke.  We met some nice people and the lounge singers were a plus.  We will come back next time we visit, I wish we had something like this in LA.
