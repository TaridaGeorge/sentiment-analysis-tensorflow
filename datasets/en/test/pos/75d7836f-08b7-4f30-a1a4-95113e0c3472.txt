I love finding new hipster spots and I and wasn't disappointed with this one! 

Their decor is so beautiful! 

We got the fez burger with garlic and rosemary fries, and it was out of this world delicious! Their fries are my new favorite. Their drink menu looks awesome but we saved to have them until next time we go. 

The staff is great. We were warmly greeted by a guy at the front and our waiter was fast and efficient! 

I love this place! It is a definite must try!
