Great place to visit for food and drinks. Their rum selection is amazing ! Most of the cocktails are $9, which is a little pricey, but once you taste, you'll see you get your money's worth. The watermelon daiquiri is my favorite so far. Cozy and comfortable with reggae music playing, nice covered patio too. The food was excellent, fresh and seasoned well. Our waitress and the other staff were on top of it, I found my happy spot !
