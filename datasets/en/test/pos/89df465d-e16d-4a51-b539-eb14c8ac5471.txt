Came here on a Sunday morning and the service was speedy enough to keep the line moving. Nice music and great feel to the place. The outside patio was a great place to eat, even with the sound of the traffic right up against 7th street. Food was outstanding with good portion sizes. I highly recommend the biscuits and gravy...incredibly fresh!  My family and I will definitely be back!
