Espressos and cocktails. For the win how about that? Jeff is a gentleman and a scholar and has created something that Phoenix needs more of: a stylish place for hanging out and being creative. There is a hipster vibe but it's not clicky. Be comfortable with who you are and be ready to interact with other people and you will have a great time here. Wifi is good and if it seems slow try one of the other two access points. I hope to one day get the password to the internal network. Rumor has it that Jeff knows the google fibre guys and is secretly testing it out for the Phoenix area. 

Finally if you see a hairy guy having a blast with his wife and the bartender buy him a drink. It's the desert by the way. Hydration is important.
