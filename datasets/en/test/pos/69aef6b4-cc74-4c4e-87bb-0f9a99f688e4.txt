The best bagel shop I have been too. Cream cheese is the best you will ever try, and their bagels are delicious with many flavors to choose from . I love the breakfast and lunch sandwiches! Their coffee is also better than Starbucks and cheaper too :-) If you are in the area i would recommend trying them out. Everyone is very friendly with a big smile on their faces .
