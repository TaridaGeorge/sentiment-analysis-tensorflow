Beautiful place, and a super sweet family that runs it.. The food is great, and you can't beat the service you'll receive. My Mom goes here faithfully, and they now know her by name. I can tell you the Strawberry and Chicken salad is the best I've ever had! The food is reasonably priced, and the portions are decent. 

It's fun to be able to support small local buisnesses, and that's what downtown Glendale is filled with. 

I live in San Diego now, but I know I'll be visiting the Spicery next time I'm in town.
