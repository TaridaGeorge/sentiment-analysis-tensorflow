I wanted to let my mind settle before I wrote this review. I had dinner with Chef Chris on October 21st for my fiance's Birthday and it was for sure the best dinner we have ever had. Bring your best bottle of wine and cash and get ready for a truly unique dining experience. There are not enough words to describe how good the food and experience is. I would recommend sitting outside if weather allows. I live in las vegas and even with all the dining options here will be making a flight to scottsdale just to eat some of the chefs creations I can't wait to eat there again. thanks so much Chef Chris
