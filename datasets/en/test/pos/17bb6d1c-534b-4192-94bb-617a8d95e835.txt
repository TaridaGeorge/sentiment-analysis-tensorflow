One of my favorite places to stay, period.  The surroundings are manicured, the service is excellent, and the kids have an absolute ball in the lazy river and pools.  The golf courses are challenging, and there is plenty of shopping just across the way.  For those of us that live where there are no In-N-Out Burgers, one is conveniently placed just down the road.  Plenty of movie theaters and Generica nearby, as well.  Fun for the whole famn damily!
