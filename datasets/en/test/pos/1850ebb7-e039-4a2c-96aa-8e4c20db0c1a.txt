I stopped by at the recommendation of a friend and found the staff friendly, helpful, and expeditious. The coffee I had was just the right mix of strong, and not too sweet.  Their pastries were exceptionally tasty.  They are apparently done by a company called 'Wicked', and Slade Grove (The Owner apparently) was there, and was also exceptionally friendly, and mentioned a Peanut Butter Pudding he was working on.  I am going to have to go back there and try that some time.
