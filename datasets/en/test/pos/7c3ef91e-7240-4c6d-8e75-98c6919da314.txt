This is the only place I like to go and shop.  What's not to love, they have great stuff and great prices.  That is the draw.  Sam's has cheap stuff and cheap prices.  And, If you think you only need a Costco membership to buy bulk groceries you are sadly mistaken.  They buy good brand stuff in bulk like watches, jewelry, sun glasses, clothing, etc...  They've had Seven Jeans and Ray Ban stuff in there.  Good wines, furniture, and on and on.  One just go in sometime and walk around looking at everything they have in there.
