This place is a wonderland of fabrics and related supplies! Its a virtual warehouse of every kind of fabric you could want or need! I came here because I was told they have the most extensive collection of marine vinyl in The Valley, and after checking out a few other spots, THIS IS IT! I restored my boat seats and got all the fabric from here, as well as the foam for my seats, which they cut for free! Staff is helpful to a straight, non-designer-guy like me! Its even fun just to look around at all the stuff they have here.
