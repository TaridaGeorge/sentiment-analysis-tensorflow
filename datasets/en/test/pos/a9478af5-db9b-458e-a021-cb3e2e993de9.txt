I would strongly recommend Frank if you need work done. I had to get work done on my girlfriends AC. The other guys wanted to charge me 120 bucks just to "find" the leak. Frank didn't charge a thing. he said it took him about 10 minutes to find it. The cost was less than i expected to get it fixed too. 

I found my future mechanic from here on out-
