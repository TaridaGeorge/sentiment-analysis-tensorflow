Wow,it's been over a year since I have come here.  What in the world was I thinking?  I forgot how much I liked the unique and tastey sandwiches here.

After a long grueling Camelback Mtn hike my friend said we should come here for a bite.  Glad I agreed to and that part.  My muscles everywhere on my body were hurting, but that sandwich made me forget all about them as we sat on the patio.

I know parking is a nightmare on this corner in Arcadia, but who cares about that.  Great place to people watch and enjoy great food at the same time.  I definitely won't wait another year until my next visit.
