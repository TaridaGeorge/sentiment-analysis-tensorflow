My sister suggested I try this place as I had a headlight out.  The owner, Khaled, stopped what he was doing, checked out my headlight, put in a new one and didn't even charge me!!!!  I also ordered a new glove box and will be back to have that put in.  I only experienced, timely and professional service and for them not to charge for the light change was over the top.  This is my new place for car service.
