Wow.  A vegetarian of 26 years gives this meaty sensation two cow thumbs up.  I went there during happy hour and got a burger and a beer for $10.  Considering the size of the burger and that it was AZ local beer from San Tan brewery, I was pretty impressed.  

I ordered the shroomie burger which was piled with shrooms and dripping havarti cheese everywere on a pretzel bun.  It was so good!!! The pretzel bun put this burger into another category.  The bun was so soft yet toasted and had this great pretzel flavor.

I was waited on by... you guessed it... an ASU student!  She was very nice and attentive.  She made sure I had everything i needed.

I will be back to tackle the rest of the burgers.
