Bar none the best and most unique frozen treat you'll find in Arizona. Betty's treats are made with seasonal fruits, so the menu changes regularly (though there are a handful of flavors you'll find all year). The staff is very welcoming, and they'll even offer you a handful of ice to pack in a bag if you're taking a couple pops to go!
