I love the place, and I love Lisa G. First, some of the menu choces rock: the antipasto plate makes indecision a virtue, the vegetarian lasagne is a great special, and the shrimp tacos on Tuesday night are a treat.

The space is cool and sophisticated, and Ms. Lisa G. is a friendly and dedicated presence in Central Phoenix.
