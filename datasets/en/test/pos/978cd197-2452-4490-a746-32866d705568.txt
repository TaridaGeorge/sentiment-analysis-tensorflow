I like dreamy draw. There are lot of trails so you can easily ignore people. It's a good place for off the leash running with the dog. Just please keep mean dogs at home. The trail is rough and rocky and there are speedy mountain bikers sometimes. But there are no fees for parking and there is a nice gazebo and tables. The bathrooms are cold brick and steel and there is no door in the women's room. But it has tp and running water.
