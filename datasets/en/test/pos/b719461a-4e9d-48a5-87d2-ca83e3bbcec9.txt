Love this store! 

There's one lady (can't remember her name) but she's super recognizable with arm tats and short spiky hair- anways, she works in the meat department and is super knowledgeable. Came in to buy some lobster tails on sale for $6.99/each -- yes you read that right- probably the most delicious deal in town! She also helped me select some yummy carne asade spiced to perfection and a few other meat items. 

Completed my shopping trip with a lb of their fresh hot salsa (sort of by the cheese section) and a bunch of asparagus and assorted artichokes. Overall, this store has a great selection of vegetable and meat items. I'm never disappointed when I come here!
