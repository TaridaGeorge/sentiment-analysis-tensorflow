We had a great experience here and will definitely be using Cochise Animal Hospital as our primary vet. The Dr. was very gentle and calm with our scared dog. He quickly diagnosed her infected toe and gave us a treatment plan. She is much better now. Our invoice showed "tender loving care" as one of the treatments she received that day. Such a cute touch.
