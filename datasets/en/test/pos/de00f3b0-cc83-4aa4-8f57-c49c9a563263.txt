While on my way to a neighboring establishment I discovered Zoe's Kitchen in Scottsdale. I have always wanted to give their Phx location a try, so this was my chance. I am a vegan and ordered the veggie pizza and salad. I neglected to inquire if these qualified as vegan (My Fault-they did not) and when the salad arrived, I explained my situation and they could not have been nicer about it. They remade the salad sans cheese and recreated the pizza to be vegan and EXTRA good! Wonderful staff, nice atmosphere. reasonable priced and delicious!
