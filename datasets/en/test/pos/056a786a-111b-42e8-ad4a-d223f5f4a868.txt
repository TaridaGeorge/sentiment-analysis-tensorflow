This is the second time we have been to this restaurant (we are from Flagstaff).  This time we had 6 people (last time only 2) and the food, service and ambience were still 5 star!  Three of us shared the 48 oz porterhouse steak and still had some to take home!  We had the saut√©d mushrooms and they were the best we have ever had.  Other steakhouses are all a la carte but Durants provides a wonderful salad and your choice of a vegetable (all included in the price of the entree).  One last thing: we went there with a $200 gift certificate generously contributed by Carol McElroy to benefit the Flagstaff Symphony Orchestra.  She and Durants deserve a special thanks!  We will make more special trips to Phoenix to eat here.
