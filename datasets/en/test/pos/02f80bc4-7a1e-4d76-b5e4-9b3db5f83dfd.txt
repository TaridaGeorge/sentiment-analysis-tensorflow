I have to add my kudos to this little gem of a place.  I've driven by it millions of time, but thanks to yelp read about it online and all the rave reviews.  I'm not a big hot dog person, but I had a Maui Dog with coconut, pineapple and all sorts of yummy things on it and it was diving.  I also had an icee.  It was so good, very satisfying and the service was REALLY good!!
