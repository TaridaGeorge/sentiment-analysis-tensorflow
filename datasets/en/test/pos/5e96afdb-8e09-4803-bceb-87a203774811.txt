i only go to LGO for the wings and wine...lol it is the most amazing combo my bf brought me here after we heard about in the living section of the newspaper a while ago..i was in heaven when they brought my wings out so tasty!!!the sauce on them is just simply amazing and they have the best blue cheese dip i have ever ever tasted! im not a fan of their pizza...but i always get 2 orders of the wings its a little pricey but the wings are big...and the fries are great too..also the drinks packed on friday nights be warned there will be a wait
