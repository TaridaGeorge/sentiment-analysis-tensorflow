Much like Sabrinas review I took in an broken pair of Maui Jims along with my about to break pair of Maui Jims to see if they could swap out the bridges and extend the life of my glasses a little longer.

10 minutes later I had a working pair of sunglasses!!

On top of that the employee that helped me was personable, professional and extremely knowledgeable. 

He even took the time to discuss other brands of sunglasses and some recommendations.  

I will be back when it's time for a new pair!
