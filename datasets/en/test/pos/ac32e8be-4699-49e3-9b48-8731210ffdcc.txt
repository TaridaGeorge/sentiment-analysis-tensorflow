We found an injured stray cat. Since we already have seven, keeping it wasn't an option. I called the Humane Society and, since it was late afternoon, they recommended I take it to 1st Emergency so it could begin receiving care, and they would pick it up the next day. The staff at 1st Emergency was great, both in person and on the phone, and I was comfortable that I had left it in good hands.
