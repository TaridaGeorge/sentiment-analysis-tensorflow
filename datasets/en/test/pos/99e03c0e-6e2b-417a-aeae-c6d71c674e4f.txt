I gotta say.
I've been in here a few times and each time I had a great time!

Really great time!

Singing along at the top of my lungs to Billy Joel songs great time!

HOWEVER
I've always stopped here after bar hopping a bit.  This was kinda the last stop... and we were all pretty buzzed each time we visited this place.

I dunno.

I have fond, fond memories of this place though.
