What a great burger, cooked on an open wood fire, with plenty of toppings to go around. Went here on the recommendation of a friend and got the bacon cheese burger with pepper jack. The bacon isn't your usual bacon, something a little closer to canadian bacon. Not crispy but just very thinly cut bacon in a large circle. The fries were really good too and the place has that old wild west outpost feel to it. 

Sadly there's only one drawback to this place: CASH ONLY. I was very sad to see this as I don't carry cash usually. I would have bought much more if I could have used my debit card, and I was really disappointed that i couldn't. This will certainly limit how often I will return.
