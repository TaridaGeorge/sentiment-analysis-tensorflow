Great place! I've never done Pilates before, however they were very helpful in their instruction on the moves and breathing techniques. Plus the class sizes are small, so you get more personalized attention. As with many others, I don't have much free time in my schedule. Weon Keyong Health Center has a lot of classes to chose from that always seem to fit at the right time for me. And, their online scheduler is super easy to use. I  can see which classes have availability when I'm able to go. I highly recommend this business!
