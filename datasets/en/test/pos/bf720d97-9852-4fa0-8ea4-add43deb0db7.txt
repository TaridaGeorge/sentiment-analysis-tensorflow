I went to Daily Dose on a Saturday. There were plenty of empty tables inside, but my friend and I decided to wait for a table on the patio. The hostess was efficient seating us once a table became available. I had the veggie burger. I told the waitress I couldn't decide between sweet potato fries and regular fries. She suggested I get the combo, which is offered on the lunch menu, not the dinner menu. I thought that was nice of her, since I wouldn't have known about it otherwise. I can't wait to go back and try other items on the menu.
