General Tsao Chicken is wonderful. So is the wonton soup. This is a regular destination for my daughter and me to meet for dinner and catch up. The owner is a wonderful lady who once owned the restaurant at Metro called China Gate. My daughter grew up her entire life eating Chinese food there as we had a business nearby and I was always to exhausted to cook after the super long days we worked our store. So it's a comfort having that great food available still. And the service is wonderful too.
