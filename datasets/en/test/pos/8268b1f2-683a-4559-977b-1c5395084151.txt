This is by far the best spa in the West Valley! I love the Litchfield Park area and this spa is amazing. It must have been recently renovated because it's beautiful. I have been there a few times this year and had massages that have both been amazing. The facilities are clean and modern. My cousin and I are have been to a few well known hotels in Scottsdale/Phoenix this year and were shocked at how outdated the spas were. The Red Door is wonderful, can't wait to go there again soon!
