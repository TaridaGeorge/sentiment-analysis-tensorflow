Thai Elephant is the best Thai food I've had in AZ!

The food is delicious and I'll drive down from Scottsdale just to eat  here.  There are many  closer thai restaurants to me than Thai Elephant but none compare.  I usually get the pad thai, green curry, change up the 3rd dish and a thai iced tea.  I have never been dissapointed.

The prices are reasonable, the service is fine and the only thing I would change would be to make the thai iced teas bigger, the're not small but La's thai and Thai house in scottsdale give you bigger glasses.

If you're looking for good thai, definitely come here!
