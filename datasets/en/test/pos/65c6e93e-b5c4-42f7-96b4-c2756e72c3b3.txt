My group of three did the Sunday prime rib special, which includes a salad, side, and dessert. Particularly noteworthy items we tried were the bread, Caesar salad, sauteed mushrooms, cheesecake, and creme brulee.

The steaks were ordered three different ways, and all of them came out perfectly.

The hostess and servers did an excellent job in making us feel welcome and special. As someone else noted, they swap out the white napkins for black ones if your slacks or skirt are dark.

The only reason I'm not a regular diner at Fleming's is the price. It is an expensive meal, so it is a place reserved for special occasions. Thankfully, the experience is so outstanding that it justifies the cost.
