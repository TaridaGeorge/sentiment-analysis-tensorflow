Incredible service! With prices exactly the same as CVS or Walgreens why would you go anywhere else? They fill your script in 5mins of you handing it to them (dependent upon how busy they are). 

The place is sooooo CenPho. Historic building restored, quaint and beautiful. Locally owned and operated by a native. Hell they even sell Hemp based lotions and such. This place is such a jem ... I can't recommend this place enough.
