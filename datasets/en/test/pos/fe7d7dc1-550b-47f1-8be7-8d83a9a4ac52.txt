Having lived in France for two years, I found this to be the most authentic food in Phoenix. They were very accommodating to special requests. The ambiance was beautiful and the restaurant was set in a little "pocket of paradise." Meaning one might not know that it was so close to 24th St. and not see it on a drive by!
