While Zoyo is always a pleasant experience (cute, clean, convenient, and culture-ally--get it?--diverse with a variety of flavors), I was delightfully surprised tonight.

What could possibly be responsible for this five-star review (beyond the usual), you wonder?  Here goes:  Strawberry Jalapeño.  FAB-U-LOUS!  It starts as strawberry and morphs into a peppery finish.  If you've had a jalapeño margarita at Z-Tejas, you know the very juxtaposition of sweet and hot that I'm talking about.  

This stuff is yummy.  Better hurry if you want to give it a try, though.  The flavors at Zoyo change frequently and this one is destined to be a memory.  Just like these 100+ degree temperatures.
