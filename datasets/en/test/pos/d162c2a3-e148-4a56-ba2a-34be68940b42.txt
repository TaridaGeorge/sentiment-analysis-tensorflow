Best sushi in town hands down! I am a sushi guru and have been all over.

My dad has worked for a Japanese company all my life. When his clients come into town from Japan this is the only sushi place he'll take them because it's the best in town. 

It is a small intimate place that has become a daddy daughter tradition. Him and I get together around Christmas time and splurge ourselves full of sushi and saki. We finish off with green tea ice cream, my absolute fav!!!

Love it, love it, love it! Can't say enough great things about Hiro!!!
