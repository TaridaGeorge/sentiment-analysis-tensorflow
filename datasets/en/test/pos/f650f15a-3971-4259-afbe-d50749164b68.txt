I love Baker Nursery! Their selection of plants is superb and the plants always look fresh. The staff is always very nice and helpful. And I love the atmosphere...sounds weird for a nursery, but it is very homey. It is as if you are walking into somebody's back yard...which is almost true. I believe that the house next door is the owner's property.

I remember my mother bringing me here as a child - I always had so much fun there. She brought me here because she also used to go there as a child! Baker's has been around for so long and is a wonderful family business. You should go check it out!
