My fave grocery store! They have a great selection of produce at amazing prices. I mostly take a trip to Sprouts when I am in need of fruits, veggies, and chicken breast. They do have a great selection of other products as well, including sprouted breads - my favorite being the Alvarado Bakery Flax bread. They also have great prices on bulk items and their nuts, like raw almonds, are frequently on sale. They aren't as bountiful in their selection of meats/deli meats - such as grass-fed beef - as some other stores may be, but I don't doubt this will change as more shoppers visit and the demand is higher.

Overall, Sprouts is always my first choice for groceries!
