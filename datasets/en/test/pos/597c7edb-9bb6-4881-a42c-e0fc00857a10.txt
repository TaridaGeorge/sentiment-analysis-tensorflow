Great hiking. Went to the Gateway entrance on N. Thompson Peak Pkwy. There are trail maps there and restrooms. I hiked the 3.6 mi. Gateway Loop trail. The scenery is beautiful, at least for someone like myself who is not a local. Gateway Loop is described as a moderate for difficulty, and was no problem for me even though I have failed to exercise in any fashion for months. If I lived near a place like this, I would possibly not be such a lazy sack of crap.
