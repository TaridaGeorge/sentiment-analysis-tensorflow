My boyfriend and I were looking for something near Chandler Mall that isn't a chain restaurant same old thing and found the perfect match here on yelp!  While people hungrily waited across the parking lot to get into Changs, we strolled in to Nouveau Bistro and were seated immediately.  We ordered the goat cheese and shrimp appetizer which was so yummy!  For entrees: he ordered the short ribs which was absolutely delish and oh so tender and I had the feta and spinach ravioli which hit the spot, it was very rich and flavorful without being overbearing. 

The atmosphere is very nice without being stuffy.  My boyfriend commented on the lighting, it was dim with candles which gave it a more intimate feel.  The service was good.  I can't wait to go back again, I forgot to try the sangria!  :-)
