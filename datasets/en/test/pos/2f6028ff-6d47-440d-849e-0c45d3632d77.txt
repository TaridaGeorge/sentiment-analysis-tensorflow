Definitely the best Creme Brûlée in Phoenix!  What is most surprising is that it comes from a food truck.  I have even bought them to have later in the evening and they still are just as good as when I ordered them. Although he offers several flavors, I keep going back to the vanilla and lavender.
If you are lucky, Eric may have a bit of his farmer's market fare available. He is an amazing chef creating dishes made from produce and meats of venders at the farmer's market.  His meatloaf is to die for and his salmon melts in your mouth.
