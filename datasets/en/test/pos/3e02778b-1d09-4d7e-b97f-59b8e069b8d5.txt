Had no idea I could order straight off the menu without anyone even knowing I am a vegetarian.  Never had to say a word, just ordered a BBQ "chicken" pizza.  

Shared it with a couple of neanderthals who had no idea they were eating a soy product.  

We all ( and I do mean all) thought the pizza was just the right tangy with the sauce that was complimented by the "perfectly done" chicken.  HAH!

How sweet is that?
