Wow!  I finally found an oasis in the desert.  A couple of scoops of the Papa Ed's hand scooped ice cream and the heat wasn't a problem anymore.  A great throwback for us who remember old fashion ice crem stores.  I must have spent an hour sitting while looking at all the pictures of the staff on the walls and reading about the charitable accomplishments the store owner has done with Glendale and the surrounding community. We weren't familiar with the area since we were from out of town and so the owner was kind enough to talk to us about the local business and what to see.  What an enjoyable afternoon because the staff is so kind, the atmosphere is friendly and especially the ice cream was delicious.
