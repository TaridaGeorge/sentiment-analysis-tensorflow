I went to Chompies tonight with Valley Movie Group of meetup.com
This is the first time I've ever been to Chompies and I couldn't wait to run home and tell you how AHMAZING! my sandwhich was. 
I ordered the Aaron's Choice which is hot corned beef and pastrami, swiss cheese, coleslaw, and 1000 island dressing on an onion roll.
This sandwhich was huge and stuffed full of meat. I assumed I would only be able to eat half and take the rest for lunch tomorrow. That's what I thought UNTIL I sunk my teeth into that sandwhich. It was soooo goood. The meat was tender and melted in my mouth. I could not stop eating and eating. This sandwhich could solve all my problems. This sandwhich makes the world a better place to live in.
I would recommend this sandwhich to ANYONE.
Service was great as well.
