Tried The Satisfied Frog for the first time, based on previous Yelp posts.  It really lives up to its fine reputation.  We had super, friendly service provided by Barb.  We enjoyed the clean, casual atmosphere and all the sports broadcasts.  The pulled pork sandwiches were delicious, very tender and covered with tasty sauce.  The Satisfied Frog really knows french fries!  The cole slaw is plentiful and very good.  We also tried the fried zucchini, an instant hit! For sure we will be back.
