I had a great time here. My first visit was at luch as a co-worker recommended it to me. I was a little lost coming in the entrence but once I found my way in I was impressed right off the bat. I find the enviornment relaxed causal and fresh. My waiter imformed me of the sesonal menu they offer and welcomed me to take a look around. I ordered a wood fired pizza with chicken and arugula, delicous!  I was impressed with the local artwork and the mural they have upstairs. I cant wait to come back at night to intesify the experience.
