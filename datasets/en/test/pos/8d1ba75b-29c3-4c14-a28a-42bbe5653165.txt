Kidstop is an independently owned toy store, a rarity in this era of retail megaliths trying to run the locals out of business. The store was busy, but not chaotic; a rare find during the Christmas buying season. My sales person was friendly and didn't try to pressure or hassle me into buying anything specific. He DID however, know MUCH about the toys the store stocked, the target age-group, and how the toy's worked. With the ambient Christmas music (not too loud), the uncluttered aisles, and no-hassle environment, i didn't feel that I had to grab something and RUSH to get out as quickly as possible; a comforting alternative to the retailing giants.

My salesperson helped me find what I hope my 9 - 11 year old nieces and nephew will really enjoy.

Kidstop offers free gift wrap too! Merry Christmas!
