Went with a group from Yelp for the CMYE: Opening Night of Giselle, and I have to admit this was my first time at Symphony Hall, what an amazing building, the art work from the lights to the seats, to the walls, everything done with such great detail, and when you walk in you can tell you are in a grand building! 

We had seats up in the baloney, second row in the center, and were able to see the stage clearly; I don't think you could have a bad seat in Symphony Hall.

Giselle was a beautiful ballet to watch, enjoyed the show! I now will make sure to follow up on what is happening at Symphony Hall and make more trips to this grand place!
