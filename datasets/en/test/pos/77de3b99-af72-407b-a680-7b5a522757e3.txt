Thank you Yelp for helping me find this place.  My husband has been asking to find a nice place to enjoy some after dinner cocktails and this place did not disappoint!  I highly recommend the art of flight.  Part of the fun is not only enjoying your beverages but oohing and ahhing over other's drinks as well.
