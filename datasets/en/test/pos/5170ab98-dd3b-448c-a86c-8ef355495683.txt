Wildflower Bread Company is like Pandera Bread or Cosi on steroids.  Everything is simply better and doesn't cost more.

i had a chicken pesto sandwich with pumpkin soup for lunch.  wow. wow. wow.  A real chicken breast right there in my sandwich with a fresh roll around it, not chucked nor reformed nor anything but tasty and real.  The pesto was excellent.  the soup had vegetable chunks and slices in it that were NOT mushy.  yum yum yum.

i went back for breakfast.  i had pouched eggs, bacon, french toast.  yes, i had a meal of left overs too.  The french toast was even better later, when it wasn't so hot and i could taste how delicious the bread is.

The staff is clean and friendly offering excellent service.
