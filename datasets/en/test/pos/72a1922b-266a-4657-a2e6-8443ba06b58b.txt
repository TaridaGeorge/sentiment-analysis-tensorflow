Love this place, have made friends with managers/servers Dulia and Chris C., and I make a monthly pilgrimage here. 
My classic order: The cheese plate (the lavender goat cheese is heavenly and I haven't found it at any other place), the garlic pizza from their wood-burning oven, and a glass or two of La Fin Du Monde. If you haven't had that Belgium Trippel yet, its about time you did.
