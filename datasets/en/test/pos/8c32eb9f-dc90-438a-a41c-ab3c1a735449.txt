They did a great job putting together individual lunches for a big holiday family bash we had--14 different selections.  Well labeled, tasty food as if we had been in the restaurant.   We love this for their lunch specials, the Empress Chicken is our favorite thing.  Check out their specials for Chinese New Year.  We had some outstanding food there last year, many courses and it was very reasonable.  The looong string beans were a real standout.  The family is always so friendly and they always remember us, it's just a nice local family-owned and run restaurant, we and love supporting them.
