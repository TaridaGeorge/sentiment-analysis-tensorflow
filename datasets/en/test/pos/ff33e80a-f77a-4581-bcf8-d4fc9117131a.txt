It's the perfect little soup and sandwich spot.  Dilly's has a few locations around the valley and all of them are wonderful.

The Hot Sandwiches are huge and filling, and they come with a classic side (potato salad, pasta salad, coleslaw, etc) and a pickle. Dilly's also changes up their menu a little bit every now and then. While it's a shame to see some of my favorites go, it's great that I can walk in and try something new.

Their soups are also phenomenal and come in a bread bowl. I recommend asking them to mix the potato soup with the cheese soup... Amazing! The salads are weak, but unless you're ordering one in a combo, it's not really what anyone is there for.
