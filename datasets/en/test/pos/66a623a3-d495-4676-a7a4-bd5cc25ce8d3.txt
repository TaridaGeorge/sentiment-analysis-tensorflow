Definately one of my favourite places.... everything is home made... including the mozzarella EVERY DAY.... it certainly makes their deep fried mozzarella the best I have ever had....

add that cheese to the thin crust fresh sauce pizza... amazing.

Went on a Wednesday for 1/2 bottle of wine... great deal with large portions on food

Staff always friendly and make the dining experience even better.

Can't wait for the weather to cool down to enjoy that patio....
