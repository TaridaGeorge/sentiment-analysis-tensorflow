My favorite, favorite, favorite spot for a hazelnut latte. I was actually here twice today but Yelp wouldn't let me check-in again...

This place is what Starbucks used to be: friendly staff who make perfect, yummy drinks. It's a bit of a wait but they only have like 1 person working as a barista. Great atmosphere for talking and it smells so good in here, not like the dark dungeons of Starbucks. 

No burnt coffee!!!

Only wish they had a drive-thru because yes, I am that lazy.
