I have never been more impressed with the attention to detail Dwayne and his wife put into the entire menu. From the time you watch Sarah mix your first drink you will realize this place is carefully thought out and time and effort is spent creating a Jamacian experience that is authentic and delicious! Eat and drink your way through the menu and you will be amazed.
