I love this place!!  I love challenging myself, I love being able to work at my own pace and I love that these guys actually know my name.  It's a unique experience so if you are looking for a great place to work out and be social if you want or you just want to go in and do your workout (and it's kinda like playing a video game) - this is the place for you!  It's not a beef-cake factory - just normal people trying to get a little healthier!  Check it out!
