This is my new favorite bar. 

The decor is awesome. They have rad-ass performers. So rad, in fact, that my Bird's parents now know she's gay because the Lounge singer used a gaydar machine on her and it went off the charts. 

But let's talk about the important stuff. 

$1 jello slime shots. Enough vodka to give you smell-chills and cheap enough to not be too upset about throwing it all up later. 

They have Absolut Peppar. This is important to me as I like my dirty vodka martinis spicy. The spicier the better. 

You simply must check this place out. I think I'm going to try to get my next birthday party scheduled here.
