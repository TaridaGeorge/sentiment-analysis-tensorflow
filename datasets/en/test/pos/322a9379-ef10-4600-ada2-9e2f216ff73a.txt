I first visited Blackstone when the course first opened back in 2004. I joined soon after and I must tell you this Country Club is one of the best in the Valley and it has to be one of the friendliest golf clubs that I have every visited. From the many awards this club has won to the outstanding service it is no wonder, why  Blackstone has grown even in a slow economy.  I have been inviting clients and friends from all over and everyone agrees that this is one of the best Golf Clubs that they have the opportunity to experience.
