This place is funky, down to earth, and all about the music and having a good time... NOT about what you're wearing! I love the authenticity,  of this place, the age range, the diversity, and the common love for the jazz, blues and funk. 
One of my favorite places in Phoenix!
Get here early, seats are hard to come by after 10pm, especially on the weekend
