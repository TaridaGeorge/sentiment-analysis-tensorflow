This is one of my absolute favorite places for brunch. We drive from Anthem just to go here on occassion. It's always hard for me to choose what to get. The cinnamon roll and fresh berries are amazing. They also have a fabulous fresh scone on Sunday with cherries and chocolate inside. My husband likes the ZuZu breakfast casserole. Definitely a place everyone should try!
