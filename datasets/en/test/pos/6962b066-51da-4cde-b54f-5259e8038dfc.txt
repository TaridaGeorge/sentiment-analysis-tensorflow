My boyfriend and I have been to Noca 3 times and have loved it everytime. I don't think we've ever eaten something at Noca that we haven't loved. The service is outstanding... Eliot and the staff are great! 

The menu constantly changes, so you know you'll be getting fresh and seasonal dishes. I won't review our specific dishes because they probably won't be available, but the starters, short rib, pork dishes, cobia and fresh pasta have all been phenomenal. I also love the amuse-bouche (small food samples) served between courses. Noca even sends you home with an individual cookie for each member of the party.
