If you're interested in trying Vietnamese sandwiches. This franchise is tops. The bread is made in-house. It's unfortunate that they don't have Lee's Sandwiches all across the United States. The sandwiches are made to order, so it takes a minute. It is well worth the wait. Must try their durian smoothie! It's authentic. CASH ONLY.
