I went here for my birthday and holy moly was I glad I took a chance on NoRTH to make my bday fabulous.  This so far is my favorite Fox restaurant and one of my favs in all of the Phoenix area.  Everything we had there was excellent and cooked to perfection.  
For apps: yucca chips and trio of dips AMAZING
Entrees- Strazz-something chicken pasta, scallops, and New York.  AMAZING
Desert- Nutella crepes- Not amazing but free since it was my bday!
Service was excellent and they catered to our needs quickly and effectively.  We did not make a reservation for outside so when we decided we wanted to be outside they made the change and we were sat in 5 min. 
Love this place.  Cant wait to get back and try more things!
