Are you a blonde, or considering going blonde?  After years of frustration I finally found a hairdresser who is a genius with color! Her name is Lisa Fournier and she has been with Grandstrands for many years. I have been using her for almost 10 years.  Make sure that you plan ahead when making your appointments, as she is usually heavily booked! You will LOVE your color, and for those who have long hair, she isn't scissor happy like many hairdressers I have come across. I moved since starting to use her and now have a 35-40min. drive to get there, but it's worth it!
