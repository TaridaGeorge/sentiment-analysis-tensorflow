Been coming here for 15 years.

Pro's
- good food all around.  Haven't had anything that wasn't good.
- portions good
- price good
- like the shuffleboard
- lots of TV's
- staff good (do miss some of the old timers)

Con's
- not enough seating for larger groups (go to Goldies for that)

Perfect place.....  Will be back...
