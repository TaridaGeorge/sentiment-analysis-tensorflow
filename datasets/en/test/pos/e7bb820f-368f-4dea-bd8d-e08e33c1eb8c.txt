My husband and I order food to go a lot from Blue 32. Whenever I've gone in to get our food, everyone is very friendly and always checks to make sure I've been helped. They are very courteous on the phone even when they are extremely busy. We've eaten in the restaurant a few times and had a great experience each time. Great service and great food! Thanks guys!!
