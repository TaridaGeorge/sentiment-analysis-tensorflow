The sales staff is awesome! Location is great and they have extended hours for the west side of town. Honestly, it is one of the best boutiques I have found in the valley. I'm used to living in big cosmopolitan cities with cutting edge fashion, so have had trouble finding a store to meet my needs. Roka has a great selection that changes fairly reguarly and if you're in the west valley, it's your best option. Who wants to drive all the way to Scottsdale?
