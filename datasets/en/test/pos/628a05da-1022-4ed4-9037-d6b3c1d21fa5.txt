I thought the food was very, very good and the staff was very pleasant.  The price was right as well ($7.95 for lunch or dinner)!!  

I could not try all the items as there were too many, but those I did try, were incredible.  For a buffet (usually not as good quality as a sit down), this was the best I have had in terms of quality and choices.  

There were several humus types, fresh feta and other cheeses, various olives, and many hot and cold dishes.

Do yourself a favor and try this placeout.  Your belly and wallet will be happy you did.
