I have never had anything bad here from the breakfast menu. It it much more spacious since the renovation! If you wait a little it is okay because they always get your food out fast making up for it. The have great frozen coffee. Try the toffee nut:) Although we live clear on the opposite side of town we like to stop here first before other errands in the area.
