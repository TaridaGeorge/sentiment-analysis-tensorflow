A friend bought me a Tammie Coe birthday cake and it was incredible.  I have never actually been there but will be in the area tomorrow and am thinking I may stop by for some yummy treats.  

My b-day is in October, the cake was chocolate with raspberries (my favorite) and the outside looked like a witches hat, orange and black.
