Without question, the best Philly Cheesesteak I've had! The ambiance is still changing/improving since the new owners took over,  but if you're looking for a mean, big guy loving Philly, you've come to the right place. Their homemade thick fries are great too. Just the right amount of sea salt. I got the Steaken combo with CheeseWhiz, mushrooms, peppers, and onions. I was stuffed! The owner asked me to name one thing I would change or that could improve and I couldn't think of anything. I've eaten here before and this was as good as I've gotten. Not sure what the other review is talking about.
