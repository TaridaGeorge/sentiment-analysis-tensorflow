love love love. when I was in PHX last year, this location was not open, so I went to the OG outpost in Tempe.  this one is a lot more convenient.

had every possible meal at Green.  I have to take advantace of the vegan delish whenever I can.

main dishes I tried: Coconut curry w/ fake chicken, Mongolian fake beef & Thai fake chicken.  plus some salads & starters. and tasty housemade bevs.  everything there is AMAZING.

brought a veggie friend & an omni & they were huge fans, too!
