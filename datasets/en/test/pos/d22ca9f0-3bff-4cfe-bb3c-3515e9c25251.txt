In n Out is my favorite fast food burger place.  They're always delicious, fresh and loaded with tomato and lettuce - which is how I like them.  I always order my hamburger animal style.  And most of the time I try to get someone to share a fry with me cuz I don't want to pig out and eat the entire thing (which I would have no problem doing believe me)!  Their fries are the tastiest!

The service is always very friendly and quick and they've never once messed up an order.

Their shakes are fucking great if you're in the mood for one.

I Love In-N-Out... and if it wasn't so horrible for you I would eat there way more often!
