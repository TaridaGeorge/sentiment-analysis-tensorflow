My favorite steakhouse of all time.  Great steak that is cooked just right.  They often have some live music there which is fun.  The service was great and the atmosphere is really cool.  There are thousands of ties hanging from the ceiling and business cards stapled on the walls, even saw dust on the ground and picnic tables.  The patio is absolutely wonderful too.
