I figure since I'm on my way over there for an evening of fun filled events,I'd take a moment while my nails are drying to review the joint.
I like it here.Comfy space,great staff,fun outgoing people.Inside is roomy enough,but the patio is home.They used to have a fire pit that was the ginchiest,but firepits plus  drunky people does not make for happy endings...So they did away with it making even more useable space.It's all good.
Every now and again they grill up some burgers that are tasty too.
See everyone who's going in a lil bit.
