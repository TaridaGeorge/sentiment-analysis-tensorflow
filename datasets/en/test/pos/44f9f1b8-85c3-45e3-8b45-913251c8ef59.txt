I could write paragraphs and poems about how much I love this place! I could eat here for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I have never been dissapointed with anything I have ordered here. My favorites: for breakfast their chai tea, Vietnamese coffee, there biscuits and gravy and bacon pancakes. For lunch, their picnic sandwich with the sweet potatoe side. For dinner, the salmon blt. The salmon blt is a must try!!
