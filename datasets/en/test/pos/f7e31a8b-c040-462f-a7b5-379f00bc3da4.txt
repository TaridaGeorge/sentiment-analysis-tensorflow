I walked in with four tires with 31K miles on them and walked out with four brand new "best" rated tires.

I had no clue about the different ratings and advantages to purchasing good tires (better gas mileage, smooter ride, harder to puncture, etc.) Now I know, thanks to the information I was given.

Great customer service guys, great job!
