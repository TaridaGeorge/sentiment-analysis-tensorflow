All I have to say is wow.  The auto picks and portrait pick that MelonFishPhoto did for me blew my mind.  I felt pretty confident after seeing some of the photos he had done, but my expectations were far exceeded.  He has a creative eye that caught much more than just the personality of the car.  The picture brought tons of people to my sites asking who shot the pics.  The portraits were truly great and fun to do.  I actually saw myself in a new light that I never saw before.  I loved it.  Anyone can take a picture, but very few people can take pictures that draw people in and seem to almost have an active emotion behind them.  I strongly recommend MelonFishPhoto to anyone for any photography need.
