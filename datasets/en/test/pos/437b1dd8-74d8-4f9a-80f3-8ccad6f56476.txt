Durant's makes me feel cool, maybe even like a celebrity.

One night, while dining with my ex, two men behind us just couldn't take their eyes off of us.  When my ex alerted me to the fact that we had an audience, I realized that one of the men was a friend of my mothers.  I turned around to say hello and it turned out they weren't staring at us because they recognized us.  They were staring because they thought my boyfriend was Jesse Metcalfe, lol.

Like I'd ever date that tool... although, he is kinda cute.

Anyway, go to Durant's and maybe someone will confuse you or your date with a minor celebrity.
