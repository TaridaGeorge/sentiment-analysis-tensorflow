Oh my goodness, Ice Cream Cookie Sandwiches!

And again...Oh my goodness, Ice Cream Cookie Sandwiches!

And not just plain old ice cream cookies---giant, homemade cookies--a few different types.  And you get to pick which cookies you want (you can mix them too!) and then have them fill them with your selection of ice cream (did somebody say rocky road??)

This is my favorite dessert recommendation for Mill Avenue...actually, this might be my favorite dessert recommendation for Tempe.

It's unpretentious, friendly, delicious, and you can't eat the ice cream cookies without getting a little messy (which I think is a plus--not *too* messy of course).
