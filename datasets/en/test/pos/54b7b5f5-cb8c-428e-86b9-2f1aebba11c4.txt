Los Olivos has done a fantastic job each time I've taken my car there.  They spend far longer on each car than the $12 or $16 you're paying would predict.  

One caution -- the last time I had my car cleaned, I asked them not to put the smelly stuff in it, because I don't like that heavily-perfumed smell.  They were pleasant about complying with my request, but the car came back smelling like sweaty man.  Stick with the perfume.
