I am surprised by the mixed reviews here. I adore Moira. 


I'm always happy with the music, the service, and especially the food. I love that on a friday or saturday night on foot downtown, I can stop for some yummy food pre-dancing or post adventuring. 

I've been slowly but surely sampling all of the rolls they have for happy hour. The kani crunch is delicious, as is the white blossom and fried tofu and just about everything else I've tried. The seaweed salad is what dreams are made of. The drinks are good, too. I really enjoy the lychee one and the orange blossom. 

We always have Heather as our server and she's terrific!
