Delicious variety of oils!! Seriously loved the setup up and the oils and vinegars were great. I am almost out of a few and I'm pumped to go back and get more and then some! Highly recommended as its not the drive the Queen Creek Olive Mill is and honestly the Tuscan Herb oil is my fav oil to use on just about everything. And the variety of basalmics is much bigger and quite flavorful!!
