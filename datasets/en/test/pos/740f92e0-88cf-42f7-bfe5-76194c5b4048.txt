An independent restaurant in the far west valley - a rarity. And this one is quite good. It's in the Safeway plaza, but they've done the best you could with a strip mall. There's even a cute patio.

The bread is unremarkable, yet adequate. The salad dressing is good but sometimes they put too much on, so I just order it on the side. The shrimp Marsala is great, the shrimp fra diovala is spicy goodness and the lasagna is a good choice too. My mother in always gets the frutti del mar and is never disappointed. The calamari was served crispy, hot, and tender. Overall the best Italian in Goodyear.
