This is the finest rock gym in the Valley and has been around the longest. With a talented crew in Dief and Marty K - You cant build a better gym. 

They have solid route setters, a thrash and dangle lead area and a natural style rock area for working on crack climbing. Other areas include a chimney area and an off width area as well 

They sell climbing equipment as well and theyre prices are more than reasonable...Help support the little guy!
