I love this place.  Went on this occassion with a gf for hh and just the best experience (not there has ever been a bad one).  The hostess sat us on the patio promptly and we were immediately greeted by our server, who also happened to be VERY handsome.  

We had the best service all night, very attentive and as good as it gets. 

The food, as always, top notch.  Great portion sizes and quality.  We shared the mushroom ravioli, prawns and cheeseburger and all were to die for. I think my favorite were the prawns, great size and spicy amazingness. 

Overall, doesn't get better and for the HH prices, it's icing on the cake.
