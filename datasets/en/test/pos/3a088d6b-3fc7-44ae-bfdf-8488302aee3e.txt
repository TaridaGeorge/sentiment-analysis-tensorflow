It's a shame that Starbucks has defined what we think the coffee house experience is supposed to be and what we think coffee is supposed to taste like. Am I the only person that remembers the early coffee house movement??  This place serves great coffee, great people, arts, music and comfort. There is nothing corporate about the place. There is nothing pretentious about the place. They serve good coffee and fresh pastries and their prices are in line with everyone else. Why should they charge less? I don't understand why people will pay $2 for a scone at Starbucks that has preservatives and was made days ago and shipped to the site, but then complain that a local small business owner has the nerve to charge that for a fresh product. Baffles me
