Men's Department.

It may seem like I'm on a shopping spree this week, but this is for hubby's sunglasses.  I love that the sunglasses are not locked up inside a display case, you are free to peruse through them without the help of a salesperson.  So many brands like Maui Jim, Ray Ban, Cole Haan, Tom Ford etc.  

The men's department is quite extensive here  in comparison to the Chandler Mall location.  Nice selection of dress shirts and ties--he hates ties, but he has to wear them to work.  I have to commend the buyer here with great taste.  We'll have to make a trek out there for their annual sale.
