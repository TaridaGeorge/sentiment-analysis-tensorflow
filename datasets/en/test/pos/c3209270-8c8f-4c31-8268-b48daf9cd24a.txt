Hands down, they have the best, strongest, tastiest teas. And they actually train their employees to know about all the flavors and benefits of each. The stores are all similar in their freakish cleanliness (they're opening in Fashion Square next week), but I suppose it's all about the zen, man. 

I've been ordering from Teavana.com for a long time, so when this Biltmore location finally opened, I rejoiced. I strongly recommend you try a blend of Queen of Babylon white tea and Rose Garden herbal. It's like drinking milk post Froot Loops, but packed with antioxidants!
