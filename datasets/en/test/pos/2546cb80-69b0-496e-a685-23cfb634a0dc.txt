I've already expressed my love for Chompies in my review of the Tempe location, but after having brunch at this location this morning, I need to do the same for Scottsdale. 

I'm not usually a fan of big menus. But since pretty much everything at Chompies is good, let them cook whatever they want. I met a friend here at 11am and had some trouble deciding between breakfast or lunch. As I looked through the menu, the omelets caught my eye. I had the Spanish Omelet which has black beans, onions, tomato, cheddar and jalapeno jack cheese. It also comes with potatoes and a bagel or toast for $8.50. Not only Delicious, but I'm set for the day.
