I've lived in the Phoenix area for over 17 years, and this is the best BBQ I've found so far.  No contest.  I'm partial to the pulled pork, but their brisket also is awesome.  And the bbq beans are to die for...

Two sauces available...regular and habanero bbq sauce.  And homemade root beer and lemonade!

Oh...and on your birthday they feed you for free (up to $10).

Great food, great prices.  A gem for any BBQ fan.
