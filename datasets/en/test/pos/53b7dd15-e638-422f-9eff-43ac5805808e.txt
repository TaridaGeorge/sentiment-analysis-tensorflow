Went back to replenish my tea supply:

1. Lover's Cup - a blend of green and black tea with rose petals. Gives off an amazing rose scent and is like drinking liquified roses. So amazing.

2. Lapsang souchong - smells like a campfire. Much like Tea #1, this one is like drinking a campfire. Sounds weird but so good!

3. Jasmine pearls - little balls of green tea leaves with entire jasmine blossoms in them. You can tell this is quality tea when you steep the little balls and they open up, revealing entire tea leaves, not just tea leaf cremains swept off the factory floor.

Obviously I'm biased towards teas with amazing scents, and the teas here don't disappoint. Too often a jasmine tea has so little jasmine scent but not with the teas here. All the teas I've bought loose here have been super-high quality.
