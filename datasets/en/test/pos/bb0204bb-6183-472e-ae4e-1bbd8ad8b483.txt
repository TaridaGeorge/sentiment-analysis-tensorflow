The hot dogs here are amazing! I always go for the Chicago dog with extra celery salt. FYI - they use natural casing so the dogs snap when you bite them, some people swear by them but I'm not some people. The answer to my dilemma? Go skinless, all the flavor none of the snap! P.S. They close at 8 so get here early and are closed Sunday. P.P.S. They will close the place down if you have a big enough group so grab your friends and give 'em a call!!
