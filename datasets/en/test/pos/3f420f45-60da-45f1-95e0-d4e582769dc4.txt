I still have dreams about elementary school field trips to Ceretta's. I felt like an extra in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory when I was here with my classes. I have even gone back as an adult, and everything is exactly the way I remember! 

The rich smell of chocolate greets you in the parking lot, and by the time you enter the building you are literally salivating. The tours of the facility are interesting. The candy-making facts and tidbits of Arizona history make it a must for Valley newcomers. 

The store section of the building is neat, organized, and everything is clearly labeled. The chocolates are otherworldly, making the only problem with Ceretta's my lack of self-control!
