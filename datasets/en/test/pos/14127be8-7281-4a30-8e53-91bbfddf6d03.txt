Great buffet. Although it was a little on the salty side, I'll be going back there the first chance I get, which unfortunately won't be soon enough as I live in Oregon. Everything was so yummy, and all vegetarian, a surprise to my father who naively asked for lamb. He was very satisfied, nonetheless, in the end.
