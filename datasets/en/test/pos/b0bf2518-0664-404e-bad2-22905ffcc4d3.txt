Sapporo is my favorite place to eat in all of Arizona. I love the teppanyaki grill.  We go for Happy Hour quite a bit and the staff is always so nice and the food is AMAZING! I have suggested it to family and friends and they all rave about the food and experience they have. I love the calamari and the scallops and shrimp. They also have the best drinks. I will be going back consistently!
