I went on a Wednesday night  and was able to sit up at the bar area.  I have to concur..all the employees there are super friendly.  The food...wow.  I tried some of the combo gumbo and the combo pan roast.  Both were spice level 8 of 10.  They were perfect.  Full of meat and super tasty.  I'm definitely going back to try the mussels and the clam chowder.  Oh...the chocolate bomb cake was great too.  Can't wait to go back.  I hear on the weekends, there's sometimes a line of over an hour.
