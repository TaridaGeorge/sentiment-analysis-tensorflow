A good friend once said that everything tastes good with truffle oil.

I couldn't agree more, and that's just one of the reasons I love the Morning Glory Cafe.

Let's start with ambience.  It's an outdoor patio, with trees providing the shade.  It's morning on a farm, so the cock will crow every now and then.  Birds actually sing.  And it's Phoenix, so the weather is going to be perfect 99% of the time.

The coffee (serve yourself!) is a decent blend.  But the highlight of the breakfast was the veggie skillet - farm fresh vegetables done in a skillet (this mornings selection included fennel, squash and red onion), together with skillet potatoes, and topped with scrambled eggs finished with white truffle oil.

I know - it makes me salivate just thinking about it.  And that's what makes a good restaurant.
