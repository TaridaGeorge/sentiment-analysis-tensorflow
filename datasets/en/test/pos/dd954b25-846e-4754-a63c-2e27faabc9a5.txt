Hey Abu what are you doing here?? Did you order my wings yet? What can I say about Rosie? Parking can be a pain, but after you park it's all good!

Gotta love this ol'girl! The wings are all drummies, oh yeah baby mommy likes! They are cooked well done so they are crispy and the have some beer based hot sauce that kicks your taste buds into high gear. I love the kettle chips too. 

They have good drink specials and a full bar to choose from. I just
love this little pub last time I was here I think Leprechauns took me home. : P
