Hands down the best sports bar in phoenix.

You can see multiple TVs from every seat in the whole restaurant.  The prices are higher than your standard sports bar, but the food is worth it, and it keeps out the riff-raff.  

If you like the idea of a "more upscale" place to watch the game, this is it.  Don't get me wrong, you still will feel right at home in your favorite team's jersey and old cozy pair of jeans. Just don't expect to see and bar fights, and do expect a family or two.

The best part of all, they just became a U of A bar! Bear Down!
