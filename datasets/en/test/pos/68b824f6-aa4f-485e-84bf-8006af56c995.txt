Total In-and-out fan here.  The food is always fresh, prepared fresh and from fresh ingredients.  This is a high-quality fast food that will not strain your wallet.  They have a very simple menu, hamburgers, french fries, shakes and sodas.

This is a privately-owned corporation, family-owned and managed.  Prices are very reasonable, considering what you get.  Service is always exceptional and the food is delicious - with a not-so-secret secret ordering system that allows you to jazz up the items with tried-and true mods.

My typical order is a double-double, animal and protein style, with a large iced tea.  This is a double cheeseburger, with grilled onions, special sauce and pickles, wrapped in lettuce.  It's a hot mess.  And it does not kill the wallet at just over $5 you cannot complain about this deal.
