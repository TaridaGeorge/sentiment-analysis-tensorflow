Another visit to my still- favorite spa stop in Arizona.  I would compare this place to a fast-paced Moroccan bazaar...other than stopping in the circular rooms to clear your negative energy and make wishes on your way into the spa, it is all hustle and bustle of sometimes more than 20 people waiting for spa services in the lounge, and a packed spa terrace pool filled with people who don't whisper.  This is the type of place you would do a girls spa party...rent a cabana or spa suite and do it up right!  Gorgeous views of Camelback Mountain make up for the lack of peace and quiet...I remembered to bring my iPod to block out chatter and noise for my return visit, which is perfect for my day-long lounging by the terrace pool.
