Seriously? It's been a couple years since I've reviewed Cartel and I just want to give 'em kudos again. Thank you universe for this little beaut and the fast, amazing baristas that run the place. When 1pm lunch rolls around nothing sounds better than running to Cartel from work for a pick me up and they never, ever fail me.
