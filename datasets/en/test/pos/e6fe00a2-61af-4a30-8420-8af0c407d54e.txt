This is the 2nd time we have been here and we can't wait to go back.                      The staff is so friendly and the Food is excellant!                                                          They even always give you a little sample of what is on the menu.              Wednesday is half price wine night. So we got a wonderful bottle of wine for only $17.00 and it was really good.  My girlfriend and i each had a different salad.        Very fresh and really good. We split the crab cake appetizers. Fabulous!                       I got the Burger and fries  Burger was great! Very moist ... My girlfriend got the Shrimp Tacos also very good, we were so full by the end of it all. Complementairy  bottled water . We love this place !
