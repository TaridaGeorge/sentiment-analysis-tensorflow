I'm no stranger to good Italian food, and I wasn't expecting anything special but I was knocked out by the quality of Carrabba's food. The tomato basil soup was absolutely fresh, with complex flavors, texture, and spice, along with lovely wilted basil leaves to top it off. I thought this would be chain restaurant stuff, and it's really quite a few steps higher quality than its price point. I loved the olive oil dip and bread (which I tried not to overeat), and my husband and I shared each other's entree. I'll be back!

Highly recommended. Attentive service too.
