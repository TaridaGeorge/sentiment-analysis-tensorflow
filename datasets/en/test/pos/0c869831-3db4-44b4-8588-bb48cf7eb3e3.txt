After this place, Tryst Cafe, and Desert Sage, the Breakfast Club in Old Town is still hands down the BEST breakfast place. I keep trying other places but cannot find a closer alternative.

The best blubbery and chocolate chip pancakes anywhere and the OJ is AMAZING. Best combination of sweet and cold. Service is alway fast and friendly.
