He fixed the tilt problem and replaced broken gears while I waited ( about 5 minutes). He gave me good instructions for rehanging my miniblind. The price was very reasonable and he even carried the blind in and out from my car to the shop. This is the second time I have used this company and would highly recommend them to anyone. Just leave a message and they will call you back.
