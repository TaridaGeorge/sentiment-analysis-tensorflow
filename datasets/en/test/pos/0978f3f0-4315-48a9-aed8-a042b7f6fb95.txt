It's like walking into an underground secret society. The ambiance here is so nice. I felt very cozy in the dimly lit room surrounded by the stone walls and jazz music.  

I'm not much of a wine drinker, but I tried the sweetest flights they had, and my boyfriend got a flight of red wines. It was very nice to sit back, relax, and hangout here. 

I believe we had to pay a cover fee because they had a live jazz band that night.  We stayed to finish our drinks and enjoyed the music. 

This unique somewhat hidden gem is definitely a must see if you are visiting Phoenix and want to partake in some of its not-so-crazy night life.
