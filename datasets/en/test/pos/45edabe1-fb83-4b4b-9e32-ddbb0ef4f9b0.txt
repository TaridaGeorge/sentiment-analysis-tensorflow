These guys are amazing.  They are very friendly, and make you feel welcome.  The color selection is really good.  Prices are a bit lower than most other salons in the valley.  $15 bucks for a pedicure is pretty darn good IMO.  Y is really nice, I enjoyed chatting with her, and she takes pride in the work she does.  Give it a shot if you are in the area.  :)
