Dr. Holmes is the most knowledgeable rabbit vet! He is great at what he does and really cares. He works with local rescues which truly shows how much he cares about helping animals! Last year I had an emergency with my rabbit, and even though he was booked, he somehow managed to squeeze us in. Wouldn't go any place else!
