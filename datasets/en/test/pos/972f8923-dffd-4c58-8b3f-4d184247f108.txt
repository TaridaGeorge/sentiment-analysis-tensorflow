One thing to say about this place...You MUST get the Meat & Potatoes appetizer.  Hands down one of the best appetizers I've ever had anywhere, and paired with a salad, I could contemplate just eating this for dinner.  This place is SUPER cute and "romantic".  They offer BYOB service which is great...you can bring your own favorite wine/beer!  
The food was wonderful and the waitstaff seemed knowledgeable in what they were serving and made some good recommendations.  
I can't wait to go back!
