Wow I have a serious crush on  Angel Sweet .This place is really delicious and fun to try . After finally finding Angel Sweet open , I forced my kids to get a gelato for research sake.  We loved the stretch of flavors, Forest Fruits , Peanut M &Ms , Panna Cotta, Hazelnut , and Seriously Dark Chocolate,  to name just a few. 
We happily took in the whole gelato experience.  We noticed a few nice features that endeared us  to Angel Sweet:

Great rich  unique flavors  , not icy in the least
Generous portions 
Great warm customer service 

Can't wait to go back again , just seriously bummed it's so far away from my house.
