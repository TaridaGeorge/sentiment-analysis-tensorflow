Ode to the Pumpkin Porter:

How I love thee, full of spice and warmth.
Waited so long for you to come, don't disappear too soon...
I may bottle you and keep you for more than a month.
Will you still excite me and keep me singing the same tune?

Pumpkin Porter is here today,
the porter may go away
but it... is.... here... TODAY!
