OK, we got here at 3:15 ish. Right after going to Rubio's. What? I said.  My friends said, You'll see. So we waited around and caught up. Went for a geocache which we did not find. 4:30 the line was huge! We were number 4 to get in. Awesome atmosphere! Love the buiding.  Owners brother was very personable and took care of everyone there.  He was right in the thick of it. I had the Sonnyboy with added prociutto. Yummy! Had some left over for my trip the next day which ws still great. Worth every minute in the sun and every penny that I had to pinch. Great staff great food amazing times.
