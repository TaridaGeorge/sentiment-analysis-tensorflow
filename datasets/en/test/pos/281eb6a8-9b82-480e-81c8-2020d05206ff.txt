I'm a huge fan of Tammie Coe cakes for both artistry and taste.  The cakes I've had (probably 5 or more) have consistently been moist, tasty, and beautiful.

This past December, I had them create a custom cake for my son's 3rd birthday.  He specifically asked for this cake (patterned after his favorite toy) and I knew Tammie Coe could deliver.  All I sent them was a one dimensional jpeg of the toy and they produced a 3 dimensional cake that friggin' rocked.

The cake really turned out perfectly (see my photos) and my son was THRILLED.  It was pretty large and we ate it for a week (and it was surprisingly still moist).  The price was reasonable, relative to the size and detail, and the customer service was excellent.
