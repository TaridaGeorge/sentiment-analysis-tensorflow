Absolutely fantastic dentist!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!  What a great experience it is going to a dentist who truly cares, has ethics and has an environment that is extremely high tech where you know the care is as good as it can get.  I drive 45 minutes to go to this dentist, he is that good!  Add to that he is kind and really cares.  His office is beautiful, his staff extremely warm and welcoming.  Dentistry couldn't get better!
