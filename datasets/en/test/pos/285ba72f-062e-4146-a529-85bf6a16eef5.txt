I love how it's ice cream weather in Phoenix when it's hot chocolate weather almost everywhere else!

Walked by since my hotel was nearby and it looked cute, but since I had just had lunch the first time, I decided to come back after dinner for dessert.  Wow, they really are in limited quantities!  Once it's gone for the day, it's gone!

Thank goodness there was still one of the "Nuez" in stock... the roasted pecan one is the one I had my heart set on earlier in the day and was the clerk's recommendation for a newbie.

Totally met my expectations!  So worth the $2.75 plus tax for a nice fancy Popsicle!
