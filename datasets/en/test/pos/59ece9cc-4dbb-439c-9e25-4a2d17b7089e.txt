This is devastating news!!! Sea Saw was an amazing restaurant. We had the 8 course meal; each course had the perfect wine pairing that hit every taste bud. We watched the chef prepare the meals as he explained the preparation, this was the highlight of the night, one-on-one with your own chef! The ambiance and customer service was exquisite, the waitress spilt a glass of wine on my friends coat but we were in food heaven, by the way they took my friends coat, dry cleaned then delivered to her house. Again, I am devastated! I wanted to take my boyfriend this next time, unfortunately, we'll have to venture to find another "Sea Saw!"
