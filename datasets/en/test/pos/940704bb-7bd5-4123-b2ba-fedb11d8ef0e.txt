Always a favorite, never disappointing. 

We have some out of state family that get their fix on good Mexican food when they come to visit. Last time, this place was a must. It's not just any Mexican food, it's from  Oaxaca which, in my opinion, is sweeter, still has spice, and very fresh. "Don't be turned off by the ambiance," I told my cousin (steal wainscoting, bright florescent lights, ect.). "It contributes tot the experience." It's awesome inexpensive food- not cheap food, inexpensive. Just noticed that a Filbertos is going in across the street but will quickly go out of business as their food doesn't hold a candle to the quality food and service you'll get at Tacos Atoyac. 

Dine in or take-away.  Try the fish tacos and the torta =)
