I love Little Saigon! Heard about it from my doc and went the same night. We've probably been back at least a dozen times. The ambiance is adorable (makes a great date place), prices EXTREMELY reasonable and the food is awesome. You truly can't go wrong but I advise sticking to the traditional dishes for the most bang!
