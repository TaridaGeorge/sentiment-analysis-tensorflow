These guys really work hard on their quality of service.   I bought an Azera in 2006 - it's a great car, but has had a couple of issues. Anyways Hyundai of Tempe have always backed me up and cleared up all the issues.  We had a couple of Nissan Altimas  which we used to have serviced at the Nissan dealership. However the comparison in service between the Nissan dealership and Hyundai of Tempe is like night and day. The Hyundai folks are great and work really hard to please.  The Nissan service dropped off very badly and we stopped going there ~ 4 years ago.  My son has a Nissan truck and also used to have Hyundai Tiberon. He found the same thing great Hyundai dealership and lousy Nissan service.

Not much else to say - comments in the other reviews cover it all.
