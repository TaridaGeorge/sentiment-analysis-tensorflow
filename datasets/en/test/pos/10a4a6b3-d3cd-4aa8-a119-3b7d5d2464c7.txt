After being waived in the general direction by the fancy but vapid doorman at Amsterdam, and wandering the deserted north block to no avail, I stumbled randomly into the doors of Sans, an oasis in the desert of central Phoenix late at night.  Swanky decorations, mind-blowing colors on the way through to the bathroom (just see you your eyes adjust from violent purple to blood red), atmospheric music and sleek decor (combination of rocks and wood and glass), super-friendly staff (who didnt yell at me after dropping my chopsticks 3 times and stealing all the spare sets off the next table), and a very creative and tasty menu with one of the best desserts I have ever had (green tea cheesecake with mango sauce and some sort of berry).  Open late, the bar food for the higher end (yeah not CHEAP but so worth it).
