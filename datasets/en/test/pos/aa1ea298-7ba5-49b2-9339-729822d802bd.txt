Unbelievable.  I found this place on Yelp, so thank you, Yelpers!

Went in on Thursday, found the staff attentive and friendly.  In fact, I think they might have kept serving me well past my ability to drive.  The food, spectacular!  Beers? Spectacular!  

Went back Sunday after the half marathon for the playoff games.  Took less than the hour the desk said to get a seat for nine, and the pizza was awesome.  The previous lamb and sausage pasta was also super.

This place rocks, only downside is the parking.  

I hear it isn't air conditioned for the summer.  If the lure of the land truly does draw me out to AZ, I will update this.
