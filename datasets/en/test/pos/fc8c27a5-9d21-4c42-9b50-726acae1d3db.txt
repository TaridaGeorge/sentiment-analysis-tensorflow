This place is in my top thai places ive ever been to and ive been to many around the country!! I am obssessed with thai food since i was in grade school when i tried pad thai for the first time and i was hooked...their panang curry is AMAZING and i always get it spicy!! The pad thai green and yellow currys are also delicious...this place isnt fancy or expensive its perfect for take out or a casual lunch or dinner...love it everyone should try it!!
