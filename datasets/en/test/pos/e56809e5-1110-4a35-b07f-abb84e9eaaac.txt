Unbelievable hidden gem of a sushi bar tucked in a strip mall at the SW corner of Dysart and McDowell.  We absolutely love this place and think it is quite possibly one of the best sushi options in the entire Valley.
We've introduced several friends to it, and all of them are shocked that a restaurant this good is in the West Valley.
Their sashimi is always top notch, their drink specials great, and their selection of rolls are too many to mention.  We especially love the ninja jalapeno appetizer and the Double Double and Cactus rolls.
