When I moved here about 4 years ago, we had a car with problems. I took it to 4 different auto shops - each had a sure fix and each charged huge huge amounts and each time it seemed to come out of it in worse shape.  In the process though, I had a lot of interaction with the different auto shops in the area.   As others have said here, I have been pleasantly surprised with the decent prices, the friendly, prompt service here. This location is not open weekends, but maybe that is what keeps them amiable, and I have been willing to work around that fact for the good service.
