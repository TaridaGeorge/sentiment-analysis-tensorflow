Please note: This review is 100% based on esthetician Grace's services.

So, I'm going to keep this short and sweet .... I was a bikini wax virgin .... Now I am not. Grace was awesome. Some people have told me they like a no-nonsense, quiet and fast worker for this service. I was totally freaked out, and Grace had a very maternal quality that I needed. 

Sorry folks - you usually get more of a "story" out of me, but I'm just not going to go there this time.
