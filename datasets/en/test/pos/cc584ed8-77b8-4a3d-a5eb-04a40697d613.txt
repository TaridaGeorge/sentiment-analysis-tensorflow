Fantastic! part of the fun of shopping is finding the items. This store lead me on a real journey through the heart, mind, soul, etc. I couldn't find anything but circuit city taught me the lesson of patience. For all those that give it a bad rating they wouldn't do that if they knew that the city went the extra mile to provide triple the size for the employee parking lot! the customer one is actually smaller and you can meet some really great friends there! 5 stars!
