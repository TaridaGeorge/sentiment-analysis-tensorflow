Walking into this bar feels like you're not even in Arizona, but rather a bar with a mixture of different concepts from various countries. I'm one of those people that appreciates a bar with character. Everything is unique from the paintings to stained glass lamps hanging from above. What's really cool is that they have a room designated for films or stand up comedies. My friends and I chatted with the owner (cool guy) and he's one of those people that are stepping up Phoenix's potential. I get what he means, he's brought bits and pieces from places he's traveled and it shows at this bar. They got a good selection of beers and awesome lounge spots to relax and hang with friends.
