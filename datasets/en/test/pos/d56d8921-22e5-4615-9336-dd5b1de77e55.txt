Went to Mighty Muf'ler based off other Yelp reviews. Greg was excellent! Went in with some noise problems and he took a look right then and there. Didn't have the part on hand but was getting some in after the weekend, said the repair would be about a buck and quarter. A few days later I called to see if I could stop in and he had everything ready to go in just over and hour. The quote was accurate and he even did some extra welding where he saw it needed to be done. Very friendly, I would highly recommend.
