LOVED the Multigrain Salad (without the cheese) and my husband was blown away by the Bahn Mi. The service was speedy and kind, the iced tea is tasty, the decor was nice. We would absolutely go there again! The only draw back was how loud it was so it is not the place for an intimate meal but I suppose you can't knock them for being popular.
