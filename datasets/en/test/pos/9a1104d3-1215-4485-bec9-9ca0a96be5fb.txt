I really liked the idea of having my lashes look great without mascara, but was not really sure about what to look out for in quality as prices vary.  I started doing research and end up on Yelp. Kathleen was everything people say about her. She spends time upfront making sure to understand your goal outcome. Then gets to work. I was absolutely amazed at the results. I think my first appointment was at least 3 hours as she doesn't focus on time but on the results. On top of everything I've said so far she also works some weekends which is the only way for me to get my grooming done since I travel during the week.
