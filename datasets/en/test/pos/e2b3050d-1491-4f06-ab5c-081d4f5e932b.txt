I think I'm in love! By no means am I a Thai food-aficionado; but my palate recognizes good food and my wallet recognizes a good lunch special. This place satisfied both my wallet and my taste buds! I had the Red Curry Chicken which was served with rice, Spring Roll and House Salad all for only $6.95! The Red Curry was rich with just the right amount of heat (there's three levels heat available to suit everyone's needs). Even though the House Salad was pretty plain I really enjoyed the house dressing which was some type of Olive Oil, Pepper, Garlic mixture. There was so much food I was able to pack the leftovers for later. My co-workers all love this place too. Can't wait to go back for more Thai food!
