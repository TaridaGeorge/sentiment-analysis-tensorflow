As good as a hot dog gets! This place has been around a long time, and for good reason. Char-grilled top-quality meats right from Buffalo NY.

Must try the foot-long-dog (with tons of toppings) and the savory onion rings. The brat and the Italian sausage are also fantastic!

It can get pretty busy at lunch. I suggest visiting at slightly off-peak hours.
