WOW! I came here little bit off guard. From outside it looks like just a modest family restaurant but oh my.. when you're inside, you immediately feel comfortable with all the soulful songs, home made fried chicken and waffle.. And they served the tea in a jar!! Just love it! The food taste so great, I come back for more..
