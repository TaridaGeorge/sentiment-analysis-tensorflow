UNBELIEVABLE! Stayed last weekend to get out of town for my friend's birthday. We took advantage of every outlet in the hotel. The restaurants were beyond amazing! The rooms were impeccable. The pool was perfect. The service was flawless (& even that's an understatement.) I highly recommend the Four Seasons Resort Scottsdale if you're looking for a perfect weekend to relax and rejuvenate.
