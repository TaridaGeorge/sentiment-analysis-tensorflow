I've been to 5th and Wine and loved the ambience.  So, I decided to try out Humble Pie and was greatly fulfilled!! Having studied abroad in Florence, I KNOW GOOD PIZZA!!!!  I know tastes vary from person to person, but in my opinion it was very well done!!!  We ordered the garlic fries and goat cheese roasted red pepper pizza.  Needless to say, NOTHING WAS LEFT ON THE TABLE!!!  I will be going back very soon to try the Pizza Cookie!!! ;)
