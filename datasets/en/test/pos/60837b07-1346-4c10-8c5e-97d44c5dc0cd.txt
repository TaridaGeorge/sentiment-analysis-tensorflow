When It Comes To Chili's, I'll Never Get Cold Feet

I usually visit the Chili's on Camelback in Phoenix, AZ. I always find something delicious to order and my dining experience is always great. I like the fact that I can eat a great meal at Chli's and still pay an affordable price. Chili's staff is knowledgeable about menu choices and often make helpful suggestions about specific menu items. I also must comment on the relaxed atmosphere and cleanliness of this restaurant. Overall, a five-star restaurant at a one-star price. The coupons also help and encourage me to try out new items that I would not ordinarily order. Thanks to all at Chili's for keeping my palate alive and well, and for providing a truly gastronomically delightful experience.
