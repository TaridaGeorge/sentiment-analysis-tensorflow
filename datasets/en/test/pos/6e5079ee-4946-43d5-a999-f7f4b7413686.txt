I went to this place for the first time today, and really enjoyed it. Besides the awesome juice, they serve vegetarian food. Not just a boring salad, but veg food with mock meats. I can't pronounce the name of the dish but it was good with a mock BBQ pork. All the ingredients were fresh and the portion size was excellent. I will definitely be visiting this place more often.
