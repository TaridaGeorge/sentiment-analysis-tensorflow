Can I live here too????

Taliesin is AWESOME!  

What happened to architecture in America?  We went from visionaries like FLW to mass produced mega-neighborhoods where every house looks the same & with any luck will stand for no more than 50 years.

Taliesin west is a great example of embracing nature into architecture.
