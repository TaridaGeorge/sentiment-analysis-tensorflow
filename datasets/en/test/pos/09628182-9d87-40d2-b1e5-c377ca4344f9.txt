Wow where do I start , was it the great hospitality, or the nice homey atmosphere?  While all of those won me over, this wonderful place has excellent Cajun food.   My husband had the Shrimp Po'Boy and gave it rave reviews.  My mom and I both had the fried cat fish and crawfish tails. I had a side of red beans and rice and my mom had cole slaw.  Both were excellent.  Great food, great service, and great Southern hospitality. All of my favorites wrapped up in one restaurant.  I can hardly wait to go back and try something else.  

If you haven't tried Flavors of Louisiana,  GO it will be so worth it!

Oh and by the way the prices are great too!
