I visited here Saturday night for the first time.  I loved it!  Perfect for a single girl that doesn't cook much...Not for lack of want, but for lack of time.  They had a nice selection of pre packaged meals and ingredients to cook your own.  I spent way less here than I ever do at other markets.

I'll be back!
