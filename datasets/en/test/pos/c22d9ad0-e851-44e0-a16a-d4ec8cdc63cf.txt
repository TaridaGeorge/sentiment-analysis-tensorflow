LOVE the Thai Basil w Tofu. Their tofu is so good! I'm very picky about my tofu and Thai Basil gets it right. I've gotten one of the curries once and it was good, but I love the fresh and light Thai Basil dish. We order takeout from here quite often and they're always friendly, fast and never screw up the order! The prices are great too!
