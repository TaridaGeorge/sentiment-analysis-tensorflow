I just had Hale Pet Door install a doggy door.  I have a block house and they did a great job.  At first they came out and thought they couldn't do it but they called the manager and he came to take another look.  The manager was Eric and he was very helpful, polite and professional.  I appreciated how patient he was with the whole thing and after he showed up he made it work and the door looks great.  We haven't had time to start training our dog but are looking forward to it.  Hale even left us some instructions for how to care for the door and even how to train your dog to go through the door.  I would recommend these guys to anyone!
