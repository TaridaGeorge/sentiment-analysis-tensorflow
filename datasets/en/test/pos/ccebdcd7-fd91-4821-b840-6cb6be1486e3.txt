Perhaps I shouldn't be writing this review since I've only had one dish there, but I love it.  Their Pho Ga is very good.  Really fresh and tasty.  They also have some good teas.  They have a decaf raspberry rooibos tea I really like.  I've ate there 3 times, and it's been great every time.

I was really missing good Vietnamese food after living in the San Francisco/Oakland areas for over 8 years.  Finally I found this restaurant to satiate my cravings.  Unfortunately, it is a little bit out of the way for me.  I hope they open another location!
