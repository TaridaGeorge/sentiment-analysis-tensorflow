It is some of the tastiest and most original food you will find in the area.  And also it is highly addictive, so be careful.  They have a well-developed vegetarian menu, and for those who eat meat there are even more choices.  I also love that there are a few dessert versions of the pasty as well, the bonoffee pie is mouth euphoria.

Quite a hipster place though, and seating is mostly only for parties of 2 or 3.  And also, don't expect to get top notch attentive service, because a lot of the servers will be busy just hanging out.  But the food basically makes up for all the bad.
