WOW! We went here last night and all I can say is that from the minute we walked in to when we left, everything was great. The spicy lemongrass broth did it for me. The service was perfect and the atmosphere and decor was so nice. Love the black ceiling and the lanterns, Johnny. Nice. Others have said more than I can, but it's all good for me. ALL good. Five stars and well deserved. THIS is the way you do it. I can't wait to go back.
