It seems like people either hate this place or love this place, and all I can say is that I am a fan! If are going to go healthy and want fast food In N Out is one of the healthier fast food places, because of the fresh meat never frozen, fries are cut in the back and cooked in non cholesterol oil and everything is fresh it is truly quality you could taste, and by the way animal style fries are the best thing on the secret menu.
