My new go-to spot in Arcadia. Pat (the owner) is almost always there to greet customers and make sure you have an excellent experience. The back patio is a great place to relax, go check it out before it gets too hot. Wifi, great espresso (the barista use to work at Stumptown in Oregon), nice staff, good food. Recommended to all, let's help this place succeed.
