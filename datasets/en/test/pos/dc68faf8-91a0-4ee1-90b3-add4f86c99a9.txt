This place is GREAT!!!   You will be more than satified.  The food tastes great and is very fresh.  I always do the all you can eat sushi.  Each order is custom made for me unlike the buffets where they have mass made sushi sitting at the buffet stand and is hard and nasty.  You will fall in love with Mido sushi.  My only regret is that it is 40 miles from my home.  I have been looking at houses in the neighborhood so that I can be closer. You have to try Mido Sushi!!
