We found this place by chance, thank goodness. It is the best appliance store I've ever been in! Randy Rice has assisted us with several purchases. That guy knows EVERYTHING about the appliances they sell and never makes you feel like he's hard-selling. We've ended up with exactly what we hoped for each time we go in. The delivery and installation is always on time and trouble-free. No, they don't have the super cheap brands like big box stores, but they do have a moderate range of appliances (like GE) as well as luxury models (like Miele).  When you are looking for quality appliances and expert knowledge, definitely go here!
