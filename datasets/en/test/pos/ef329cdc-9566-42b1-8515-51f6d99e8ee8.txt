This place is pure heaven!  It is a combo restaurant (wait-staff for dinner, casual for breakfast and lunch), market, coffee shop, gelateria, wine shop, bakery . . . basically all things good!  They have an amazing fig pizza, delicious looking sushi, and one of the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever tasted (it's called the "Better" cookie, with oatmeal, milk chocolate, and dark chocolate).  The music is fun and hip.  The market features gourmet goodies, kitchen accessories, magazines, wine and wine stuff, even toys for kids and pets.  As a San Franciscan, I have high expectations when it comes to food places.  Le Grande Orange surpasses them 10 fold.  I am so happy to have found it!
