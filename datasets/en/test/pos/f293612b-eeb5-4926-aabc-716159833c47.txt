Only good things to say about Charleston's. I have never had a bad meal there... in fact, they've all been delicious. The service is extremely attentive..... and their staff does a great job with team work. The managers work right alongside their staff... which is a nice change. Their drinks are great, too. LOVE Charleston's.... I'd go there over Texas Roadhouse (across the parking lot) ANY day.
