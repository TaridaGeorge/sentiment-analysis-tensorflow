I came here for a late lunch on a Sunday. I got a lovely outside table with a beautiful view of the golf course. They have a wide selection of beers including some very eclectic brands. 

I ordered the BBQ pork sliders and the chile verde, both listed as appetizers. Both were excellent. The chile verde had a lovely flavor without needing any fixin'! A balance of sweet, hot, sour, and salty. The BBQ pork sliders were on the sweeter side with a lovely slaw providing tartness and crunch. Just too much to eat for me, as always!
