My favorite neighborhood joint!
If you like beer, music, art, and mingling with like minded cool cats this is the place for u! It does tend to get noisy and a little crowded around 11pm....but its a super relaxed atmosphere. I tend to strike up interesting conversations with strangers here which is always a plus. Im always down for lost leaf! BTW this is a beer and wine bar only.
