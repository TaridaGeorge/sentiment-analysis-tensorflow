Great restaurant if you are in the mood for fresh and healthy style Mexican food and do not want to pay extra money to be waited on hand and foot.  I am from California, and the closest thing I can compare it to would be Baja Fresh, but Blue Burrito has a full service bar which is a really nice addition.  The only negative thing I noticed was the mini taco soft shells.  They are about the diameter of an orange which is a little strange.  They do provide an unlimited supply of chips and salsa so that helps.  The burritos are large.  Everything seems very fresh and they don't use lard of other unhealthy additives.  They need to open one of these in L.A..  I would go there all the time.
