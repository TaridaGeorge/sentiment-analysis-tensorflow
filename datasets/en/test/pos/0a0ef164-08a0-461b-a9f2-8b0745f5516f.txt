Great place to go on a nice sunny Phoenix day.  Be sure to bring a Frisbee or football to throw around and have one of the delicious soups and sandwiches.  Most locals don't know about this place and I am OK with that since it already gets crowded to the point that I have never been able to walk in and get a seat at the Cafe.  You can easily spend an hour walking around the farm and discovering a bit of Phoenix history.
