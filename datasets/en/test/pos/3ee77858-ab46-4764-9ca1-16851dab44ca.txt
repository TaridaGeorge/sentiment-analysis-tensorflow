I live a mile away from Fujiya Market and didn't know it existed until today--thanks, yelp! The market is tucked away on the southeast corner of Priest and University (somewhat hidden by trees).

It's a small ethnic market, but I picked up some freshly-made California rolls ($3.30) and a box of Jasmine tea ($1.75). Delicious to go sushi at an affordable price! The tea is excellent, as well.

I would encourage everyone to stop by Fujiya Market and check out their selection of sushi, bento boxes, and other Japanese goods :) They rock!
