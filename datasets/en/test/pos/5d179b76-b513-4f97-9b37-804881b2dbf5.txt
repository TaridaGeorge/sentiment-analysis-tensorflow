I have been a long time customer of IKEA, but I had to write about Phillip and his outstanding service he gave me a couple of months ago.  It was a busy weekend, and I know he had his hands full.  He was eager to help me find what I needed, and he acted as though I was his first client of the day.  I really appreciate his willingness to actually walk me to the isle and look over the products that I was confused about.  He had a smile on his face and offered a helping hand.  Great service!  Thank you, Phillip.
