I live next door to this, so I see it almost everyday...

It is the nicest, best laid-out dog park that I have ever seen. I don't have a dog at the moment - if I did, I would be there on a regular basis (right now I borrow my friends dog for an occasional visit). The place really gets full (of people and dogs).

Right on the greenbelt, so lots of activities are nearby too...
