Cannot say enough good things about this place! My family and I have been coming here for years and still make the drive (from Mesa and San Tan) for special occasions. he food is great, the chef and staff are very friendly, and the atmosphere is clean and comfortable. The Pesto Pizza is my favorite - it's a must try! I also love that it's a local business and am proud to support that!
