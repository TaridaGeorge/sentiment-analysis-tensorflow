I go to this place for lunch at least 2-3 times per week. For lunch it is amazing. The service is great, the salsas are good and I still have not had anything that I did not like. They just changed the shrimp they use which is an excellent upgrade. The steak fajita burrito as simple as it sounds is perfect, the carnitas are amazing and the carne asada is excellent. They also have orange bang which is super old school but really enjoyable. 

Overall this is my favorite place to go for lunch. Fresh delicious food at a great price. 

I have only been once for breakfast and to be honest the burritos left a little to be desired and they also do not open until 8.
