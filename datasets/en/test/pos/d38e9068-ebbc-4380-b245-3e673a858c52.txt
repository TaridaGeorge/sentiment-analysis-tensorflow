Phu Thanh is one of the better and cheaper pho places to eat in Tempe/Mesa. 
 
THE GOOD:
Their food tastes good and it won't burn a whole in your wallet. 
They are quick with seating you, taking your order, and giving you food.  

THE BAD:
Don't expect for great service. The waiters are nice but will not come around to refill your water or give you a check in a timely manner. You have to ask for it.  

THE UGLY:
The whole restaurant is soo ugly. I was skeptical to go eat here at first because it looks like some dirty jailhouse. It's really old and it looks scary but you get used to it.
