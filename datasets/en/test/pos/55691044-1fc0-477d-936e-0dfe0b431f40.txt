These guys did a fantastic job sharpening my knives, maybe too good.  My sister and I had our knives sharpened while we waited. They are very reasonable and quick on our visit.  They did a great job fixing the dings and the broken tip on my knives. Now they are better than when they  were new.  I didn't have time to check our their knife selection on my last trip, but I will definitely check them out next time my knives are dull.  I highly recommend.
