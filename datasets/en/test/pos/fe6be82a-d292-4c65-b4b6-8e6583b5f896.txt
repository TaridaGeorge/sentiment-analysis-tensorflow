I like to stop here on my way home from work on Thursdays and stand at the end of the bar.  The bartenders, Therese and Luby, are fast and professional.  They don't just stand behind the bar watching sports like at some other places but actually interact with the customers.  The servers are always nice and say hi when passing by.  The happy hour food is good and free though I rarely am hungry when I stop by after work - just thirsty :)  I would recommend stopping by when you are in the area.
