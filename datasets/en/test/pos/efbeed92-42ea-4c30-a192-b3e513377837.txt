Do I really even need to review them. A dual level store with hundreds maybe even thousand of different types of accessories. Someone needs to keep me from fainting just talking about it. I love this store. It has good quality costume jewelry, reasonable price, organized, and I gray place to come Derek out those hard to find accessories  you have been lusting  for whatever current  fashion  magazine  you've  been  reading.
