Had to have dinner at our fav place last night.  Got a new waitress, Kay.  She was cheerful, very helpful (especially when my husband spilt tea all over me), and kept us happy.  My husband was downing so many splashberry drinks, she gave him a pitcher of it.  That made him super happy.

The food was really good and was served fast with big portions.  

We had fun!  Thank you again!
