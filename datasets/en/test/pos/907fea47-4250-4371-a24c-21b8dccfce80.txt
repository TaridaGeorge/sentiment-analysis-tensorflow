I have been going to Angel Sweet for a few years now and it has yet to disappoint.  They have the best gelato outside of Italy and today was no exception.  They always have the same basic flavors and then they add others on a daily basis.  I have been to other gelato places and they definitely do not compare.  Be sure to try the apple cinnamon...WOW!!
Pros:     The flavors are plentiful and amazing!
              The staff is very nice
              Open late
              They have a water cooler for free water

Cons:     I wish they were open 24/7  :)
