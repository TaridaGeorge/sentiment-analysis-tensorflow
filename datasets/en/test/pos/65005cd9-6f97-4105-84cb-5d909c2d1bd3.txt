As soon as you walk in the door you read a little piece of paper stuck to the counter that reads " Best Samosas in the USA" and I kid you not, the samosas are THAT good. All the chats are really good. I went there with a friend whom I met after years and between the two of us we ordered 11 items. We binged and hogged like crazy. Really good food.
