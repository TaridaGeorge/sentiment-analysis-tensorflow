I can not believe this business has not been Yelped already! Mary is great, truly changed my skin. Mary is very knowledgeable in every type of skin, and has some great products for your at home care as well. This studio is really cute, clean, and just the place you need to go to get your natural glow back.  Another great thing is that Skin Bliss is very intimate, when you walk in the door, the focus is all about pampaering you. Don't waste time, call Skin Bliss as soon as possible!
