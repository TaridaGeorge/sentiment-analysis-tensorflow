After reading an article a while back in the New Times on the top 10 valley meat shops I made it a mission to try all ten. Mission complete and can honestly say that Von Hanson's wins the award hands down for the best in the valley. Perhaps the best on the planet. I have since been back three times and live 40 miles away. The seasoned griller steaks are melt in your mouth AMAZING. And at 10.99 a pound they're a smoking deal. They have a decent selection of craft beers too. Now if they would just open up a north valley location life would be perfect.
