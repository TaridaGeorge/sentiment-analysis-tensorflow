If you have been shopping anywhere else for a bra - STOP this place is it. Service amazing - I was actually fitted and for the first time in my life - no shoulder pain! Had no idea my bras were hurting me before I found Belle Lacet. I made the mistake of trying to go to the big chain again, starts with a "V" - uhm lets just say they failed the test and were nowhere as good as Belle Lacet - I'm a forever Belle Lecet gal!
