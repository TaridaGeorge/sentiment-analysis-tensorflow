So cute and truly best cappuccino I have had in Phoenix.  I have recently been going different places to study and read, and Carmel's my favorite place to go. They have a super cute garden patio in the back.  For some reason when I am there, I feel like I am on vacation. Leisurely sipping my perfect cappuccino, nibbling on a breakfast pastry, reading outside on the garden patio. I want to go tomorrow !

 I can't wait to try more of the breakfast food there, as it looks super tasty. Always jealous of everyone's food when it comes out of the kitchen.  

Oh yes, and they have free wifi too and comfy stools at the counter seating.
