We had such a great night at this restaurant!  Yes, we were celebrating our son's engagement to a girl we love, but the experience here added to the excitement.  Chad, our waiter, was effecient, personable, knowledgable and professional.  His recommendations were right on (including the B & B in Templeton, CA!).  The food was so good we were thrilled we had chosen this place for this dinner and will definitely go back.
