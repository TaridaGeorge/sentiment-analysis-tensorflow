If you're not into waiting for 4 hours at the Phoenix  pizza hot spot (you know which one I mean) Patsy Grimaldi's will definitely satisfy any pizza lover.  

Portions are quite large so consider sharing. The salads are also excellent and don't get me started on the wine list... 

Love Patsy Grimaldi's :)
