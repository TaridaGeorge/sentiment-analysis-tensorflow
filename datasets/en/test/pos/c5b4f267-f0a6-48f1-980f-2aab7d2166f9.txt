These guys are the best. The staff is super-friendly. The atmosphere is comfortable. The selection is great - and if they're missing something you want, they'll do special orders at no additional cost. That said, it's not like the costs are much to begin with - I've gotten several beloved CDs there for under $10. They're always hosting free events like movies and concerts and art shows. They just installed a bunch of new listening stations, too. Also, they do a lot to help out programs at Broadmor Elementary, which is always a super-cool thing to do.

Steve (one of the owners) once told me he believed music made you spiritually wealthy. I believe that this totally captures the spirit of the place.
