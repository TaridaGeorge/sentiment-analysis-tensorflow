Stopped in here today joined by Mike C. for a first visit to this Cracker Barrel (& fourth visit ever to any).  This time I ordered Meat Loaf, with mashed potatoes & beef gravy, turnip greens, cole slaw, & one each of a biscuit & a cornbread muffin.

The serving sizes were excellent, the price low ($8.79), & every bite of this meal was SOOOOO good!!     :-))
