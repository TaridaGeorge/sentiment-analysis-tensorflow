The pool area was very nice.  Every chair had a towel on it ready for you.  The pool service was great.  Greg Badger is the most hard-working waiter there.  He was out in the sun in upper 90/lower 100 degree temperatures and was very helpful to all the guests.  I ate at Elements the other times I visited Arizona, but the poolside menu is great too! I preferred the orange chicken bento box.  Although edamame was not on the poolside menu, our waiter was able to get it for us.  That is great service!

The bed was very comfortable; nice and soft.  I also liked the wall-mounted, flatscreen LCD tv.The valet service was great as well.  We were greeted everytime we drove into the Sanctuary complex.  

The tennis courts were very nice as well.  I played during the morning and made use of their ball machine to warm up.
