Jeff (the manager) is a great guy who really knows his stuff. He is always more than happy to share his knowledge and take the time to ensure you get what you need, even if you didn't really know what that was when you went in.
Because the owners and staff are all riders themselves, the Helmet Center stores always have a great selection of gear and clothing, etc that people actually want and use, if you want something bike related and it is any good, you can pretty much bet you will find it at the Helmet Center - and if they don't happen to have what you want in stock , they will order it and get it within a couple of days for you.
