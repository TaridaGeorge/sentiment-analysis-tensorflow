gotta love an independent book store in a world of huge chains like Barnes and Noble.
they've always had a book i was looking for, and plenty of gift items for someone on your list. 
plus, they are ALWAYS hosting some author or event... i get press releases every other day about another event here. Local and national authors, big and small, from books on sex in your 60s to workshops on how to get your children's book published. they really have a sense of community, bringing people together, holding events that will truly benefit their customers, and 99% of the events are FREE.
plus, they're right by Trader Joe's and Wildflower, so it's a fun little pit stop before morning coffee or after a shopping trip.
