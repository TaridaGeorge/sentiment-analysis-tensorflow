My girlfriends and I had dinner there on a Friday night. Our table was not ready when we got there but we sat in the bar area and enjoyed one of their delicious specialty cocktails. 

We had excellent customer service both from the waitress and even the GM stopped by our table more than once to check on us. Both had excellent recommendations and everything we tried was delicious. Stick with the classic plates and you won't be disappointed.

I thought the pricing was on par with every good sushi place that I have been too. I even thought it was reasonable.
