I love this store.I went with my husband in June to pick up a clutch for our anniversary.We had a wonderful SA I feel horrible that I forgot his name.Having never been to this location he left his area at Chanel and escorted us downstairs I picked out an amazing YSL and Tory Burch.
         Unfortuanetly I had an emergency with my 4 yr old and had to go pick him up from daycare before I could buy them,when I went back a few days later he had put them aside for me and even helped me get a NM gift card to purchase my bags since they don't accept Visa.He also remembered why I had to leave the first time and asked how my son was doing.Im sorry if other people had a bad experience but mine was great!
