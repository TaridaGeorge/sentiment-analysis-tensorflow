I just started eating pho and have gone to over 8 in phoenix so far and it keeps getting better until this place.

The vegetarian pho is phenomenal..mushrooms, asparagus, baby corn oh its a sweet symphony of sweet, savory, tart, spicy and earthy!!! The broth is a perfect balance of delicate vegetables and herbs.  Spiced just right! The tofu was done to perfection, not too soft or chewy.

To finish the meal, my friend and I shared the creme brulee.  It was just crispy burnt enough to balance the creamy delightness.  It was topped with fresh mango and mint. The absolute best way to end the meal.

The service and atmosphere was exceptional, attentive and friendly.  Very hip and modern but inviting and down home.
