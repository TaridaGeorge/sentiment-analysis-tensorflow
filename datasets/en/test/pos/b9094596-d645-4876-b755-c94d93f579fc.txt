Never disappoints! Great food, fun atmosphere and wonderful service. Each time we have eaten at this particular site we have had the same server. He is always calm, polite, social, and very good at what he does. The food is always wonderfully prepared! Just so you know, you can order lunch sizes at dinner, which is always nice for people with smaller appetites. We were not aware of that until our last visit, so this is good to know. If you are ever at this location hope that Jason is your server.
