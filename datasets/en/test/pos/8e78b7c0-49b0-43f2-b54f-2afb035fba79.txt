My mom gets jealous when I tell her I'm going to Super Target.  See, she lives in Payson and only has *gulp* WalFart up there.
The parking lot is spacious and it's always easy to find a convenient spot to park in.
Walking in, I feel such a sense of calm.  The aisles are wide, there aren't a million screaming, dirty kids running around, and it's not loaded with the kiosks you'll find at WalWhiteTrashMart.
Prices are decent and there's always some sort of price cut, usually exactly what I need at the moment.
Grocery selection is great for a non-grocery place.  Could use help on the produce, though.
People are always friendly and it seems they enjoy working here.
What gives it 500 cool points????  The parking lot security guy.  On a Segway!!!!!!!  You won't find THAT at WalIAlwaysGetPinkeyeMart!
