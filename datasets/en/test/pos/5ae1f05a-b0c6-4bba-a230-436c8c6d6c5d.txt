So far, the best seafood restaurant we've been to in Phoenix.  Everything was excellent, from the menu, to the food quality and presentation, to the service.  Definitely a place to take someone to impress.  I've been there a half dozen times or so in the last couple of years, and never been dissappointed... okay, once, when I couldn't get a reservation when I wanted it.  If I didn't like trying new places, I would go back to this restaurant much more frequently.
