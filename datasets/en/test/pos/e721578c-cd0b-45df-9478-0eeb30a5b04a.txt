If you are going to have fast food, this is a great place to have it.  We typically have the #7 - Grilled Chicken sandwich with a side salad and it does the trick.  Food has always been good and employees are anxious to make your experience a good one.  If you have young kids...Tuesday evenings is family night, but in reality they make you feel that everyday is family day.  Wonderful place to enjoy a quick meal.
