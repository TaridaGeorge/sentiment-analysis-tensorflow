Amy did a great job with my haircut and style.  She is one of the master/senior stylists at Rolf's and it shows.  I have long, thin hair and she knew exactly what to do to give it more volume, and had some helpful tips on how to style it on my own.  I walked out of the salon feeling and looking like a million bucks ; ).  She is very personable and friendly too.  Highly recommend!
