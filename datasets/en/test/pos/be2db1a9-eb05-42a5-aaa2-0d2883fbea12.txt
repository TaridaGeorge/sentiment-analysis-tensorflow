Excellent beer and wine selection.  I love that you can buy a single bottle of beer - if you want to just try something out, you don't have to commit to a six-pack.  Great prepared foods section - I had a hard time choosing between a sandwich, soup, build-your-own salad, pizza, and sushi (just to name a few of your options.)  I opted for the sushi and was not disappointed.  Fresh fish made to order.  I'll definitely be returning!
