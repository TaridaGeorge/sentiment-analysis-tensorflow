I work at a restaurant and therefore I am painfully aware of what good service is. Dan gave it to myself and my friends from the minute we walked in the door. He was friendly, hospitable, and gave some of the best service I've had in a long time. Besides his great service, the food was incredible. The dirty chips were taste bud heaven and the chicken sandwich made me drool. If the food and service isn't enough, they give a discount to other people in the industry on Sunday nights. You can't beat RnR for a good time, delicious food, and wonderful service.
