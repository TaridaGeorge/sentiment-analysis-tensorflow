I love everything about Oregano's!  My first experience was in Flagstaff with a location being right off NAU's campus, and I was thrilled more started to open up in the valley.  There is one in Mesa, now, very close to me, and the ambiance remains the same.  I love the vintage decoration, the music, usually Ella Fitzgerald and other jazz icons, and the FOOD!  All the appetizers are amazing, especially the Boom Dip.  My favorite pizza is the O-Riva.  And passing up the Pizzookie (pizza cookie) is out of the question, get your friends to dive into this amazing desert.  Also the bellinis are outstanding!  Enjoy your experience here, you will fall in love! Have patience at the smaller locations, usually there will be a wait.
