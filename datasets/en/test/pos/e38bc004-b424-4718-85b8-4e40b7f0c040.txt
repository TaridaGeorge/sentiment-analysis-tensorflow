I love the sandwiches here, they serve fresh bread and meat that can't be beat!! Both Chicken and Beef cheese steak are superb and the Bobbie is in a league of it's own. I don't know how I lived on the other Sub chains before finding Capriotti's call in your order and give them about 15 mins and you will be eating shortly upon arrival.  The largest sandwich cost about 12.50 but at 20 inches two people can dine nicely, all I can say is bring your appetite and you won't be disappointed
