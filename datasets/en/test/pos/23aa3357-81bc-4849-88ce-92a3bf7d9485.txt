My sisters and brother are big fans of this place.  Everytime I come to PDX, I am taken here and have a blast.  Maybe it's the big redbull/vodka's served in plastic glasses, maybe it's the Wheel of Fear Factor they have, maybe it was the girl bouncing on a trampoline with no shirt on...who knows, but I always have a great time here.
