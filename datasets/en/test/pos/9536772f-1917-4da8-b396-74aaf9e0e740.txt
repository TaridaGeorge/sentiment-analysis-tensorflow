I just love this place!! 
We decided to escape the cold Chicago weather for a weekend in Phoenix, the sun was shining, weather was great! 
Arcadia Farms was a recommendation from our concierge at The Royal Palms. We had lunch in the back garden at Arcadia Farms. 
It was just lovely!! Everything about it! 
The service was so friendly, the food was delicious and the atmosphere was so peaceful! 
All of the food tasted so fresh, so good...I think our eyes were bigger than our stomachs, Everything on the menu looked so good...we wanted to experience it all! 
We started with the Crab and Avocado Tower and Savory Smoked Salmon Cheesecake - both were so delicious! The servings were large...we had to leave some left on the plates :-( 
Then we shared the wild mushroom, spinach and goat cheese tart, so good! 
We had dessert, fresh berries. 
Just Lovely!!
