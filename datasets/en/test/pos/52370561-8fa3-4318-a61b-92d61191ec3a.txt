I love everything about Elite Nails!  To begin with, the location is perfect for me (super close to home).  From the street/parking lot, it looks like you are waking in to a run-of-the-mill little nail shop, but it is actually open, spacious and modern looking.  Instruments are sterilized and individually packaged between each use and the place is immaculate.  The staff is always friendly and accommodating, and they go above and beyond to make sure you are happy with the results of the services you are receiving.  The prices are right on par with the other shops in the area, but the level of service and quality of products used are far superior.  I have to agree with the others...without a doubt, best pedi I have EVER had!
