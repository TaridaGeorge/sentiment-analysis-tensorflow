Stopped in after the Dbacks shellacked the Rockies last night (12-3) and celebrated with a toffee banofi. It was totally awesome. We had seen it featured on the Best Thing I Ever Ate and wanted to try it since it was in our state! My husband had scoops of salted caramel, peanut butter and vanilla. He enjoyed all of them. We'll be going back again and again...loved it and can't wait to try more things.
