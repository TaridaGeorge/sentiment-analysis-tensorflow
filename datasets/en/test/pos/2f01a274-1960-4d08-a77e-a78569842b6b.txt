Cork is one-of-a-kind for this side of town.  They are creatively serving small plates with usually mind-blowing combinations.  Their food is usually sourced locally and they use both creative/unusual meats as well as traditional meats for their proteins.  Small plate sizes let you try more! Their service is top notch, they have a great happy hour and a very large wine selection that they're happy to help you with if needed.  I have no complaints about Cork except I wish they were a little bit closer to my neighborhood (Ahwatukee).
