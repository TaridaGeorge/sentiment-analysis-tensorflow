I would reccomend this dance studio to any parent.  The teachers are great.  They're fun and full of energy.  My daughter started dancing here when she was 4 years old, and her teacher Kim, has really helped her develop a love for ballet.  My daughter has been taking classes there for 4 years and I can't complain about a single class she's been in.   Most of the teachers grew up dancing in the studio so there is a real family atmosphere.  5 Stars!
