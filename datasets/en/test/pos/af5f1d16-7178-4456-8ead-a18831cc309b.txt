What can I say? I first heard about it on Facebook. So when I saw it in Denver I had to try it. I've loved everything I've tried with the exception of their fried pickles. Too salty. But I have been a fan ever since and I tell everyone who isn't tired of hearing me yet how great their burgers are. I even like the chicken sandwiches. I've been to three different locations and the service has always been so top notch they must treat their employees really well.
