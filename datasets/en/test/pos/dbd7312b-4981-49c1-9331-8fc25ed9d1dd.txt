The decor was pretty cool (very Scottsdale).  Food was excellent - braised short rib pasta = superb.  Corn pasta dish was very good.  Biggest surprise was the service.  The wait for food was somewhat long - 30 min or so, but they repeatedly apologized and gave us free carrot cake for the wait.  Service industry in Scottsdale has come a long way.  If you are in the area, you must stop in here.
