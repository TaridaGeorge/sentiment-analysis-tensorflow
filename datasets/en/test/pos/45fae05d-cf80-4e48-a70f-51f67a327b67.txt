This is a GREAT bike shop.  My son has decided he loves to bike and so we went to 3 bike shops before finding this gem.  Nice prices for an entry level biker (or a bike collector, great vitage bikes, or a serious biker might find something, but since we are new at this, well...that's all I can review). 

The guy that worked there (not the owner) was sooo nice! He worked with my son on how to change gears and he hooked us up with a new seat.  After a weekend of more biking than I have done in 10 years, I am going to head back and get my son's bike fixed (he crashed), look into a bike helmut and a new bike for the hubby! :-)

I really liked this place!
