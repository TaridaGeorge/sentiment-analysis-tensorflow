I am such a regular that when I walk in my glass of wine is waiting for me..I know all the staff by their first name and talk toRob the best chef  ever about what he is cooking what is specail that day. Both mangers Tracey and Hector  have become my friends and go out of their way to take care of me and my business and personal buddies. I walk into the "TAV' and I feel like I am in the bar in "Cheers"" where everybody knows your name".
