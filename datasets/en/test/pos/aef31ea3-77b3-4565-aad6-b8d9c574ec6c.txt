I brought my young son here and had a great dinner.  I usually order a  chicken pita at the Shea location, but I asked the waitress for another idea and so I ordered what she suggested.  It was something I never would have tried on my own, and it was fantastic.  I really enjoyed my meal here and appreciated the super friendly staff.  I'll be back soon!
