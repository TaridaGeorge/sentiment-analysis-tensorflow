The prices here cant be beat. And the Ambiance was great as well. Friendly servers light music was playing. Great portions at dinner time, and I'm sure on lunch its a deal too. Some places have tight parking lots but not here. I managed to pack it in and I will be a regular here when i need a Thai Fix.
