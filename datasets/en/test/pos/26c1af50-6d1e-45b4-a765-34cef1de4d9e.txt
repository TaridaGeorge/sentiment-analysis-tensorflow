A yummy lunch for $5? Heck yea! I've got to give My Big Fat Greek Restaurant props for their "order at the counter" version! They have a lunch special from 11-3 for a gyro plus salad or fries.  It may just be in the summer... I don't know, but it's a good deal.  Good size portion and healthy too! Can't beat that! Express restaurant gets an express five star rating.
