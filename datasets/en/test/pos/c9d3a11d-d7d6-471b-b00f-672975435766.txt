Water water everywhere, in the middle of the desert!   Very few holes on this 27 hole course don't have water involved with your shot!  You know that you're in a very Arid place and the contrast with all the water around is pretty cool.   It's target golf, but instead of avoiding the desert, you're avoiding water.  pretty holes abound.  I give it five stars for being unique.   As far as the food and resort are concerned I don't know, never ate here or stayed here.  Played here many times and it's always been fun and/or completely frustrating.
