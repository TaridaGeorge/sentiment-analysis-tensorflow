This place definitely gets 5 stars. Defalco's has the best cheesesteak you can get in the desert. I have yet to have one that compares. Unfortunately I now live 30 minutes from Defalco's, so I can no longer visit as often as I like.

The only real downside to this place is the wait-- if it's busy, you're gonna wait at least 20 minutes.
