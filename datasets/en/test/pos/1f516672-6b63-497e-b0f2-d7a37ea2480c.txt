By far my favorite steak house in the state. Also my favorite lunch meeting spot. I really enjoy the JUMBO shrimp cocktail, and the great "atomic" horse radish. Follow that up with the open faced Fillet sandwich cooked to your liking, and you will have a great experience!

Don't forget to say hi to Chef Ken and Harlen the kitchen when you get there.
