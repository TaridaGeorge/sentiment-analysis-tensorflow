Really good place if you are looking for something different and are going with people who want the same old thing. They have the classics like spaghetti and meatballs and some creative dishes. I got a pasta with prosciutto and Brussels sprouts and it was really good. 

Make sure you get there early cause it's kinda small dining area and fills up fast, but worth the wait.
