Wow! The Main Ingredient is as good as it gets for it's niche. Getting a fantastic, fresh caprese sandwich - delicious, salty genoa salami, homemade pesto, juicy organic tomato, home grown basil, a thick slice of mozzarella on a baguette - plus a great draught beer (the Sonoran Inebriator Stout) all for $10...you really can not beat that. I am definitely looking forward to returning to try more of their sandwiches and the beers.
