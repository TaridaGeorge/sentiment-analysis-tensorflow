Looking for the best Chinese food in the valley? Do you want to experiance great customer service attention to detail?  This is the place!!!!  Hands down on a scale of 1-10 everytime I go it's an 11!!!!
I've had a chance to sample most of the menu and can't find one fault.  This is a hands on owner run restaurant and it's safe to say it will be around for a long time.
