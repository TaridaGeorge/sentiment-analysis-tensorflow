The perfect place for Date Night! 

The Tuck Shop was featured on Planet Green's Best Food Ever series for its meatloaf. My husband and I went on a Tuesday night, but unfortunately they only serve the meatloaf on Thursday. Fortunately, the menu has many other delicious options. We started with the Roasted Beets and Times Mac and Cheese. Both were delicious! 

I had the Chicken and Waffles, and my husband had the Pine AZ Skirt Steak for dinner. My chicken was juicy and well seasoned, and the waffles were clearly made from scratch. Yummy! My husband's steak was cooked perfectly, and served with tasty mashed potatoes and mushrooms. 

They have awesome drink specials on Tuesday and Thursday, so we will be definitely be back another week to try the meatloaf!
