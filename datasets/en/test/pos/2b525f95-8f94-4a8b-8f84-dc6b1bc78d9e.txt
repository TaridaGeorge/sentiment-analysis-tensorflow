Oh my Jesus, this place...if you have not been, GO! You will not be disappointed. I crave this place, it's THAT good. Their chicken gyros, are amaz-zzzing. Baklava? Homemade delicious sweetness. And their Greek salad is exactly how a Greek salad should be. I can't stop taking everyone I know here...
