Well, I think Philthy Phil's closed up. I heard a few things from the rumor mill. One was the owner had some personal problems and the bar had to go. The other was that a bad fight broke out (seems more likely). Unfortunately, I found out the hard way when I drove out on a Friday night and the place was empty. This dive/club had some great DJs on the weekends but I guess it wasn't meant to be.

It's odd that it closed as the New Times did an interview there about a month ago.
