I stopped in here on my way back up to Flagstaff. My doggie needed a bathroom break and I desperately needed a coffee. I pulled in not knowing what to expect but was delighted with the outcome. I ordered a Java Chip frappe and a banana loaf, both of which were delicious. The staff wasn't overly friendly but not rude. And I always appreciate a place with a clean bathroom.
