When I lived in Scottsdale I loved dining here.  It can be pricey put the food is worth every penny.  Best Souffle and french pressed coffee I have ever had.  The entrees are small but rich in flavor where you savor every bite.  Definitely a must if visiting Scottsdale.  You will never guess you are in the middle of the desert if you're sitting out in the quaint patio with the romantic lighting in the evenings.  It will transport you to Paris France with the ambiance, service and of course the food!
