I eat here so much I'm actually embaressed! This place is amazing, I never liked any form of asian food before I ate here, I always order the same thing..sesame chicken with white rice and crab puffs. I like how tiny the restaurant is and the fact that it is family owned. The owners are so sweet, there is never a wait either. They have really good lunch specials and the food is always fresh.
