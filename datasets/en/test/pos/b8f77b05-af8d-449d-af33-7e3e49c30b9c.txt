Well read the other reviews of this bank. They are not good. However, i have always had a very good experiance here. True they are spread out,not too close to where i live or work. However, you can do a lot on line.  I have been in here several times and always had good customer service. Maybe i am lucky i never had to deal with Mrs. Torres.....They at this time will give you a $100.00 if you open an acct. very much like Chase.   I have referred 2 people and they have been happy with there change. Look into them and give them a try, maybe you too will like it.
