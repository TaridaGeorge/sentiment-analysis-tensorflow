First time i have ever been here. I came because, i had a coupon i got a mani and pedi for only $28.00 . Can't beat that in any way. They are very clean everything is sterile. I always pay attention to this.     I got black and silver for Halloween. The lady took a little longer than usual but, she did a wonderful job and gave me a great leg massage even with hot stones.   They open at 9:30am which is fantastic! because we are all so busy.  Lots of parking in the lot. I will be back.
