This place is a hidden treasure!
It doesnt look like much from outside but the inside is very cute.I was in Thailand last summer and the food in here tastes just like the ones in Thailand.
The most expensive food in the menu is 11.50$ and they have great selection for 7-8$
I know I will be there soon again!
