I really Love this place!
I stopped in for lunch and tried a couple new things. 

The Ravioli di Zucca Appetizer (see pics) which is:
roasted butternut squash ravioli with parmesan, brown butter,
sage and crumbled amaretti...OMG it was just delicious but a perfect appetizer to share , it's available in two sizes I got the small one.
The sweetness from the crumbled amaretti is a very nice touch.

I ordered the Healthy Fish again (see pics) and once again it was perfect!

My guest ordered the Penne Salsiccia (see pics) which had Italian sausage, caramelized onions and pecorino cheese! The sausage was really good and for just $5 you can't beat that!
