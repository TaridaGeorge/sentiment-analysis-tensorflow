My husband finally did good. He suggested that we try Alessia's and it was excellent!  Very good service, nice hot bread, and a great wine selection. I had the special (which I could say in Italian because it was beautiful) which was a stewed pulled pork dish and served in the both with broad egg noodles. I was not disappointed!! Hubbie has the lobster ravioli which he also really enjoyed.  Servers were friendly and attentive. We will return!  Yum!
