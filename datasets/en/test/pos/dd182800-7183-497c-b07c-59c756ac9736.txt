What can i say about this spot...I love it, have seen some of the best rockabilly there is! And some kick ass blues along the way. This is defiantly a good date takin place, because the music is always lusty and makes you wanna grind on someone in a slow good not slutty way! and if you are single there are always a boatload of pretty people to look at... this reminds me of going back in time whenever i can go see a good show here...
