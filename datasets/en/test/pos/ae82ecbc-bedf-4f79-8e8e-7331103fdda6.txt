Great restaurant and now they have a satellite location at the airport! Awesome staff and service that is very friendly and helpful. Food is very flavorful and fresh. Ingredients are top notch and it is definitely reflected in the food. I love that the airport now has a great food option instead of the normal fast food garbage!
