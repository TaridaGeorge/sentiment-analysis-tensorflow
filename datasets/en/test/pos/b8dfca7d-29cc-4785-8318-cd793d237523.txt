Wonderful place with lots of atmosphere inside and out. Lovingly decorated and the food was delicious. You stop outside the door for the menu, I think it is what the Chef feels like making that day. I had a great tomato soup with grilled cheese bread  - and the Chef even asked me if I liked the burned ends of the bread, how did he know?????  - and for desert pumpkin bread with baked pear and what I believe was a cranberry puree  - it was fantastic. The food is made with great care right in front of you - so do bring some time to enjoy. An absolute do again. Come early and it is cash only.
