you cannot go wrong at zia. brought hubs there because he's huge on old school punk and so i knew he would be able to find some gems at zia.  good for zia, bad for our bank account-we left there $200 bucks lighter, and that's even with the awesome guy at the counter telling us about some reward program where you get points and it helps you get cds half off or whatever (the guy figured it out for us cuz he was AWESOME).  we got like 23 cds or something tho, so obviously it was a good deal oh, i got two of my friends some gifts from there too-zia is a good place for random fun gifts. we had to buy 2 cds new ( i HAD to replace my mudvayne cd for the ride back to cali!) and it was cool they had those in stock.
