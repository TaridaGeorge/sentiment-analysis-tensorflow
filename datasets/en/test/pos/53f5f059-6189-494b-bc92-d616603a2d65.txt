Always good, and definitely filling for even the most bottomless of stomachs. The owner knows exactly what we want in a pasty...lamb vindaloo? Yes! Rosemary chicken? Please! Hamburger, cheese, and grilled onions? Oh my...I think I'm in pasty heaven!

Other plusses: delicious British brews on tap, big-big salads, and hooks for your backpack or purse at the bar. The lighting is forgiving if you've just had a typical ASU night...and if it's been a little too typical, you can take your pasty home, with handy heating instructions from the friendly pasty people.
