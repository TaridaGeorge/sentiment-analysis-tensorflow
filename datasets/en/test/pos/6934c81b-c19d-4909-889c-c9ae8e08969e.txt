Well, I've been to 3 other Pita Jungles (North Phoenix, Scottsdale & San Diego), so visiting the Glendale location was bound to happen.  Went there for lunch today - it's by far the SMALLEST location, but as ususal, the food was wonderful, service was great.  

I ordered the spicy chicken pita wrap while there, and a large cilantro jalapeno hummus w/pita to-go.  Those wraps are so darn BIG - I ate the second half for dinner.  

Again, smaller location, but great service, huge portions.  So far, the San Diego location is the biggest by far.  I'm really a fan of this wonderful menu.  Don't know how they make everything, including veggies, taste so good!!!
