I love Orange Table. I've gone to lunch and dinner here, but all my friends rave about the breakfast/brunch! It's a great biking destination-they are bike and dog-friendly, as far as I can tell. I love the classic chicken sandwich...it is not on the menu, but if you ask for it by name you will get a yummy sandwich on tasty bread with lettuce, tomato, onion and lettuce; a very simple sandwich. I had a side salad for lunch today, and I can't remember the name of the yummy dressing I had...it was ranch-based. We have always had great service when dining here, and I even got offered a to-go drink! Sit outside on the patio and enjoy the nice weather!
