Copenhagen was a great find. Even though we have seen it about 100 times driving up and down Camelback. Best selection of sofas we have seen to date. Great selection of contemporary classics and Natuzzi.

They also have a more affordable section called Denmark. We finally found our sofa and chair! Great price and the service was the perfect combination of helpful and respectful of our space. 

We will shop here first for all of our home furnishings!
