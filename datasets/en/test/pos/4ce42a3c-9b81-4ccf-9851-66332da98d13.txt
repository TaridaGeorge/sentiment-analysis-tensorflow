Actually have been coming in here everyday for a week for an early morning breakfast within walking distance from my hotel room. The staff (Dobson location) is great and the food has been consistently good. My standard has been the light, 'traditional' breakfast of scrambled eggs and bacon with vegetable soup and tomato slices (or sub in avocado) for $9, which I broke for a daily special one day: Cheesy eggs, mushrooms, tomato and bacon in a skillet with accompanying sides for about $11... Very delicious!
