From their chicken sandwiches, to their onion rings, to the cement mixers, to their super sanitary lid dispensers, I'm a huge fan of Culver's!

The quality is above and beyond what you would get from any other "burger joint" i.e. McDonalds, Burger King, etc.  You'll wait a little longer but the quality is WAY WORTH IT!
