Arizona Golf Works is a great locally owned golf store that can assist you with everything you need. It's run by a bunch of old golfers who know their stuff. They do repairs, re-grips, buy/sell used clubs, as well as sell new clubs. Their service is great and they don't make you feel dumb if you're a beginner or not great at golf. They are there to help you and hopefully get you to enjoy the game they love so much.
