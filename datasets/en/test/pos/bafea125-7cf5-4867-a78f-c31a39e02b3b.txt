Everything was a wonderful experience from the valet that received my car to the ice cream lady at Churn. Service was friendly, prompt and professional.

The atmosphere was warm and inviting and it just has a great vibe. 

Now to top it all off the Reuben was the best that I have ever had. Kind of funny when you think about it. How good or classy can a Reuben be? This Rueben takes you beyond the typical greasy low quality experience. The pastrami is some of the best that I have ever tasted, The sandwich was elequently done. 

I would highly recommend this place for a lunch with really good friends. It just adds to the experience of being with the ones that you love.
