I could eat this 3 times a week and never get tired of it. The most amazing Chicken Feta Salad... ever!! Large portions and they do not hold back on the feta! The staff is frendly and amazing, the food is great. I love this place! How could I forget the pita bread... mmmmmmmmmm! This location is my favorite, but is pretty small. Go early and be patient. It is definitely worth it!
