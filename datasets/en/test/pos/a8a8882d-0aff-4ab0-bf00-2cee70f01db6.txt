We can't get enough of Los Sombreros amazing food and the patio atmosphere is perfect 80% of the year.  You truly won't find anywhere else like it in Scottsdale.   We've brought along our toddler the last few times as we couldn't resist the enticement of Pollo con espinaca and they have been very accomodating.
