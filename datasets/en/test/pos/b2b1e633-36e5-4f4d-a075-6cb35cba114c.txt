Have purchased several games from this location over the last year, and their staff is terrific. Sometimes at these kinds of places, the persons behind the counter are very arrogant and rude to the non-hardcore gamer. I have had no such problems from them, and will buy more games from them in the future. Prices are competitive and they give you fair trade-in value for your stuff (relative).
