Yesterday was my second visit here and it was great.  The patio is beautiful and is a great place to relax with friends and a cocktail.  My dirty martini was fantastic and the waitress even put it in a new frosty class halfway through.  Classy!  The menu is the same as Houston's except for a few sushi rolls.  I've always enjoyed Houston's and this is no exception.  The sushi rolls are tasty too.  The patio only offers sushi, appetizers and dessert.  The hot fudge sundae is the best in town.  It's a house made hot fudge that isn't actually hot and therefore doesn't turn your ice cream into soup 4 bites in.  Genius!
