My friends and I love the food at Royal Thai Grill. We are Thai so we know how good Thai food should be. The owners are very friendly. The price is very reasonable. I have been there at least 10 times now and never been disappointed. I'm so happy I found this place, my favorite Thai restaurant ever.
