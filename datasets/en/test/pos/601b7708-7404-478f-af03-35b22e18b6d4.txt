So glad to have experienced The House at Secret Garden. How have I not made the journey to this place before? Awesome location, great ambiance, amazing service, and fabulous food. Well worth the drive from North Phoenix. I would highly recommend this restaurant. Was here for the first time because of Phoenix Restaurant week. Check it out. :)
