Dined here on Thanksgiving 2011 but sat on the bar side as they were fully booked.  I had the lamb and it was fabulous, as always.  They marinate it overnight and it really makes it something special.  On their website, they have a picture for each entree and the lamb chops arrive to the table looking just like the picture.  My husband had the rib eye and it was a very healthy portion and was cooked to perfection.  And their mushrooms - please, if you love mushrooms, you won't believe how good they are.  I wish I knew their secret.
