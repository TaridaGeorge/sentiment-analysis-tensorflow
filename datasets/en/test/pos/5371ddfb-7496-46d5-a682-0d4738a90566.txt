Took my 5 year old and 1 year old to Pump It Up on Friday.  The guys (Jon and Chris) who were keeping order are probably the best kids I've ever encountered!  Not only are they totally on top of any possible danger situation, they have made it a point to keep my 1 year old safe with all the other older kids running around.   Way to go Pump it Up for hiring some great staff!!!  Love it and will def. be back - especially with your open bounce passes!
