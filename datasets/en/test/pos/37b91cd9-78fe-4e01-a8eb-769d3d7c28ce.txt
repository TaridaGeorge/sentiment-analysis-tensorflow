Ok, so of course I want to be as granola as the next yuppie type, but I gotta be totally straight...I come to Trader Joe's for the wine. 

This is my stop for wine. Period. Occasionally I will be distracted by good hummus, or decently priced produce or flowers, but really, for me it's all about the fact that I can find at least half a dozen great red wines for under 6 bucks. As a daily wine person, that's huge. 

Also, the Big Day White with a picture of a walking pancake on it is the best white I have had in quite a while. I even bought a bottle of it for my mom, who is a white zin kinda girl and she was impressed too.
