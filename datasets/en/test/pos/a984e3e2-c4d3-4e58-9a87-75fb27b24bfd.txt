Ths place is fantastic.  We eat out about 5 times a week.  We go for the breakfast so I can't say about lunch.  The hostesses' are always smiling and friendly.  The waitstaff are prompt to your table and listen to what you order.  The Veggie hash is fantastic, I get it almost everytiime we go.  It has sweet potatoes, potatoes, corn, and brussel sprouts topped with 2 eggs any style.  Pancakes are also a great choice.  Coffee is hot, deliscious and your cup is never left empty. They make their ownl freshly squeezed orange juice.The place is always spotless.  The wait is well worth it.
