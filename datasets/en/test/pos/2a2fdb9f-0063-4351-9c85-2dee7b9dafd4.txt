I have been dry cleaning my stuff at Thomas Cleaner's since I moved to Phoenix in 1997 and cannot imagine to get it done elsewhere. Not only is their service everything you expect from your dry cleaner, but your business is truly appreciated there. 

If you are interested in Greek Mythology and Greek History, just swing by, drop of your clothes and George will give you "Everything Greek 101".
