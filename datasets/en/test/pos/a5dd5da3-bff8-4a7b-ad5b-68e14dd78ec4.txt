Tasty food, best hummus ever, great service, modern deco (but a bit loud of an atmosphere) and great value! 

Hubby and I ordered:
Steak and hummus trio (u can pick any three off the menu) - I really like the plain hummus (had a yummy smokey flavor) and roasted bell pepper. 
Kafta pizza - thin crust and generous w the meat topping
Shawarma pita - most popularly ordered item. Juicy chicken breast!

Bill came out to $28 and we had leftovers due to the large portions!
