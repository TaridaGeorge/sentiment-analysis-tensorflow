Do the tasting menu for the best experience paired with the wine or Sake tasting.

No matter what you have to have the butterfish or beef tataki. The best food items on the planet. 

Also if you are not sure on what to order allow the staff to pick a entire menu for you. I have done this and it works very well with large groups. (Its kinda the only thing that works)

The lounge area is a great place for a date, the watermelon martini is killer,(thats not the right name but just say that they know what you mean:)
