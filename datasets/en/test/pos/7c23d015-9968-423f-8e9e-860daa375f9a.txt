This place definitely has their dishes down. The food tastes great and spot on with what your expectations. The interior is very traditional but it gives it a cozy feeling. The waiters/waitresses are nice and the service is great. 

I usually get the Pad See Ew or Pad Kemao and have nothing to complain about in terms of taste. The deep-fried banana and coconut ice cream tastes as it should, although it is not the best I have tried.

The only downside is that I've had better food for the same price.
