Awesome place.

I am pretty sure that this is my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale. 
Honeycomb, radishes, and a huge heap of rainbow valley butter for an appetizer? what?! Whaat? I had to take a picture of it. The waitress gave me a hard time about this, but she was cool :p

My coworkers and I went on a mission to try everything here. I do remember the brussel sprouts being too salty. but everything else was great. spicy broccoli...
fat-fat cooked potatoes....
perfectly grilled ribeeyeeeee.. .yummm..

but i dooo remember the brussel sprouts being a bit too salty for me.. but i forgave them for this. 

In addition to the great food, it's a cute little restaurant with a lot of character. The servers (who are also your bartenders - i thought this was a bit interesting) are really friendly. 

Good memories here!
