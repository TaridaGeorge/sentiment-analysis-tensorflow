This is the best frozen yogurt I have ever had. So many flavors and toppings to choose from, it's heaven. It's so cold and really cools you off after walking around Mill Ave. I was introduced to Red Mango while in Washington DC and absoloutely love it. I was ecstatic to find we had one in Tempe, AZ. Since I was craving Red Mango today, my friend and I headed over to Mill Ave to try the AZ version of Red Mango. Everything was great! Clean store, friendly staff and plentiful choices of toppings. However, the fruit pieces are WAY too big for your cup. Smaller pieces would be easier to eat and more joyful to have a small taste in more bites. Maybe they could work on that, but it was still great!
