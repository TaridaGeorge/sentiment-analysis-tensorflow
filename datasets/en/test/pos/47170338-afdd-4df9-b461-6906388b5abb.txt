I had a hard time choosing between Citizen Public House or the Mission for my one dinner while vacationing in Scottsdale.  I am so glad we chose here.  From the martinis, the appetizers (pastrami pork belly is really that good!; bacon popcorn yum). the entrees (one of the best duck I have tasted and perfectly cooked), and the service, I highly recommend this place.  

The only downside is that it is really loud and you need to talk in a raised voice (need to put some noise reducing elements in the interior). 

Good times!
