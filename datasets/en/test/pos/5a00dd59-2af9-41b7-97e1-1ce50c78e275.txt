Looks like 3rd time is a charm! The food was Amazing esp the fry's and the pork! Awesome service and I'm willing to chalk my other two visits up to just bad luck based on the individual server. I will be going back again but next time I think I'll try the lunch portion like I had been getting because they give you a lot of food on the reg. menu or whatever it's called.
