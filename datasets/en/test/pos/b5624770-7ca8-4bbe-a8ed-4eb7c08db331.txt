If you wear prescription glasses you need to go buy them here. It is $29 for regular glasses, including lenses, frames, tax, etc, etc. Prescription sunglasses are $59. Your jaw should be hitting the ground. 

The selection is wonderful. The staff is kind, patient and super committed to making you happy. If you want your glasses sooner they charge $12 for a rush order. No exams, just glasses. 

Last time I was in town me and 2 of my friends spent close to 2 hours trying on every single pair of frames they had in stock. We all had tons of fun and were hardpressed to pick only one pair each. 

Thanks Lesco for being so awesome!!!
