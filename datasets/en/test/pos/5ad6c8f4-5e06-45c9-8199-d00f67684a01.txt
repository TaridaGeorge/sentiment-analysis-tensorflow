This was my first time at a Fry's and I really loved it. This one had patio furniture and all kinds of things, kinda reminded me of Target on one side and the full grocery on the other. The cashier who checked me out was super nice, generous and polite. I had a coupon for a product which I wasn't able to use and she still gave me the dollar savings! Also when I was a few cents short of the payment (cause I didn't want to break a bigger bill) she let that slide too. I wish I remembered her name, cause she was awesome!
