I love, love this restaurant.  It is charming and relaxing.  I love the fresh. locally grown ingredients.  The service has always been good.  Yes, it is a little expensive.  I think what people sometimes miss is that growing your own produce is much more costly than one may think, particularly when it is organic.  I hope one day to try everything on the menu.  I am about half way there.
