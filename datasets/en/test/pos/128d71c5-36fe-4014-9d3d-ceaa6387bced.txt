Best. Burgers. Ever.      Really yummy, delicious burgers.     I'm a huge burger lover and this place has a great variety of burgers that always hit the spot.    The appearance of the restaurant is extremely appealing, the service is top-notch, and the food, burgers or otherwise, never disappoints, the appetizers are stellar and this place has probably the best Happy Hour in all of Scottsdale.     Comfy seating, nice scenery, great food, what more do you want?
