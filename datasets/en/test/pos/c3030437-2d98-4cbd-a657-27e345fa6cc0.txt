I eat at Hana's probably two or three times a week.  I absolutely love their chicken meal.  Its grilled chicken, rice, pita, and a small salad for about 9 dollars.  I also love their grilled chicken sandwhich.  It's more of a philly sandwhich type thing but sooo good. You will not be dissapointed.

P.S. I just scarfed the Hana's Mixed Greens salad.  Even though there wasn't really a mixture of greens really,  it was soooo good. Almonds, parmasean, marinated kabob chicken, onion, tomato, cucumber, and lots of cabbage. Yum.
