The first time I came here I was dissapointed.  I thought it was too hoity, too pretend fancy.  I've subsequently been here at least ten other times and have been so taken with the food that I think this is the best place to come when I want a relaxed deconstructed meal.  The flavors are all there, but the presentation and use of ingrediants is always surprising and a delight.  Everything from the bread to the dessert is amazing.  I will say that you'll have to spend a bit, but it is worth every penny.  The restaurant is airy on the inside, even though it is in the same parking lot as a Safeway next to a nail shop.  But once inside, you'll think you are in a restaurant in California, like a mini vacation!
