Friendly service, good coffee and iced tea, and a great selection of hot teas, along with a cool ambiance and a welcoming environment--what more could you want? I haven't had a chance to try their pastries, but they look very good, and they have a nice variety of instant oatmeals. Try their tropical iced tea and their spicy cinnamon black tea. Both are excellent.
