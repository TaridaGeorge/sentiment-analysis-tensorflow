This was recommended by my friend Kristin - who is an overall pet lover who has the happiest pets that I know of!....so naturally I had to check it out!
They have a great selection of everything overall and of course for an pet boutique - the latest in all of the hot trends for pets. What I enjoyed is that they carry some specialty brands of shampoo that are organic and great for sensitive skin. They were very helpful in pointing out so many things to me since I was a new pet owner and needed some attention and remedial dialogue.
Of Max was in heaven at this shop - all of the doggie treats and goodies are at eyeball level - so he ate hi way through the store and will never forget it!!
