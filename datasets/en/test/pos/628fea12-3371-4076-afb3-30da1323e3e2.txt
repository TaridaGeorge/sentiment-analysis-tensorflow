As a native Phoenician, ever since I was little we started going to the Manuel's on Cave Creek Road and then when we learned about this location we have started coming here more often (only because of proximity).  Both restaurants are equally amazing, the service is always great and the food is delicious!  By far my favorite Mexican restaurant in the valley!  My immediate family (with marriages & kids) is now at 21 people and they always do a great job of accommodating such a large group, with young kids, and the prices are great.  

Would highly recommend Manuel's to anyone looking for great Mexican Food in a casual atmosphere!!
