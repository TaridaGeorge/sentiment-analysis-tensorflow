Outstanding in every respect - Food, service, patio, perfect size portions.

I visited Autostrada on a recent Saturday and find it to be a breath of fresh air. The parmesan scrambled eggs with artichokes are to die for and so are the bacon, the bread, the marmalade and the lattes. 

Aaron May's architect did an extraordinary job at rebuilding the interior and patio, formerly housed by Hava Java and Market Street Coffee. The tables are made of wood and the ambiance is reminiscent of a contemporary Italian bar where you can grab a small serving of delicious pasta, panini or a latte.

With the arrival of Autostrada, neighboring Heirloom and the recently opened Banzai Cowboy restaurant, the DC Ranch marketplace is finally experiencing a long awaited and overdue revival.
