I have seen this old looking spot as long as I have lived here. Drive by it almost every day. Finally we go in. Unfortunately they didnt have what I have been craving for the last 2 weeks, and after going out for breakfast too darn often for the last couple weeks not much is impressing me anymore. Until today. yes the place looks dated, but it was clean. The wait staff was very attentive & efficient. This food was GOOD. Very good. & my friend, swears we a re going back again. The pancakes were unlike any other either of us have had. I love finding these little treasures of places.
