I had to get the power line mast moved due to the power line being on the roof.  Tony was honest and competitive with his pricing.( I got three quotes). I picked All Valley Electric because I felt comfortable with Tony and what he proposed to get everything corrected. The only hold up in my project was waiting for SRP...but that was expected.  Tony and his team did a fantastic job and I would definitely use them again. Also, they were on time which is always a plus. I would definitely recommend All Valley Electric for any electrical work.
