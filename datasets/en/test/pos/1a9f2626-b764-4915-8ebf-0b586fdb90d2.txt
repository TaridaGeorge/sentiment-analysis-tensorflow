Ok, this place has THE BEST coffee I have ever tasted.  Bottom Line.  I didn't get the "everyone is required to wear skinny jeans" vibe that a previous reviewer stated, so I would definitely give this place a try before writing it off.  If you love coffee, this place is not to be missed.  And I am not talking about the "Venti Chocolate Chip Frap" type of coffee.  If you like drinks like that then this place is not for you, but if you love the idea of each cup of coffee being made specifically for each customer and supporting an establishment that is truly passionate about their product, than check this place out.
