So the time for an Oil Change finallllly came and as predicted, to Firestone I went.  

Called the night before and set up a Friday am appointment to drop my car off before work and grab it at lunch, they were super accommodating... the tech on the phone even answered my questions about current specials!  When I dropped the Edge off in the am it was a bit busy in the large lobby, but they did a great job of handling the line and servicing customers with an appointment (ahheeemm) right on schedule.

The only snafu happened when I walked in to pick up my car and I realized I had left my debit card on my desk at work.  Drat.  Once again, they were understanding and I was back on schedule shortly.  All of this without out any gloom and doom hard sell action.  Shocking.
