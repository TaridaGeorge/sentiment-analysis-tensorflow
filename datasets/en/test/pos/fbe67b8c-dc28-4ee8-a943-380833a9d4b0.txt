I love this place. Denise and Cindy are the best. My little Nismo is always treated so well when he comes in for a bath, hair cut and teeth cleaning. He is a little nervous to be left without me, but is treated with so much love, that when I come back to get him, he is happy as can be. That was never the case at any other places before I discovered Hug N Pups.  I've been a regular customer for about 3 years now, even after I moved away from across the street! I am a bit particular about how Nismo is cut, and I am always pleased with how he looks.
