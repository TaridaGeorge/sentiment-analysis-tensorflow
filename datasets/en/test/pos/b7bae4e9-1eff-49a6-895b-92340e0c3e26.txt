What can I say? 

If you want to get out of Phoenix in a rush, this is the place to be!

I have probably been here 30 times in the last 10 years, through travelling, picking up friends and relatives and seeing of Make-A-Wish Kids.  

I have also traveled to airports over the nation and some throughout the world and i have to say PHX is pretty good.  

They have a great selection of stores outside of the security gate, and some good stores inside the gates. 

Security is the full body xrays and I have been through here a few times and the lines move pretty quick.  

Starbucks, Einsteins, Paradise Bakery, reasonable prices.
