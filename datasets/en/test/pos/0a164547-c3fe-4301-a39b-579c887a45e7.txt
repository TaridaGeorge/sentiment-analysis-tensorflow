Looking for a good diner style breakfast?  If so, try this place.   After living back east for some time you get to appreciate food - diner style.  This place is all of that.  You can always tell a good breakfast by the number of people who are there or waiting to get in.  In fact the last time we tried to eat there we decided to pass as there was a line out the door of the place.   

When you do get inside you get all the feelings of a small town eatery.  Many patrons seem to be regulars.  The staff is very friendly and welcoming.   The portion size is good and speed of service is great.   Cost is reasonable as well.   

2 thumbs up !!!
