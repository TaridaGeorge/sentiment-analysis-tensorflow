Daily Dose is my favorite go-to on nearly any occasion.  Breakfast?  Yep, you HAVE to try the Prime Rib Omelette.  Lunch?  Definitely, their salads are unbeatable.  Dinner?  Their happy hour is the best!

Seriously, though, the vibe inside is perfect, and the servers are friendly.  I never get tired of going to Daily Dose.
