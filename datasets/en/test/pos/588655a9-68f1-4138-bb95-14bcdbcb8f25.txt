I've had my fair share of foot and ankle problems for someone still in her 20's, and I've visited lots and lots of podiatrists before finding the amazing doctors here. Both Dr Kates and Dr Golub have been absolutely fantastic.

The office is small and no-nonsense, but features walls full of photos of all the famous athletes and stars they've treated. Hello - team doctors for the Suns for over 35 years! And the Coyotes, and the Rattlers!

Staff is helpful and can get you in for an appt quickly. 

I've always had great treatment and superior care here and anyone needing a podiatrist should try them.
