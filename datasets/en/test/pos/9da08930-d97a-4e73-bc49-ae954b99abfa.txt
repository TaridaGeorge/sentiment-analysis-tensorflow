I first came here on a Scottsdale food tour and loved it. I took my friend here for his birthday and we looked like idiots because we came in the side door, and waited at what we thought was the hostess stand for 5 minutes before the staff corrected us. The atmosphere is great, with a couple couches and board games. I went on a Saturday night and sat outside, and could hear the live music just enough. The singer sounded sexy but I never saw his face. We ordered the larger order of bruschetta for the two of us and were full. Great wine and sangria. I want to go back on a Sunday and try the seafood stew special.
