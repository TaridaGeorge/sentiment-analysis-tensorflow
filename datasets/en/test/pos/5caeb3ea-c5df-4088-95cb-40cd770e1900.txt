I remember when this little place was owned by Ken and was called The Sushi. I was upset when Ken sold the place, but Masa has worked wonders!
 The sushi here is phenomenal! I haven't ordered anything I haven't loved! Their Volcano Rolls are amazing and I make everyone I'm with try it. :) 
  The staff is very helpful and nice, especially Iris. 
  I recommend Fresh Wasabi to all my sushi loving friends. Best sushi in Arizona by far!
