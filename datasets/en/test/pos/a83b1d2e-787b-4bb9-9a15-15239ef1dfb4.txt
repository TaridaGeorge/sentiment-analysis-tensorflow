We stayed for a week with two kids, a dog and two cats. So yes, very pet friendly. Great pool, nice employees and excellent free breakfast- saved us a good deal of money just on that meal alone. Computer and printer access, coffee and water available all day. Comfortable beds, clean room. Pricey I suppose but well worth it for this family relocating from California. : )
