Hands down best massage of my life.

Found John through Yelp and decided to schedule with him after reading all of his great reviews- and I'm so glad I did! John is professional yet very therapeutic.  He takes the time to listen to areas of concern prior to the massage. I quickly learned that John has the hands of an angel & I left my session feeling completely rejuvenated and refreshed.  I especially enjoyed the stretching during the massage.

Definitely plan to return on a monthly basis!
