Ok
I hate doing this
I really wish I didn't love a chain fondue restaurant more than the independant fondue places in AZ...

But Melting Pot does fondue very well.  Better than the other fondue options.

I'm not a fan of their cheese

However, their Yin Yang chocolate fondue is SO FREAKING GOOD

So yeah.
Darn.  I love the Melting Pot.
