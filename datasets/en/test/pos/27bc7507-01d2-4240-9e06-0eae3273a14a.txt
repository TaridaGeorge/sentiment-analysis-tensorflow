Now, I rarely get a craving for cupcakes, but I will admit that Sprinkles is about as good as it gets. They are well deserving of the publicity they receive. The frosting is probably the best I've ever had and the cupcakes are fairly large so you don't feel quite as raped when you plop down your life's savings for an afternoon treat.

All of the flavors I've tried are good but the red velvet is definitely the best.

It is likely that a place like this will kill you. But really, would that be the worst way to die...?
