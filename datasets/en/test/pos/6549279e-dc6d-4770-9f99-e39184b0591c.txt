Meikle Moving moved my elderly mother in law in September.   The team they sent were fabulous.  They moved everything carefully and both of the Meikle movers that were sent to the job were so patient with her requests.  She's a tough cookie!  

Most important they were prompt, responsive, careful with her furnishings and we would use them again without hesitation.  I strongly recommend this small business for all of your moves.
