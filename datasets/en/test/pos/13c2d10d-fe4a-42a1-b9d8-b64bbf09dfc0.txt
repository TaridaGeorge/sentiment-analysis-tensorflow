If you are at all bashful or have issues around nudity, you might want to stop reading now.  This place will not be for you.... but for the free spirited, the Alwun House is the place to be this month for their Erotic Art Festival.

The exhibit kicks off with their outrageous sneak preview party tonight, (Feb. 8th) at 7pm.  Don't expect to see stuffy art aficionados milling about with glasses of champagne. Do expect to see transvestites on 8 inch platform shoes dancing and laughing with the  glitter dusted, the body painted, the latex clad, and the goths. They create a club atmosphere in their back yard with a floor show of comics, cross dressers, dancers, acrobats and contortionists.  You can't immerse yourself in the circus atmosphere and not walk away smiling.
