My son and grandson tried out the wave pool recently and loved it! It was indoors, so no sunburn to worry about and had lifeguards standing guard all around. They enjoyed the waves and waterslide both. As an added bonus, my very active 8 year old grandson (who was staying with us) was a tired out boy by the end of his swimming time. :) A must visit for anyone wishing to wave swim without sitting in the beating sun. Oh, and the kids come home tired - yea!
