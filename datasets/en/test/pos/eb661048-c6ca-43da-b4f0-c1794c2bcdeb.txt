Dr. Tuttle is as sweet as they come and I had to up Pecan Grove to 5 stars. 
We unfortunately lost our little guy to complications with the Parvo while he was in the care of another vet (Pecan Grove doesn't have the ability to do overnights). Dr. Tuttle not only called the other vet daily to check on our little one but upon hearing of our loss, phoned me to offer condolences. Today a hand written card came with a very personal note. 
Doctor care & this level of personal caring doesn't get any better and I can't say enough kind things about her. 
Get your dogs to Pecan Grove-they will thank you for years to come!
