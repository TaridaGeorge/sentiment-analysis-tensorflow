I'm a huge tea drinker but it's hard to find any tea cafe's Tempe, unfortunately it's nowhere near where I work otherwise I would stop by religiously. From the two times that I have been there I've gotten iced green tea's cannot remember what blend but they we're both really good. Great service and staff was very friendly and helpful and free wifi is always a plus. I really hope they expand across the valley so I can visit them more often. :D
