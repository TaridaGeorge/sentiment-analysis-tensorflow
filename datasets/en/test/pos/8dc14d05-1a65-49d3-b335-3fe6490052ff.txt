Absolutely killer place. Excellent cortado during our last visit to town. Followed by a nice macchiato today. Great music and atmosphere. Well worth the visit for the rest of the out of towners wondering where their best opportunity for exceptional espresso and espresso based drinks can be found. Small but awesome beer selection on tap and limited wines too. Glad they stop there though. No one can be the jack of all.
