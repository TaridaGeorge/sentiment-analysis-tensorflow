Very small place, but very cozy... When it's busy, it's tough to find a place to plant myself. One time on a First Friday night they opened up the backyard and was serving brews there and lots of open space. There's occasionally bands playing there...love the fact that they serve Delirium. Very glad to have found the lost leaf.
