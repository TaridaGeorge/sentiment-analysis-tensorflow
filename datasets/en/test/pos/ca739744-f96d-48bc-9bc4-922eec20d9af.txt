How Fez isn't 5 stars just blows my mind. Best restaurant in the city. Had the Lamb Kisra last night, it's probably my 15th favorite entree on the menu, and it was still fabulous. 

Friend them on FB and you'll get an update everyday of the specials. So good. Not much more to say, it's the best. Mascarpone Cheesecake omg!
