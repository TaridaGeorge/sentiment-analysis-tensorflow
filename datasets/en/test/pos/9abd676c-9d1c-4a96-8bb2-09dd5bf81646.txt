I live in Canada and I cannot wait to hit Chico's @ Kierland Commons location when I arrive in Scottsdale. Myra was the first Sales Associate to help me out on my first  visit and I was thrilled with her knowledge and her incredible service. I spent  3 hrs there. It can be overwhelming at first because of all the shoppers and staff. I absolutely love Chico's.  "Friendliest Ladies I have ever met"
