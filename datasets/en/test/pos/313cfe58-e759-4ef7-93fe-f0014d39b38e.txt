I came here for one reason and one reason only.....for the waffle dogs. 

I saw them featured on TV's,  "the best thing I ever ate".  The line was literally wrapped around the block and were told it was a 70 minute wait for a table. despite this the service was wonderful!

i was served three breakfast sausage corn dogs with their special sauce (syrup and hot sauce). It was delicious. 

I came, I saw, I ate, I was satisfied :)
