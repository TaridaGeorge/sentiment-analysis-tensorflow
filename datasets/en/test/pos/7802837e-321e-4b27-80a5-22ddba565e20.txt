Great place to get the things you just can't find at the big chain stores.
High quality pet food, snacks, toys, cloths, and staff that care.
The store is small, but well worth the trip.  You won't be disappointed.
I just moved to the area, and after doing a little research online, I found that this place carried not only the high end food I feed my dog, but also the brand of shoes I wanted to protect my dog's feet from the hot ground here in Phoenix.  I looked some more, and they carry, or deal in just about every high end food on the market, and just about anything worth getting for your dog, and they even have a few items for your feline friend too.
