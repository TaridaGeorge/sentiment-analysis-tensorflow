Best Whole Foods I've been to!

Some things I like about this place:

-Walking distance from home
-Cute little bar with good beers on draft
-Ice blended caramel mocha coffee from the coffee bar
-Burger meal from  the Smokehouse Grill
  (there's a different special each day, less than $10 a meal)
-Smoked Mozzerella Pasta Salad in the deli
-Sage Shortbread cookies (in the case near the coffee bar)
-Grace's Sunflower Seed Cookies (cookie aisle, green package)

and of course... Sweet Republic Ice Cream!!!
