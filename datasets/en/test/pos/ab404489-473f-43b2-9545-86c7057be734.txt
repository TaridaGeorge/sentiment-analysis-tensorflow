Love this place - my boyfriend and I used to go everyday before relocating out of town. Super friendly, upbeat staff - that was not faking it!

I am very picky and they would remake my drink whenever necessary. 
They knew our names - knew our drinks and would have them ready for us by the time we got up to the window. 

I already miss this place!
