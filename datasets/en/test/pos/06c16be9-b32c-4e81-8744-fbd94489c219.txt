Well I suppose I am kinda biased as I teach at YP. But it wasn't always that way. I used to practice at other studios around town and had always enjoyed classes. I metEric, the owner, through a business meeting and we got talking. He invited me to practice and I haven't looked back. Since then I completed the 500 hour certification program and the studio is part of my life. 

If you are looking for something different, go to Pura. The classes still give you the physical work out but what's different is that you get the philosophy too. Not just a few new age words sprinkled in here and there but a truly holistic understanding of this ancient practice.

Try it once. You never know. You might like it.
