Wow Love this place!!!!!!  Went here for a birthday lunch with the family and everybody raved about what they had.  If you get the burger you have to try it with the fried egg. yuuummyyyy.   Also try the donut holes for desert, the best I tell ya. It is pricey but I think you really get what you pay for here.
