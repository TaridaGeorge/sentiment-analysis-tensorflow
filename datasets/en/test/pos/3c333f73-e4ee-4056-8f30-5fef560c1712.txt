We popped into liberty market on a Thursday for dinner. It's been a while since I have been back and I was truly impressed, I had to bump it up to 5 stars. ordered pizza and champagne and the Hubster ordered chicken sandwich, potato salad and a San tan epicenter beer. For dessert we shared a slice of red velvet cake and two perfect espressos.  leave room for dessert! 

Service was quick and pleasant. Love the laid back casualness of the restaurant. Even though it's laid back I still think its a nice treat and the food is so good and fresh. overall fabulous place for lunch or dinner.  Love it & that it is in Gilbert.
