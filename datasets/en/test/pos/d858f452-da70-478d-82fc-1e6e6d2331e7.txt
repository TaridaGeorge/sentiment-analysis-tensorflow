I'm definitely a fan!  The gelato is rich and smooth, the staff was really cool about giving out samples, and since I was there on a Saturday night, the people watching was prime -- lots of cougars and adam lambert look alikes.  

I got the chocolate caramel and the strawberry combined, it was truly sublime.  I shall return to the Gelato Spot!
