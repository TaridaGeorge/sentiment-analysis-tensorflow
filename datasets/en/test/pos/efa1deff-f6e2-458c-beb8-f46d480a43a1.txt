I purchased a living social and got my order in last minute before it expired!Angela,the owner, was very professional and took a lot of her time to tell me about all the chocolates and many other delicious treats she makes all by herself!All her chocolates are made from scratch,vegan and have no preservatives or waxes like many other products!I love the way she packages all her products and the web site makes it easy to order!I will put an order in for christmas for sure,and another one just for myself!YUMMY!
