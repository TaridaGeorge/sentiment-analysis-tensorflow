Dan Majerle's new joint, located on the corner of 2nd Street and Washington next door to his flagship eatery, gave me a pleasant surprise today when I stopped in for some quick eats. 
Expecting simply "eatable," I got way more. 
You will not find better pizza (2 slices for $6) or lunch hour service (helpful, friendly, smiling, composed under duress) anywhere in Downtown. The combos include a drink and a nice little salad and there are a couple of flat screens tuned to ESPN. I took my slices to go but next time I'll gladly eat in.  
The only criticism I can make is that the selection of pizzas was a little weak, but I had no problem waiting three minutes for the next piping hot pepperoni pie to spring from the oven. 
Great job, Thunder Dan!
