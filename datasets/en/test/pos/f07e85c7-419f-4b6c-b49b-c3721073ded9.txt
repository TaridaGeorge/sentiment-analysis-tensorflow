I have used this company three times now to have my carpets cleaned.  I have been impressed each time, and I am VERY picky.  They are always competitive with their pricing, and they are always on time!  Those are two huge pluses for me.  I have a habit of calling people who are between 1 and 3 hours late for appointments.  They always send two people, who are professional and don't try to sell me a million services.  Today, they even fixed a buckle in my carpet for free.  I am a very loyal customer to companies that have good customer service and can back it up, with good services.
