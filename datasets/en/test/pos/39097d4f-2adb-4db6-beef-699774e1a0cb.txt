Came here in the middle of the night fighting a kidney stone. The only negative I have is how long it took to get seen. I spent about 30 minutes to be seen, which is an eternity in the pain I was in. Outside of that, the staff was genuinely caring. I saw Dr Page and he was quite helpful in helping me understand what was going on and getting me medicated so I could start feeling better.
