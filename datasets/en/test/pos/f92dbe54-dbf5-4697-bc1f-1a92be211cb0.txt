Filet - Awesome.  Cooked perfectly.  Maybe even better than Mastro's
Caesar Salad - Nothing special.  Mambo salad at Mastro's is much better.
Truffled Macaroni and Cheese - Awesome.
Godiva cake - It was luke warm by the time it was served.  

Great place to people watch.  Way too much plastic surgery, exotic cars and skimpy clothing.  Scottsdale at its finest.

Go for the food, stay for the free Cougar show!
