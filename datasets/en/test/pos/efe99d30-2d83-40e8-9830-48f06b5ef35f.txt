These guys are awesome - relentlessly polite, friendly, upbeat. My pup and I drive through each morning, and they know my drink order, and my dog's name, by heart.

This is a really busy location at certain times of day, so the car line can sometimes be long, but I always see them working as fast as they can, and they've given me a free coffee on several occasions when the wait was too long.

NOTE: There's a new Starbucks policy that you have to steam milk individually for each drink now (where relevant), you can't steam a pot in advance and pour it as needed. This makes for a fresher drink, but slows down the line. Not the fault of they guys on the front line...

Awesome Starbucks team here - love 'em.
