We ate here twice in one week on our spring break vacation. First, we at there and had the special spinach pizza. We don't eat meat, so the idea that there was a special pizza that didn't have meat was fascinating and boy did it deliver on taste. Super garlicky, if you're into that kind of thing. Kiddo's plain cheese pizza was even good. Then we ordered a to-go super veggie pizza for round two. That was delicious as well. Good service, not fancy. Just go and eat and drink and have a nice time.
