It's hard to find good Thai food when traveling in a new area.  We were fortunate to find the Royal Jasmine in Goodyear.  The food is excellent, the service superb. Clean, classy, casual.   It was such a good experience and the menu so varied that we went all 3 nights in town to the Royal Jasmine.  It's in a small, quiet, but attractive "mall."  Closer than you might guess to the main street and hotels.  
Worth every effort to locate.  Enjoy!
