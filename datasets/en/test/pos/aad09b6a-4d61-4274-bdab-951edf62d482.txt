A major fan of this thrift store. 
As much as I am not a fan of Arizona...this place stole my heart! 
If you're a true thrifter and not a snob about places being modernized and blah, blah, blah....then you'll definitely love this store.

The staff is very nice and helpful. Things are not overpriced/marked up like at some resale or so called thrift stores...This one has something for everyone....whether you're a fashionista on a budget, college kid looking for some housewares, or a low-income family trying to keep things afloat...you'll leave with a smile on your face.


xoxo enjoy.

p.s.
it is very organized and clean! parking is never a problem.
