I love this market. It's no Marukai/Mitsuwa, but I can find what I need here. The staff is so friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful.
I'm willing to pay the price for the goods (not all are expensive, mind you) for the simple fact that the customer service is great, the store is clean, and the selection is fairly high. 

I love the lady that helped us out. She was very sweet and caring. 

I could go on and on about the customer service, but I'll spare you all further pain.

Go here, you wont be disappointed (unless you're flat broke.)
