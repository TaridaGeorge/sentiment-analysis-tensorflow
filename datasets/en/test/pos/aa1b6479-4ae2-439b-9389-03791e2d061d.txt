Excellent service!!!! I had to find a spa different from lavenders after they got rid of yet another excellent staff member, so I tried this place! I was SO HAPPY!! clean, pleasant, warm, comforting. The manager is actually on site and aware of the things going on in their spa! The staff is friendly and efficient! 
Lavenders day spa can learn from this place. Send the owner from lavenders to sanity and TAKE NOTES. 
I HIGHLY recommend it here!!!!!! Go and enjoy!!!
