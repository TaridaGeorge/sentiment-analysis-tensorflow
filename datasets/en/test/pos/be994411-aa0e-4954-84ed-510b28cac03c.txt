Tons of great stuff for the collector of rare, stylised toys. They have small items for $7 and all the way up to much larger, custom designs for as much as $500. Don't come in expecting to get your kid something - this is definitely for collectors only.
I love to go in and just look at it from a gallery perspective. Tons of wonderful art for art's sake.
