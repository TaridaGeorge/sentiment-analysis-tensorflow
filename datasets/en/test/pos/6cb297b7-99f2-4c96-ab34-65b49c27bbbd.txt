Just ate here for the second time last night. The service here is always impeccable and I love the vibe. It's very laid back and comfortable, a great place for good food and good conversation. I didn't figure we would need reservations as it was a typical Tuesday night and we were able to get right in. My friend and I tried the mac n' cheese for appetizer and it was delicious; the pancetta is a great extra! The last time I was here I ordered the mussels, but this time I went with the Pork Osso Bucco and it was delicious! The spaetzle added a nice extra texture to the dish and the pork was fork tender. My friend ordered the chicken and the only thing she left on her plate were the clean chicken bones, so she clearly enjoyed her meal. I will definitely be back.
