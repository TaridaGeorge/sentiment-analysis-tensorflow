I have been going to Mesha's Salon and Spa for the past 5 years and absolutley love it. I see Michelle (the owner) and she comes up with some great new looks for me. 
I have gone from short hair, funky styles and colors and long and sexy hair. She is awesome and I love her recommendations. There have been times I have gone in and not knowing what to do... and she always comes up with something that makes me feel fabulous !!
I will never go anywhere else.
