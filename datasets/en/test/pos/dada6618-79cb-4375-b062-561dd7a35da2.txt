Absolutely love the food that Switch has to offer me. I don't think I've ever tried something on the menu that I wasn't absolutely satisfied with. Oh wait, I remember one thing, their martini, but I'm pretty sure I'm just not a martini drinker so that's why I didn't like it.

I love that they have monthly specials and I make an effort to try them out once a month. Their daily $3 drink specials is so awesome!!! The service has always been good to me.

If you haven't checked out Switch yet then you are for sure missing out so get your butt over there and dig in.
