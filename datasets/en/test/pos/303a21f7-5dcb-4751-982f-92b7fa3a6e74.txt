I know the YogurtLand staff because I frequent the spot so much.  For only 30 Cents/oz you can fill your YL cup to the brim and decorate your masterpiece with approx 30 different toppings, including Mochi!  By the time I make it to my car, I've devoured the entire dessert and have entertained the idea of going back in for seconds more than once... You might be thinking-- well you're probably a large girl then...nope, because it's frozen yogurt aka NON FAT.  

YogurtLand receives a 5 star rating because of the variety, environment and friendly staff... plus the spoons are extra cute.
