Anything with prosciutto makes me smile.

Started off with the Snack Plate which consisted of Sopressatta, Parmigiano Reggiano, PROSCIUTTO!, and other good snackins for just $4! Can't be beat!

Then went for the Prosciutto e Mela pizza which was fantastic! I can honestly see myself eating this as my last meal if i were on my death bed. It was THAT yummy.
