I dined at this amazing place on Sunday the last day of Restaurant Week - AZ. They put together an amazing menu that was really worth the cost. 
Started with Miso Soup - perfect! Second had the Ahi Poke - which was prepared on these little triangles of what seemed like a soft corn tortilla. I could not figure out exactly what it was - and doesn't matter - all I know was Yummo!
Next course was Sea Bass - prepared to perfection. Not too much flavor as to distract - but just enough. 
Last was the roll dessert - with cream, berries and a sweet rice - I was in heaven. 
All that and an amazing bottle of wine that was half off - sitting outside under the misters at a nice 90 degrees - in Beautiful AZ - who could ask for more?
