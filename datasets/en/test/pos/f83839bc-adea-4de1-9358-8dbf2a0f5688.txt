Always great food at a great price!  My girls like the Katzu chicken and I'm addicted to the Katzu chicken with curry. Their Kalua pork is also sure to please. A great alternative to burgers or tacos.  What more could you ask for?  Great food at a fair price and a very friendly staff make this a 5 star place for us.
