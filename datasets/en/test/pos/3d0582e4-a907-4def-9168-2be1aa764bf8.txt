Staff was wonderful!  Waiter went the extra mile to get us waters to-go as he found out we were tourists heading out to Sedona for a hike.  During happy hour, bartender was extremely courteous.  When we wanted to move to a booth, she not only helped us bus the table herself personally, but she also continued to bring extra ice teas.  I really miss the service at Pappadeaux.  If only all restaurants give the same experience.  As for the food, order the Happy Hour Fondeaux, cheesy wine butter crawfish and shrimp delight.  Half dozen Oysters for $4.99!
