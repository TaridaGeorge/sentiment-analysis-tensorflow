I have been going to Health coach's various clinics for 3 years  The medical staff and employees are very well educated and helpful.  I have been visiting the Chandler clinic for years with great success and recently went to the Phoenix clinic for a TMJ issue.  I was having serious jaw pain and within 4 visits my pain was completely gone.   I would highly recommend Health Coach for any of your chiropractic needs.
