I love this location for Fed Ex. They were a life saver for me over the Christmas holidays. They are always cheerful and friendly when you come in. Even though when  they say hello many people do not respond. Rude people!!  Any way, the service is excellent it always gets there when they say it will. They are super quick when they help you and they will even package it up for you.  There are some really wonderful people working in the shipping dept. Chris being one of them. A truly nice person who really wants to help you as best as he can. If only more of us took pride in our job like that.  Great location, fast service, delivered when promised...what more could you ask for.
