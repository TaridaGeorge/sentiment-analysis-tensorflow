i just have to say that this place is GREAT. I love the coffee. They have many events going on on different nights from wine tasting to jazz playing. Ive gotten to know the employees very well. They are all so nice. They buy from locals which i like alot! its very roomy and has free wifi!
 I will always try to go out of my way to stop here for my coffee instead of starbucks if i can!
