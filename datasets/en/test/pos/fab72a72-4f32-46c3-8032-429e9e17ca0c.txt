Disclosure: Jerry's sponsors an event I help run, Dr. Sketchy's Anti-Art School. This does not influence my review, except for I can vouch that they are a cool, laid-back, flexible sponsor. 

When I first went to Jerry's, I was expecting a small store. But MAN, it's pretty freaking big. Tons of supplies, including books and software.  They also carry Montana spray paint and comic/manga supplies, so I feel like their selection is pretty comprehensive. I generally only shop for art supplies that pertain to drawing and sketching, though, so I can't vouch for any of the traditional painting and sculpture stuff. But the place is so big, I'm inclined to guess that they'll have whatever you need.

Oh, they do framing, too!
