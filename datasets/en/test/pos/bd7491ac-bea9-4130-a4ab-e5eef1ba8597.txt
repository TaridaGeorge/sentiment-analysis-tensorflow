so upon walking in with my newly adopted mildly brain damaged chihuahua, i knew i had a slightly bewildered  look on my face.
these lovely people took me under their wing and literally walked me around their shoppe and showed all they could offer my sweet little 
general fritz.
i will be back for sure.
