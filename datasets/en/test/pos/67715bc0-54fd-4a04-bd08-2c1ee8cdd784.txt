I had been to Lux a few times when they were located right next to Pena Bianco.  Had to see the new place just a building over but a whole lot more space.  The scene is great, plenty of seating inside and out.  The breakfast kieshes are deliscious and the menu is always changing.  Great coffee or if your into Smoothies they have them too.  Also if you wanted to come back later in the day they have a full bar in the back corner!  Its hard to beat Lux!
