New to the sport and came into the store really apprehensive and confused. Sam helped me out and gave me really knowledgeable tour about what I should look for. I appreciate that he didn't try to push my budget and found a really good bike based on my expectations and budget.  I said I would come back on the weekend if I wanted to buy it. Well, I came back on the weekend and tried out a few more bikes just in case. We ended up going back to the original choice and got it fitted for me. Took it out for my first ride this morning and it was great! Thank you Landis, for helping me into such a great sport!
