The place has grown up and gotten better over the last year or so.  Food wise it is top notch with tasty food choices including a bit of healthy choices.  The beers are usually pretty darn good also and they have some nice beer and food pairing suggestions.  The patio is small but pretty nice also.  Service is generally pretty good too. Good for lunchtime also.
