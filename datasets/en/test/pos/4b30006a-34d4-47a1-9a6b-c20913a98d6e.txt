This place is solid in every way.  Great local brewed beer.  The food is surpisingly good every time.  The menu is huge and they really do everything well from pastas and pizzas which are excellent to their Philly, which is equally great (they put a little gravy on it, mmm), and wraps.  Fries are darn good.  Servers are all nice and like working there. It shows.  Good lunch specials.  Good happy hour too with half priced appetizers.

I really recommend this place.  Solid and semi-local.  Can get busy but I always sit at the bar.

PS.  Believe it or not I met my wife there a few years ago!  Thats why it gets the 5th star.  :)
