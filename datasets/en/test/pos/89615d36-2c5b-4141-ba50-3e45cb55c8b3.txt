I was told that the Chuckbox would have the best burger I EVER had, ever.  
I was not lied to.
The 1/2 pound burger I had was fantastic.  I also had onion rings and and an ice cold beer to wash it all down.
Their menu is not extensive, but it did not need to be.  They do one thing, and they ARE the best.  
Well, at least the best I've ever had yet.
If you can recommend a better burger: please let me know.
