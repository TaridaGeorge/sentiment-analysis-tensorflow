The best Italian around. i went a few weeks ago with my girlfriend (mainly because of the byob) we couldn't believe how great it was. i had an assortment  of home made pastas that were to die for. price i thought prices were a little high but reasonable  after realizing we drank our 30 dollar bottle of wine which would of cost us close to $75 if bought at a different restaurant,  not for the average fat American looking to throw down a pound of pasta and sauce.
