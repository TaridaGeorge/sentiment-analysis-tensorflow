I have tried lots of froyo. I'm kinda' a conisseur (sp?) at this point. I do love the Dulce de Leche here. I'm not as big a fan of most of their other flavors, my my daughter loves their red velvet. The people who work here are nice and it's a comfortable place. The price is fair, and they have lots of toppings. :)
