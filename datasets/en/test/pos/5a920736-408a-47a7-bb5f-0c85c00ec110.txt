TOP restaurant I have ever been to in Arizona or even on the west coast.. Once you start walking into the pub you feel like you have suddenly traveled over the pond and back to America's roots BRITISH FOOD! I have always heard horrible  things about how British food consisted of mainly fish and chips and other bland entree's - to my pleasant surprise  the Food was Delicious!
- huge beers 
-Pasty for all food types 
- the service is outstanding 
Give yourself the gift of time travel and head on over  to Cornish Pasty Company  where you can leave the southwest once you step in the dark hall of the restaurant EXPERIENCE LIFE ABROAD!
