Although I am no longer a regular, Gilligan's is still by far my favorite bar in the entire west coast!!!  It is by far a dive, but the funnest place!  It's the place to start any night, or end any night, or spend your night!  Just make sure you have a cab to bring you home, these people mix a mean drink :)  It's perfection to those who love dives.  Awesome!!!!!
I haven't been on a Tues in too long, but if they still do fish races, it is a MUST!!!
