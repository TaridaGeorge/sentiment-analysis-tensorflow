I moved here from Orange County in Southern California about 4 years ago, we don't have these restaurants back home. It took me 4-5 months before I realized that Cracker Barrel had a restaurant, from the outside it just looks like a retail store of country themed items and gifts. 

   The customer service at this store has always been good every time I've eaten here. The portions are good sized and I do find country/southern food items (catfish, okra etc.) on the menu that I do not see in other restaurants.  I wish they'd get Fried Green Tomatoes on the menu.
