So listen, this guy *does* blow on your toes.  But I don't have any open wounds, nor did he, so I am willing to let this slide because:  this was the best pedicure I've ever had in my life.  Let me tell you why:  the longest most wonderful lower leg/foot massage + hot stone treatment I've ever experienced, and I am not even kidding.  The polish itself looked great and I got a cute design too (they have SO many to choose from!) and it was only $25 total for pedicure + design and this included the most-wonderful-massage-ever and the hot stone treatment (base price is $20, still great!).  I was not rushed out the door, but the massage was so long and so good that I wouldn't have minded if he had.   All I can say is wow.  I'm a forever customer.
