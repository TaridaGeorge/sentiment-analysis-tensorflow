Was visiting the fountain with some out of town friends and came across this coffee shop. Great location and staff and great selection of drinks as well as free wi-fi. The shop is long and narrow but seating is comfortable and modern. I would definitely ask Ashley to whip you up a drink. She made an excellent Milkyway one for me. I'm not a coffee fan per se but for anyone in the Fountain Hills area,  this is a great location to go to.
