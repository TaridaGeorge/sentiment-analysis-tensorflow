i've been to pita shack twice and the first one was solely based on yelp reviews. i will be returning as much as possible- the staff is amazing, they talk to you, make recommendations, and generally make you feel like a valued customer. the food is also amazing- the lentil soup is super yummy, the veggie oombo authentic, and the chicken shwarma and gyros are delicious! definitely a place to check out if you're in the mood for actual greek/mediterranean food!
