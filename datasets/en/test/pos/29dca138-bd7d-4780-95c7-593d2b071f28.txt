Doesn't need more reviews, this is just for friends to see. Famous pizza place downtown, it's rumored that Seinfeld & Oprah have eaten here. Simply put it's a place you have to go to at least once. The food is great, slow cooked, atmosphere is awesome in the old brick house with art on the walls. Just a comfortable place where you feel like you are friends with everyone eating there. If you are going for dinner plan on getting there at least by 4pm to get a table by 5-6. Or come at 5-6, get your name on the list, go to Bar Bianco, and eat at 7-8! 5 stars because I have been there 5+ times, can always recommend it and be thanked, never had bad food.
