Have now been coming here about once a week for maybe three years.  Loved it on my original review. As you continue to go here you love it more. Great staff, cool regulars and new customers, very good live music (especially Brian), and our neighborhood hangout.  Come here and check it out because you will come back.

I had written this and never finished it.  They ended up closing.  A lot of people were bummed because we all loved it.  Oh well.
