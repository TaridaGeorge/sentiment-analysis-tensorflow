This place is not the average Old Town Scottsdale drinking establishment... I could actually get a drink.

This was more of a bar than a nightclub. I didn't drink much, but just the fact that I could get a drink made me pretty happy. The staff was really friendly and the place was really clean. There was a nice, quiet outdoor area too! Some of my friends liked the rock music in the background, a far cry from the blastin' hip hop at some other Scottsdale places.
