hands down, the best dog park i have been to so far! lots of room, trees, water fountains, good owners, tennis balls galore... what more can a dog want?

not to mention it has an actual people park as well, where the kids can play. the playground is right outside of the dog park for your kids... 

5 stars, awesome bark park...
