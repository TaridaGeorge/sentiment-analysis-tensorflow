I was there April 4th, and 5th. I saw a ton of funny and amazing shows. It was a great mix of local and national troupes. I did not think there was any difference in terms of quality between the troupes from Phoenix, and the ones from Chicago and LA. I am going to try and see some of the local groups in town and would suggest others to go and check them out. I will be going back to PIF next year as well! It was a good price, and the theatre was full for most performances.
