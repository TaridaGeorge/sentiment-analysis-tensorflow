Excellent customer service & product knowledge. The staff is friendly and solution oriented but not pushy even though they make commission. Great selection and rarely out of stock but if they are your order can be delivered to your door at no extra cost. My experience here has made Finish Line my preferred store for athletic shoes.

Only problem is I have not made it out of the store spending less than $100 yet. Do not take your wife or girlfriend with you. After all.. it is a shoe store.
