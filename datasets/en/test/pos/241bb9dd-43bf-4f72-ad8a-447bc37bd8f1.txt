I loooove this restaurant. Everything is wonderful. The service is fantastic and all the waiters are very nice, the ambiance is intimate, classy, and romantic, and the food is delicious. The creme brulee dessert is a must-try and comes as a plate of creme brulee with a cookie gondola with chocolate and berries. Plenty of good wines available, too. And, as an added perk, you get a free gondola ride pass if you have dinner here. There is a lagoon behind the hotel where gondoliers will row you around and sing to you. Magical experience. :)
