You can't go wrong with Sprouts.  

I am not a health nut and I shop here often.  They have amazing produce here that is decently cheap.  I say always to purchase your produce here, if you don't, then your crazy :)  .  They layout items very nice and often have season items that you never knew existed.  

There stand in the middle with all of the candy and licorice always gets me.  They have like 10 flavors of licorice that are all amazing.  They also have Cinnamon bears, and I don't know if you have ever tried to find cinnamon bears, but it seems no one has them.  Anyways....

Overall, I will definitely be a repeat customer and always purchase my produce from them.
