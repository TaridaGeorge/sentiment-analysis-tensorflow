Normally, I'm not a fan of franchises, but Zoes Kitchen has it down. Impeccable everything, completely healthy and delicious, every damn time! Zoes is a perfect lunch spot, with counter ordering, fast service, light healthy , perfectly appealing food. Service is always friendly and the food is always fresh. They use no mayo in their tuna or their out of this world slaw (something I literally crave)! The prices are quite ideal too! Obviously, i'm stoked on this place! You will be too :)
