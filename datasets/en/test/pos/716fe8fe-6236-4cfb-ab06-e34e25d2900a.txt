Lucky's Pizza is great. This is what Independence is all about. The ability to have an idea and to go out and make it happen. The family of Lucky's pizza is great and there are several locations in the west valley and each one is owned and operated by a family member. Cousin, uncle, brother, Etc. :) It's a great thing. 

There pizza has a great thin crust with fresh toppings. They get there sausage locally and cook it up fresh in store and then slice it thin on the slicer. no precooked or packaged crap. Real fresh Italian Sausage. It rocks. I highly recommend trying it. 

The wings have a great sauce and they come out crispy and juicy. They don't disappoint. 

I am a fan of Lucky's pizza and several other independent pizza joints around town. Arizona is Lucky, to have them. :)
