Arizona is in desperate need of more delis.  Romanellis is one of the best.  I picked up some spicey homemade Italian sausage, fresh parmesean cheese, and fresh baked french bread the other night and made some of the most delicious pasta I've had in a very long time.  If you are looking for an Italian deli in Phoenix that has a wide variety of goods this is the spot.  You will pay much more here than you would if you went to the grocery store but you will not be getting the same authenticity.  Seems how great Italian delis are hard to find in AZ it comes down to Economics 101 - supply and demand.
