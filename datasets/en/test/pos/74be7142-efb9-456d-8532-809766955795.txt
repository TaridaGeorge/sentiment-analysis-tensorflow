My friend Joy Li has her store here at The Mix.  My wife and I built her website for her.

This may be VERY Scottsdale, but all of the store owners and employees are really nice people.  We came at the big opening event and had a really nice evening.  

My wife has some of Joy's clothing and she looks stunning in them.  Check out her shop and tell her Terry and Lindsay sent yoU!
