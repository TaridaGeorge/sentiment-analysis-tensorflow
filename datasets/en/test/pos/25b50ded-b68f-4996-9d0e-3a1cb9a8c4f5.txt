I am hands down obsessed with this place. Best pizza in town. Better than Grimaldi's, even! I will say that both times I have been there, my order was taken completely wrong, however, it did no phase me becasuse their pizza is worth it. The calamari is amazing as well. And the veggie salad with the white beans. I have only had these three things every time I havee been there! I just can't stray because they are so good :)
