I couldn't possibly think about standing around outside waiting for a table at Pizzeria Bianco. So why not make the best of it and come next door to Bar Bianco. 

A great wine list and an awesome selection of craft beers all reasonably priced! But the big allure for me is the old house that Bar Bianco is housed. Its just an amazing old house that has been lovingly cared for. All the details are still there and you can tell this place had a lot of love in it. The second you walk through the door the place has a just walked into grandma's house, make yourself at home kind of feel. 

You cant go wrong here..
