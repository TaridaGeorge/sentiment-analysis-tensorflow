I'm new to Phoenix from San Francisco, so perhaps it's no surprise that it took a bumping gay bar to make me feel like I might actually be able to make it work in this town.  But this place is awesome.  Super diverse crowd, all your fav pop and hip hop hits to keep the crowd moving, and reasonably priced drinks.   We got there early and were able to relax on the comfy outdoor leather couches before it got too crazy.  But the best part was that even after it was packed, we were able to sneak upstairs to this extra bar that had more of a quiet, speakeasy feel, with plenty of space to sit and chill (and a group of slightly older dudes who looked like they got lost en route from the golf course to the sports bar - seriously, diverse crowd).

One point Phoenix.  Yay.
