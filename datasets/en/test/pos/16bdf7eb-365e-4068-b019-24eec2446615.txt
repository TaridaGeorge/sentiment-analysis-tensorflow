Dr. Sam and his staff are the best.  He is experienced, knowledgeable and kind - to both the animals and the people who love them.  I have moved and now drive 45 minutes to see him with no complaints.  He not only is a wonderful vet who takes his time with each patient, he will tell you when he doesn't know something, needs to do research, or will refer you to a great specialist.  He also is very cost-conscious and while I will do whatever I need to with my animals, it is appreciated that he understands that not everyone can afford to do everything.  He gives options and never forces expensive tests or tries to order anything that is unnecessary.  He also works with a local rescue organization, which shows his compassion and care for the community.
