Cute and fancy. Cocktails, wine, and selection of foods topped off the day.

The wide availability of pork bellies reminded me of Houston grade food  institutes, but it kept a very Northern Californian vibe and soul over all.

I hadn't seen this venue included in the "places to get cocktails" circuits yet, but it would place well in that categorical.
