Lets face it, all Home Depots are pretty much the same.  The only things that may be different are cleanliness and service.

This Home Depot is very clean.  It is pretty empty so you don't have to worry about getting your cart through the aisles without disturbing other customers.  Also, they seem to have more items than the Home Depot at home in Honolulu.  

Service was awesome!  I came her to buy boards to make slats for my grandpa's bed.  The employee was super helpful.  He gave us suggestions of which materials to use, carried the wood to the saw himself and cut the wood exactly to size.

The guy at the check out stand was also really nice.  I get a 10% military discount and he thanked me for my husband's service, which I thought was very thoughtful.
