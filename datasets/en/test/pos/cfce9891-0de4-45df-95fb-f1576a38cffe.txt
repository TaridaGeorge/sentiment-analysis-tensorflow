My son and I went to pick up a few parts for our Traxxes Nitro car and truck. WOW! There personal attention was really great  along with helpful knowledge. I ended up buying a new stadium truck as well and I went online in front of them to check their price. To my amazement, it was within literally a few dollars with others. Hats off to you guys @ The Hobby Bench for your attitudes and help. P.S. Your map location is off!
