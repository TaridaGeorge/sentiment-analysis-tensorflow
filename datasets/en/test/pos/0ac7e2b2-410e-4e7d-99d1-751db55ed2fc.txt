You HAVE TO try the Hawaiian Barbecue Chicken!! My husband, 16 month old daughter and I go 1-2 times/week for lunch and get it every time. We love the simple, well cooked chicken and our little one loves the sticky rice and the friendly attention she always gets from the staff. With so many lunch choices in the Scottsdale Airpark, it's rare we become regulars anywhere. With their consistent quality, fast service and super friendly staff, Asian Island has gained a lifetime customer.
