The BEST macaroni and cheese anywhere. It doesn't seem possible that a classy upscale place like this with a fabulous wine and cheese list would have incredible macaroni and cheese. Ken knows what he is doing here and even though the food is every bit as good as the food I have had in Paris, his desserts will cause you to give in and forget about your diet for the day.
Ask your server which cheeses are at their best and simply have a glass of wine to go with it if you like.
If you order coffee it may take a bit as they always make it fresh when I am there.
Worth the drive, wait or ruining your diet for.
