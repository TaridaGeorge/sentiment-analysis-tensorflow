LOVE the Phoenix zoo! My son and I are there at least once a month for regular zoo days and breakfast with the animals (special program for youngsters to learn about a specific animal and have breakfast at the zoo) 

In addition to regular zoo days, we enjoy their special events. We spent "Noon Years Eve" there--they had a special event for kids, they brought in snow for the kids to play and even had a cider toast at noon. We also went to zoolights (holy crowded) on my sons birthday.

I also love that the zoo has a social media presence. They're active on Twitter and always have deals and contests going on.
