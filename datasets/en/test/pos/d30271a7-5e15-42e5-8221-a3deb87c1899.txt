This is one of the best Irish pub/restaurants the valley has to offer. They also have live bands perform on occasion.

I used to work very close to here and wandered in about once a week. The food is authentic, with fish and chips and dozens of other traditional Irish comfort-food dishes.

The bar is wonderful with seating for about 20. They offer plenty of expected Irish Beer and Whiskey selections. They have a small patio for us smokers too.

Service is friendly, though it can be a little slow when they are really busy (lunch, happy hour and weekends).
