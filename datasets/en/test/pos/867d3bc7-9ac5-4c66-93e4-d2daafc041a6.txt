Top notch food and top notch service.  That is what you get at Capital Grille.

A few notes:

* The shrimp cocktail sauce lacks the kick of Mastro's "atomic" horseradish sauce and is blahhhhhhhh.

* I ordered the Delmonico steak which was awesome but I should not have gotten the porcini sauce/rub because I don't think balsamic vinegar belongs anywhere near a steak IMHO.

* Au Gratin potatoes had a wee too much garlic

* Lobster mac n' cheese = PHENOMENAL

Anyway, I wish I could eat here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day if money or having a heart attack wasn't an issue.
