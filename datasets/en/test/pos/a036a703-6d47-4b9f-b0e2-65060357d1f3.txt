Over a year later and still great. Went in on a Sunday afternoon for a late lunch and got the California burger (sans tomatoes and pickles). The avocado was fresh, the bun wasn't dry, and their "secret" sauce was still perfectly peppery and went great with the avocado and cheese. It's also one of the only places to get a lot of the soda they have on offer and today I chose a vanilla root beer from Barrel Brothers.

It seems that they bought most of the mini-mall they're in so there's more parking and will soon be a lot more seating. Good for them!
