Having been born and raised in N.W. Dropsonia this makes me an expert on grocery stores. And this one I like, the Mexican music makes me wiggle down the isles while I pick up the cheap and plentiful produce. It is not really any better produce than other grocers, but much less expensive. The meat counter cuts its meat in much thinner portions than others do. I prefer thin as apposed to fat. The already marinated chicken and beef is also quite good. The folks who work here are always very nice and helpful if one needs assistance.
