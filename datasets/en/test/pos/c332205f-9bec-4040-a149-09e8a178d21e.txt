Erik, the owner of Everything Just Works, is everything you could want from a computer repairman.  He accommodated my crazy schedule by meeting with me at 10pm at night.  He made sure that the parts we used were affordable, and even created a merchant account just to accommodate my preferred method of payment.  To top it off, Erik solved my laptop dilemma perfectly and at an extremely reasonable price. 

I will be personally recommending Erik to everyone I know in town for his personable, efficient service.
