Going in - you know your going to get typical TGIF food.  But the view is great!  If you're a sports junky you need to eat here once.  We took my grandfather, a sports nut, for lunch (hopped off the light rail) and he loved it.  As we ate lunch on the "patio" we watched as the landscapers groomed the field.  The top was open, the sun was shining, a breeze was blowing...ahhh..  The service was perfect.  Our server was funny - took time to chat and made sure we had what we needed as soon (or before) we needed it.
