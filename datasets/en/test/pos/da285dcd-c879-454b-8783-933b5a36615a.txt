I LalalalaLOVE this place! Their pizza is so delicious!!

I've been here many times and alway order my personal fave-- the margherita pizza!

The dough is just so amazing I can't even describe it. So good that it almost comes close to the amazing pizza dough in NY. [the water totally makes a different in the dough]

I also got an order of the wings. They were not your average hot wings. They were baked and had a tangy BBQish sauce to 'em. [can't even describe the taste but were yummy]

Plus, the restaurant is such a cute and trendy place to have dinner! It's almost always busy though even during the week! 

It's a must try!!!
