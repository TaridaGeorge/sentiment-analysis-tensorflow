Sing it one more time Bo Brooks! :) 

Cause got friends in low places,
where the whiskey drowns (with my ginger ale)
and the beer (in jugs) chases my blues away,
but I'll be okay 

Now I'm not big on social places (yeahhhh right!)
think I'll slip on to the Rustler's Rooste
Oh I got friends, 
in great places! (my prime rib was fat and yummy!)

I guess I was right this place I belong
and yes I will return, cause everythings alright, (and scenic I might add)
and I can't say goodnight, and I'll show myself to the dance floor, (live band awesome!)
Hey I did mean to cause a big scene, (my two step ain't all that :( )
just give me more than an hour and then, 
I'll be as high as South Mountain and you'll always know!!!
