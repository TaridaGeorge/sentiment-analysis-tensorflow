I had the BEST service at this shop! The staff was so nice, they helped me throughout my claim. They also have rental cars right on site to make the stop faster. My insurance company referred me to this shop, they are the top rated for State farm in the North West Valley. I am very pleased with the repairs on my car, especially with the clean up they did on it while it was there.
