Very pleased with everything.  I really hope they maintain the level of food quality and service.

We had a large half and half.  Half was a chicken and Potato with red onion, the other half was prociutto with artichoke and portabello mushroom.  

Both types were very tasty and the crust was exceptional(traditional).  It is a asiago baked crust.

For starters we had the fritters...these were so good.  They are made with pepper jack cheese so they are nice and spicy.

 The place has a great selection of beers.

They have a good happy hour as well.  Plus TVs throughout the place.

Our server was Zachary and he was great.  He took the time to explain everything to us.  

Give it a try...It is a good night out.  I plan on going back to try the carnitas pizza!!!
