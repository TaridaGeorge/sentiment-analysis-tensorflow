Two weeks after I dropped off my computer for service with the Geek Squad I got it back with a new screen and hand rest.  They said 3 weeks and I got it in two!!!  And the open-box computer I purchased to use while mine was in the shop was returned with no problems. 

I was so happy we purchased a new Toshiba DVD player for $40. Who knew that DVD players could be so cheap?  I've been using it all day and it works beatifully.
