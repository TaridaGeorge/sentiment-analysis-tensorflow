I'm a long time Babies'R'Us customer, but shopped at buybuy Baby today for a shower gift. Wow! BuybuyBaby blows every other store out of the water. They easily have 3-4x the inventory that Babies'R'Us has. The staff are super friendly, helpful and everywhere. I got the feeling that the employees wanted me to shop there. The selection is amazing. They have a TON of environmentally friendly items, no BPA plastic, organic clothing, stainless steel items, organic baby soaps, etc. They also carry a fantastic selection of breastfeeding products!! 

After you've paid, they have a FREE do-it-yourself gift-wrapping table. I was in heaven! They provide you with everything, including buybuy Baby wrapping paper and the most wonderful wide, satin cloth ribbon.  Sorry BRU, I'm breaking up with you. Buybuy Baby is my new store!
