I can't understand the poor customer service experiences. I love, love these ladies. They have always been very nice and helpful. 

I get a LOT of clothes tailored and I find their pricing to be fair and the quality of the work excellent.  

I've referred several people here and will continue to do so. Everyone has been satisfied. 

TIP: Be sure to call. As a small business, their hours sometimes fluctuate.
