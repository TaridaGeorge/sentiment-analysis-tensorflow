PetSmart is the only place you should be shopping for pet supplies because they're an Arizona-based business, and we should all be supporting the "shop local" movement. They always provide good customer service and I've never had an issue with returns.The company is also a good corporate  citizen, putting lots of money and effort into its charity division. The company supports homeless shelters and food service for people as well as all they do for homeless pets.
