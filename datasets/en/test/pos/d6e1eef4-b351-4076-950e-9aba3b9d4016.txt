This is my 99 cent store that I go to for all my 99 cent needs.  It's not in the best of neighborhoods and there is always someone asking for money or selling something in front of the store, but I just ignore and do my thing.  I like their selection of food, makeup, cleaning supplies, and toiletries.  Oh and their selection of spices!  They have a lot of good cooking spices here.  Love it!  Their store and bathrooms are clean.  The cashiers are really nice and helpful.


I like it, I love it, I want some more of it.......
