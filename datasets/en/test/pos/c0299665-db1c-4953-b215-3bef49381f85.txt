It may be a yoga-clothing place, but Lululemon makes the best workout clothes you're going to find anywhere. It's not cheap, but you'll get so much more wear, that it's worth it. I now have a closet full of Nike air and Adidas workout clothes that sit there while I rotate my Lulu stuff. These clothes are just more comfortable, lighter, more durable, and it feels good to wear.That's it.

This place originated in Vancouver and if you visit there you'll see that most everyone wears this stuff as they're running along the seawall. You don't have to do yoga to wear this stuff.
