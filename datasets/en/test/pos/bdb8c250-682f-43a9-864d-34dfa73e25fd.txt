Great group, great people, great classes!  Highly recommend getting on their mailing list and taking a class!  My most recent one was on pomegranates and the presenter was extremely knowledgeable...one of the "experts" on pomes in the valley.  I've taken classes with other groups on permaculture, but this group is by the best!!
