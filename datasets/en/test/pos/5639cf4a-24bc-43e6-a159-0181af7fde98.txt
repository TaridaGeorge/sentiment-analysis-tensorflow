Pretty much as good as it gets as far as BBQ is concerned. Ribs, coleslaw, cornbread,  peach tea..all awesome! Also the smokehouse burger is one of the best I've had.They also  bring these little doughnuts ( free) at the end that just melt in your mouth.. so delicious.  Service was great. Sit in Sawyers section. I hear Friday nights in the bar are a good time as well.
