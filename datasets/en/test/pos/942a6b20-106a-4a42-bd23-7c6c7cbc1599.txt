Wow, were us mid-westerners excited to see Jimmy John's here in Tempe!  It's a staple in Michigan, and for a reason.  They do it right!

I love the "Slim" options, which are plain subs without the meat ("Slim 6") or veggies for us picky ones.  I'm not sure what everyone else ordered because I was scarfing down mine...but all were happy!  

Service was fast and friendly too.  Now, if only we get get some of the people chowing on burgers and fries next door at 5 Guys to come over and order a healthy sub instead!
