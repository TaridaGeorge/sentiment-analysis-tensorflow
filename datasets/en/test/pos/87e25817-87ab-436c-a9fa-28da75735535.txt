Last night a group of us went to The Duce in downtown Phoenix. It. Was. Fantastic. An old 1928 brick warehouse, the space is all indoor/outdoor, the food is roach coach style, the speciality "vintage cocktails" are served in mason jars and the overall vibe is uber hip & comfortable. We bought some vintage Love Button jewelery, ate Chicago style hot dogs, meatball sliders and waffles while mingling with a magician and singing along to 60's tunes. What more could you ask for? Oh, bottomless fresh squeezed grapefruit mimosas for a dog friendly Sunday brunch? Sign me up. One of the coolest spots in Phoenix for sure. The service was a little slow but that didn't bother me as everyone was super nice and quite frankly - I wasn't in a hurry and didn't mind waiting for a drink. Two thumbs up.
