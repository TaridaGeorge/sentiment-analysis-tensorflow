We went here today for a "last day of internship" lunch for one of the girls at work.  The atmosphere is really great and it's really easy to carry conversations.  Two of us ordered salads and two ordered pizzas.  Everything was delicious!!  If I could give a separate 5 star review specifically for the Roasted Banana Zeppole I totally would.  Definitely treat yourself !
