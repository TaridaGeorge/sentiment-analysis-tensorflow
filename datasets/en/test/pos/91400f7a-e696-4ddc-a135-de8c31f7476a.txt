Just found our new favorite sushi place.  The food was impeccable... not simply the sushi, but the grilled items were wonderful (we had the terriyaki spareribs, and bacon wrapped scallops - yum!).  The sushi was done to perfection, the best tuna I've had in Phoenix.  The atmosphere was cozy (it is a small restaurant), but the staff is very helpful, from the hostess who seats you, to the bartender, to the wait staff and the manager.  We were welcomed at every opportunity.  When we arrived, we had a short wait for our table (even though we had a reservation).  While waiting, the bartender was incredibly helpful in his recommendations of the menu.  Then after we were seated, he even came over to see if everything was okay.  A very delightful experience all around.
