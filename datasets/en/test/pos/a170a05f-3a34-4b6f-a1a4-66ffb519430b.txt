I've never had their buffet.

But my family and I always enjoy their Dim Sum on Sundays or takeout.  

Also if you want to have the old fashion family style experience take a look at their menu and call ahead for some good Chinese classics.  They even have one of my favorites of bitter mellon and black bean.
