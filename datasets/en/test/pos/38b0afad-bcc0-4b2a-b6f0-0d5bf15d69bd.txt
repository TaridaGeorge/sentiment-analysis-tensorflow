This was our visit and we thouroughly enjoyed our meal.  What a perfect meal for one of the few cold nights we have here in Mesa/Phoenix. We had yummy dough filled with yummy stuff like pastrami, corned beef and saurkraut baked it is a warm golden brown.  What a deliscious take on a Reuben.  We also had a more traditional pasty with steak, potatos, and rutabagas.  Very good in that whole comfort food kind of way.

The only negative I would give is that the space is small and the noise level is high, but then so is a pub in the middle of London.
