Crepes... glorious crepes!  

I've frequented OPH for many, many years!  The quality, service and the decor (unfortunately) never changes.  

Things to know: 
They do not accept credit cards
They do not take reservations
They will only seat you when your entire party is there
The wait on the weekends is almost unbearable
The French Crepes are freaking amazing!
The Apple Pancake is delicious, slow and a modern miracle of baking
Dessert for breakfast? Chocolate Chip pancakes!
