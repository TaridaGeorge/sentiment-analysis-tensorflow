I'm updating to five well-deserved stars. 

The jidori chicken is so good, it even has me eating meat off the bone (I'm a boneless girl... no wings or ribs for me under ordinary circumstances. But, for this chicken I am compelled to make an exception)!! 

The pasta is perfectly salted and cooked. Hearty, fresh and delicious. 

I'm certain you cannot have a bad meal here. 

One of my favorite Valley restaurants!!
