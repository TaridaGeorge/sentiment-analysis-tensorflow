This little restaurant is just what you want out of your local pizza shop. The owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous. 
I work at a local elementary school and they are great helping us out with fundraisers and the like. They also give teacher discounts! 
Their lunch specials are great and there really isn't a whole lot of waiting when you order your food. Their pizza is delicious and their salads are fresh. 
Please drop by and give them your business!
