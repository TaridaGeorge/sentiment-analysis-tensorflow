Known for it's fabulous ribeye steaks, I have to say we have found our favorite place for Catfish, it is just delicious, and what a serving, Two big catfish fillets, served with mashed potatoes and gravy or steak fries, all for$12.00, you just cant beat it.

The Catfish is always fresh  and  Fabulous, the crisp batter is like no other, and the fish is flakey and YUM YUM!!!!!. 
The chichen fried steak, is no joke, enough for two and just AWESOME,tender and tastey served with mashed potatoes/gravy and homemade biscuits, the kind of stuff that sticks to your ribs, you will not go home hungery, that is for sure.
TEXAZ is a small place but it is cozy, parking can be a bear, but the food is worth it. Oh yeah, almost forgot , they do have a lovely pecan pie served a la mode if you like, DELICIOUS!
