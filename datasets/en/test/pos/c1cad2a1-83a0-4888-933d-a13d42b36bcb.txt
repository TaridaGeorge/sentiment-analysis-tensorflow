I consider myself so lucky to have found Dr. Amy Terlisner at Aletris Center of Integrative Medicine. Dr. Terlisner is one of the most knowledgeable, friendly and helpful doctors I have been to, and I've been to a lot! I was starting to doubt the ability of many doctors, especially traditional doctors who spend 5 minutes with you and write you a prescription but my experience with Dr. Terlisner was so much different! During my initial visit she spent an entire hour listening and asking questions and we went over my entire medical history in thorough detail. She ordered a complete blood analysis and showed me all the things I needed to do to get my body back in balance and I've been feeling so much better. I would highly recommend her to anyone in search of a naturopathic doctor, she's simply the best!
