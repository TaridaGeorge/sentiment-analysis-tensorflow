If you can find it you will enjoy it - It's a tiny place located around the FAR left side of the plaza on the NE corner of Hardy and University in Tempe.

The Pasty, I was informed, is a long ago English mining tradition. Which breaks down to it basically being a "Limey's" take on a burrito. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limey

We tried this for lunch on Sunday - Her cheese steak pasty was amazing, and my chicken pot pie pasty was delicious too. The crust is so so flaky, and the "oven chips" with jalape√±os were the best I've had. This is NOT fast food, so don't be in a rush when you visit.
