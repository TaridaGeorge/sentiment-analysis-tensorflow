Love it!  If you're a member, you get coupons in the mail, and occasionally coupons for free stuff...something Sam's doesn't do.

My friend first told me she thought she might be pregnant here.  (I suggested she get the Costco sized variety pack of pregnancy tests but she thought otherwise...)

Accepts credit cards, but only AMEX as far as I know.

I get my tires, much of my food, my TV, some clothes, booze, plants, etc all  here.  I heart Costco!

(One good thing/annoyance is when you get tires, they fill them with Nitrogen.  Lasts a long time, but most of the quickie oil change type places refuse to put regular air in your tires when you need a fillup..even though it's supposedly ok to do so)
