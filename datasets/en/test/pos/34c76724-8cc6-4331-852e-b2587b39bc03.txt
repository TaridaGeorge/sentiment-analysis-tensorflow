I am updating because I have since tried like 4 other cupcakes. I have begun to follow them on Twitter and as Richard Z has pointed out, they give away free ones every day. 

-The Pumpkin with Cinnamon Cream Cheese frosting. Could be their best one. 

- The Banana with Cream Cheese frosting. DIVINE!!! 

- The Banana with Milk Chocolate frosting. Great, but not as good as the above. Although the girl that helped me, looked like an angel. 

- The Peanut Butter Chip with Chocolate frosting. This was great too, but heard the Peanut Butter Chocolate is better. 

This place is getting me fat.
