In addition to my grocery shopping, I spent almost 20 minutes just looking thru and reading all of their sunscreen products.  Even though I asked multiple questions during that time all of the clerks were very kind, attentive and informative!  It was a wonderful experience and with their help, I even found exactly what I wanted.
