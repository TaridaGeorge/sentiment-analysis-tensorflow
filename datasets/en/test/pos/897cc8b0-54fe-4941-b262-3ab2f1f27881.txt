Bring yourself to this place. Your taste buds deserve it. 

The hummus and aioli make you want to spin in your chair. 

The chicken shwarma is fit for a King, both in taste and portion. 

The lemonade and baklava are fresh and delicious. 

A list of eclectic and cheap starters to invigorate your palate. 

I'm visibly heart broken that I don't live down the street from Haji's anymore. 

This is as good and as cheap as it gets. 

The waiters are characters too. Bring a date. Impress them with your worldly food tastes. 

I could keep going. I love this place.
