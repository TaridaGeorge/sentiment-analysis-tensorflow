Every time I am in Scottsdale, I come in here at least once. The food is fantastic, and the drinks are great, too. I love the space, & the dark wood beams against a light wall w/ dim lighting make it a spot for any occasion. The staff is very friendly & accommodating, & they will ensure you enjoy your visit. I HIGHLY recommend the Chopped Salad & the duck (if available), but all the food is wonderful. I highly recommend to anyone.
