My husband and I loved this place. It keeps things simple by telling you that all the items on the menu are 475 calories or less. This way you can just order and relax and noot sound like " could you pls just put my dressing on the side, grilled instead of fried pls, ect."  Our waiter james was awesome-  prompt and funny. Last thier piano bar singer was phenomenal. Will be back as soon as we can convince a family member to watch our kids again.
