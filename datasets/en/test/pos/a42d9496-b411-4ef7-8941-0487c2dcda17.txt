This place is my new favorite...everything on the menu is really delicious!  I keep going back and trying different things and continue to be happy.  The food is kind of traditional but very high quality...no funny meat here...The short rib panang Neur...is my favorite as is the port shoulder!  I love the sticky rice!!!
I only wish there was an Indian restaurant with these standards in our town:(
