Just tried Two Hippies Pita Shack, having noticed those bright pink and green neon lights along Camelback road. It was excellent, had 3 Pork tacos, chicken burrito (no beans), 1 cheese crisp and 1 brownie for $13.50.00 how does this place stay in business? Well they sure know how to feed the hippie soul and drive away the munchies. Inside there was tons of posters of hippie idols like Jim Morrison, Cheech and Chong, Beetles, etc, and tons of chachkas. Their Pork tacos were done just right and that food was pure joy, 
The lady behind the counter looked like 2nd or now 3rd generation hippy with a tie-dye-dead-heads style look. The guy cooking was obviously not hippie. 
But the place was cute, the food was great, and the price very hippie-reasonable--you rock "Two Hippies"!
