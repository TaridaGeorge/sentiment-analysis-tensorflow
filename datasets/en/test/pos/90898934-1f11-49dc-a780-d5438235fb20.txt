Courtyard is my preferred choice of hotel whenever I am travelling.  My only complaint is the design of the rooms, with the TV being on the side of the bed.  It makes it hard to watch anything without getting a crick in your neck.

I stayed at this Courtyard for one night.  The room was large and clean.  The bed was comfortable and I had a good nights sleep.   The water pressure in the shower was perfect.  They even extended my check-out 4 hours to accomodate my late flight out of Phoenix.
