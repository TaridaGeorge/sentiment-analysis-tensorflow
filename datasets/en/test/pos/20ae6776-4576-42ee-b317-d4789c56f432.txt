This pizza is soo good! It reminds me of the pizza you would get on the Jersey shore. The slices are big and the sauce is very flavorful. Their prices are very reasonable too. And the best part? The tiramisu. You wouldn't think dessert would be that good coming from a pizza place, but man. This stuff is amazing and the perfect size and price.
