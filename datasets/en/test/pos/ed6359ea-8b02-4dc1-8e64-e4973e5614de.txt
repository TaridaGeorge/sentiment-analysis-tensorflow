We came here on a recommendation from a Pheonix local me and my coworker knew AND on a recommendation from our hotel shuttle driver. If it was recommended by two locals, it has to be good, right? It was! We had the kobe burgers that came with cheese and sauteed mushrooms. It was excellent, the burger was full of flavor and quite large. We also tried the creme brulee shake...delish! Also the zuchinni fries and the sweet potato fries are a must have. We ordered way too much food for the two of us to finish but it was well worth the visit...we left full and satisfied. I'd recommend this to other people visiting the area.
