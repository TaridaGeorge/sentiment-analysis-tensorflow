I totally heart the Welcome Diner because:

There are 7 seats. Maybe 8. (inside)

The cook (Andy?) is super friendly and apologizes if it takes more than mere moments to get your food.

The Garfield fried egg sandwich will knock your little socks off.

If the Garfield knocks your socks off, then the french fries with onions and peppers will knock everything off you, leaving you happily, nakedly enjoying you food.

And because there are only really like 5 menu items. Eggs somehow, hamburgers somehow, hot dogs somehow, french toast in a cup (what? yes) , and some other thing maybe. 

Normally I hate cash only, but this gets a pass. It seems right to pay cash.
