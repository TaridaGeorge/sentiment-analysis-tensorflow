Love Costco!!! I really like the low prices and the great quality. The return policy is unbelievable. Even if you don't have a receipt, they look it up with your Costco ID. I haven't ever had a problem with returning something. I have been in the returns line and wondered why in the world they were allowing someone to return something as the person clearly abused the return policy.  I've used the optical dept and was very pleased. I didn't realize my vision was so poor. Thank you for the great care and service. I will always be a Costco customer because I know they stand behind their word. Costco is all about customer service and I'm sold on that.
