SPICE HEAVEN!!!

If you love to cook, bake, grill- whatever, you will absolutely die when you walk in this place! They have every single spice you can imagine (over 40 types of Cinnamon for example... who knew that was possible?!?). They have a variety of specialty spices in rare raw and pure form, as well as blended spices and seasonings for different forms of cooking. 

One of my favorite purchases is the Vanilla Bean Sugar. It's just pure white sugar with fresh vanilla bean mixed it- I love to sprinkle a little in my morning Oatmeal! Delish! 

If you're stuck on what to buy Mom for Mother's Day, or maybe a bridal shower gift- pick up one of their pre-made gift baskets or customize one to suite that person's kitchen hot buttons! 

This place is a must visit- you will definitely not walk out empty handed!
