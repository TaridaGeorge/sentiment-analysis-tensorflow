One year the local rag reader mag.  voted this place in the annual "best" issue... "The best place to take someone from Tucson to make them feel like they are in Tucson"  This is a compliment.  I love pita jungle.  The Chicken and humus appetizer is great... get the humus half red pepper and half jalape√±o.  Also, the Menchilada is enough grub for a few days.
