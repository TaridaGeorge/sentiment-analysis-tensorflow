$5 burgers on Mondays. Get it.

My girlfriend and I got there at 5:45 to make sure that we snagged a table, as I have seen a long wait for burger Mondays. We ordered a drink and then waited for 6pm when $5 burgers start. Of course the special $5 burger is only one burger and they pick a different one every week, but you can bet your pants that it will be delectable. I had the peanut butter burger...sounds gross? Not even. It had a silky, creamy dollop of peanut butter on it and BACON strips. It was a harmony of taste that I never dreamed could be possible. Go Vig! (and my drinks were strong and good - keep 'em coming, guys).
