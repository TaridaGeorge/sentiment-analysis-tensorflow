I'm from seattle so Sushi is a common staple in my diet, and I'm very picky about quality, and presentation. While in Arizona for spring training my sister took me here, my son and I were wary about Sushi in the desert being somewhat picky from seattle.
Wow! Not only is this Great Sushi, but top 2 all time for me and I've been to Japan! 
Size matters here, the rolls are huge!, quality of ingredients are top notch and presentation is well thought out and fun! The catapillar, amazing!

My son and I rave about this place up here in washington. wish there was more like this.

The head Sushi Chef comes out and greeted us and was very inviting, a must next time i'm in AZ!
