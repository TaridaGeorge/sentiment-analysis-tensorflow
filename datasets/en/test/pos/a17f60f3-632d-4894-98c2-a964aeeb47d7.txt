if you need gas and coffee (or soda) in PHX, QT is the only way to go. for 99 cents you can make yourself a coffee drink however you want, and if you don't like it you can pour it out and start over, just ask my wi-fi.

my buddies came to visit from out of town, and the two things they liked best about Phoenix were QT and the vast assortment of whorehouses masquerading as starbucks coffee shops. you didn't think all those people go there for the $4.75 lattes, did you?
