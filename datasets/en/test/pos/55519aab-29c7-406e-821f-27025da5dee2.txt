It doesn't get better than PARS. The best pita, beef dishes, and rice dishes around. Be sure to get the Zeresk polo- my favorite- it's a basmati long grain rice with barberries. It's great with anything, but I prefer the Koobideh! 

I love saying Koobideh- but it's even better than it sounds! 

If it wasn't for the whiney 13 year old who wrote the review below mine, this place would be unanimous 5 stars. It earned every one.

I met Masoud the owner / chef when he was putting up the sign to the restaurant. Great guy- really cares about the food. High quality, everything is fresh and vibrant. One of my all-time favorite spots. Enjoy.
