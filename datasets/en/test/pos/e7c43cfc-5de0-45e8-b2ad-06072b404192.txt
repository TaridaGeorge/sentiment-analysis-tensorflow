Yes!!!  Finally!!!  YAYYY!!!  The world and Tempe needs more places like this.  Besides the fact that our food was delicious, everything is organic 'except the coke products'.  Plus, a lot of their ingredients are local to boot!  We had the hummus, yum, with pita bread and veggies (a nice spread of veggies, not just carrots and celery) followed by the Chicken Pesto Pizza, double yum.  AND the prices are very reasonable!  I strive for a mostly organic diet, which is not cheap, so...I'm not sure what some of these other reviews are talking about, but I think the prices are great!

Thank you Herbs n' Flavors for making an organic life style a little bit easier!
