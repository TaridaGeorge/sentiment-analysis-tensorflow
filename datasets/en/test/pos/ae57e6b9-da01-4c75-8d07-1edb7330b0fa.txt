I came here about a year ago and took the usual freeway to freeway to freeway route of most destinations in Arizona.  I recently discovered a more direct route (from where I live) driving up Tatum Blvd/ Cave Creek Rd. 

I like this park because it is detached enough from urban to Phoenix to feel as if you are truly in the desert.  My trail of choice is the "Go John" Trail, the longest in the park.  It's about 5 miles in length, though at times it seems as if one of those miles is UP at times.  Parking is plentiful, and keep an eye out for some desert wildlife!
