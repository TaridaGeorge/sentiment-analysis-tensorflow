I just had my rear window re-tinted by Lenny and the Tint Wizard on the Greenway-Hayden Loop in Scottsdale. Great job and excellent service by an owner operator establishment! No upsale and I HIGHLY recommend them, so next time you need your windows tinted pass on the hard sell car wash guys and stop in and see Lenny. You will be glad you did.
