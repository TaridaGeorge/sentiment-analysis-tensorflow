Love this Chinese place! It's like good Chinese we used to be able to get back on the East Coast. Their menu is similar to most, but their duck sauce (in the fridge) is so good!! The kids meal option is great, and enough for at least 2 kids to share. I love their chicken and brocolli, fried rice and their egg rolls are good too! I am happy to finally find good Chinese in our area. Give it a try!
