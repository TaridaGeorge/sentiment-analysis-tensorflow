I have eaten seafood all over the world, and generally the best is south of I-10 in Louisiana and Mississippi.  However, the Wildfish Grill was wonderful.  The crab-fried rice was almost indescribable.  The swordfish was great!  Salads, sides, everything was top-shelf.  But the thing that took Wildfish from 4.5 stars to 5 stars was the Pineapple Upside Down Cake.  Good grief!  My mom would be jealous!
