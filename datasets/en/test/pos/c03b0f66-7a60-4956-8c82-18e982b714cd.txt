I had never heard of Sweet Republic until a week ago.  I knew they were celebrating their birthday by giving away free single scoops of ice cream.  I read several reviews and not one of them had anything bad to say about it.  I am now one of those reviews.  This place is awesome.  I had the brownie swirl.  Love it.  Check this place out.  They also have sorbet.
