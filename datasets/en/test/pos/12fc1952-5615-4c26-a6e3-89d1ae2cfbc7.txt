They now serve cheap and fresh breakfast now, think they open at 7am.   I had the bbq ribs and my wife had the brisket sandwich.   We both LOVED IT.   Also had the peach cobbler and the honny bunnies....OMG!!!  Amazing, absolutely amazing.     I'm going to check out the breakfast, seen the menu which is pretty small but its a great price and I know it will be fresh.   5 stars baby!    Loved it.
