At the suggestion of another yelp review, we ordered the salt and pepper squid (9.95) which was very good albeit... salty. The broth of the pho wasn't as rich as some places but still tasty.
Service was great and quick.
Ben for some reason really likes tendon so our server recommended the combination which he was thoroughly pleased with. He'd never tried tripe and now I'm afraid he likes that as well... We also ordered spring rolls, which I think are exactly the same regardless of restaurant.
