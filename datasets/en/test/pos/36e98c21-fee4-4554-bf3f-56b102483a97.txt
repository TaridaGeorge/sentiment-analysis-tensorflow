I know I don't live here anymore, but I remember hitting up Vincent Market Bistro on the weekend after a nice hike up Camelback. This is a great place to just come, relax, and enjoy a nice weekend  brunch.

The food is fresh and outstanding, and as always, the service is perfect.

Great place to take people who are in town visiting for a truly exceptional meal.
