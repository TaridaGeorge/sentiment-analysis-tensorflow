The guy who mentioned that the Italian Grotto was better was demented.  Francos is well priced, very good food, not the junky regulr Italian food but refined Italian food like you get in Italy.  Prices VERY WELL PRICED, small intimate.  The owner has such passion, he is allover the restaurant helping and greeting people.  Where can you get a 3 course meal for two with a decent bottle of Italian wine for less that a $100. Go its worth it.

Italian Grotto makes me laugh
