My husband and I have been to a couple of the Pita Jungles and we love it! Healthy menu especially right after a good workout! The ambience at this location is very cool. The employees were friendly and fun! I like to get the sampler platter so I can have a taste of everything! We like to go on Saturday afternoons and catch whatever game is playing on the tube. I could see how they would get crowded and loud at night! First visit, go early so you can get educated on the menu and take in the atmosphere!
