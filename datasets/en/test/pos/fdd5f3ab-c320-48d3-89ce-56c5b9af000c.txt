I've been going to Scott's Training Systems (formerly Body By Scott) for 3 years, and have gotten into the best shape of my life as a result of my structured workouts and recommended meal options. 

You may have seen Scott on 3TV as he is often interviewed for health and fitness segments. Scott and his team of skilled trainers work with regular people like me, but also many award-winning professional body-builders (he also competes from time to time), bathing suit competitors and Ms. AZ contestants. The studio is bright and clean, and the equipment ranges from weights, ropes, kettle balls and state of the art machines. STS just started offering group training classes which I hope to check out soon too.
