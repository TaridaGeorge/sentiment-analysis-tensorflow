Calabria is known for their awesome selection of Italian meats and cheeses. I also think their roasted peppers are the best I've ever tried.

I live in Northern CA now, but use to frequent this place a lot. Especially when me and my girl wanted to make our own antipasto plates. 

I like the sandwiches too, but go here if you want to get very good deli meats and make your own sandwiches. 

DONT FORGET THE PEPPAS
