I love this place... i had something that was the greatest hangover meal ever.... it had bacon, eggs, cheese, and hash browns all mixed together.  they also have fresh squeezed OJ which i always a nice touch for breakie...

though to go with  a large group but solo at the bar is nice... you should check this place out...
