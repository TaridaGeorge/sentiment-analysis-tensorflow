After checking several kennels, or "pet resorts" in the area, I settled on Elite.   It is really a nice place, far better than anywhere else that I visited.  The owners are very friendly and you can tell that they enjoy what they do.  I have been taking my Lab to Elite for the past couple years, and will continue to do so.   My only complaint is their hours, it would be nice if they were extended a bit, or at a minimum they were open on Sunday.
