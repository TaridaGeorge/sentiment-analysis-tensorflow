Great service today.  Popped in to get a new phone and the whole process took under 25 mins.  Yosef and Leslie were very friendly and answered any and all questions.  They didn't pressure me and were understanding when I didn't fall for the mandatory overpriced accessory upsell.  Overall, great experience.  Cheers to Yosef and Leslie for great service.
