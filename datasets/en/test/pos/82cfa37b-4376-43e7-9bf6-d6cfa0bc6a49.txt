I haven't used this place yet but I stopped in with a friend who was looking for some glasses and I was impressed.

It's just a small store in metro center mall but they have some great frames. The guy who runs the joint helped us out and made suggestions on frames to fit her face and similar selections to those she liked. He really knew his product.

He also had great knowledge of the prescriptions and what he could do with each frame shape and size. he was a tad eccentric which added to my belief that he is a goddamned genius. I took a few extra cards from him to hand out. I will definately be going back for my next pair of glasses. 

The prices are also more than reasonable.
