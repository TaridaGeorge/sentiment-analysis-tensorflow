We had our reception at the Zoo and it was absolutely perfect.  The event staff was on-the-ball and were very helpful.  However, the greatest part of this experience was working with Kelly, one of the Zoo's Social Event Sales Representatives.  Kelly was helpful, a saint when it came to patience, and made the whole experience less stressful for us.  It was a joy working with her.  My guests loved the whole experience, from the animal encounters at our cocktail hour to the venue sites.  They loved the whole thing.  I highly recommend the Phoenix Zoo for your event and would absolutely work with Kelly again.  Great job!
