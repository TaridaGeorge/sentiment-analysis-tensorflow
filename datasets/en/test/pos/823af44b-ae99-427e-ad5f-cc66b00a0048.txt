This place is simply delicious.  I heard about it from friends who live back east where Ritas is a household name and decided to try it for myself.  The custard is of the perfect consistency and goes great with the fresh everyday flavored ice.  Great place, try it.  Not the cheapest so if you are looking for less than quality flavored ice and not concerned with value, stay away.
