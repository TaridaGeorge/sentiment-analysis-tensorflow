A Real Gem!

The salon is conveniently located in a strip mall across from Frys grocery store and is nicely decorated with a roman theme. It's clean and bright interior make it very welcoming.

I arrived shortly after 6pm and only had to wait a few minutes. Gerry promptly started working on my nails and I must say I was hesitant at first to be trying somewhere new but Gerry's attention to detail was most impressive. Not only did carefully craft each nail he checked to insure consistency with the other nails. Being a designer who's all hung up on consistency 50 hrs a week, I was very impressed. His level of expertise is off the chart.
