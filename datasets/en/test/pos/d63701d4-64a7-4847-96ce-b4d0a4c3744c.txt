I love this Petsmart, a girl name Amber cuts my little girl's hair and it always looks amazing.  The price is okay, I wish I could get coupons to help with ticket price.  But, when she comes out, she looks amazing.  I love the service, the people, the vet, the nurses... everyone there including people at the register are really nice.  A pleasure going there.
