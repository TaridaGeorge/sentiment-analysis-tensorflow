Absolutely amazing food! We love going to Fresh Mint. Always good. We have tried numerous dishes and every time it just gets better and better. If you work around the area, their lunch specials are affordable and taste amazing as well. Oh and if you want dessert, try their Mango Tapioca. Wow wow wow! Oh and we aren't vegetarians but Fresh Mint is just too good to not go to when we are in the Scottsdale area.
