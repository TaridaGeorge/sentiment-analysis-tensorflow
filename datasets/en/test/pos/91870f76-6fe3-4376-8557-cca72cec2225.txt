Hands down the best place to eat while at Terminal 3.  Lots of selection, and tastes fresh rather than microwaved.  Chicken Salad sandwich is my favorite, along with a small Caesar.  I would agree with a previous reviewer, sometimes they put too much dressing.  But you get a free cookie (YUM) with your meal and the people here have always been pleasant and cheerful that helps put a grumpy traveler in a better mood.
