Went here a couple weeks ago for our one year anniversary.  It was amazing!  We had desserts and menus personalized for our anniversary, and the food and service was great.  We both went for the $40 3 course meal.  The grounds at the Royal Palms were amazing!  This was the best meal we have eaten in a long time!  

The best dessert ever! My wife had a creme brulee cheesecake and I had a chocolate hazelnut cake.  Both dessert plates had "Happy Anniversary" written on them in chocolate ganache.   At the end of the dinner, they brought us over a souvenir menu that had "Happy Anniversary June 28, 2009" written on the bottom.  Would go back again and again!
