I've been eating at Miracle Mile ever since I can remember, initially at the old Christown Mall location.  For my youth, it was the only Jewish/American deli I knew.  It's still great after all these years and location changes.  I've since eaten at a few deli's that can top it, but not by much.

I'm not going to run down everything I've eaten over the years; you know what deli's have to offer and this place is no exception.  Get your matzo/pastrami/corned beef/chicken soup on, homey!
