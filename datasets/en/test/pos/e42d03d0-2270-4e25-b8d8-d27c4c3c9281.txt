Wow.  This amazing place is tucked away just north of Thunderbird on 51st. Ave.  I was pleasantly surprised today at the service and quality of the food.  The chocolate croissant was light as a feather and amazing.  The coffee superb.  I was told they have home made New England Clam Chowder on Fri and Sat.  I cant wait.
