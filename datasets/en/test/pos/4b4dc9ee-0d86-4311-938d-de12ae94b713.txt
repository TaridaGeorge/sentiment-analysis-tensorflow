This is THE place to come for nitro-powered helicopters; nobody else in Phoenix is really supporting them like they do here.  The help and advice they've given me has been amazingly valuable and they are always friendly and supportive to people just learning to fly.

Other strengths are electric helicopters, and nitro and electric planes.  Pretty much anything that flies is well-supported here from beginner to expert.  

Cars and non-flying models are also available.  They even have a flight sim you can use in the shop, and have weekend flying get-togethers.  Really a shop that supports the hobby rather than just looking to make a buck.
