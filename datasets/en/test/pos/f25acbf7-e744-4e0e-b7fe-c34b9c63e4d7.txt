Hands down my favorite place to eat in Tempe. Food is ALWAYS good. Service, always friendly and timely served. I love that they promote local artists and it helps the atmosphere feel cozy and downhome. I'm fully convinced I'll never find a better greek salad or garlic dip. Wow. Thinking about it makes me wish I were back at ASU. Two thumbs, way up!
