Brent from Off Camber is fantastic!  I've been going to Brent for years- faithfully following him from two salons because it really doesn't get better.  He's always consistent and my hair always turns out beautifully. 

They have a pretty cool online booking system- it sends reminders on appointments and even emails a receipt.

Thanks, Brent!  Good luck with the new place!
