I'm writing this review from a comfie seat in the Copper Star cafe itself, using its free wifi. For a laptop-wielding downtown resident like myself, outlet accessibility is as important as wifi and this place gets the thumbs up. The owner and staff are very friendly. They seem genuinely delighted to see every customer walk in. The place is fairly packed and I recognize the faces of at least two fellow downtown professionals as I sit here. The coffee is good. The scones are excellent. The ambiance reflects exactly what I look forward to as the future of downtown Phoenix:  scaled down, unpretentious but urban; loft-like bricks and open ductwork. Given its proximity to my home, I'll probably spend many weeknights here when I have late projects.
