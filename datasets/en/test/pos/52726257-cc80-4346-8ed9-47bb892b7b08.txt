Only second time I came here, and this is the only fast food place I'll 5 star.

- The workers actually greet you and are ready to take your order when you enter.

-They bring- yes, bring, the food to you when it is ready. 

-It's not a hot mess like most joints, although there are usually roudy kids running around the play area.

-They *gasp* say thank you! And more than just once too, AND ask you if you'd like a refill if you're hanging by the front with your cup??



If you're like me, you like spicy..

Check out #4, Spicy Chicken Sandwich meal, blows Jacks Spicy Chicken out of the water. Is a little better than Wendy's Spicy Chicken Sandwich.

Please - - open on sundays, dammit.
