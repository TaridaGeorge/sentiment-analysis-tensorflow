I heard this place was a welcomed return to the  neighborhood so my wife and I checked it out last Saturday night; we were so happy that we did. We started with a suggested appetizer and a nice glass of red wine. The appetizer was delicious; a great selection of cheese, meats and some grilled artichokes. The menu offered classic Italian homemade pastas and how could I resist; even our waiter was Italian. We were both too stuffed for dessert but we will be back to try some.
