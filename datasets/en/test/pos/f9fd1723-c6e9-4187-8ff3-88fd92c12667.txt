Grassroots fills a severely underserved creative Farm-to-Table niche in central Scottsdale.

We thoroughly enjoyed a full front-to-back dinner, starting with the Grocery Bag Appetizer and the Pork Belly Appetizer, and enjoying the Red Fish Entree. 

Our dinner guests enjoyed the Ahi Entree and Baby Back Ribs Entree, which are also highly recommended.

We are pleased to report that you will not be disappointed with a visit to Grassroots Kitchen & Tap.

The one downside is that I don't believe they have a Twitter page, so it is difficult to rave to the Twitterverse about how great they are, and I couldn't find a website either.
