I've ordered delivery from here twice. Once, 12 minutes before closing time for me and my husband, and another time on a Saturday with my family. Both times the orders were 100% accurate and on time. The food is absolutely delicious and doesn't feel wet with grease or overly salty (I didn't say it wasn't, I just said it didn't feel that way....we all know the sin in chinese food). We have gotten the kung pao chicken, vegetarian lo mein, and orange chicken. All were fantastic.
