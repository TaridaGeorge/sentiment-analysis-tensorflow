I've been meaning to write this review forever, and I always forget.  Finally!

This little store is the most awesome costume and party store every.  It's not huge, and it's pretty unassuming from the street, but I have never failed to find what I need (usually and then some) when I shop here.

Not just Halloween costumes (although their selection is really extensive and great value for excellent quality), but a great selection for every holiday.  Party decorations, novelties, you name it.  I personally have purchased such things here as a disco ball rig, a rubber gag mouse, and a really great selection of Mardi Gras beads and masks. 

They have one of the best costume wig selections anywhere in the Valley, and the full line of Ben Nye and other high quality stage make up items.

The people are awesome too, and always friendly and helpful.
