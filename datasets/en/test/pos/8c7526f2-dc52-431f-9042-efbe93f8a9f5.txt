This was the first trader Joe's that I ever shopped at and I have been a fan ever since (to the point that I drove 25 miles each way to shop at the closest one to me in MN).  The selection of vegetarian food is great and you just can't find better wine at the prices that they sell it for.  I agree with Lauren V. that you'll need to round things out at another store (for me it's typically kid stuff or cleaning stuff), but Trader Joe's is great for just about everything else!
