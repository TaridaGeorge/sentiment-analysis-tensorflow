I'm obsessed with this place.  I feel bad for just getting around to reviewing it.  We go every Thursday.  Food alone this place is 5+ stars, it's so fun to sit on the traditional side.  Bring out of town guests.  I am not vegetarian but prefer the vegetarian ethipioian food.  Everything is good but I love all the lentil dishes, the cauliflower floret crunch and the Ethiopian coffee with Orange coffee cake is AMAZING!  Service is hit or miss and I mean really hit or miss.  Go early when the crowd is small.  It seems as if there is always one server working.  When it gets busy, make yourself comfortable. :)
