Robert catered the Xavier College Preparatory Holiday Auction on November 12th, 2011 for over 500 people. The food was the best of any catered event I have ever attended before! He used a family recipe for the yummy strawberry cheesecake dessert. He handled the event with linens, tables, chairs, food prep and serving with his own tableware service. The service was remarkable and everything went off perfectly. As a co-chair of this event, I highly recommend Robert and was only sorry about one thing...that we did not know to use him for the floral centerpieces too...because he could have handled that job beautifully too I'm sure. I highly recommend him and his company for your next event!!
