A lazy sunday afternoon
sadly however this would involve no cupcakes or narnia
but rather two brothers and their schwinns perusing cen pho
lil bro and i cruise by this awesomely funky little house covered in art head to toe, inside and out
so we stop in to smell the roses
and conspire doesnt fail to deliver
for $3.50 we order ourselves a large iced coffee, deliciously strong
a sign on the inside cautions: "there is no such thing as strong coffee only weak men!" so maybe i should say...flavorful instead of strong lol
at any rate conspire is probably one of the coolest little secrets in the valley. cheers! i hope to be back every time i visit mi hermano in cen pho ^__^
