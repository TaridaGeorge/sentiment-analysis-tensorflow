This Dunkin Dounuts,is very well located. Right off the freeway. It is a really clean store and they also always have coupons. I ordered a Breakfast sandwich and coffee.  By the time i had my coffee ready my food order was totally ready. Their coffee is very godd . I also buy it for home.                                                                                                                      They are very fast, friendly and It is a quick stop when you are in a hurry. They even have a drive thru. Lots of parking as well.
