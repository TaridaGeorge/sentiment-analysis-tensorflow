OMG, try the Peach Beer ladies, you'll be ordering beer all night, for the TASTE for once!!!!  We were visiting from SoCal for Spring Training and the hotel clerk recommended this place.  It was just a 15 minute drive from our hotel.  The food was amazing, the beers are great.  The service was great.  We had to wait a little while for seating, but it was worth the wait.  Food came out almost immediately, but not over or under done.  They must know what they are doing in that kitchen!!!!!!  

I will definitely eat here again when we are back for Spring Training next year!  GOOOOO DODGERS!!!!
