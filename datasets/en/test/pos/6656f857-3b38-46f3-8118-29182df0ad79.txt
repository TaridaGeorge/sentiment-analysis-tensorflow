As far as hot dogs go this place PWNS all. Nothing better than a wonderful grilled hot dog. This place is simple and yummy! I have also had the grilled chicken sandwich was amazing. If you live here and like hot dogs but haven't been to Ted's you need to re-evaluate your life and get a hold of yourself.
