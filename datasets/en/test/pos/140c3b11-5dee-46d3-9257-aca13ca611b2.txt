I just went to my first show at the Mesa Arts Center, in the Ikeda Theatre. It is a beautiful venue with great acoustics. It clearly a great mix of technology and architectural style. I was very impressed. What is best to me is that it wasn't elbow to elbow with pretentious types of people which you would expect to be herded with in these types of venues. 
This is clearly a place to see great musicians and artists. 
The grounds and classrooms are very nice to walk and observe on a cool October evening. Look to see what they have coming, and go out and enjoy.
