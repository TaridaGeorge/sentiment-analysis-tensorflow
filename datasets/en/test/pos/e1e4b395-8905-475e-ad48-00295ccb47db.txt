The pies are really good and the staff (at least my experience) was excellent. 

My friends and I have this dinner club; we try to get out and try new spots every Tuesday. We arrived with about 10 people. We didn't wait long for seats, our food came out fairly quickly, the server was personable (always a good thing!) and had great suggestions. We were taken very good care of.

The design of The Parlor was very attractive. The low lighting and booths seemed like it would be a great place for a more intimate night. 

I can't remember all the pies we had, but the most memorable was the Yukon Gold Potato with and egg on top. It was surprisingly good. 

I've had better pies, but this place is excellent in my opinion. 5 stars for superb food and service.
