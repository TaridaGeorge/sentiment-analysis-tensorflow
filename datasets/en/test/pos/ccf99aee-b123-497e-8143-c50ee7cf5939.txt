I eat there four or five times each week.  I love the Chinese food the best, but my wife like the sushi as well.  Today I had the Hawaiian BBQ pork.  The flavor was delicious.  The restaurant is family owned with fast tasty home style food and friendly service.  The portions are large with fair prices.  I have tried most everything on the menu and I enjoyed every meal.  You can't go wrong eating there.  I highly recommend Asian Island.
