I scheduled my dog for grooming and I was a little nervous, because this was the first time I had taken her to Crossroads Veterinary Hospital.  

But all doubt was erased when the groomer arrived and it was Scott, the dog trainer.  He taught the canine obedience classes that we took with our puppy.  I immediately knew that my dog was in good hands.  Scott listened to my concerns about my dog's sensitive skin and assured me he would use the oatmeal shampoo.

When I picked up my dog she was all smiles, sparkling clean and super soft. The staff was friendly and helpful and the place is really clean.  I will definitely be back.
