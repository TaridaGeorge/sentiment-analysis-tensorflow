Best Calamari ever. I'm talking in the USA-so far. First time eating at this restaurant, thanks to my son who found it first. We both love calamari done right. Light and crispy and chewy. The place is elegantly comfortable. I'll be going back. Also, no problem parking and our server was from Rome so for a few hours we spoke Italian and almost forgot we were in Phoenix.
