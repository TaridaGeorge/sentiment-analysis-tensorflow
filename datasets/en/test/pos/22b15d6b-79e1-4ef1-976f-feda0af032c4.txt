Back again last night for a third time.  I love it when a restaurant can accomodate us by modifying an item.  The Grilled Chicken soup was converted to a strictly vegetarian version and the bowl was HUGE.  My wife finished it because it is favorite thing to eat.  They added tofu and changed the broth to a miso-like broth.  Mmmmmm!  It had numerous pieces of fish cake.  Great udon noodles and loaded with vegetables.  The sushi was good as always.  And Pat makes you feel like you're an old friend.  We always leave happy.
