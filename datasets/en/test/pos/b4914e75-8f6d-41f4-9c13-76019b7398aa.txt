The employees always ask if I'm finding what I'm looking for, but in a genuine way. Prices are reasonable. I love this place. 

The products sold are of consistent, exceptional quality and there are many things that I buy here that other grocers cannot replicate: frozen mango chunks, blueberry muesli, pulled BBQ chicken, perfectly prepared frozen meals...the list goes on! 

There are ALWAYS samples being served.  Whether it's fresh sliced pineapple and French vanilla ice cream, or Swedish meatballs with homemade dipping sauce, or any other amazing product, you can always look forward to chatting with the designated sample-giver. 

Yes, my friends in Colorado should be very, very jealous of this neighborhood market. They don't know what they're missing!
