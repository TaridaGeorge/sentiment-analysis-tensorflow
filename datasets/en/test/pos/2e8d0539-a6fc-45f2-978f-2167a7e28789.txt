Solid 5 stars for an overall great experience.  This is my favorite kind of spot -- with excellent food and service, but without any of the pretentiousness that is often found at top restaurants.  

The food was inventive and excellent.  The braised leaks lived up to the high marks given by others.  Our lamb entree was also a highlight.  

The service was super.  Joshua was friendly and engaging.  We took all his recommendations on ordering and was very happy with his choices.

If you plan to have wine, I recommend skipping the main wine list that is exclusively Arizona wines and asking for the "Plan B" list with other (better) options.
