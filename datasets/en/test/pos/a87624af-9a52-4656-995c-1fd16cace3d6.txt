This shop is great! They are fast, know their stuff and have helped me with everything from a custom piece, to repairing my favorite super delicate necklace.  I can't say enough good things.  Location is super easy as well - I park at Sears at PV mall and walk right through and the shop is right there.  Great staff - Great work - So glad I found them!
