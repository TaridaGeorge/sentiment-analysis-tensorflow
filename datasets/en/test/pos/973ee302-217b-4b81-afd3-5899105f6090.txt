Awesome service! Everyone from the hostess at the front, our server and then when we were leaving. 

We stopped by to eat before boarding our flight home to Los Angeles. 
Ordered the taco beef short rib, the Howie burger and side of fries. 
I can't describe how juicy my burger was!! Medium rare...oozing cheese and tender saut√©ed red onions. 
The short rib was also flavorful and loved the dark crispy pieces. 
The fries....what can I say? It's crispy, thin, seasoned lightly and just darn heavenly good!

As you walk out of the restaurant, you can grab a salty chocolate chip cookie!
