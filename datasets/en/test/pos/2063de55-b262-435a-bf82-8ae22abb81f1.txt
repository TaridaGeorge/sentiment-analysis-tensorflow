Are you listening Olive Garden management?  The hostesses were very friendly when greeting us as we walked in.  And the service?  Ashley was an AMAZING server.  I can't even think of enough compliments .  We were totally indecisive and she recommended wines and entrees and never rushed us as we looked over the menu.  Perfect timing for refills, etc., and seemed genuinely friendly and smiling.  I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone, it has proven that good customer service does still exist!!!
