Wow, what a hidden gem!  

Went on a Tuesday night at it was completely dead.  Don't judge a book by it's cover.  Despite being in a bad neighborhood, the interior is very modern and clean.  

We ordered sizzling rice soup, bean curd with mushrooms and bok choy and egg fried rice.  Everything was delicious!  The bean curd dish was very unique.  You could tell it was very fresh, not slathered in MSG and microwaved (like some Chinese restaurants).  

This is my new favorite go-to Chinese place!  Go to Prime people!  You won't regret it.  

Service was very friendly too.
