Really love this place, many of my co-workers and I go over and sit and drink every break at work.  The workers there are just amazing they all greet you with a warm smile and a cheery hello.  Not to mention their drinks are by far better then those of Starbucks.  So all around this is the place to be when you get that coffee craving.
