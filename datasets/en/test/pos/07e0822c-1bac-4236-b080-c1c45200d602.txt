Scottsdale's Best Breakfast Restuarant! I'm in here 2-3 times a week. Service is great! Food is out and ready within 5-10 minutes after ordering. Also, they have one of the healthiest breaskfast menues in Scottsdale. I highly recommend the "Protein & Iron" for breakfast. Added plus, it's right next to Starbucks for your morning coffee.
