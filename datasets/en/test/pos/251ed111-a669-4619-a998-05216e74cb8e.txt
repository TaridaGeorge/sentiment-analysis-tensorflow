I have high maintenance bulldogs and things always come up.  The vet I used normally was out of town and one of my dogs needed medical attention.  I consider myself very knowledgeable about my breed and I have used many Vets in the past.  Dr. Florez was very patient and knowledgeable.  He was able to treat the problem we came in for and point out a few tips on how to treat other issues I hadn't even considered.  The staff was very warm and friendly.  

The office is beautiful and very well taken care of.  My bill was 50.00 less than it would have been with my other vet and I left with more knowledge.  I also took a look at their boarding.  I'm so impressed.  I will definitely be back.  Thank you everyone for taking such good care of my baby!
