My wife and I ate at Ruby Tuesday Saturday night for an early Mother's Day. Even though the line was out the door we got immediate seating because we had reservations. The service was still good even though they were busy. My wife tried the seafood treo, which she loved.. I tried the new Mahi Mahi and had them blacken it. I loved it. We love the ambiance, food, and service at this Ruby Tuesdays. We keep going back because we know we can depend on them for a good meal, a good value, and good service.
