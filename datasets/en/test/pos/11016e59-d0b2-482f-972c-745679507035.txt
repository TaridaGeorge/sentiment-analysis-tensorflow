I've only been to the yardhouse when I lived in Hawaii and I have to say this one is pretty amazing too! 
One of my girlfriends was having her birthday and she wanted to go to a coyote game, however, we started the night at Yardhouse. I have to say this, their Mac N Cheese was BOMB! I don't think I've ever tasted anything that good in awhile. I am definitely going back for it. And the mixed drinks were hella good too. 
BTW, the vegetarian menu is to die for. You wouldn't even know half the stuff was vegetarian.
