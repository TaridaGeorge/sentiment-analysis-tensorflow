The Chuck Box is a small burger joint that is located on the ASU campus in Tempe. 

It's a casual little place that charbroils your burger as you order, so they always taste hot and delicious. After your burger is cooked up, you head over to the condiment bar to dress it up as you like.  They also have some pretty good onion rings, if you're into that kinda thing.

You can grab a seat inside or you can also choose to sit out on the patio area. 

The Chuck Box is one of the best burgers that you will find in the Phoenix metro area.

Keep in mind that they only accept cash.

Fast and friendly service along with great food gives the Chuck Box five stars.
