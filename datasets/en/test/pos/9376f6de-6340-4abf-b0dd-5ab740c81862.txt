Yeah i am a globe trotter.  Yeah I am a world traveler I do the Tucson to Phoenix thing all the time.  That being said I really dig this place.

The food is solid.  It is super fresh. It has a ton of flavor.  The eggplant will rock your world.  Definitely worth a try.  The service is usually friendly and passable. But I will come back often.
