I am not sure how I have missed this little GEM. Seriously good food, ambiance and service. I had a Thai Mojito that was both delicious and potent. 

For appetizers we shared Baby Spinach Salad (Incredible), Cesar Salad, Filet Mignon Beef Carpaccio (I had never tried Carpaccio before as I couldn't imagine liking it, but it was yummy), Fried Fromage d'Affinois with Homemade Strawberry Preserves (Fried Cheese and it was truly amazing and the Preserves were also amazing).

For Dinner I had Grilled Beef Tenderloin. It was incredibly delicious and cooked to taste (I prefer Med. Well and was spot on without butterflying). My only regret is that I tried someone's Pecan Crusted Smoked Pork Tenderloin. That was the best Pork I have eaten in some time. The sauce was heavenly.

This is now one of my top ten restaurants in the Phoenix area.
