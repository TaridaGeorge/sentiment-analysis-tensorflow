It's refreshing to see all the good reviews.  For a while, Razz wasn't getting any yelp love.  Just saw in the local paper that Razz was number one under 'best kept secret," hopefully that will change.  As I said before, so many of the restaurants in Scottsdale rely on image and gimmicks to draw crowds, subsequently closing once that particular fad fades away (see Canal, Digestif).  God knows how many trendy burger bars and sushi spots have sprang up in the last 5 years.  Luckily we have Razz.  He isn't afraid to create new combinations of flavors in textures, but he is level-headed enough to keep a strong foundation of tried and true techniques.  He's been doing so for 30 years.

Besides, I have find any restaurant in the US that can create and pair sauces like Razz.  It's absolute art.
