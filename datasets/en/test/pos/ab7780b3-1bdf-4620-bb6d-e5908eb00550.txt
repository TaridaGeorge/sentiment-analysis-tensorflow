Bought a 1/4 cow and was amazed with the quality.  I am an avid grass fed beef eater and absolutely give Date Creek Ranch 5 stars.

The steaks were tender, delicious and had a very nice color to them.  

Additionally they added some liver to our order as per request.  They weren't sure if they could do that but when we got home we were surprised to see 4lbs of liver in our package!!!

Secondary bonus:  When we thaw the meat it didn't leak juice from the packages
