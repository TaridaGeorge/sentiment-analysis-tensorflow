This was my first visit to Entourage Nail Salon. I give a double thumbs up to to set up of the stations in which each has it's own room and personal decor. Glenda was very sweet and took her time making my nails look just perfect. Not only does she have entertainment she also provides a nice glass of wine with your visit. I would recommend anyone to Glenda for a nice relaxing nail experience just the way it should be.
