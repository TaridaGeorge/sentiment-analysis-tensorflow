Cibo is awesome!  Housed in an old downtown Phoenix home, it has charm and class...good as both a date night hot spot and a casual lunch stop, anybody fits in.  Also has a small bar and outdoor seating (with heaters for the winter).  The pizza, salads and dessert are all fantastic, they have a pretty good beer selection and the wait at dinner is never more than about an hour. I guess my only complaints would be the parking...just like anywhere else downtown it's limited; and it can get a bit loud inside when it's busy. 

Thinking about taking your date/out of town guests to Biancos?  Don't bother...head over to Cibos for better food, better atmosphere, and a shorter wait.
