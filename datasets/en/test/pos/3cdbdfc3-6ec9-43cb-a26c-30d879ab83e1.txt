I have been waiting patiently for the meatloaf to hit the menu after getting to taste it a couple of weeks ago (they were still tweaking the recipe)....finally it made it's debut on Monday and thanks to a text from our boy Matt we wasted no time in getting there....Yes...the meatloaf rocks and is good comfort food at its best. Two thick slabs on top of cheesy creamy potatoes and seasonal baby carrots and asparagus. I think I am in love with the meatloaf (and Matt B.) Nathan you nailed it with this one. By the way... there are other new items on the menu as well but I will probably never make it past the meatloaf.
