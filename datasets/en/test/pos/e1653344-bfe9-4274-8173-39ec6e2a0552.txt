I'm a library-going type of woman. You know what I like about this library? I can go into the cafe, pay 1.68$ for a cup of jasmine tea, grab a table by the window, (or out on the cafe's patio) plug-in my laptop, and write/read/research away.  

And what an upbeat cafe crew! And what an easy self check-out system!   You know, sometimes in our search for the perfect "free wifi" cafe, we forget about good old libraries. I like to mix it up, but lately I find myself back at the library more and more. Plus they have that certain something going for them---books.
