I am obsessed with this place. I love to sew but fabric and accessories are so expensive and often good quality merchandise is hard to find. Sas is amazing it sells a lot of unusual items for a good price. The place is a bit cluttered and sometimes you have to dig through  a lot of junk but I have found some amazing things for dirt cheap.
