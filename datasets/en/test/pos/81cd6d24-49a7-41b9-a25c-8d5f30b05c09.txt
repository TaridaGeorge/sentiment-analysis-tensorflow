I drive well out of my way to go here.  I love the Ghallaba.  I don't know of another place that has Ghallaba.  The Hummus and Baba Ganoush our some of the best I have had.  If you like Mediterranean food you must try this place.  Don't be put off by the lack of parking or simple look of the place.  Go in and you will a fan too.
