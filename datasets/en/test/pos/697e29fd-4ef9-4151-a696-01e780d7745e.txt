I say this again this is by far the best niteclub in Scottsdale for 40-somethings. The service is exceptional and the food is surprisingly great. This is one place you are guaranteed to find a woman to dance (maybe not as attractive as you like but you know what they happens after you have had 3 drinks!). Through the many years this is one place where I have never ever had a bad experience. Highly recommend.
