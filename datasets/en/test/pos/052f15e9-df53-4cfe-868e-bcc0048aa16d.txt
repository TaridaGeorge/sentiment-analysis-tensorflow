My husband surprised me with a very nice dinner at Mastro's City Hall last night. We sat in the bar area at one of the side tables. We enjoyed a bottle of sparkling wine with our dinner. The beef carpaccio was delicious and it was a very large portion. Great to share.  I loved my  half portion of the Mastro's salad (with lots of shrimp). Its great that they offer half sizes on salads and sides.
The server (Andrew) was very attentive and friendly. We will definitely be back!
