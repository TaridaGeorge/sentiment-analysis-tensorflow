HOLY COW! An entire WALL of frosty specialty drinks?!?! Are you kidding!?!  I had a standard cheeseburger and it was phenomenal. The service was great- the flourescent green sodas that my kids chose from the wall were good. Weird, but good. Had a great time here with the family, will definitely go back the next time we are all in the mood for burgers and sodas.
