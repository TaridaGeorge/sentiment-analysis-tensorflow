Don't be afraid...  This is not hardcore Tai food... It is delicious! My absolute favorite Asian restaurant in Scottsdale.

It can be warm if you request, but don't be a wimp and pass this joint up. This is a wonderful, local, cute dining spot --  with a nice little bar and amazing atmosphere. I like the Old Town location better than the Desert Ridge one. Some portions are really huge, so I suggest splitting a meal.
