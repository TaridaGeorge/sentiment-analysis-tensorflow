This place is a gem in Mesa, since it has a creative menu, great food, and an interesting atmosphere; all of which are rare here. I've been 3 or 4 times, and am never dissapointed. Some meals are better than others, I remember the gnocchi being amazing. This place is about quality, not quantity, and you can tell that each menu item has been well thought out, so that the flavors balance one another but are not overwhelming. Every time I eat here it reminds me of how mediocre so many other restaurants are in the flavor department.
The service has been spotty, never terrible, but not great either. But I forgive that for the food.
