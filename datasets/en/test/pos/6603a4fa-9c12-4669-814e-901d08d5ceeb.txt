This review is on the weekend brunch only--

Great medium sized (heavy-ish traffic) spot to hang out with friends and enjoy brunch.  The food selections is good, and their outdoor seating can't be beat.  They have the best huevos rancheros I've ever had in my life. The best eggs bennie too (with homemage english muffins)... but after tasting huevos rancheros, it's hard to bother with anything else.  The prices aren't  exactly budget friendly - but worth the occasional splurge.   Word to the wise: Mimosa's are bottomless only on Saturday - we mixed the days once and ended up spending 40 bucks on breakfast booze while the food was 20 :/
