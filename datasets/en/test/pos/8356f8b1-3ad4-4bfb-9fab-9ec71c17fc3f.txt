5 stars - yep.  Want to know what I ate?  Here goes the list.

I split 1 cannoli.

yep.  and it got 5 stars from me.  why? BECAUSE IT WAS FREAKIN AMAZING. 

I'll be back to sample the whole menu, and get some italian meats to go, but for now, that simple cannoli gets 5 stars.  Just the right amount of chocolate chips in it, perfect creamy texture.  Nice crispy, buttery shell.  Was awesome.
