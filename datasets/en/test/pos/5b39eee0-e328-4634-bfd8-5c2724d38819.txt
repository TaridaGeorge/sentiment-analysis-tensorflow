4.5 rounding up to 5.

My favorite pho restaurant in the Phoenix metropolitan area. I went to college at ASU, so I used to frequent this place at least once a week. I've had everything from their noodles - pho tai, bun rieu, bun bo hue, to their lunch specials - orange chicken, fried rice, etc and can't say I've ever been disappointed. Their soup for all their noodle dishes are very flavorful and well-portioned.I used to come here so often the owner would just ask - "the usual?" 

Khai Hoan definitely has a special place in my heart :)
