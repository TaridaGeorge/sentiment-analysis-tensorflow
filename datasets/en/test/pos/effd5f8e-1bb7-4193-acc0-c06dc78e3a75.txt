FINALLY made it to Fez for brunch. After sucking down a few of the $3 Mimosas, I dined on the signature omelet. It came stuffed full of their yummy, yummy gyro lamb, feta cheese and pappadeaux peppers - a great mix of savory, sweet and spicy. 

Each of us ordered something different that morning, and there was nothing but the garnish left on our plates. Safe to say we all gave it a thumbs up.
