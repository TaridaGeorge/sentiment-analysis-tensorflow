One of my favorite take out sushi spots.  I even bring my friends from work here to eat lunch.  The sushi is very cheap but the quality is great.  The food is definitely fresh.  Sushi rolls that normally costs $16 for a 18 roll only costs around $7 here.  Fried rice is also good, but i normally pick this up on the way home to eat sushi.
