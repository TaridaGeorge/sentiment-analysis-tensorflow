My mom introduced me and I've been coming here for years! Friendly, talented staff and cheap prices. The location is clean and sanitary. I feel welcomed every time. The massage is the best! A pedi massage is the longest of any nail place and it feels wonderful! With prices as low as $18 for a pedi, this place is unbeatable. I'm getting a pedi right now and had to post! Check them out and remember to bring cash!
