ok...I admit I don't have much experience with getting piercings but I would like to say the ENTIRE staff at HTC has always been tops in my book.  From day 1 they have done everything in their power to put me at ease.  I've been getting my ears stretched by Kat and JD and both have been awesome-couldn't ask for more informative, gentler piercers.  Everyone is super down to earth and friendly and, as was said by another yelper-they are first aid certified, and CPR trained....these people know there stuff.
