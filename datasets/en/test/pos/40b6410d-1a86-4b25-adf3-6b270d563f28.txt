Check this place out....very bright, inviting atmosphere.  There is plenty of room to sit inside, or you can enjoy the beautiful fountain just outside the store.  The staff is knowledgeable, courteous and friendly.  This place is immaculate and the variety of flavors will keep me going back.  They are right next to the Tempe Dance Academy in McClintock Fountains - NEC of Warner & McClintock.  Check them out...you won't be sorry!
