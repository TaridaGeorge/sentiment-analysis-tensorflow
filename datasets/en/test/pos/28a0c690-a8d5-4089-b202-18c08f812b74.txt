This is a great resort restaurant!

We had some very nice meals here:
-Gnocchi with a veal ragu that was spectacular.
-Scallops with a wild mushroom risotto--perfect scallops, if you like scallops don't skip this dish.
-Even the roast chicken was special--a little spicy, very moist, perfectly cooked.

Salads and starters--especially a deceptively simple arugula salad--were excellent.

The service sets this place apart.  We came here a second time on the night before Valentines on the spur of the moment, we had cancelled reservations that we had made at another restaurant when friends with an infant joined us.  Well, we should have known, Taggia was booked solid.  But they immediately walked us into the bar, rearranged some tables and served us dinner there--which with the baby worked out maybe better than the restaurant would have!  

Above and beyond.  Loved it.
