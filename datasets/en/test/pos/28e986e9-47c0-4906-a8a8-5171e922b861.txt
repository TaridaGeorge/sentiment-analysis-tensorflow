Costco is truely an amazing store.  Great prices, great products and great customer support.  I was leaving the store last week and as always they checked my receipt and cart to make sure all was good.  They noticed that I was charged for 2 bottles of Kettle One, but I only bought one.  They quickly called another employee who promptly brought me the money they overcharged me.  Go Costco!
