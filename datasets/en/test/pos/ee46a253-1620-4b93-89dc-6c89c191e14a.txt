Went here on a Friday night for my 23rd birthday with my family. Don't let the outside fool you, its very nice inside.

Service was top notch. Waiters were quick with the refills and we didn't have to wait too long for our food.

I ordered the Top Sirloin steak and it was delicious. I recommend the garlic mashed potatoes, very tasty. I also got a complementary dessert for my birthday: I LOVED the Fruit Crisp a la mode. My parents shared the ribeye and they loved it as well.

Overall I'd definitely go here again.
