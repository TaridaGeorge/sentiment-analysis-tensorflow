As a member of their Dental Plan (inexpensive & saves a lot on each visit!), I came in today for my regular semi-annual Scaling & Polishing.  As always, it was a top quality experience all the way with Dr. Khaydatov & the team, & at LOW cost.

It's still a big 5 Stars from here, & it shouldn't be like pulling teeth to get YOU to come down here too from anywhere in the Valley, & make these guys the go-to professionals for your dental care needs!  It's one of my favorite Valley businesses, & I think you'll like them too.     :-))
