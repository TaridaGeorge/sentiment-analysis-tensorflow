***The best the best the best!!!!! 

I have been eating at Sahara's since I was 15 years old, which at that time it was located on Mill Avenue. 

Sahara's is THE BEST you can get for Middle Eastern Cuisine. The lentil soup is TO DIE FOR and if you add this special green sauce, it's amazing! I usually stick with the chicken shawarma plate, which is amazing! They also have the best hummus in AZ! You must also try the Turkish coffee, which is out of this world with cream and sugar. It'll keep you up for hours!!

Lastly, the family that makes it all possible for us is warm and inviting. They are hard working and have been apart of the community in Tempe for years and years. Ali is my favorite, always a smiling face. :)
