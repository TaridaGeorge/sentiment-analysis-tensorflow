I caught a game here last month.

Pro's:
-All the seats face home plate.... No awkward seats where you face forward but have to look slightly to your left or right... This park is set up nicely.

-The seats are appropriately sized.  I'm a big guy and was comfortable sitting in these armed seats

-Lots of shade... Depending on where you sit and the time of day... but most of the seats in this park are in the shade so the Arizona sun won't fry you.

-Very clean

Con's:
-It will be difficult to find something healthy to eat here. Hotdogs, hamburgers, pizza... fried this and that are your only choices.

Other than that, this is a very nice park.. It is brand new and is a great place to check out a game.
