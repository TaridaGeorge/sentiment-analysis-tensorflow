This place is too freaking cute!!!  The OJ is literally one of the best glasses I've ever had.  I had the typical eggs, bacon, and toast and it was amazing.  The bacon was crispy without being burnt, the toast had just the right level of buttery goodness and the eggs were folded such as a crepe and fluffy goodness.  I also tried a bite of the pulled pork burger which was amazing, and the touch of apple put it over the top.  Another plus was the garden patio area that feels homey like someones backyard.  I will definitely be back to this cozy establishment!
