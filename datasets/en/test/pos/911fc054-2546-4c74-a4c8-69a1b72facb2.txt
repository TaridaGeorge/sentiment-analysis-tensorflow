Denise and Jay are the quintessential eclectics.  Need computer animation?  Want to be a better cook? Enjoy backyard concerts? They provide all of this and more.  We recently worked with them to coordinate a drop off of Chow Locally boxes that can be integrated into a monthly cooking class.  The creativity and responsiveness on behalf of win-win all around was super.  Looking forward to helping this business grow.
