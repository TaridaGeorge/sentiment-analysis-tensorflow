Everything I have ordered here, I loved! Their hand-made pasta is excellent! (Try the pesto pasta) The pizza and sandwiches are great as well! Expect to wait for your food because everything is made fresh; even if you are the only person in the restaurant, it will take some time...but the food is well worth the wait! Keep in mind the place is vegetarian/fish, so you wont get any meat options...but the food is so good you wont miss it!
