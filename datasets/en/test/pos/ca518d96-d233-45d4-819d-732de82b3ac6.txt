The Persian Garden Cafe uses organic ingredients and they offer lots of vegan options in addition to meat dishes. Everything we tried was extraordinary. The owner told us that anything can be made vegetarian and the portions are generous. The service was great. If you like red wine, try their Pinot Noir from Oregon.

We had the vegetable and chicken stew, lentil soup, and the spinach stew. My taste buds were in seventh heaven. I have also had their food delivered and it was great.
