A small intimate restaurant in Scottsdale. We were there in February with friends. The staff recognized my friends from a previous visit. The Waiter reminded my friends of the wine they tried and also the food even though it had been only one other visit and a whole month past. That is amazing! Even though they were busy, we felt very appreciated and the food and wine were excellent. It you want a place where you will be treated like a special guest. This is it. I want people to be nice to me when I go out. Two thumbs up!
