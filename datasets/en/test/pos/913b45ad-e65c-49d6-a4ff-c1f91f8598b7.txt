I dont even need to be gluten free (my daughter does) but everything I've tasted there has been fabulous!!  The bagels are a must have staple in our freezer (daughter uses them for breakfast, sandwiches, etc), the ice cream sandwiches are soooo good, the pizza crusts are amazing - they are some ones that Barros uses (I love those!).  We've even had a few slices of pie at the store and a few different kind of cupcakes - all A++.  I recently used their Enriched Baking Flour in a tiered chocolate cake recipe I have - it came out fabulous!!  I subbed cup for cup and you would never, ever know it was gf.
