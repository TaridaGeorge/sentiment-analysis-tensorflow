This is a frequent dining spot for me. There are not to many options in downtown Phoenix, however this place has a great variety. I am not a sandwich gal or a fan of deli's though Paradise Bakery has a great variety on their menu to offer for all types of eaters. Everything is fresh. They have daily soup options and tasty crisp salads to go. As far as the deserts (cookies, brownies, etc) All I can say is YUMMY! 

The staff is always friendly. The management team is always upbeat and greets all visitors who walk through the door. 

There is indoor and outdoor seating. This place gets busy so they offer call in to go orders. 

For a healthy option this is the place to go.
