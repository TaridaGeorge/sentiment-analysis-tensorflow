A few nights ago I was really craving some good sashimi and I happened to wander by Geisha. Being that it was just me, I sat up at the bar. The bartender was very friendly and attentive, and he even made me a delicious bellini which is not on the menu by the way. I ordered the yellowtail sashimi as well as the salmon sashimi and both of these fish came out very fresh and flavorful. 

The decor in this place is very cool! Its a small space, but they use the space well including a patio and a private karaoke room. And the bathrooms...how do I explain the bathrooms...let's just say the toilet has options. Yes. Options for your bathroom experience. Overall, it was a good time, and I will definitely be back with friends.
