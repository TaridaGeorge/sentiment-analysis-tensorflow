Awesome price for a few nights in March when every other motel jacked up their rates for Spring Training. Super clean and safe. The bathrooms looked very recently upgraded. Microwave and fridge included in the room. Coffee, juice, fruit, and wrapped pastries for breakfast. Walking distance to everything downtown. Friendly, helpful owners.
