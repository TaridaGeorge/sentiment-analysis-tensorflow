I love this place!! They have the best mocha monsoon I have ever had and the best coconut whoopi pie - simply amazing.  The atmostphere is just as weonderful, quaint little gem to stumble upon.  A friend of mine brought me here a few months ago for the first time and now we are hooked!  We go all the time!! Fantastic little place, you wont regret going here.
