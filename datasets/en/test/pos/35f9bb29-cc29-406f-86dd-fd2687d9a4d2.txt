Wandered in on a sunday night after a long day of traveling.

The space is beautiful, and the service gracious while not being obnoxiously over-smily. They seated us in a quiet corner, as asked. The menu is short and sweet, I had a hard time choosing something from the many delicious sounding options.

In the end I went for the white fish with moroccan spices and the apero cocktail. Totally delicious, both of them. The fish especially was wonderful, light, the spices just right. Texturally, the almonds on the top went wonderfully with the steamed green veg and flakey-creamy fish.

I live nearby and am SO happy to have found a healthy & tasty place close by. Vive St Francis!
