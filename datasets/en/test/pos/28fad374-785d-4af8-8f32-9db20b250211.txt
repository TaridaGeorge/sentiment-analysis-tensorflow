My first appointment with Dr Wyatt I was 6 months pregnant. My gag reflex was nonexistent and the wonderful assistant doing my xrays was such a trooper. She let me break and breath and didn't make me feel guilty about taking to long. I'm actually getting ready to return for another appointment to have some fillings done. Entire staff including Dr Wyatt are great about making what usually sucks at the very least bearable!
