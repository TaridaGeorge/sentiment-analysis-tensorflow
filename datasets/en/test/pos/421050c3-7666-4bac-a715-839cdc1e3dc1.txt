Just moved to the area and was looking for a new go to place for my Spa Pedecures. I came to Chic Nails on a week night about 30 minutes before they were supposed to close. The lady who did my spa pedicure must have massaged my feet and calves for about 15 minutes it was great. The color on my toe nails didn't even chip for about 3 weeks! Also the prices are great! Give this place a try.
