Looking for Cajun? Look no further. My favorites are the etufee and gumbo. I stopped in on a Friday night and had the pork chop special, it had to be the biggest and most tender chop I've had! For those of you looking for a classic dirty rice they took me back to a LA coonass swap party. The live guitar sole was a great addition for back ground music.
