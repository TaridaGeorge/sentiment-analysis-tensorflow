Went to Qcumberz yesterday with my young son and he bought his first vinyl record, Van Halen for $3 and got his dad, "Bourne" for Dad's day for only $5. Hadn't been in since they got new owners, and I was pleasantly surprised- you could walk around and see all the good deals to be found. Thank you for the friendly service and great deals!
