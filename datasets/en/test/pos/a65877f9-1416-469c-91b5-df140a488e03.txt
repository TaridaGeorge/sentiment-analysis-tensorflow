This is one of my favorite places to get breakfast on the weekend.  But beware, you either get there early or be prepared to wait a while!  It is a tiny little house and quite popular.  There is indoor and outdoor seating.  The staff is very warm and friendly.  The omeletts here are absolutely delicious!  Ingredients are fresh and everything is home cookin!  This is the best time of year to go and sit out on the shaded patio.  Check it out, you will be glad you did!
