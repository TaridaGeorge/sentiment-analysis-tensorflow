If you can get past the sun and incredible degree of heat in the desert this is a Frank Lloyd Wright property every bit worth the price of admission (and all the more-so as a fantastic fellow Yelper hooked me up with a free pass.)

Bearing in mind that FLW was not a nice man nor was he a humble man his vision has shaped modern American architecture more than perhaps anyone before or since and every time I visit a new location I learn something new and see something I'd have never expected.

Top notch customer service from entrance to exit and the best gift shop I've seen at a Wright home yet.
