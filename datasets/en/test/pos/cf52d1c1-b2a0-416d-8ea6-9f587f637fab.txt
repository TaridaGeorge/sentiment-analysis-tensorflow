Other than highlighting some of the excellent side dishes, I'm not sure what I can add to the other excellent reviews. The collard greens are frackin' fantastic, and I order them every time. My Baby Mama likes to order the fried okra, which she raves about at the most random times (playing disc golf, watching Dr. Who, playing euchre). I also tend to order the home fries, though I've had to deal with an underdone potato or two.

My father-in-law was in town last weekend and wanted to treat us to fried chicken. We suggested Lolo's. WARNING -- read on only if you feel very little empathy for others. Otherwise, the next sentence might break your heart...OK, ready? He showed up with a bucket of KFC. Sadness.

Last word? Lolo's has the best chicken and most complimentary side dishes in Phoenix, hands down.
