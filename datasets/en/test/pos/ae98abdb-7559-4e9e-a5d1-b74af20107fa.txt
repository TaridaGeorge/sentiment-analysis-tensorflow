I've been to Liberty market several times and always recommend it to friends.  Everything I've tried here has been very good.  Their service is organized and great.  Sometimes you might see Joe, the owner walking around and talking to people.  Of the three restaurants of Joe's (Liberty, Joe's Farm Grill and Joe's Barbeque), Liberty Market is my favorite.

Random, but take a trip to the bathroom - they are very innovative and cool. 

There is also lots of fresh produce and supplies that you can buy.
