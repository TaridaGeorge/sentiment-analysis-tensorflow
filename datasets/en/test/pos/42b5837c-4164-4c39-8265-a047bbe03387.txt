Matt (of Matt's Big Breakfast) has opened this swanky-but-comfy bar/restaurant/tavern/ downtown. The building is a beautifully resurrected vintage house -- perfect!

Cool place to hang out and relax. Grab a seat (if you can) in your room of choice. There's a giant communal table in the back and an amazingly wallpapered (you'll see) chamber up front. 

Terrific craft brews and a nice wine list. Haven't tried the food yet, but the menu features a comforting, upscale twist on the normal bar fare. 

Great reason to hit the downtown stretch on nights other than First Friday.
