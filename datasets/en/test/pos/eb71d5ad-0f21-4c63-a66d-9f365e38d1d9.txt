I too have been meaning to review for quite some time.  

This place is unique in terms of Scottsdale.  The atmosphere is intimate and romantic.  Chris is a wonderful host and multiple times has accomodated for us being late for our reservation.  Our dishes have always been outstanding.  The best part- BYOB!  Having a 5 course dinner with two bottles of wine for 3 people for $150?  I'll take it!  There's no other place in town where you can get this kind of value.  Chris makes a point to get to know you a little more each time your there and last time we were there he even kept the place open late just chatting with us.

We will be back and I'm sure based on the other recent reviews that it will be harder and harder to get a reservation here!
