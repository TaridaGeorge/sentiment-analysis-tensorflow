Panda Garden is a family run Chinese Food Restaurant that is always friendly, and most importantly, delicious. You can order dishes family style and there's plenty of delicious meals to try. My personal favorite is the Empress Chicken, sweeter then Orange Chicken, but the flavor just melts in your mouth. I just had the Kung Pao Two which is Chicken and Shrimp, and its even better the next day as leftovers thanks to the generous portions. They have a good selection of sake and beer as well. This is my favorite Chinese restaurant and hope everyone else checks it out.
