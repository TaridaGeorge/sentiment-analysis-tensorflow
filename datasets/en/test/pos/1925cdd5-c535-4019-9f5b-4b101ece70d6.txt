Went there for the first time and my first impression was how clean everything was.  No wet dog smell, no gross floors, nothing.  The wash service starts at $13 so it's pretty easy to deal with.  The tubs you put your dog in are clean and offer shampoo that comes straight out of the water nozzle so you don't have to use separate bottles if you don't want to.  Instead of drying with towels, they have a blow-dryer type of set up that dries a medium sized dog in about 5 minutes.  The dog treats and toys are a little pricey but that's not why you go there, just a convenience.  (I bought 3 dog toys).
