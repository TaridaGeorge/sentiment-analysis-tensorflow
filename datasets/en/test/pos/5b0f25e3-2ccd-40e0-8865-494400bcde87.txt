Best four years of my life.

I graduated with my bachelor of science in marketing and my bachelor of science in management.  I also got my international business certificate, all through the WP Carey School of Business at ASU.  

Thanks to many generous scholarships and many different class schedule options I not only graduated in four years but also graduated with honors and graduated from the Barrett Honors College after completing my senior thesis. 

I love the professors, the campus, the weather, the convenient location.  Honestly you will be hard up to find someone more enthusiastic about ASU :)  There are so many different opportunities and choices, the sky is the limit.  I was extremely involved with extra-curricular activities offered through the university, I never was bored.

Thank you Arizona State for a wonderful college experience.  I can't wait to come back for my MBA!
