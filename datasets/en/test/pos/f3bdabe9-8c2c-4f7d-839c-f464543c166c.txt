Never had Burmese food before...dammit...now I'm craving it all the time after Little Rangoon.  The Tea Leaf salad was unique, unique, unique.  I really would stick to the Burmese food here even though they represent Vietmanese and Indian.  It's rich, spicy and unusual...and cheap.  Alfred and his staff were very genuine and friendly.  Might not make it back, but will look for Burmese in Chicago.
