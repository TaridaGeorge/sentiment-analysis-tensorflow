Love Super Target. Didn't even know it existed until recently. I wandered over to the bakery and deli Omg. They have a nice selection of sandwiches and salads. The bakery is amazing. One of the best places to get a slice of  double layer buttercream cake for only $1.99. Its a nice size slice so it'll take more than a day to eat unless you want a nice sugar rush. I prefer Super Target over the regular Target. So much better than Walmart. The Prices of the items are pretty good
