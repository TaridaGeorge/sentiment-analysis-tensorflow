I have had two treatments here with Andrea, a chemical peel and a facial, and both have been amazing!  She really knows everything about skin, asking tons of questions facialists have never asked me before to solve my skin problems.  Both treatments with her have been incredibly relaxing, with fantastic neck, shoulder, and scalp massages while the masks and peels sit.  It's so unusual to get a treatment that is both enjoyable and effective.  Andrea also followed up with me both times, texting me a day or so later to see how my skin was doing!
