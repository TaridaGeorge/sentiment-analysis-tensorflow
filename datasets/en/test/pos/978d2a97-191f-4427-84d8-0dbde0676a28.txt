I drive here from Central Phoenix for their stellar selection of products and customer appreciation discount.  We buy lots of cat & dog foods so the gas spent is well worth it.  Everyone has always been very pleasant and they have always acknowledged us, without being over-bearing (which tends to happen sometimes at the other specialty pet food stores).  We've been coming here for years and will continue to do so.
