Tonight I picked up a manicotti, side of meatballs and cannoli for my friend and I to share. It was all delicious! The manicotti had the perfect combination of cheeses, the meatballs were the perfect consistency and the cannoli was fresh and tasty. I would also recommend the white pizza with spinach, I've eaten it during past visits and it's very tasty.
