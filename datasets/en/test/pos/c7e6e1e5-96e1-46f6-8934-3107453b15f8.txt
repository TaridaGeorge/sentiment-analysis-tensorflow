Yum, love Indian food and this one was not a disappointment. I hold all other Indian restaurants to their standard and many times it doesn't come close to this culinary perfection. There never seems to be a crowd so I hope they stay open. But truly great food - I'd give it more stars if I could! I can't begin to pronounce or spell all the wonderful delights on their menu. You'll just have to take my word for it.
