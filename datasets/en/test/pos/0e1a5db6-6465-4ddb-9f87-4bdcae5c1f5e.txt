Great beers! Four Peaks is my brewery of choice. The Kilt Lifter is my fav. Food is slightly on the pricey side, but good. If you don't know which beer to go with, try the sampler. 

The service is great, staff is friendly and the crowd is laid back and chill. Its so refreshing to find a place thats not trying to bring in the snottsdale 'bros' and materialistic women.

I LOVE the patio out front when the weather is nice, but the inside has more than enough room.

Can't say enough about this place. My favorite watering hole.
