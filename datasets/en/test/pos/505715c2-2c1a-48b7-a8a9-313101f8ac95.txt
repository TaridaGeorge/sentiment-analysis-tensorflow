I can not say enough about this fabolus spot! From the patio, to the long board bar (and the long board on tap!) I've been several times, and every person ive brought, or come with, loves it. Great date spot, great pre funk bar, or after hours wind down location. Everything on the menu is bomb! From the Shrimp spring rolls, the ahi tuna, the fries (sweet potato or regualr) the hula burger.... OMG... im craving Hula now! thank's yelp, for making me think of this moth watering spot!
