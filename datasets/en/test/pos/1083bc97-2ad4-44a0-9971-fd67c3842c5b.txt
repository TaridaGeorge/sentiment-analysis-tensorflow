You can't get a better latte in Phoenix than at a Cartel. That's just a fact. Even more impressive is their unbelievably great food. Turkey sandwich, awesome. The freaking spring mix side salad, amazing. What really blew me away was the bacon, (fantastically runny) egg, and onion jam sandwich. I've actually been back 3 times just to get this sandwich. I don't really care for drinking espresso with this sandwich, so I hope that they start carrying some bottled drinks or something. 

In addition to the deliciousness, know that this is one of the most affordable lunches in downtown PHX. I don't know what most of these restaurants are doing charging so much for so little (I'm looking at you, Chloe's Corner), so it's refreshing to find a place that does amazing food for a reasonable price.
