Super badass record store.  Great selection, and I frankly didn't find the prices that out of sorts with other stores of this type.  Found some great obscure funk in here, as well as some good ole stoner rock (I'm a sucker for the SR).  Highly recommended.  As an added bonus there wasn't the annoying hipsterism that you find in many other shops of this type, more like guys who are music aficionados who just dig talking music.
