OOOMMMGGG...I am obsessed with Forefathers.  I think I could literally eat there every day.  They do have a bunch of sandwich options, although I've stuck with the Original "with wiz".  They have a small fridge with peppers and fry sauce--must try the fry sauce.  The staff there is so nice and it's always clean.  The only bad thing about going during lunch is that it is on the small side so seating can sometimes be a problem.  They do have outdoor seating though.
