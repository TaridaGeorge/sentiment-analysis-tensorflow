This place is great. The owner is very friendly, and she is very patient with people's orders (there are so many choices on the menu!). I personally get the Taro or Coconut snow with Boba. I have never tried the food here, but I have heard it is good too.

The place has board games, and you frequently see people playing battleships or cards at the tables when you go in. 

I spent part of 2009 studying abroad in China, and compared to some of the places I went to over there, this is just as good.
