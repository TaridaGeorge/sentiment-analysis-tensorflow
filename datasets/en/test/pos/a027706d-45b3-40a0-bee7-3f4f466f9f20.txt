I can only speak to one food item here, and that's their tomato and mozzarella sandwich.  If they only served one sandwich, and I had to eat it for the rest of my life, then I would die a happy and full man.  

We spent our honeymoon in Italy, traveling around the country and eating as if we had gone hungry the other 30 years of our life, and I swear this sandwich matches, and occasionally exceeds, the simple fare that was so overwhelmingly good across the country.  The sandwich is huge, and every time I think I'll have some leftover for later, and each time I prove myself wrong by eating every last crumb and wayward tomato.  One day I'll order something else, but then maybe I won't.
