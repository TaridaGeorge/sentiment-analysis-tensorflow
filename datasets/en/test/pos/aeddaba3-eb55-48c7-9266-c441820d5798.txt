Stopped by on the weekend, staff was friendly and the store was clean.

Had a chicken bowl and everything was perfectly cooked, I visited another location shortly after this visit and it was not as good.  Good thing I live in Surprise and not Phoenix.  

Suffice it to say, I will be returning to this location again and again, I just hope they never close because they sure are slow alot.
