I grew up in the north east with Rita. I was really missing good ices when I moved out here but two Rita's locations have opened in the Phoenix area! I couldn't be happier about it in this dessert heat!
I'm usually not much for chain/franchises but it doesn't matter here. No other places can complete with this! 
Get a gelati - layers of custard and italian ice and more custard. 
Lately I have just been sticking to the standard ice. The flavors change and there is never a time I'm disappointed. 

bonus for the Mill location, short walk off the lightrail. enjoy!
