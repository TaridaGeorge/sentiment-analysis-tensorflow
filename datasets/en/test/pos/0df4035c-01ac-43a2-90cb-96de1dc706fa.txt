This is the best facility of its kind that I've ever encountered -- so good that I have bought its stock, assuming lots of Boomers will find their way to the top-of-the-line fitness experience. I've been a member for more than a year. The trainer I work with is extremely competent and professional. The equipment selection is vast and well-maintained. I get my hair cut in the salon, and I use one of the massage therapists (although this is the facility's only weak spot; staff skills here are mediocre to poor).
