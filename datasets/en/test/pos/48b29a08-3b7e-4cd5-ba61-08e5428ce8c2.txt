I can't believe I haven't written a review for this place yet!

If you haven't been here for lunch you are most definitely missing out.  There's a reason why I go here and can barely find parking every visit but I wouldn't care if I had to park a block away and walk.

The barbeque is better than any adjective I could use to describe it.  If you're not sure what to get, just get the sampler plate.  I'm partial to the brisket sandwich.  If you like barbeque, I recommend giving this place a go.
