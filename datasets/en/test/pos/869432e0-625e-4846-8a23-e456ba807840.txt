This place just opened up in my neighborhood so I decided to give it a try. I just got a "swedish" massage, though they offer acupuncture, craniosacral, and a number of other therapies. I must say that it was one of the best massages of my life! For days I really felt like I was healthier, somehow. I know, it sounds weird, but its true! There are many therapists here, each with a specialty.
