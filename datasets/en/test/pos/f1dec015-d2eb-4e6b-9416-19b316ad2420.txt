Damn good pizza.

My wife and I dropped in on a whim, I used my iPhone's Pizza app to find somewhere new that we hadn't tried. And the 4.5 Stars that Luna had according to the Yelp reviews found on it were well deserved.

Thin foldable crusts, flavorful yet crispy wings, oregano and garlic salt right on  the table (WHERE THEY BELONG)

I was thoroughly impressed, and the price was right too. Check them out.
