This place is fabulous! Everyone who works there is very friendly and great at helping you find something you will love. I go there at least once a week and get my favorite drink... an iced chai latter with almond milk. It is the BEST coffee drink I have had! I definitely recommend trying it, as well as their food items. I have only ate there for breakfast but everything on the menu looks d'lish and healthy! Plus, all of the items are all labeled as either vegetarian, gluten-free, dairy-free, protein packed or balanced, which is helpful for those with food sensitivities. 

All in all, I highly recommend this place for coffee, breakfast, lunch and even a mid-day snack.
