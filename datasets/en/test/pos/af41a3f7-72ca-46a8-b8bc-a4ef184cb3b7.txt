Nami-you had me at hello!

My sweet tooth is SO thankful this exists and that it is close to my work site (though I'd prefer it was closer to my home-pretty please consider setting up another one in Chandler/Gilbert??? :). I'm a loyal Green customer (no restaurant has topped this restaurant as far as I know, NATIONALLY!!), and Nami is an exciting addition. I haven't gone there for Brunch, but I do plan on very very soon! 

I can't pick a favorite because everything is good there. I like to try a new Tsoynami flavor each time I go there. I love their play on their toppings such as Captain Crunch and how it brings back childhood memories. 

This is a place I would bring my non-vegans to-not one of them has walked away disappointingly.
