Urban Cookies makes the best cupcake (er, OllieCakes) in Arizona - trust me, I've tried every cupcake shop here.

The flavors are always rich and often times creative (tomato soup, peach) and the cake is the perfect moist texture.  The price is also right, as a cupcake will run you about $2.35 - that's CHEAP in the cupcake scene, folks. 

The staff has always been so friendly and the owner recently won a Food Network cupcake competition! As well as taking home the "most creative cupcake" title at the Cupcake Love In.
