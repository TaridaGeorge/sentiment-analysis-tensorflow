Once again, this place does not disappoint. Tonight I took my friend from Northern Arizona out to dinner. We ordered the hummus (yummy), and I orders the mousaka. OMFG! It came out looking like a beautiful Greek lasagna (if lasagna was blessed enough to include mashed potatoes and eggplant!!!!). I was already pretty full from the hummus but just could not stop myself from eating more and more of the mousaka. It was, simply put, PERFECTION. My friend had the gyro plate with Greek fries and she was also VERY impressed. This place is awesome.
