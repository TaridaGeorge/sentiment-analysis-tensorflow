Probably one of the best experiences I have had in recent memory.  Not only were the bagels superb (I got the bacon, egg, & cheese on everything) but the service and friendliness of "Mr. Bagel" were top-notch.  If you like NY-style soft bagels, do yourself a favor and go here.  Wish this was in DC!!  I will DEFINITELY be back!!
