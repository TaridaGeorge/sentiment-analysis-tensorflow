All I am going to say is their hash brown casserole is the best thing since sliced bread....and the sliced bread isn't bad either.  This place is pretty consistent, never eaten hear for lunch or dinner but it is a top 2-3 places for me to have breakfast.  I also love the market store in front...I always buy my stocking stuffers for the kids here every year.
