Buttered baguette, brie cheese and pickles.  These three ingredients happen to rank among my favorite things.  Never would I have thought to put them together.  Add turkey and you have yourself one heck of a delicious sandwich.  My first visit to The Cider Mill and I am positively hooked.  While I highly doubt I will be exploring other sandwiches of their menu due to my new addiction to "Brit's Brie & Pickle", I am looking forward to returning and trying their homemade sodas.
