The Orange Table is awesome! I loved the experience, from the location tucked away in the Scottsdale Mall, to the eclectic decor, to the cuisine and service. I walked up on a Saturday around 10AM, and was seated right away in a corner with drinks served promptly. The menu consists of Pancakes, Omelets, Hash brown-type entrees, and sandwiches. Everything was expertly cooked and I really enjoyed my Lemonade. Not too sugary, and not too Lemony. I'll definitely be back ASAP. This is my new pick for my favorite breakfast spot, and next trip will be to try to lunch menu.
