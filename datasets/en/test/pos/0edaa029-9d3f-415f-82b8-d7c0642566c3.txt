I am writing this review on my 3rd visit to Crust in Scottsdale.
I sat for the first time at the bar-top (on a date which was great BTW)- one of the owners was there, the norm I have come to notice, and as always took great care of us.  I tried the 'Duke Special Sangria' as well as the wine-tini, both wonderful ask for them next time you are in!!
Best pizza/wine bar ever, and believe me, I LOVE PIZZA! Just ask around...
