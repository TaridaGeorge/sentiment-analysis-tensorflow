The first time I strolled into this lovely place - I was blown away. People here are so friendly and inviting and I cannot get enough of it. 
Iruna has the best Sangria of all time. Most restaurants add soda to Sangria - it should never be made that way but Iruna does not - they actually know what they are doing. 
Food - One Word - AMAZING!
I had so many dishes here - happy hour boasts lots of discounts. I ended up sharing with other people at the bar - everyone is very inviting and almost like family. 
Highly recommended.
