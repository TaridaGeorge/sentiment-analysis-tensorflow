LOVE this place. Their bulk bins are such a good deal, as is their produce. Their regular dry and canned grocery is a little pricey, but most of it is specialty food, which they sell on par with or cheaper than other places that sell these things. If you are looking for any natural beauty products, this specific Sprouts is a great place to go. The people have always been friendly when I go there.
