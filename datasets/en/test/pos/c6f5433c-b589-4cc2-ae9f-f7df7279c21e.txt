Do you want authentic Japanese food, drink, little toys, book, free newspaper? Don't waste no time, and come to Tokyo food market. This is Da place!!

I found this place by accident, to my surprise this turns out fully stocked Japanese grocery / convinience store from heaven. And pricing was juuuust right!! 

The owner is very very nice gentleman, I chat with him a while and found out how much of knowledge he has for Japan and Japanese biz. 

I ended up more than I needed, but I'm very happy to go home with so many Japanese grocery items. 

This is true gem in town!
