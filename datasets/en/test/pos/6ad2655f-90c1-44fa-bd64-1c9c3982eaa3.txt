Mark Howard of Fez, just opened up Bliss/ReBar. We headed there for brunch last week to check out the new space. 

The Braised Beef Nachos were delectable.Several people at our table ordered sandwiches on the pretzel bread- which was great. 

The new interior spaces are fantastic. A new solid wood bar was installed on the inside to watch games etc. 

The price is perfect for the location. The previous restaurants in that space were on the pricey side, but these prices were very reasonable. 

After reading reviews- I can't wait to try the Mac and Cheese!
