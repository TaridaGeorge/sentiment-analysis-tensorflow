I LOVE their froyo! It's about the only place in Phoenix where I can find green tea froyo. And it is out of this world! I love their other flavors here too because they are not as overly sweet as other froyo places. Their strawberry and chocolate are so flavorful and creamy. Love that they give you a stamp card, so you can accumulate them in order to get a free one on a future visit.
