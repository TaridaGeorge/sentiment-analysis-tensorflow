I really like lunch here. The prices are reasonable and the menu is varied enough to pique my critical interest. I had a seasonal salad with local grown varietal tomatoes, roasted beets (a weakness of mine), and Queen Creek olive oil which is usually spectacular, but this time was sort of ordinary. I opted for the beef  fillet add-onto protest against vegetarianism. It was medium rare, tender, and very good. The salad had some lump of bread but I didn't eat it. My friends had the portobello burger and the black bean soup and both were very happy. I will be back next week for another lunch and will write a follow up.
