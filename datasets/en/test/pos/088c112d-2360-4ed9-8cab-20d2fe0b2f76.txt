I'm new to the Phoenix area and was looking for a good place to take a group of 6 for dinner.  Fuego Bistro was recommended to me, so we decided to give it a try.  Among our group, we ordered 4 different dishes and all were excellent.  The short rib really stood out!  The service was also very good.  The menu prices are fair, if not a bit on the high side, but they offer all kinds of discounts/specials/etc., which, when factored in, make this place a great value on top of the already great food.  I will definitely be back and will recommend Fuego Bistro to others.
