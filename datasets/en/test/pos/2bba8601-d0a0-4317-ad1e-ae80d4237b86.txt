I have nothing but great experiences at Cork, and today's brunch was no different.  We held a birthday brunch with 21 guests this morning there.  The service was wonderful, the food absolutely amazing.  And I do have some very picky guests!  They do not hesitate to tell when they have a less than stellar experience, yet every one of them loved the food and loved the restaurant.  To the servers, chefs, and owners, my hat is off to every one of you for making it a perfect occasion.  To all of you reading this, get in there and have what is in my opinion the best food in the Phoenix Metro!

I have eaten dinner here more than once as well, and the dinner is astounding.  I had never had the brunch before, but the brunch was amazing, and a lot more food then I was actually expecting!
