This is the real deal.  I HIGHLY recommend this place if you are in the mood for burgers, fries and milkshakes.  The owners are friendly.  The prices are unbeatable.  The quality is spot on.  I do not recommend the deep fried mushrooms or the grilled cheese sandwich.  However the other items I mentioned are phenomenal!  You must splurge on a milkshake... i love chocolate cherry.
