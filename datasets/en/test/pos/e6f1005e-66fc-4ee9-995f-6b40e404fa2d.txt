Alexi's is somewhere between Greek and Italian, closer to the latter. No matter - each entree is outstanding in its own right. Last time in the desert cannelloni was spicy and delicious - and totally hopped up on chile peppers. The salmon salad - magnificent - and perfectly cooked. The food is excellent AND it's a great place to hob-nob. The area has a loyal clientele of movers and shakers. Alexi's is highly recommended in midtown - one of the best places especially for lunch in Phoenix.
