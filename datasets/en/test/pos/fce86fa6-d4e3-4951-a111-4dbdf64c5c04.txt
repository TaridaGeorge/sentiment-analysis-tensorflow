This place has a big sign outside that says 
"Under New Management"

I'm not sure how new the management is, or if the old management sucked... whatever.  Don't really care.

I totally dig this place.  $3.99/lb of live Fiji rock, AWESOME!
$7.99/lb of live Tonga rock, HUZZAH!
(I got 20lbs of live rock, and when I brought it home and set it up, all these little starfish and shrimp climbed out of the rock! )

I'm new to the marine aquarium world and I like that the guys here totally love saltwater tanks, talking about them, giving advice, etc etc.

They've been very helpful, and have super cool fishies to stare at too!
I like a lot.
