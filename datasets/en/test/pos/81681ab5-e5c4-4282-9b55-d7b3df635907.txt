Found this place on ZocDoc.com cause I was needing to make a last minute appointment.  I was on vacation for the Spring Break Yelp Party, but I ended up coming down with a cold.  We left on Sunday and I decided, with the way I was feeling, to get on my phone and try to find an open appointment for Monday.  And I found one near by.  

I didn't know this was an urgent care, but either way I was treated quickly, kindly and respected.  The front staff was cheerful and kind.  The Dr I saw was very nice and treated me like a human being.  (sometimes you just don't get treated like that anymore)  

I highly recommend this place!
