I loved my experience at Mariee. I had a lot of fun trying on all the Claire Pettibone dresses but in the end loved the Lea Ann Belter dress the best. My mom and two sisters-in-law had a nice spot to sit while I tried on dresses and everyone who worked there was very patient and helpful.

Definitely worth the visit.
