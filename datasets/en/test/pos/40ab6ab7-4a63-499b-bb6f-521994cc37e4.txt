Maybe, this place isnt the greatest...  I dunno I just love the inside lighting and the juke box and the couches!

The ambience just does it for me.  even going outside to watch the crowds going by is fun. 

Never had the food so it might suck for all I know, but I just love sitting on those couches ordering drinks from the punk-esque waitresses.

If I lived around there it would be my hang out fo sho,
