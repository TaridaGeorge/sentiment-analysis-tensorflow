I am glad that Noodles Ranch is my very first review.  I absolutely LOVE their Pho Soups.  A five star ratting is exactly what this restaurant deserves.  Very unassuming location, humble service and owners, but extraordinary Pho.  There was one week that I ate lunch at Pho EVERY day.  It is just that good and I can never seem to get enough.  I highly recommend Pho for the food, service, and atmosphere.  Comfort food at its finest.
