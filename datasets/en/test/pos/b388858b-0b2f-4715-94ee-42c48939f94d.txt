If you get the chance to try the pie at Mama Toledo's pie truck you must give it a taste. I have to confess I have tried way toooo many flavors.  The great news is you can never go wrong!  Her seasonal flavors of Apple Chili and Pumpkin  are so delicious. The pumpkin pie took the boring out of pumpkin pie and made it a real showstopper.  My personal favorite is the cherry pie --so fresh and a bit tart but not too much. 
 At the next street fair, art market or farmers market look for the bright red truck and be sure to save room for pie!
