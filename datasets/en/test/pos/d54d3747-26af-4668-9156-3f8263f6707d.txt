my wife does our grocery shopping, but when i do my monthly bike ride on trail 100, i drive by trader joes and pick up things on our list. 

i'm always torn by trader joes. i like their prices, their products, their customer service. yet i always feel like it's full of uppity customers, often glaring at me for wearing sweaty, dirty mtn bike clothes, wal-mart flip flops, and not driving a car over 50k. 

it's a good thing i don't really care, because trader joes is for all us middle class yokels.
