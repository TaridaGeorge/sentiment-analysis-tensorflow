My husband and I stayed here and loved it!!!!!! The rooms were very clean! We loved the modern look. We get so tired of the "southwest" look and this place didn't have that. A bonus was the complimentary breakfast and reception time. Awesome! To top it all off, the service at the front desk was awesome. The two ladies that were working the front desk were very pleasant and super nice. The pool was a little smaller than it looked in photos, but that's no biggy. Can't wait to go back.
