Why are you so far from my house!!!!!!!???? 
I love this place.  Great coffee, amazing pastries, and a really cute ambiance.  I can't wait to go when it's not a thousand degrees to enjoy their farmer's market area and possibly even sit outside (what a novel idea in Phoenix!).
On second thought, it's probably better that you're so far from me...my butt would be huge if your cupcakes were any more convenient.
