These guys rock, plain and simple.  I bought a bike and got a hand written thank-you letter from the owner, how cool?  I bought another bike and returned it five months later (was in perfect condition because my kid didn't like it, had receipt and paperwork) and there were no problems returning it except a small stocking fee which I was cool with.  These guys make me trust shopping small, local businesses.  Check them out.
