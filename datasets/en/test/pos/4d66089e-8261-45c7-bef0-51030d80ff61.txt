I attended this restaurant Sunday night with a food group of which I am apart. Being that there were 18 of us, they reserved their gorgeous community table for us. The ambiance was perfect for a romantic night out on the town. 
Being that we were there on a Sunday, we took part in their special of half-off bottles of Arizona wine. (which occurs every Sunday)

I was able to taste small portions of several entrees and each was impeccable and thoughtfully constructed. The presentation was beautiful. For dessert, I branched out and tried the owner's recommendation of the chocolate-covered bacon peanut butter s'mores with homemade marshmallows. It was absolutely divine. 

I would highly recommend this establishment on every level and from every angle: the service, taste, decor, and the list goes on.
