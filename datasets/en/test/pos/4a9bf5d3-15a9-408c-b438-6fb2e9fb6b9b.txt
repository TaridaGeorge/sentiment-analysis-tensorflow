First time on WN....PHX to LAS 10:35 Mon morning 28 Dec...checked in online day before and got A pos 42....always preferred other airlines because I could choose my seat in advance and have frequent flyer mileage....luckily got first row window with more leg room....attendants were as friendly as I've ever had...left and arrived on time...will probably fly WN again
