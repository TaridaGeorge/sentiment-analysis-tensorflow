Have eaten here a number of times since my first review. The food is great. My shredded beef taco was stuffed full of tasty beef and the cheese enchilada was very cheesy (in a good way). My friend ordered a special plate. Our server was great. We were seated right away next to a lovely roaring fire. As always, the chips and salsa are outstanding.
