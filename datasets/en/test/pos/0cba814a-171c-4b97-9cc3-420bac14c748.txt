The best bar food in Phoenix. Actually, calling it "bar food" almost seems denigrating, this is just very tasty cuisine.

Hot chick sandwich, best turkey, mahi-mahi sandwich, nachos, soup - all are excellent. I did not review this place until I'd eaten here a few times, because I wanted to see if they could deliver top notch quality consistently. They exceeded my expectations, which is why they deserve a 5 star rating.

 Happy hour ( 3-6 pm) has 1/2 price appetizers, $2 off wine and other drink specials. They also have Odell's IPA on tap, which means they are serious about good beer.

Parking sucks but so does every other place in that area. Really nice atmosphere - good lighting and great patio, but can get really crowded at night, so come early.
