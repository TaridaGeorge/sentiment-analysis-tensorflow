What a great Thai place!  It's close to my work, and whenever I can, I sneak in there for lunch!  The food comes to the table, piping hot, the ingredients are fresher than fresh, the flavors are delectable, the whole place is clean!  The service is terrific, led by sweet and efficient Rose.  My faves are Garlic Cashew Beef and Garlic Lover's Chicken ... yummo!  It's a bit pricer that going to fast food for lunch, but the service is almost as fast!  Parking can get a bit tricky because they share a parking lot with the strip mall, but it's worth figuring it out.  Great, great restaurant ... you'll love it!
