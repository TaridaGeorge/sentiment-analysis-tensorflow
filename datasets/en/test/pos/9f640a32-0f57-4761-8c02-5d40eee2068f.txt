I loved this place.  I've only been to one event here, but it was awesome.  I love how it's a historical house, and how they support local artists and events.  The staff was all very nice, the decorations were unbelievable, and the yard was beautiful

It looked like parking could be difficult, but we took a taxi which worked out perfectly.  Just be aware of parking issues if you drive.
