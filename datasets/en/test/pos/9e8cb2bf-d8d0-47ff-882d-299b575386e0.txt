I don't park anywhere else! 
Well, unless picking up incoming guests or something... :) 

Seriously Parking Spot rocks! They are always friendly, quick to shuttle me to Terminal 4, quick to shuttle me back after I arrive, there's always discounts you can find.... covered parking, free water when I'm leaving.... love them!

And... you can even join their Frequent Parker club to earn points for Free Parking! Duh...  if you're a frequent business traveler, why wouldn't you do that?? Duh....

They just flat-out earn my dollar (and my company's dollar) everytime I need to park at PHX. 

Thanks Parking Spot!
