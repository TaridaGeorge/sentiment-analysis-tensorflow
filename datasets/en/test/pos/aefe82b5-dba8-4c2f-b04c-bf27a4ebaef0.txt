This hotel is so much fun. I live not even a mile away and it was the perfect stay-cation. The rooms are a perfect size, beds are incredibly comfortable. My favorite part was the pool and pool bar. There is a DJ on the weekends which made the whole experience that much better. Also, the hotel is Dog friendly which made it really convenient for us so we didn't have to board him. Once we checked in the brought us a dog blanket, bowl, treats, doggy bags and a toy. I would recommend anyone to stay here.
