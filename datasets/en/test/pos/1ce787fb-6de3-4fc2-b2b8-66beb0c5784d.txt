The best mall in the Phoenix metro area. It has really everything. From Banana Republic to Jcrew to Nordstroms, Neimans, Gucci and Louis Vuitton. 

It definitely carries all the high end stores but also has the affordable shops too. The food court is great and diverse. 

Some of the department stores offer their own valet but I like to park myself because it's free.
