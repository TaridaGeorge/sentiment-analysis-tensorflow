Crudo, shattered potato chips, deviled eggs, meatloaf, strawberry basil gin lemonade, chocolate pudding, rice pudding, all of it soooo delicious. And that's about half of the smorgasbord I noshed on... those are just the favorites that really stuck with me. 

Seriously the most amazing meatloaf I have ever had. I never thought I'd use "amazing" to describe meatloaf, but there you go.
