I recently had the opportunity to cater a small event at MonOrchid and I have to say, if you are looking for a unique, artsy and really special venue for your event, this place is it!  I could easily see how the space could lend itself beautifully to weddings, bridal showers, as well as corporate or team building events and I would love to see live music there--I am sure it would be a stellar small concert venue as well.  

As an added bonus, Wayne, the owner of the MonOrchid, is such a personable guy, making it a real pleasure to do business in his amazing space.
