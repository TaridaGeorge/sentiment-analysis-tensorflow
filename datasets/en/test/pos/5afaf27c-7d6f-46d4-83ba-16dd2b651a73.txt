I blew a tire on the free way this morning, soo scary!! So I drove to to Discount Tire on Southern and McClintock on my little donut :/, to buy a new tire. I was greeted by Jesse  before I even walked into the building. He was very professional and friendly and helped with all my questions. the rest of the staff was also very friendly and greeted each costumer. I don't know a lot about tires, but I trust the info Jesse gave me. $117 for a new tire with a warranty, not bad! I defiantly will return for the rest of my tires, and because of the great experience with Discount Tire, I no longer dread buying new tires. Thx guys :)
