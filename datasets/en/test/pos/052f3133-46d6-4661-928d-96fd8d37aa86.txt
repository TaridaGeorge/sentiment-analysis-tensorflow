Great Italian food and served in a super cute atmosphere.  The service was good and our waiter was very attentive to our table. The food was great...we started with the Gnocchi which was wonderful! I had the Chicken Marsala and also tried some of the Lasagna...both were fantastic.  The best part of the night was the wonderful Chianti that was suggested to us and the shot of Sambuca that was brought to us after our dinner, compliments of the house.  i would give this place a try if you are looking for a great Italian dinner...everyone that has been from my recommendation, LOVED it. :)
