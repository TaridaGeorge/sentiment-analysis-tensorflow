I agree that the timing here is great.
I've only been once but they had a cowboy-ish old dude jammin' so that was pretty cool.
I was here for a work thing with some people I had just met so I just spent the entire dinner wondering how the f was I  going to expense this...luckily  one of the dudes paid, saving my boss from having to fire my ass (upscale + North Scottsdale = Out of my price range).

I had a DELISH pumpkin soup that had some seeds it in for crunch, a side salad that wasn't too special, a chicken entree w/ mushrooms and a bunch o' beer.  We all tried one another's food and it was all good, though I can't remember anything particular. Definitely save room for dessert!

Pretty good wine selection, as noted numerous times by a particularly obnoxious wino in our group.
