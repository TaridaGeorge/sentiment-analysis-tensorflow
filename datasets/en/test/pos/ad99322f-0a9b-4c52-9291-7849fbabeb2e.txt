Like a warm comforter Durant's has com through again. We had the prime Rib which was expertly prepared with the perfect side. The Meat melted in our mouths, and the Au juice was almost not needed.  The Garlic Mashed potatoes were heavenly fluffy and the service was impeccable.  There are many great Steakhouses in this country and I believe that Durant's is one of them, for 60 years of excellence, always perfectly done!
