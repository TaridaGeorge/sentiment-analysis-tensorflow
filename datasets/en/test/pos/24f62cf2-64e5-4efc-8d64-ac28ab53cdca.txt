Very surprising location for a coffee shop this Phillipino cafe brings a large unusual array of flavoured coffees hot and cold.  

They have a great selection (untried by me) of ethnic food. 

Great staff some are very skilled and take pleasure in creating the drinks.  

I recommend the peanut butter iced coffee or the hot banana nut latte!
