Was disappointed to find out that 'Thats a Wrap' had closed it's doors but very happy to report that an even better restaurant took it's place! The girls that run the place are very sweet and make a mean sandwich. I had the West Coast wrap and the spicy ranchero sauce is FAB!! They give you a really nice sized portion of fruit too, all for $7. You can't beat it! 

They have mustaches everywhere (even on their bags) and it's a cute place. Plus when you leave they give you Ghiradelli chocolates. 

Can't wait to try more of the menu as D'Lish is a great lunch spot and has super friendly staff!
