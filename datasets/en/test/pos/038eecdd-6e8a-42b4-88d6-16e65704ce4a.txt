I noticed there have not been any reviews written since Hegel moved (and grew a lot!) in early 2011. I've been doing yoga for over a decade, have visited quite a few studios over that time, and have also watched a couple of them through similar transitions. In the past, I've always left a few months after those transitions finding them suddenly impersonal and too expensive. HEGEL, on the other hand, has retained the majority of the characteristics it had a year ago when I fell in love with it. While class sizes (especially of the lower levels) have overall had some major growth, Tish and the other regular teachers still have a way of facilitating each individuals' practice. The community that exists here continues to be the same passionate and kind group (just a little bigger), and I've never found a place I felt more comfortable.
