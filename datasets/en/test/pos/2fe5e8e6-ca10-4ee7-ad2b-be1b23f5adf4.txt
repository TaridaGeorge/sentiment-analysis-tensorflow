Great deals for facials and body scrubs, with high quality products.  Your student experience will be different depending on the student naturally, but the times I've been here the students have been very knowledgeable and thorough, as well as very friendly and personable.  The basic facial is only $33, is an hour, and is custom tailored to your skin type.  Body scrubs are $40 and are also custom tailored in a similar fashion.  They are open Saturdays and late on Mondays and Tuesdays, so it is an excellent and convenient place to get your skin pampered!
