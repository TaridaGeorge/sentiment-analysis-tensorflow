Today is a historic day (9/9/09)!  After 28 years, Don and Charlie's opened for lunch.   I was not disappointed.  They are serving lunch from 11:30am until 2p in the bar.

There was a great selection of hamburgers and chicken sandwiches.  As always, the food was superb and the service (with Cooper) was even better.  The prices are more than reasonable for a big,  juicy hamburger.

For the record, on this inaugural day, I had a cheeseburger with bacon and grilled onions, no bun, a few cheese fries, dill pickle and creamy coleslaw.  

It does not get much better than that!
