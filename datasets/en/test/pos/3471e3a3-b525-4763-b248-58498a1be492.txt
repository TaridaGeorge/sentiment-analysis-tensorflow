If you are looking for local culture, this is it. As a recent transplant to Phoenix, I really enjoyed my visit to the museum and learned a lot about the local Native American cultures. This is also a must visit when people visit you in Phoenix. What I especially love about this museum is that it presents the Native American cultures as living, breathing peoples and not in a museum/"under glass" sort of manner. There is a lot of information here, and it is presented clearly and coherently.
