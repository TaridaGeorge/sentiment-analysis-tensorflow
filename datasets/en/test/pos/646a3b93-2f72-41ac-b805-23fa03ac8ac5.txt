This fine breakfast establishment is right next to my work and I am lucky enough to get to go there often.  Even if I go for work with a large group the service is good, the food is great, and the prices are very fair.  Most times when we go with a large group they give us one of their famous Apple Pancakes for free!

The Pancake house does not accept credit or debit cards,  it is cash or check only.  They also STRONGLY suggest you do not use  your cell phone while you are in the restaurant.  This policy alone warrants 5 stars.  They have signs all over the place advising of their request for this courtesy, which should be common, but some people are VERY important in case you did not know.

I have never had anything here that did not impress me.
