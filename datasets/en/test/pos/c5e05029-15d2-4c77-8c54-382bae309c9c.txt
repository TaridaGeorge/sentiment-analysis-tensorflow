I am most definitely a fan.

My friend was taking me out to dinner the other night and it was my choice.  I have been to Sierra Bonita a long time ago and I remember that I loved my experience there before.

This time it was just as memorable.  For starters we had the bacon wrapped shrimp.  Oh boy was that pleasure in my mouth! I had the buttermilk chicken with the side of mashed chipotle sweet potatoes.  It was amazing....and I made sure I left room for dessert!  I told myself I would only have a bite of the bread pudding and save the rest for later.  

Yeah....that didn't happen.  I devoured that amazing dessert with spectacular speed.  

I can't wait to go back to try something new!!!
