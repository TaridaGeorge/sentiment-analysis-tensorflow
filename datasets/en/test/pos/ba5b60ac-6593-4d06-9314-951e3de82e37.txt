I was getting married on 2-29-2012. And we wanted something that was quick and easy and near our wedding location. My now husband suggested we go to how you roll. I'm not a sushi person. But I was willing to try it. The staff was very helpful and understood I didn't like sushi, so they suggested some veggie rolls! The soy seaweed, rolled inside-out with white rice, strawberries, cream cheese and jalapenos. It was so good!  
So we got it catering for our wedding, and everyone ate everything!  The whole staff was so nice, and said we were the first ones to have catering! 
Thank you "HDYR" for your suggestions and for your amazing work!
