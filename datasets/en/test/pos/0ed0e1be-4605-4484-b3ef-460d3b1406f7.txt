We held a meeting planner's luncheon inviting local clients to our hotel that host regular meetings.  Our theme was "getting to the core of your meeting" and the entire event had an apple theme.  Yuri's Popcorn created a special flavor green apple for our event and it was a nice compliment to our other offerings.  Our attendees absolutely loved it and were excited about all the creative and delicious offerings, including centerpieces with an arrangement of candies and popcorn beautifully arranged into a bouquet of yumminess.

Several months ago, we hosted a lemonade stand for a client serving glasses of flavored lemonade.  Yuri's created another fun flavor....lemon....that was well received by all.

They offer the perfect gifts for clients and everything is very affordable when you're on a tight budget.

Thank you!
