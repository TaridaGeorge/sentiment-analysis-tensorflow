There aren't many places in the valley that make me feel I am somewhere unique and 'non-chain' but this is one of them. Yes sometimes the service can be a little off but when this place has it's game on ... it's ON! The wine list is always interesting giving you choices that surprise and please, the food is well priced and the brew-shetta (Geordie accent please) is ridiculously good.
I should give this 4 stars as the service can be hit and miss but I gave it 5 for those great nights with friends when the music is loud but not too loud, the wine is flowing and a good time is being had by all!
