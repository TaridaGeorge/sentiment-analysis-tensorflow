The true testiment to good stylist is not how you look walking out of the salon but how your hair cut looks a month later. My hair cut grew out nicely (I have shortish hair) and after 7 weeks I went back to April and received another great cut. The salon is fresh and sunny and April's talents as a stylist are evident. I am hooked!
