I adore everything about Made from the cute house to the creative jewelry and artwork for sale on the walls.  Plus, there is a door that connects to Eye Lounge (except on First Fridays).  The best part is that they sell all of the Fuzzy Balls line by Roy Wasson Valle, an awesome local artist.  

I've never walked out of Made without buying something, even if it's just a pin or a notecard.  Luckily, it's close enough to my office that I can pop in at lunch, especially handy around the holidays since 95% of the gifts I buy come from here.

Pop in, check it out...there is something for everyone.
