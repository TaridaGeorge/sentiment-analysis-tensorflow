I love Justina, the owner.  She is super sweet, funny and sassy.  It's true that she has a wicked sense of style!  My husband and I had our second date here and religiously go about once a month.  We go for the AWESOME food - the Mint Chicken is my favorite although the Crispy Noodle Cake is pretty good too.  My husband also likes the Pad Thai here.  You can't beat the BYOB or BYOW with no corking fee.  I love the atmosphere, the music and how intimate the restaurant is.  This really is one of my favorite places to eat and I always bring out of town guests here.  :)
