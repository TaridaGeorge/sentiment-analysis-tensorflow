My wife and I have been coming here for 3 years straight now!  I have nothing but good things to say about the property.   The staff has always been extremely accommodating, and friendly.   Having 3 golf courses keeps me busy everyday if I choose.   Definitely play the Gold and Blue (Patriot) before the Red.    They are much nicer courses.   The rooms are nice and ROOMY, we love the fairway casitas becasue they're right on the course across from the practice facilities.   If you're bored, just hit some balls (they're free), or practice some putts!
