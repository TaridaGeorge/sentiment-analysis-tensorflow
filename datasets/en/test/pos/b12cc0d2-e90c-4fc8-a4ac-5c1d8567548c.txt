This is the best Trader Joe's location I've ever been to. Because of its location and most likely its newness, it's not really busy yet. And it's huge! The widest aisles I've ever seen in a Trader Joe's so you can actually push a cart around without encountering non-stop traffic jams like you usually would at a TJ's. Great addition to Surprise!
