The five stars are mostly for the superb, warm, and inviting service. Lorenzo and Dino made me feel at home the second I sat down on the intimate patio. Complimentary cheese bread with marinara to start off the meal, and complimentary home-made tiramisu and Amaretto to end it, were really nice touches.
The strip-mall location is a bit unfortunate, but I'm telling you, the people who own and run this place more than make up for it. 
Since I was not very hungry, I only ordered the straciatella soup (which was delicious) and a glass of wine. But all I could hear from the tables around me, was how tasty the food was.
Parmigiano will from now on be a must-visit every time I'm in Scottsdale.
