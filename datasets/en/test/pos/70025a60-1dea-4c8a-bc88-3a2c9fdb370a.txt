I have been to this store with two different cars over the years.  The car I took in today has always been to the dealer because I have free oil changes.  The brakes needed service according to the dealer, but I did not want to drive into downtown PHX.  Brake Masters took a look and said that I didn't need new pads, just resurfacing of the disc rotors.  The dealer would have told me new pads and rotors.  $189 at Brake Masters, over $600 at the dealer for work that was not necessary.
