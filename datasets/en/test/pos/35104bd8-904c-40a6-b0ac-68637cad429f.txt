I had the opportunity to play on this amazing course because of Nate Martinez. I showed up at the course without the proper golf attire. I am now the owner of a Blackstone shirt, shorts & hat. 
We had lunch at the club- amazing Turkey sandwich.
The driving range was nice but the best part were the challenging holes. The greens run fast which took some adjusting... Next time I play Blackstone I will be ready for them!!
