First time coming here and we weren't disappointed. One of the best Rubens I've have in Arizona, everyone else in my party had burgers. The California, Bacon & cheese, and a cheese burger. Everyone was very happy with they're orders. Also tried the onion rings and cheese curds. Both were great. Great people behind the counter and very friendly. Can't wait to keep trying  more of the menu.
