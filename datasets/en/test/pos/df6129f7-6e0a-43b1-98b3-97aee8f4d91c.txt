One of my favorite place for vietnamese food. The pho is the best in the phoenix area and prices are so reasonable, in fact, they're downright cheap! I am Vietnamese and this restaurant has my stamp of approval for authenic, cheap, good food.

The service is the vietnamese norm. Someone will take your drink and food order and then bring you your food. If you need something, you need to speak up. They will not come by and ask how everything is. This is the STANDARD and NORMAL Vietnamese service.
