Yep, I'm in love! Suck it, RA!! I love this place because you can choose sushi from a conveyor belt while you sit. You can also special order an entree as well. I also love how the plates are each $1.50 or $2.00 and the portions are small (3 pieces to a plate) so you're not stuck with 8 pieces when you order one roll. This way, you can sample a little bit of everything. I got 2 rolls, edemame, dumplings (forget the actual name) and my husband got 4 rolls and the total cost? $15! Hot damn, we WILL be back!!!
