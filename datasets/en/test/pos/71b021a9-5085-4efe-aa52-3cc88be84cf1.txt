found cute dog bed and some neat bbq items and a cute wire decor thing to set my cell phone on and other stuff next to the bed. I like this store, they have tons of tennis shoes and cute towels & linens. Its near my house so I always pop in just to check out what they have. I never found it to be ghetoo or very crowded, I like it.
