One of my favorite cuisine's prepared with perfection. The honey wine is amazing as well as the hot tea. You can choose a vegetarian meal or add chicken, lamb, or beef if you'd like. If you're not sure what you want, they have a plate they can bring out with a sampling of several dishes. I tend to order this regularly for variety. Best of all, leftovers (which you will most likely have) taste even better after they've been in the fridge for a few hours. Dishes are very flavorful, not spicy. If you are not familiar with Ethiopian cuisine, you might want to research it a bit before you go. I highly recommend to the adventurous and vegetarian.
