Delicious!  Wonderful brunch spot.  Tasty food, inviting decor, and reasonably priced.  My sister-in-law and I came here for lunch, and we both ordered the Cinnamon Roll Stuffed French Toast.  It was SO worth the calories.  We both brought our babies with us, and everyone was so accommodating.  It was a lovely experience and I will definitely be back!
