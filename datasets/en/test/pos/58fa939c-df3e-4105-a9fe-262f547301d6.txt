We had a group of 8.  We were sat quickly.. SWEET!  The ambiance very west elm, loved it. The service was great and very attentive, my drink was refilled without ask.  And one time, I did not even know it was refilled...  Ninja waiters?   We order the meat and cheese appetizer... YUM!  I ordered the pepperoni pizza...  Thin crust, cheese is just right amount, not cheap on the pepperoni, and the basil was fresh...  Need to drag my foodies girls to this place...
