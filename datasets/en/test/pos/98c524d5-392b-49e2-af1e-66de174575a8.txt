Carina impressed me the moment she arrived! My dog, Jake, ran right to her. He left a scruffy little muffin. After only one hour, he returned a dapper little dude. His cut was done to perfection. After four plus hours at some of the other places, he returned with nicks, scrapes and an irritated bum. This was certainly not the case this time. We will definitely be calling COUTURE CLIPS next time he needs a trim!! Excellent choice!!
