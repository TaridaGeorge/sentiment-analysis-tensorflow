Classy, sassy, with a dash of salt.  Wildfish is the place to be during happy hours.  Their appetizers are phenomenal and out of this world.  Fresh oysters, fried calamari and some wagyu beef.  Wag what!? Wagyu stupid - Wiki it!  Their selection of wine is always a delight and service is bolting fast.  I think it helps when they're all dressed like penguins; there's so many! - awwe so cute though :)  The ambience is so chill with a nice touch of a lounge.  Happy Hours all day Monday so push that "case of the Mundays" aside! - Enjoy
