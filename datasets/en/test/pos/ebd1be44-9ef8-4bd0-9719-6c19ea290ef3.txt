Derek @ Exklusiv Motorsports is the best VW guy in the Valley.   He knows these cars inside and out and is one of the only guys in the Valley that really knows the TDI's.  His prices are extremely reasonable and he is very honest about what needs (or doesn't need) to be done to your car.  Derek has been doing all the work on my 01 Jetta for the last 11 years and I have always been very happy with his service.  From routine oil changes, to power upgrades to complete engine rebuilds, Derek is the guy to see for your VW.  He is not the easiest guy to get ahold of but his work, honesty and pricing are absolutely worth dealing with that small difficulty.
