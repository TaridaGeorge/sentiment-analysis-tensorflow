i love this place!

i always order the bbq sampler plate for $12.  i believe 2 ribs, chicken, pork, beef and a side dish come with the order.  it's great when compared to most bbq restaurants.  i like the meat and seasoning.  no complaints.

the parking and lines are usually a joke.  it seems like whenever i go to joe's there is a line to order.

give it a shot.  if you like it great.  if you don't then you can go to hell.  jk.
