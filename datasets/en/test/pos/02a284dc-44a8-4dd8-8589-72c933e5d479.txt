I love this place!  It's always packed every day here with a line out the door!  They have great food and the portion sizes are pretty big.  I love the BC coffee (iced coffee that's infused w/hazel nut and caramel topped with cream.)  the breakfast menu has lots to choose from (the omelets are big enough to split  for 2 people0 and the lunch menu is great too!  Got to try the green tea here, another favorite!!  They are open from 5am to 3pm daily!
