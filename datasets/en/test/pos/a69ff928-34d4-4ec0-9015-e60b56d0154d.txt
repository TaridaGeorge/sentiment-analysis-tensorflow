Went to opening night...was a blast! Very cute decor, nice tables to sit at. Love the "homeyness" of the Coffee shop, the ice cream is to DIE for, I had the caramel/salty ice cream..was wonderful in a waffle cone which was just the right crunchiness ! The owner was very nice, got to visit with him for a few minutes, He was interested in what we thought about the ice cream and place.  I would definitely go back...and I live in south chandler...was worth the drive.
