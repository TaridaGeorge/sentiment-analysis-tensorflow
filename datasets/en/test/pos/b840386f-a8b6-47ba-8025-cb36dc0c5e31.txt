This place is kind of hidden in this little shopping center, but absolutely worth seeking it out! Go for lunch and get the #11. You will not be disappointed.

Every time I'm home to visit family, I absolutely have to stop here at least once. And if you're in the mood for an appetizer, get the thod mun.
