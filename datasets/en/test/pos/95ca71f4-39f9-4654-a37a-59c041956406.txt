This is a great place to get a protein packed chicken sandwich fast. The people that work here are friendly and the drive thru moves pretty fast. I only wish they were open on Sundays for my afternoon workout post meal. Other than that I like this place and that says a lot coming from me. Only downside is that it does get pricey but you get what you pay for and it's better than McDonalds (Which I never eat)!!!
