All I can say is greek salad, potato salad, and Zoe's signature slaw.( not all together though, you'll explode)  I hate picnic food, but this place puts a spin on it that you wouldn't believe. I practically go broke stopping here after work every day, but my job is so demanding that I fast all day...it's worth the wait!  And if you're ever in a rush, order your food ahead of time and just pick it up...then you don't have to worry about waiting all day for your food at the high rush time (around 11pm-1pm)
