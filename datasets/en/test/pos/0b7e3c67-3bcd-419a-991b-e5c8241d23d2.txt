My wife and I loved everything about our experience at NOCA.

 I want to congratulate the culinary team on showcasing high quality ingredients , crafted in a delicate, thoughtful way.

The amuse-bouche, cotton candy and parting treat round out an amazing tasting menu.  The passion shows.  Keep up the good work, keep pushing the envelope and be proud.  We will be back.  Hopefully soon.
