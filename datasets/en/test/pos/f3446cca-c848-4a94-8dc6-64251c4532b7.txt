In Sanskrit, 'Metta' means "loving kindness", perhaps this is all you need to know about the studio. Every class is different, but each class shares the common thread of this definition. Teachers are professional, yet friendly (no yogatude), and the casual atmosphere makes everyone feel welcome. The connection with the Phoenician is so cool as it's fun to practice in a beautiful environment as well as at the sweet spot on Indian School. From expectant Mom's to seasoned veteran yogi's -- feel free to just be you within your practice at Metta.
