My best choice restaurant for dessert. I tried the famous Chris Outrageous Chocolate Cake and found my new favorite dessert! It's so delicate and at the same time the chocolate is not too overpowering the flavor of coconut mousse. The calamari is great, they cooked it just right. I'm highly satisfied with choosing this restaurant for dessert!
