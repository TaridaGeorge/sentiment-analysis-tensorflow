I have been eating at China Way since I was in high school (that was 10 years ago and it has been consistently good. I don't think I have ever had a bad meal here. To look at the building, its not much but the family that runs it is super nice and the food is amazing. There is only one thing I order because it is so good that I can't bring myself to order anything else. The General Tsao's chicken combo with fried rice, egg roll, and crab puff. Everything included in this combo is excellent and they have probably the best sweet and sour sauce I have ever had. To me, Chinese food doesn't get any better than this!
