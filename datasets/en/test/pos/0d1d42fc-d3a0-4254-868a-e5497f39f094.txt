I love Knockout. The staff is very friendly and always helpful. They pay special attention to the kids. The classes are always challenging and fun. They take intimidation out of this fun sport. I feel more fit since I joined and I look forward to going every day. All of my friends who have tried a free class have loved it and end up joining. The gym is also very clean and they have cardio and weight equipment as well.
