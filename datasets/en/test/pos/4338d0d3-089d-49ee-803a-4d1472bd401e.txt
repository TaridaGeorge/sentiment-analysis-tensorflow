I love everyone at AZ Animal Wellness Center! Wow, they take care of my sweet dog (Cooper) as well, if not better, than I do.  They got me in for a same day appointment (within 45 minutes in fact!) when I called them about a concerning wound/lesion on his back.  They analyzed it and determined it needed to be removed and got him in for surgery the next morning.  Everyone was very loving toward Cooper and took great care of him.  He's back home and happy (although loopy from the morphine) and I'm so grateful for everyone, especially Dr. Heetland, who was our vet (but I heard from a friend that all the vets are great here). Thank you to everyone at AZ Animal Wellness Center for taking care of my baby!
