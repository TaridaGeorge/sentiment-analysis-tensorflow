I did some research on the top local tuners when I moved to AZ and these guys were top of the list.  I had them do some porting and ceramic coating work, and Clark tuned my car to perfection for the crappy 91 octane AZ gas.  I trust these guys to do it right and give good advice, and I keep going back.
