This is a good place to eat the pulled pork & cabbage, or the b-que-beef and chicken mix and just tried the chicken misubi and its pretty amazing.
You also get a side of macaroni salad-no one make it like they do-mild but awesome!  You get two servings of rice also with your food.  ALOT OF FOOD!!!
My daughter introduced us to this place originally and it's yum!
Different kinda menu but you have to try it as it's like nothing else!
Did you know they open at 10 in the morning for those who work early??
YUP!!
