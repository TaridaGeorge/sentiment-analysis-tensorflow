This has got to be the best Costco EVER. 

Playa playa parking? 

Not crowded...AT ALL? 

Opening up a new line just for me because I'm third in some other line? INSANE! 

Unload my cart for me, too?! I'M SPOILED! 

The one thing though is that they forgot to give me my Mahi-Mahi. How? I don't know. I thought I left the frozen fish in my car, but I looked at the receipt and saw that they didn't charge me so it's all good. That just means that I have to go to the GREATEST COSTCO IN THE WHOLE ENTIRE WORLD!
