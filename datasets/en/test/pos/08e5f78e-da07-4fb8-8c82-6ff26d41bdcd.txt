I've been getting my gyro's from this place for years now.  Nothing in the city compares.  It's quick, cheap, and delicious.  You really can't ask for much more.  

Food is always hot, and cooked to order.  Menu is large and provides a variety of delicious selections.  Anything from gyros to hot dogs, burgers to Italian beef sandwiches.  

Highly suggest trying it out!
