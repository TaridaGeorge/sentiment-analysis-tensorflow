I was introduced to Andre 10-plus years ago when he was working out of his house. I followed him to his second house and now to the present location.

I am echoing the other positive reviews before me. Andre is not only a great mechanic, has saved me a lot of money with his honesty and integrity. There have been times where he hasn't charged me for specific fixes or has given me a great discount.

You can judge any business by how it looks.  It is clean and orderly, which is rare for a mechanic's shop.  The cleanliness reflects Andre's attitude toward his service.  This is one mechanic who will not rip you off.  The consistent top-notch service, honesty and pricing is what keeps me coming back.

Keep up the good work Andre!
