This place is a hidden little jewel that apparently only locals know about. Since I am now a "local" I know too. Amazing is the only word I can think of. All fresh ingredient and made with love. I had the house made Margarita with no refined sugar at all. Just Tequila and fresh citrus. That's it! Then leeks with fresh mozzarella, bread crumbs and egg on top. Also rock shrimp, razor clams and cheese plate. Wow!  So European and yummy.
