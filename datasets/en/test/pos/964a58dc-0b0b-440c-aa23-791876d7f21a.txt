Nails are one of my small indulgences- a monthly pedicure keeps my toes in sandal condition during the summer. Historically I haven't had much loyalty to one nail place or another- but this one might change that. I saw Kevin for my appointment, and not only did he do a a fantastic job, but he was personable and nice to talk to. 

The place was clean and my wait time was minimal. A basic mani/pedi combo was only $35, which is a steal if you ask me! I'll definitely be back. 

It gets five stars because if you're comparing it to other strip mall nail places, it's as good as it gets! I figure that's a lot more fair than comparing it to Dolce or the Phoenician.
