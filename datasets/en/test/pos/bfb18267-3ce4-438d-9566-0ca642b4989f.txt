This place has everything I want.  Love their premium chocolate.  Love the salad bar.  Love the gourmet meats and bottled products.

Could easily spend $500 with no problem if I was a glutton which i try very hard not to be.  Well sometimes. maybe.


Order a chicken salad on sour dough bread.  I get pepperjack cheese and olive oil and balsamic.  

My ideal glutton food shopping exp. would be AJ's and Trader Joes and then stock the bar over at bev moe....
