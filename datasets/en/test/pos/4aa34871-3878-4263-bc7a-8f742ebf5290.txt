We stopped by for Mother's Day yesterday last minute, mainly because they took reservations and still had availability-  best decision we've made in a while!  Everything was dynamic- our server was passionate about the food and very helpful (not overly cheesy or pushy).  The food was absolutely incredible- we tried a bit of eveyrthing-- charcuterie, cheese plates, homemade pastas with very fresh seafood, chicken caesar, parmesan fries, salad nicoise, dessert (still drooling)-- everything was amazing.  A lot of time and love used in every dish.  The chef stopped by to say hello and shared some of his secrets with us which was a treat.   And the cocktails-- deliciously dangerous.  Also, I find the lunch prices to be very reasonable considering the high quality of food and time-intensive preparation!
