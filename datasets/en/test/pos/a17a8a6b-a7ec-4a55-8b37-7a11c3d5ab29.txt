I wonder how many restaurants that are within hotels would make it on their own in a stand alone setting? Cafe ZuZu would do fine, trust me, they don't need the captive clientele. 

Had breakfast here twice while staying at the Valley Ho. Absolutely amazing service and food. First morning I had the fresh fruit and yogurt parfait with homemade granola, delicious. Next morning had the best egg white omelete ever. 

As with everything Valley Ho, this was a very relaxing and pleasant experience.
