I was at the bookstore today, and as I was pulling out, I realized that a Zoyo Yogurt had moved in across the street.  This is a dream come true for me, because I really love Zoyo.  Their unique, cute, and have a great little setup for a yogurt shop.  

My first experience was with the one down in Chandler, off Chandler and 48th Street.  I came here tonight to treat myself, and went with the Cake Batter, with cherries and some chocolate syrup.  Grand total?  $3.07!!

Great prices, great flavors, toppings and a friendly staff, this place has it all.  Love you Zoyo!
