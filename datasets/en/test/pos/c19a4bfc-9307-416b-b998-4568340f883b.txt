We've been coming here for years - and it has always been one of our very favorite places. Perfect for a special night out - either for a romantic dinner or with friends.  But tonight we discovered a new thing to love here at Pappadeaux: the chargrilled salmon diablo! Perfectly prepared - and the flavors of the mesquite-grilled salmon were perfectly complemented by the slightly tangy diablo cream sauce, with big tasty pieces of crab and crawfish in it. Even the broccoli was delicious! Steamed with a light sprinkling of garlic lemon olive oil and a touch of warm red pepper flakes. Love!!!
