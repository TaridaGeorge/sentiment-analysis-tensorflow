Another great addition to Central Phoenix! Stopped in for dinner last weekend with my wife and absolutely loved this place. Pulling up it didn't look the big, but after the valet took our car and we saw the back patio, the bar, and the dining room we were quite impressed. We sat in the front room which is great and you can't even tell that you're right on Central Avenue. I had the Crab Cake BLT and my wife had the Picnic Kebobs. Both of us found our food to be delicious and the service was fast and attentive. 

I want to go back again and try the ceviche and some of the specialty cocktails. I can definitely see hanging out at this place when I am home in Phoenix.
