by far one of my favorite restaurants.  I'm totally in love with the biretta.  The best thing is to find a friend and share a salad and  brochette flight at lunch!   I took my husband once and he didn't think it was enough food to fill him up (he went home and ate more).... but for me I'm always happy and stuffed when i leave.
