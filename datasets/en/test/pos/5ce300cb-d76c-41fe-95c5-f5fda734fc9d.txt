Service is always welcoming.  Lucky to have a neighborhood cafe that serves your coffee with a smile and a "Thank you".

Favorite Drink is The Matador and you absolutely can't skip the whipped cream.

Pastries never an intention when I go in but always draw my eye and I'm sold.  They never disappoint
