I love this store!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

we recently lost a very dear/sentimental Carol Suina storyteller doll that was extremely hard to find (single child- trust me, they are not a dime a dozen).  I checked the Heard Museum online store & they had other pieces by the artist, but not the storyteller I was looking for, so I emailed them.  

Within 24 hours they tracked down another one in a similar style by an artist from the same tribe. when I sent that e-mail it was a total "shot in the dark" & I figured I'd be SOL. Jewel went out of her way to find a piece she thought I would like.... & she was totally right.

AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE & KNOWLEDGEABLE STAFF.  if I could give 6 stars, I would!
