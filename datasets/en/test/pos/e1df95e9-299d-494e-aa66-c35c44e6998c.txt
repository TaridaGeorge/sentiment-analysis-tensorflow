Loved the country chic decor, ambiance and the food!  Came here for Sunday brunch with my sister (who's a foodie) and absolutely loved it.  Looking forward to coming back here and trying different dishes.  The Marketplace across the street is also awesome for those times I don't feel like cooking, but want a high quality and tasty light meal.

I would recommend this place for an elegant brunch!
