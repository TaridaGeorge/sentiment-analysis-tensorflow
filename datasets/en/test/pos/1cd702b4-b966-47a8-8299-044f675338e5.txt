This is my 6th attempt to write a review.  I keep deleting and writing, and deleting and writing.  Nothing I write will do justice in conveying how much I love this place, the coaches, and the rest of the crew.  How the people like Chase and Heather have changed my life and the lives of my family... and how I'd lose my mind if I couldn't step foot in this facility at least once a day.  Come visit me at any noon class.  I'll be the one giving high fives and daps at the end of training.  The class and the coaching  will speak for themselves, but if you give me or any current member a minute, you'll eventually realize this is the only gym you will need to join.  Hands down, the best!!
