Breakfast done right... as everyone knows that is not an easy task.  The scamble eggs were fluffy and not over-cooked or dry.  They have an awesome protein pancake packed with oats and blueberries.  The skillet hash is amazing!  Only quality ingredients used here.  The portions are also huge so only come here if you want to leave stuffed.  It is difficult to stop eating when it is m-m-good!
