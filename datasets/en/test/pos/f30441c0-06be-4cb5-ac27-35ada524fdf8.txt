Beautiful outdoor shopping center with courtyards and gardens for casual, low-stress shopping. Centrally located and less than a mile south of the world-famous Arizona Biltmore Hotel, the Biltmore Fashion Park is located at 24th Street & Camelback, across the street from The Ritz Hotel. It features stores like Saks, Escada, the Apple store, Restoration Hardware, Pottery Barn, Borders as well as one-of-a-kind boutiques. There's lots of good restaurants like Sam's Cafe (great southwestern cuisine), Steamers (seafood), Bamboo Club and a great outdoor lunch place called Vintage Market. There are tons of other restaurants within a quarter mile as well. http://www.shopbiltmore.com/about_us
