I have never felt this way about a restaurant in a very long time. 

I can't even begin to describe how beautiful this experience was. I had brought a date to this great restaurant thinking I have never been here why not. (I don't think my date was worth taking to this nice of a place) We showed up around dusk and eating dinner right by the window seeing all of Arizonas beauitiful colors in the sky was so delightful. 

Any anniversery or date or birthday for a special one, I would get a reservation asap!!!!

ps the bar a level lower is also great. Dance floor and outside patio with view. GREAT!!!
