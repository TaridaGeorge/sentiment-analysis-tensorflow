Small but sweet little family restaurant with authentic Italian food! Friendly service and they have indoor and out door seating and a bar as well. 
The bread was awesome and our entees too. Everything was made fresh and tasted it too. The owner shook our hands and was very gracious. We paid $50 for two with an appetizer and tea.
