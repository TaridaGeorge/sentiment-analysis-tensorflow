Holy Hell. Best cupcakes ever. If you like coconut and chocolate go for the Chocolate Coconut one. Like PB and Chocolate? The Peanut Butter Chip one is amazing too. Oh yeah the milk chocolate and dark chocolate ones are good too. Okay throw in a Cinnamon Sugar one for good measure too -I am just a chocolate hound, obviously.
