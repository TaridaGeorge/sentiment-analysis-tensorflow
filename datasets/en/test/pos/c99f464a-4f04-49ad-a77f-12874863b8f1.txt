I love this place!  Mike & Julie are amazing!  We had so much fun.  If your shy dont plan on sitting in the front because they may call on you for crowd participation.  I was amazed at how well they knew the most random songs.  The waitresses did a great job even when it was packed.  I would recommend going there to just about anyone looking for a good time.  If your a "stick in the mud" then just stay home. :)
