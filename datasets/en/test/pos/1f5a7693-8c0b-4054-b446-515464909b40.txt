The best margarita pizza in town - and we know our pizza. The perfect flavor. Great restaurant with a simple menu and good atmosphere. Fantastic chicken wings, salads and margarita pizza. The sangria is pretty good too. Usually a bit of a wait, but worth it. Can do some browsing at the market next door during your wait and grab Gelatto after.
