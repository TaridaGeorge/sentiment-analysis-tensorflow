Never Ending 

This describes the choices of food and drink here. 

On today's menu was a small toasted California Club and a Black Cherry sodee-pop. 

Don't let the sound of small fool you either, it is huge! Crammed packed with turkey, bacon, tomato and sprouts. This is a sub to try!

The staff including the owners are amazing. They have such a great selection of food and drink you can take your picky eating kid or a cranky grandad, both will find something to enjoy.
