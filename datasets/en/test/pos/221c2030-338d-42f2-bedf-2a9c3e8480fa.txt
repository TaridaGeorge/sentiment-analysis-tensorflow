Mamma Mia might be the best tasting and cheapest New York style pizza in town! You can get two slices of cheese pizza and a drink for $3.50 while still satiating your craving for delicious pizza. They also serve an array of other good foods (sandwiches, wings, cannoli..mmm, etc.), but one of the best of the other dishes is the vodka penne pasta that pretty much melts in your mouth.

The staff is really nice and the owner is a cool guy. They always bring the food out quickly and the quality of their food doesn't waver. So...try them today!
