This might be my shortest review. This place has Zagnuts and plenty of them and they are only $1.39 each (some places charge $2). If you like zagnuts, which are crunchy peanut butter and toasted coconut you know that these aren't sold in gas stations or normal places. Luck was on my side as I wandered into the addict. Zagnut lovers unite!
