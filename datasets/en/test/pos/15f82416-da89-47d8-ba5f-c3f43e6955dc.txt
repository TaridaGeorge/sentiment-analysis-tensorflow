I have had such a wonderful experience with IrisD Bridal. I found the little shop by chance after hitting up David's Bridal and not even seeing a single dress worth trying on. Instantly I fell in love with the little shop. The gowns were so beautiful. I loved Kristen right away! She is so helpful! I told her what I was looking for and she pulled out the perfect dress. It was totally not what I had thought I would get, but I tried it on and I LOVED it. I never would have tried on a gown like that if it weren't for her suggestion. The dress was on sale and I felt like I was practically stealing it from them! The customer service continues to be awesome. I can't say enough wonderful things about this place!
