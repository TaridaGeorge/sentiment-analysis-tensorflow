There are plenty of good dentists around, but Dr. Lee is an excellent dentist. His entire staff is very good at what they do. As the other reviews say, the office is very tastefully decorated, which makes the atmosphere comfortable. I've never felt that Dr. Lee would order a procedure unless it was necessary, and that's really important to me in a dentist. I highly recommend him - he knows what he's doing, has a light touch, and is personable and thorough. This is the kind of office that won't leave a job alone until they're 100% satisfied with it, and if there's even a small detail they don't like, they'll redo it until it's right. I would confidently recommend this office to family and friends.
