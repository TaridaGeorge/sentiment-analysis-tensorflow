Every time I walk into Sprinkles Cupcakes I feel as if I have been transported to a Willie Wonka bakery of some kind. No matter how busy this place is, the staff is always efficient and beyond cheerful in delivering what have to be the most delicious cupcakes on the planet. My family and I have a particular fondness for the coconut and strawberry flavors. Runners up include their chocolate marshmallow and chocolate banana. The cupcakes are delectable and the service is a delight. It's a win/win situation.
