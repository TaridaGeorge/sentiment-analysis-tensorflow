We have been going to Julio G's for at least 3 years. I totally disagree with Nikki Jo about their Salsa.  I really like the flavor of the mild Salsa and besides its Free and we love their Chips too. The hosts are always helpful and friendly even when we have to wait for a table. Service and Food has always been terrific and we have introduced alot of friends to Julio's and have never heard a complaint from any of them. If anyone loves cheese the way I do, try the Pollo Loco lunch or dinner and the Loco Pie is great to split with friends. We really enjoy going to Julio's and they offer a Great Happy Hour not just in their bar. When I think about I would have to say it is our Favorite Mexican Restaurant.
