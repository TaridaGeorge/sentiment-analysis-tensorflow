This is a great, honest, capable mechanic shop that I would recommend to anyone. The place is run very well, they care about their customers, and stand by their work. As others have said greg is the best service writer you could get. 
Also as others have mentioned if you have a subaru and cant afford the dealership this is the only place I would recommend taking it. In fact, in general when it comes to any newer or high end vehicle this is the only place I'd recommend. They also seem to be extra proficient in VW.
Overall, best shop you could go to for your money.
