Great hotel and even better services. Staff was incredibly nice and seemed genuinely concerned about us as guests. Many extras too, like free drinks (beer, wine, mixed), hot food in the evening, fresh popcorn in the lobby, as well as a nice indoor/ outdoor pool and hot tub. I would definitely recommend this hotel.
