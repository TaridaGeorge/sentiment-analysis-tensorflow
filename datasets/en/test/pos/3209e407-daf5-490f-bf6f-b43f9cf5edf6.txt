I've been coming to Christopher's (old location and now new) for about 10 years.....   I can't think of a better restaurant.   I can go on and on about how wonderful they are, but if you need a restaurant to go to with great atmosphere, friendly staff and awesome food, this is it.  - Don't go anywhere else!
