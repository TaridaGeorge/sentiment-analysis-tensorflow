I had the goat cheese and roasted garlic pizza and it was phenomenal! The creamy tang of the goat cheese paired well with the whole cloves of roasted garlic and perfect, airy yet substantial, crust. As for dessert, I had the tower of mousse and that was just straight-up ambrosia. Anyways, I enjoyed my experience and I highly recommend it!
