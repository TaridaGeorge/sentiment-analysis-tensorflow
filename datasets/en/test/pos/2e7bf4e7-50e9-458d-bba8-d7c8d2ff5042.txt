This spice store is amazing!  Three generations of my family swear by it for cooking spices and for many of our favorite family recipes you can only find the right spices at Penzey's.  They have so many kinds of cinnamon and paprika that you can't find anywhere else.  I love to receive their catalog each month and visit the store as they always have free recipes and they are delicious!  If you have felt uninspired by cooking, visit this store and discover a whole new world of flavor.  Also, their boxed gift sets of spices make fantastic gifts for the holidays.
