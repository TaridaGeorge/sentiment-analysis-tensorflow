FINALLY-TEXAS BRISKET HAS ARRIVED! If you transplanted Yankees don't like this, then don't move to Texas....for THIS food is what my home state of TEXAS is all about. Dave's sucks (who puts brisket on top of a slice of white bread?) What's that for; to soak up all the nasty tasting grease? All the other "BBQ" places I have ever tried in Phoenix and the surrounding areas can't hold a candle to Texas BBQ. Now I don't have to make brisket myself anymore. Nothing in this state compares to Rudy's. Grow a pair and live the good life! Thank you, Rudy's....it sure took you long enough to get here......
