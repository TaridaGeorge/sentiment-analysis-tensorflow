I'm not a pizza fan, and I will always be up for an order from Barros. That's how amazing it is.

First off, ordering on the phone is so simple.  Usually I'm already in the system and I don't need to give them all the crazy address and direction information that I hate repeating every time I call somewhere.

Secondly, their delivery is speedy gonzales quick. I don't know how they do it, but it arrives well before I think it will and is piping hot and fresh.

Third, the prices are reasonable and they aren't afraid to give me food without tomatoes. The dough is fantastic, and it's easily become one of the favorite delivery spots for the crew in my hood!
