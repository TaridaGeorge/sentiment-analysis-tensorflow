Had to update my previous review.  Forgot to mention that the prices at the restaurants are in line with off-airport prices.  Maybe not exactly the same, but way cheaper than most airports.  For instance, the Wendy's breakfast meal I just got was $3.99 for OJ, Hash Browns, and Bacon Egg Bicsuit.  In other airports that would be 25% more expensive for sure.  I heard from someone that worked here a while ago that the airport has an agreement with the vendors that they have to charge reasonable rates for all food and drink here.
