I love Tasty Thai! Moved my boyfriend to Tempe in January and at the end of a very long moving day, and famished, we called Tasty Thai to pick up. We've been doing the same ever since! I like the standards: tofu green curry, pad thai. Boyfriend is a big fan of their tom kha soup, masaman curry, and pad prik king. 

We've tried other thai in Tempe and this is still my favorite. Thai Elephant gave me chicken in my vegetarian curry and food poisoning for both of us, all in one night. I like Thai Basil, but Tasty Thai is more consistent and the owners are really friendly. 

The other reason I am motivated to write this review is that TT is always so empty, which breaks my heart since it is so... tasty! Help support a great local business, eat at Tasty Thai.
