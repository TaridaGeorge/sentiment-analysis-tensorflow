I have a dairy allergy and a weakness for Ice Cream. I tried one of Nami's tSoynami's ($4.50 for a lot) which is sort of like a DQ Blizzard only made with what tastes like Homemade Ice Cream only this has Soy rather than Cow milk. I went with the Fluffernutterin (organic peanut butter, banana, ricemellow fluff and toasted marshmallow flavor). I can honestly say this was better than a DQ Blizzard. They also have yummy cupcakes and cookies and other treats, coffee & Sunday Brunch. I also like their restaurant Green located next door and I am far from a Vegetarian but good is good.
