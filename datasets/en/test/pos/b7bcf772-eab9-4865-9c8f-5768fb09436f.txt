Tasty, creamy, nutty, and smooth were the words my mom used to describe the Maple Pecan ice cream

Creamy, salty, sweet and smooth was how my husband described the Salted Butter Caramel ice cream.

Aaaaaaahhhhhh-mazing is how I would describe the basil lime sorbet.  Fresh, light, sweet, and just the right amount of sugary goodness.  I asked the woman behind the counter for the igredients and she said basil, lime, ice and sugar.  I ate it on one of the tiny little spoons and savored every little bite. 

I know that I will be back during my next visit to AZ to visit mom b/c I still can't stop thinking about that darn sorbet.  Kudos to you Sweet Republic.  Kudos on creating a solid, additive and preservative free - "whole foods" approach to sweet desserts!  YUM!
