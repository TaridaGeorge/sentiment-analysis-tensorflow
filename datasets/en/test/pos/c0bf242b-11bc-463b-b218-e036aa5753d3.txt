So we have two weeks in Phoenix, and we came with a list of old favorite places, and 5th Ave Cafe was on the list!

I always order the Chorizo Cowboy Skillet with corn tortillas and add a side of bacon.  This is probably not good for me.  My wife orders the Mediterranean Omelet with a side of fruit. This is probably better for her.  

In either case, we consistently enjoy our breakfasts here.  In fact, out of all the breakfast places in Phoenix, this is the one that we both enjoy every time.

The service this morning was quick, and in spite of a huge rush, the servers were kind of awesome.
