I really like Carsten Salon, Ally in particular.  The desk staff have improved and are not any more snooty than at any other high-end salon.  It seems to go with the territory in Phoenix/Scottsdale.  I had tried severl other salons over the last few years trying to save money (Great Recession) but really think Carsten is the best salon in Phoenix.

Really my loyalty is to Ally, she always gives me a perfect cut.  She is super nice and I've missed her.  If Ally left I would probably leave too, but for now I'm glad to be back.
