I am a big sandwich fan!!! These are delish! The sesame bread is the best. It has a light crust with the perfect give and soft interior. Parking is horrible, but it's worth it to find someplace to park. My fianc√© LOVED the roast beef, and he is not a sandwich person.

The decor is cute, and the service is super friendly. If you love sandwiches, try it. It's better than any chain I have tasted.
