Before I had visited this restaurant, ramen to me was the small packages at the grocery store which aren't that great. But at Republic Ramen, I had an opportunity to try something more authentic than those cheap packages at the store. The service was good, and the employee who helped us was very fluent in ramen knowledge. Afterwards, other employees were really nice in providing a take-home container. 

Also, the atmosphere is nice and modern in style. I would recommend this place to anybody who would like to try restaurant-style ramen.
