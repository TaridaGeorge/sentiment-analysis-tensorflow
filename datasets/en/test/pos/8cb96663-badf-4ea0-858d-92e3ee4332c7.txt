This place is absolutely fabulous, I recommend it to anyone that needs shoes fixed or cleaned.

Ive taken several pairs of heels, dance shoes, boots...even my favorite purse here. Theyve performed every kind of repair for me whether it was fixing a mangled zipper, recoloring my leather heels, resoling a pair of boots, fixing heels, and even completely redoing the insides of a couple pairs.

They are always nice and fast.

Affordable and worth every penny. So glad I stumbled across them, and by accident no less!
