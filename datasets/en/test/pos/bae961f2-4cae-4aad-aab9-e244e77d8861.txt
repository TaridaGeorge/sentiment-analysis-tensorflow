While looking up a menu for a different restaurant, we realized it was Arizona Restaurant week.
We skimmed through the list of other places and called for a reservation.
we were told it wasn't necessary for a Saturday night, that it was about a 15 min wait, so off we went! We didn't even wait..we were seated immediately. The restaurant was pretty full.
It was LOVELY. Such a pretty restaurant. Nice, friendly service and a beautiful patio.
We sat outdoors and it was great. A nice selection of music was playing and it was just a great vibe. Yes it was loud, but in a fun way.
We ate off the AZ restaurant week menu-salad, short ribs and red velvet cake. All AMAZING!!
The short ribs were super tender and the dessert was perfect.
Pretty restrooms too :)
Can't wait to go back!
