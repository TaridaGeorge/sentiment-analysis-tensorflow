I've been going to VK Elle nails on Camelback since I moved here 3 years ago. I've tried a few other salons along the way but keep going back. Yes, its likely that you'll wait a few minutes for your service due to the large following they have but I can assure you that the wait is worth it. And once in the chair, you'll never feel rushed. It's the only salon I know where you'll get a 15-20 minute foot and leg massage. Try going at the beginning of the week to get in faster. Enjoy!
