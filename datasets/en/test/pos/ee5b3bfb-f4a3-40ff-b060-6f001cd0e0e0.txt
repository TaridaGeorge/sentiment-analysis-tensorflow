A consistently great place, and one of the few I've found that actually does the deep fried rolls correctly. The staff are excellent and give superb service, and the sushi chefs fun to be around and most skilled in their art. Just wish they stayed open later than 9pm on the weekend, but other than that small quibble I've always been pleased when I've been there.
