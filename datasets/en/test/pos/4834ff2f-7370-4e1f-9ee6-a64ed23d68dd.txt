This place is a haven for people who work or study at coffee shops. I don't feel comfortable hanging around talking with friends sometimes because the quiet, peaceful environment seems so delicate and so rare. So comfortable, great proximity to Kiwanis Park so you can go for a walk and talk with coffee when the weather permits.

Really good coffee, attached to a salon I adore, great prices for sizes and perfectly suited to a person's need to escape and be productive. I wouldn't give it 5-stars as a venue for hosting any noisy brunch get together but I appreciate Solo's splendor and place in this world. 

It is a beautiful coffee butterfly. Shhhhhh!
