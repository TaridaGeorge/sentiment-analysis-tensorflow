My MacBook Pro went crazy on me with the cursor becoming possessed and messing all kinds of things up. The Apple Store "genius" said it was a hard drive problem and it would have to be replaced. Stupid answer and wrong. The Best Buy "geek" said it was the touch pad and it would have to be replaced. Wrong again, but at least he disconnected it and I used just the mouse. FINALLY I found this iStore and immediately they showed me that the battery was bulging and pressing on the touchpad causing it to malfunction. Problem solved. Guess where I'm going for Mac help from now on.  These guys are the real geniuses!
