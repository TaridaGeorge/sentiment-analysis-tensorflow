Brought my Wife's Honda CRV here after getting a flat on a dirt road while camping up near The Rim. Asked how much the patch job would be and they said" Its no charge, just bring your car in when you need new tires." So, I did! We did some research and decided on Yokohamas, but the sales guys talked us in to the Pirelli's. They ran so smooth and are going strong after a good 25,000 miles. warranties are great here, excellent customer service, and all the sales people are friendly & courteous.
