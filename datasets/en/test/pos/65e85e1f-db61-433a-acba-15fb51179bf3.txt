This place is amazing! The restaurant was pretty packed but we got seated very quickly. 

We ordered the tuna tartare & guacamole...SO GOOD. The tortilla chips were very crunchy, fresh and almost the best part!

My friend and I split the Chelsea's hamburger and asked for it to be cut in half. They plated it on two different plates for us without us even asking, we thought that was really nice. The burger comes with fries which was seasoned with what tasted like sweet mesquite bbq flavoring...like what you found on kettle chips...sweet & salty = YUM. 

My absolute favoritest part of Chelsea's Kitchen was the free chocolate chip cookie sprinkled with sea salt that was offered as you walk out the door. I made sure to take the biggest cookie in the pile!
