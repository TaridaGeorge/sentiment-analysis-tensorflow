Chihuly exhibit = awesome.  

DBG itself = very cool.  Student ID gets you 1/2 off.  More like an art museum than a typical museum of the modern era - obviously not particularly interactive, but the few displays or other directly educational features are dated and not really useful.  Go to look, not so much to learn.  A beautiful facility, nonetheless, and certainly worth a visit if you enjoy looking at plants.
