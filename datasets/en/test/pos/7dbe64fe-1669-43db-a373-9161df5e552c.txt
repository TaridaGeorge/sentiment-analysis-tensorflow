I came in to replace my back 2 tires and my spare. Bad news and good news. My front tires could not be balanced because they had bubbles on them. I agreed that they were old and needed replacing. They would not do the work for me without replacing all 4 tires (safety/liability concerns.) The good news was: they worked out an arrangement to lay-away my front two tires, replace all 5 (with the spare) and allow me to drive off on the unpaid front tires. They trusted me to pay them at my convenience without collateral (or financing.) I really appreciated their trust and all parties benefited. I have my new tires and as of this posting, I have returned to pay a hundred dollars toward my balance.
