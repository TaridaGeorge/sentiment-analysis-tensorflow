I am Vietnamese and since living on my own I never found a restauraunt that reminded me of MOM. This place does, and the owner resembles my Mom too! lol
 I come here weekly with my BF and the owner & staff recognize us as soon as we walk in. Everyone here is so nice. Flavorful dishes, quick to seat & serve.  It's always a pleasure to come here...just wish we found it sooner!!
