Went here after seeing it on DDD. The waffle and bacon were amazing! Got there right before the rush (Sat around 8am) so we didn't have to wait. They don't have tables big enough for 4 (it's a smallllll place) so we sat at the counter. Everyone's food was great. ONLY problem was for some reason, the waitress refused to give my husband water. I say "refused" because it turned into a joke but he asked her like 4x and still didn't get water.
