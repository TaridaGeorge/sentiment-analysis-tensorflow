I had the "12 Gauge Chicken" sandwich and I am STILL talking about how good it was a day later! The guacomole & jalepenos + cheese, SO good. I ate the other half for dinner and it tasted even better which I didn't think was possible! Everything I've had there is decent food and I'm excited to keep trying it out. My friends all loved their sandwiches as well. I've had Zipps a million times and love their food as well but the Lodge just became my new fav spot for my "cheat eating" days :-)
