Best sushi in West Valley. Happy hour is simply amazing and runs M-Sat from 4p-6p and 8p-10p. Owner is very accommodating and they have a great selection of rolls. The Japanese Dynamite salad is excellent. Been going for a year now and highly recommend it. Ask for the unlisted Winter Roll (Scott Roll).
