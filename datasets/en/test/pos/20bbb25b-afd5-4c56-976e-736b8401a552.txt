I was taking grounders and this field is as nice as Pac Bell (oops I mean SBC. oops I mean AT&T).  There's a specially designed infield lip so there's no noticable transition between grass / dirt.

The problem isn't the groundcrew but the AZ sun for pop ups.  I almost dropped two fly balls balls.  Now when someone basket catches a pop-up, they call say, "oh he didn't have a good beat on the ball, he cha-chianged it".

Players hang out across the street at Dave's BBQ, at DC Village and the brewery in Fashion Square
