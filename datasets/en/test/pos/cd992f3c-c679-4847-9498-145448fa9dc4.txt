What a fun, hidden Phoenix gem! 

This isn't your fancy Scottsdale resort by any means, but we had a great girls night here using a Groupon - $49 for the night.

The restaurant - Gallo Blanco - was great, the rooms, pool and lobby were all clean and really uniquely decorated.

The staff was the BEST, and the snacks after 10pm were the perfect added touch of service.

Walking distance to a lot of fun restaurants and bars as well. We'll definitely be back!
