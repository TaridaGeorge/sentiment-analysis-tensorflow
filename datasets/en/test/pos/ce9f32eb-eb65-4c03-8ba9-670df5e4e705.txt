I absolutely love this place and frequent here often.  Everything I have ate there has been good even though now most of the time I just fill up on the pretzels!  Happy hour is a lot of fun here and the staff isn't too bad to look at either.  I do agree that this is more of a drinks/appetizers kind fo place rather than a common dinner spot.  Really good drinks,  great atmosphere, and really friendly staff.
