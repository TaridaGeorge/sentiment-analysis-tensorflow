My wife and I had our "second" first date here, so I admit I'm kind of biased. But this is the type of place I love, smaller, mom and pop type of place. Very friendly people. Never had a bad meal there, always have a special and very open to substitutions or special orders.

Full bar, take out, and breakfast!
