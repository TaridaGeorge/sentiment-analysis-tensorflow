Good god damn is this some awesome chow.

Whenever we had some lame corporate event, there would almost always be Honey Bear's before in huge trays.  It was usually the only good thing that would happen.

They do everything good here.  By way way waaaay far the best BBQ in a 200 mile radius of Phoenix at least.
