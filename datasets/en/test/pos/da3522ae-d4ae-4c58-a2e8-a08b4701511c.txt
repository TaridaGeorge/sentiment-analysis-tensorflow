Just a warning, the chippers are totally addicting! B&W chippers and Oatmeal Chocolate Chip, tiny little cookies that disappear very quickly when I bring a box to the office! Other excellent choices - 
-SW Chicken Caesar Salad (ask for a little extra dressing, it's awesome and they never put enough on)
-Walnut Chicken Salad sandwich
-Fire-roasted Tomato Soup with tortilla strips and sour cream

Paradise bakery also has some of the best iced tea in Phoenix!
