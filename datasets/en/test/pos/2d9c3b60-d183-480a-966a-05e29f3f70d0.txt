Love place! The food was great (both my dish and what my friend got) and very healthy. This restaurant is particularly great for anyone who is vegetarian, vegan, gluten free or all of the above. The teas and deserts are great, too... which is a real treat for those of us who are GFCF. The restaurant was a little hard to find- it's nestled in the back of the plaza somewhat off the beaten path, but it's worth finding. If you're into the natural health/ herb scene there is plenty to purchase- they have a wide variety of teas and herbs in their store... but off hand they looked a little on the pricey-er side. Overall a wonderful experience- I will definitely be back!!
