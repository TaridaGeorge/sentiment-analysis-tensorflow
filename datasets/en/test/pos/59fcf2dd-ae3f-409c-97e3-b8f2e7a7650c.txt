Delicious! great service! We had a business lunch there, just 4 of us but it was a treat. The Kingdom Kabab Was very good, I had the Gyro very tasty. yes it was $6.99 a meal but it's not Mc D's It's fresh all made there, Clean restroom and clean kitchen, worth a little more for a special lunch. with exceptional service.
