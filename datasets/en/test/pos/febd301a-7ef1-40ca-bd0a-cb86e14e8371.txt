Nolan makes it all happen here.  Knowledgeable, excellent service, great rates.  One of several sites of a small local business.  Two of my business laptops repaired/cleaned of minor internal parasites/demystified.  Home laptop restored,  Nolan recovering 22 Gigs of potentially lost data including photos, music, and documents.  I chose to purchase a hard disk Nolan offered to remove from the bill when he found, after further analysis, the original disk I sent worked as advertised.  Now I've got a mirror disk for backups.
