Best Italian restaurant in the valley, as far as I'm concerned. Totally unassuming from the outside since it's in a strip center on 64th St. & Greenway (in the same center as Fry's and McDonalds). But this family run restaurant that has been here for years. Same friendly staff every time...especially love being in the bar area. A little on the pricey side, but definitely worth it. Must try the ravioli (either as an appetizer or main dish) and chicken Marsala with fettuccine Alfredo on the side. All entrees come with soup or salad.
