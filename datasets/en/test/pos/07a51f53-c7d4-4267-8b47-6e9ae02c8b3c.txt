The all time BEST PALO Chicken sandwich I've ever had! And they breakfast burrito's are the all time ultimate. I get bacon, eggs, cheese, and add potatoes. with a large salsa and sour cream. I love this place and certainly wish it was closer to home in Glendale, but so happy I found it since I work in Scottsdale. Keep up the good work.
