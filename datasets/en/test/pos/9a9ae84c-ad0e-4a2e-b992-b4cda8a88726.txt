I work just around the corner from this location and last night I had to give it a try.  I've only had gelato one other time so to me this was a new experience.  I loved it.  The staff was wonderful and gave us a brief history of how the gelato is made.  I had a taste of my husband chocolate oreo and it was so YUMMY!  I decided on their tropical surprise and it was Yummy too.  They make their Gelato daily so you know it's fresh.   I'm going back as often as I can.
