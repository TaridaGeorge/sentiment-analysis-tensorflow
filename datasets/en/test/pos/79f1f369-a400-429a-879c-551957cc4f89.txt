After traveling to 40 different states, and eating in countless Turkish, Greek, Mid Eastern and Mediterranean restaurants, only one place had the best baklava in the US. And none came even close. It was Med Fresh Grill. Baklava was just amazing. To die for. Crispy on the top moist and sweet at the bottom with generous portions of pistachio in the middle.

Even only for the baklava they deserve to be the best. 

The Kebabs are excellent as well, get the mixed kebab plate. Amazing garlic sauce, amazing meat.

I just loved this place, and wished to live in Phoenix just to eat baklava anytime I want from Med Fresh Grill.
