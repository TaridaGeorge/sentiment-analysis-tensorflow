I love Bud's. For years they worked on my old '60 Galaxie when most other shops in town either didn't want to or didn't know how to do the work. These guys are real mechanics, not just a collection of 20 yr olds who only know how to plug your car into a computer to diagnose the problem. And most importantly, they don't run up the bill for extra time or unnecessary parts. My buddy just received a quote for a job of $175 from bud's that another shop wanted to charge $800 for! 

Bottom line: to me, auto shops are all about finding someone fair you can trust. For me, it's these guys.
