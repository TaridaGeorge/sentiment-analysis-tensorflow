LOVVVVVED this place! My table ordered the Bolognese Ragu and Macaroni & Cheese and loved it. Topped it off with the Tiramisu. The owner is great and walks around and talks with everyone. Our server was really nice and helpful. The place is small and they don't take reservations but there is a sports bar 30 sec away where we waited until the owner called us and said he had a table. We were told it'd be a 45-60 min wait but it was more like 10 min. Can't wait to go back!
