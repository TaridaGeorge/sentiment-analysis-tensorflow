What can I possibly say? 
Everything they serve there is wonderful. 
The selection in their little grocery section is inspirational. Even when I go with a list, I end up with a dozen things I didn't know I needed at home for my pantry. 
They have amazing prosciutto. 
If you are a foodie, this is one fun place.
