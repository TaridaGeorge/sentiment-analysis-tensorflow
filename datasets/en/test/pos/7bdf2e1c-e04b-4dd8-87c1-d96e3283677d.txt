This little place showed up on yelp and the wife and I just decided to give it a shot. When we entered we were greeted by two very nice men then I noticed the soda pop. Everything you have ever wanted in a soda pop selection. Everything from real sugar Pepsi to saranac Shirley temple. I decided to have the biggest burger I could and what a choice. I decided the newyork burger was what I craved. Burger on a fresh bun with tons of thin sliced cole slaw and amazing pastrami. The hot dog was the best my wife Ashley has had. Top it all off with chili cheese fries. No bean chili the way I like it. Fresh cut fries and it was cheesy heaven. The best part, 2 full people, 2 great sodas.....$12. Love it.
