I loved this store. One of the reasons I came to arizona and was totally worth it. Only come here if you are good at hunting for clothes and know a good bargin when you see it. I got a pair of new uggs and lots of cute shirts and dress and a calvin sport jacket for my dad for about $100. Make sure you check everything before you buy it for stains.
