Cheba Hut could be a 3.5-star review on a few of the times I've gone, but it's never been terrible by any means. My favorite is the Kush (BLT). Garlic is the best bun to get (again, in my opinion). I can't explain it, but everything seems even across the bread and toasted just right. This is one of the more unique dining options on the West side, and the fact that's it's great food is an added benefit.


It's typically faster to call in an order because the wait can be ridiculous at times. They also offer delivery which I have not tried yet.  I hope they open some more locations along the I-17 or even downtown and uptown. I really can't fathom going back to Subway with Cheba and Silvermine around.
