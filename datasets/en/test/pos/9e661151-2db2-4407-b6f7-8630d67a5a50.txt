I think it's been summed up pretty thoroughly by others, so I'll just list a few of my favorite things.

Bare wood ceiling
Beautiful views of the mountains
No bad seat in the place
Fire pit with little swirlies drawn in the dark sand
Salt and fresh cracked black pepper in a cute yin-yang bowl
Great food and even better service
FREE BIRF-DAY DESSERT in the form of molten chocolate...... (they even wrote 'happy birthday' in chocolate on the plate.  Sweet!)

The only thing I could pick at is...for such a beautiful and chic place to go, did they really have to put fake horsetail in the vases at each table?  Come on now, couldn't you splurge on the real stuff?

Best lunch item:  Orecchiette pasta with shrimp, chicken, and sausage in a morrocan spice cream sauce.
