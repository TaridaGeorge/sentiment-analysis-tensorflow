A lot of people love Sapporo for its happy hour - which I have heard is great. Although I live in and love Scottsdale, sometimes you can find some of the more dolled up, trying a little too hard crowd here. Although there are just as many normal, fun people as well. ;) I love Sapporo for the restaurant' s teppan - the chefs are fun and the food is amazing. Sapporo serves the BEST filet i have ever, ever had. It melts in your mouth and is "to die for". You have to try Sapporo - the atmosphere is great.
