This place was outrageously delicious, great service and good atmosphere.  It's the kind of place I would want to be a regular at but still have not found in San Francisco.  The food and presentation was nothing short of upscale at sweet prices.  The waiter was professional, he was at our table when we wanted something and not hanging around when we didn't.  It was candle-lit and romantic but had a relaxed atmosphere.  

In fact, this is my favorite restaurant I have ever been to in my life.
