The wife and I were in town for the NYG v AZ game in October and were in the mood for pizza. This Glendale pizzeria is no joke. Brick oven pizza at its finest.  The char on the pizza crust was done to perfection. The wifey had Mediterranean pizza with pesto and mozzarella (freshly made) and it was divine. I went 6 rounds with the Italian Stallion which has Schreiners Sausage, Pepperoni, Prosciutto di Parma and was it was amazing.  It sounds like it is a heavy pizza gut bomb, but this pizza was not since all the meats were thinly sliced but generously portioned.  Wash your pizza down with a refreshing Italian Birra and you are in heaven.
