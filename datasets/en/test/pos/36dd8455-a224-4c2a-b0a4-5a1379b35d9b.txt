Green Planet Postal is FABulous.  I love that they will help wrap - and wrap carefully! - make sure package contents are protected and secure, box and tape everything up, and help select the best postal or other rate.  They always ask if you need additional insurance on packages, and if you just walk in with something intended for USPS, they don't complain that you're not using their services.  PLUS their new space at McClintock and Southern is full of good energy.  Greg and Pascha are professional and friendly, too.  This is a great addition to our neighborhood business services!
