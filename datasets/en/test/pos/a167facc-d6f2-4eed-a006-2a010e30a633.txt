We stumbled upon Majerle's and I have to say, we were pleasantly surprised. Walking in I wasn't sure if the food would be good, looks like a fun place to have a drink and watch the game, but didn't seem like a place this picky eater would like. I have to say the food was fabulous, the BBQ chicken sandwich was amazing and the bun was soft and very tasty. Oh and the fries were shoestring and crispy - YUMMY. We'll be back! Thank you.
