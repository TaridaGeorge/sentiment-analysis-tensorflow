LOVE, LOVE this store!! A definite need in the market place.  It is a gluten free heaven, to know you can walk in and eat anything in there!  The owner is so knowledgeable and helpful.  I've learned things from him about Celiac, what products taste good, and money saving tips.  Also, about what is going on in the gluten free world, as far as where to get pizza, and who keeps adding GF menus to their restaurants. A must visit!
