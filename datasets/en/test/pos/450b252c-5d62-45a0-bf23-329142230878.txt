Two words: short ribs.  You haven't lived until you've had them here.  The substantial portion will leave you with plenty to take home for left overs too!  

Loved the atmosphere of this place, great service, and NO VALET which is a small miracle in Phoenix these days.  I'm more than capable of parking my own car and glad that Beckett's table let's me do just that.

It's the little things... :)
