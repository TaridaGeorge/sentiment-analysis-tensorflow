I've gone back a few times since my last review. Every single experience has been fantastic! The burgers are pretty good, BUT do yourself a favor and get the pork tenderloin OMFG!!! Sooooo freaken amazing! 

Also their onion rings are pretty much perfect! 

And the fried cheese curd...just get it! I was a little creeped out eating something called cheese curd, but holy deliciousness!
