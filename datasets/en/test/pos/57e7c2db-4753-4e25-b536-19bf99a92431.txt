Called for reservations, was notified they do not have reservations, just have call ahead up to one hour ahead.  Thought it would be an issue but there was nothing to it!!! The music was said to be loud but I didn't notice it being too loud at all.  There is line dancing by the employees in the middle of the restaurant too.  The best service I have received in a very long time.  Definitely worth my while being the last place I was going to eat before going back overseas to finish my tour of duty.  The meL was just the best ever. The ribs are all that they say they are. I look forward to coming back in a year when I get back to the states.
