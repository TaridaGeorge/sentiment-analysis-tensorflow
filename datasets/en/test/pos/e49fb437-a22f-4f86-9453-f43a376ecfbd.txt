Rafael, who owns the place, is a really  sincere, excellent barber with over 15 years experience, and it's the only real Barbershop I could find open on a Sunday :)

Baseline Barbershop doesn't look like much from the outside...it's next to an auto repair place, it has a few empty chairs inside, and it has advertisements in the window for buying and selling gold....I hesitantly went in on a Sunday afternoon :)

I'm pretty picky about barbers because I went to a really good one in Boston for a year, and I've tried to find a good barber ever since.  I was really surprised that I got one of the best haircuts I've gotten in a long time.  Great barber.  The cut was quick but done with care.  

A haircut is just $10.  

Come support this barbershop because it's definitely one of the best around here!
