This is the place to go if you want a first-class dining experience from start to finish. Phoenix seems to have a dearth of quality Italian restaurants. This is the only one in the Valley I can think of that gets 5 stars. 

Service: outstanding. Our waiter was a consummate professional, i.e., not just a "friendly guy" but a gentleman who goes out of his way to make sure you know this is a top-notch restaurant. Without being snobby, of course. 

Atmosphere: up-scale Italian-American. 

Food: outstanding. The "Zuppa di Funghi", a mushroom soup, was out of this world. In perusing their website just now I'm surprised by the lower price of the main entrees, relative to their quality. It's still a bit pricey so I don't come here often. But it's perfect for special occasions and to satisfy an Italian craving.
