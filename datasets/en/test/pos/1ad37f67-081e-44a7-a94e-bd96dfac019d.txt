Nearly every spice you can imagine and you can purchase them in all different quantities. Small jars, large jars, small bags and large bags to refill your jars. Ada G. stole my thunder because I got her hooked on my three favorites. You have to try the Vietnamese cinnamon, the chipotle chile powder and the French vinaigrette mix. Penzey's is great too because every spice in the store is displayed (for lack of a better word) in glass jars so you can smell them before you buy them. Makes a huge difference when deciding between six different cinnamon's.
