I have never had a great "gimmick"  (and I use that word in the complimentary form) come together with service, atmosphere, and amazing tastes and smells so well. I can only highly  recommend the wine pairing. Our wine steward knows Josh's cooking as well as he knows his wines, his pours where bang on. 
Thanks Guys
