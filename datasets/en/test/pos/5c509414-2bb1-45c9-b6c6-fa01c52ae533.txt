If not THE, then one of the best chicken shwarma dishes I've had. Just the right degree of succulent and tender. And the garlic, yogurt sauce that comes with it is almost like crack. The jasmine rice was perfect in its softness and saltiness. Taboule was good and the pita was mmm..mmmm...good. Hummus was awesome too. Definitely going back to work my way down the menu. My friend who recommended it said she'd never had any bad item there. I totally believe her.
