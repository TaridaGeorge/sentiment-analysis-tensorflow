I had mixed feelings being at SRAH. I was stressed because my cat is not doing well, but I was also very happy to see all the cute cats there. The staff and Dr. Gullinson are the best. The doctor called me at home and took her time explaining everything that was wrong with my cat. I hate hospitals and so does my kit, but we like and trust the staff at SRAH.
