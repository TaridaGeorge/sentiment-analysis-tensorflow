I'm very happy that I called Enterprise Pools.  They have friendly service and worked with my schedule when I asked for an estimate.  Mike was knowledgeable and quickly determined what the problem was and even told me how I could fix it.  He offered service at a reasonable price and never tried to sell me something for the sake of sales.  It was definitely a relief to find an honest business man after dealing with sub par service from Leslie's for such a long time!
