HAPPY ANNIVERSARY!  you guys know how to throw a party!!  Everything was perfect: the setting, the patio, amazing & attentive servers, speedy bartenders, absolutly fantastic food!  (cept i am not sure why everyone says those pop-overs are to die over?  they are just yorkshire pudding things - sheesh!).  

Steak was YUM!  creamy potaotes (could have eaten a bowl full) were amazing.

and you had (1 of) my favorites cabs!  (ZD - Mmmmmm).

Talk about a perfect evening with a gorgeous setting - thank you!
