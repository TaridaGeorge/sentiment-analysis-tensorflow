Perfectly executed comfort food. 

The "fork tender" short ribs lived up to their name, and I'm craving them as I write this. Mac 'n cheese was given a tangy, mustard seed Welsh rarebit twist, and I loved it. The veggie chop salad had a ton of variety and flavor. Chocolate bacon s'mores were so good, the table next to us ordered round after round of it.

Service was impeccable. Friendly, fast, and super-knowledgeable, and our server made us feel so welcome. 

Atmosphere is upscale casual, but not remotely pretentious. Very lively and friendly, with a diverse crowd.  

The wine list was exceptional, but the beer options were disappointing. 

Do call ahead to make reservations; We called a half hour before we wanted to arrive and were seated immediately, while walk-ins waited for forty-five minutes.
