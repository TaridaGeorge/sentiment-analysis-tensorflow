I started going through the drive through back when it was Daily Rush and got to know the owners at that time.  I loved giving the local guy business.

When the new guys took over I was bummed to have to build a relationship all over again.  But I have to tell you they are kicking butt!!  

The remodel is fabulous, the extension of the menu is great and they know what I want when I pull up.  Always nice to have someone know your drink :-)

I can't wait to try the dirty Chai!

Thanks so much for giving us this great drive thru in South Scottsdale!!
