I'm not sure yet if digestif is great, but it is seriously good.  From start to finish we were pleasantly suprised and the waiter did a great job making suggestions starting with cocktails.  I can't remeber the exact name, but the Nob Hill cocktail was a winner with my date.  She flipped for it and I was wise enough to write down its ingredients.
The house salad was good, the entrees- especially the scallops were fantastic and the dessert (choclate brownie something) was a lump of gooey choco deliciousness.

Take a date there, apologize to your wife there, impress your snobby foodie friend there- just go.
