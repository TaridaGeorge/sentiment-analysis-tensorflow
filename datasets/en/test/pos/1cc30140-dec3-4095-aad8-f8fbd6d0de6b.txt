I was in the area for a long weekend and was looking for a sports bar to watch the world series. This place is unbelievable. Very family friendly (was there with my young kids). Comfortable seating, spacious, great food! Did I say great food? It was really amazing bar food. Great wings, burgers and nachos. Very good value for money. Service was excellent. Place is clean. Staff friendly.  TVs everywhere, large ones, HD. This place was the best sports bar I have been to in a very long time. Hard to think how it could be any better. Perhaps if they handed out free $!00 bills, but let's not get carried away. Did I say that I had a good experience here?
