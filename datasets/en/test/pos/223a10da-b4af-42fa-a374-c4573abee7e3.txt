The Raptor course at Grayhawk is a remarkable golf course.  The course includes spectacularly beautiful golf holes, and challenging, technical layouts.  The course is fair and playable, while still being quite challenging.  It is a true pleasure to play, and it is a gem, especially as a public course.  The Fazio design includes dramatic bunkering, and a brilliant intertwining of desert and grass.  I highly recommend the Raptor course to anyone with deep pockets.  The course is fabulous, but the price of $225 for a weekend round during "the season".  If you've got the cash you are in for a real treat.
