Went for breakfast Saturday morning with some friends who were in town for our 20 year HS reunion. I had not been to this location yet, only the other two. I was not disappointed. I really don't think they know how to do a bad meal at this restaurant. I had a spinach mushroom omlette, and it was perfect. Service was attentive and fast as well, even with 6 of us. But then again we were all chatting and catching up, so it didn't matter all that much. :-) It also wasn't very busy when we were there at 8am.  Good morning and GREAT food.
