My fiancee and I love this place.  We go here quite often on the weekends. 

The crepes are delicious, and they have several sweet, savory and breakfast crepes to choose from.

The coffee is okay, usually pretty strong.

The family that owns the place is really cool and they and like to joke around.

Great place
