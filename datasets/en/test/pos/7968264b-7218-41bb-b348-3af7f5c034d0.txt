I always make the mistake of bringing only one bag in with me, and then I end up buying 3 bags worth of groceries!! I could just walk up and down the aisles, filling my cart with every other thing I see. They have so many unique products. Cookie butter, anyone? The prices are terrific, although the meat is a little pricey. But everything else is priced great! I saw this documentary called "Dive" about TJ's, and I hope it isn't true, or at least this location doesn't do what the documentary portrays. I'll leave it at that.
