I have been bringing my kids to pete and macs for a few years. I have boarded them there in there suites {which are spacious and clean with a  flat screen tv} They were taken care of  by Robin and Jo who did a fantastic job. I also use there grooming services with Marchelle who is the best groomer that I have ever used. She is sweet and caring and takes great care with both of my kids. After two miserable experiences with other groomers who were ill trained and should never be allowed near any animals, going to pete and macs was a breath of fresh air. I love the fact that I can watch my babies being groomed. Being a very picky pet parent I love pete and macs and never hesitate to use them.
