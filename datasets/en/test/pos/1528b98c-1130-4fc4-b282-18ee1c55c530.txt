How have I gone this long without reviewing the lodge? Sheesh! I get all fluttery inside when I think about the lodge. The Mac and Cheese is not something to play around with. It is a dish of fantastic, cheesy wonderfulness. Also, please note the veggie wrap. HOLY SMOKES. Its a heavenly combo of sauteed veggies, feta cheese, and some kind of lemon/herb/heaven sauce all wrapped up in a pita! Really? Really Aaron May?

The other aspects of the lodge I enjoy involve the friendly staff, and comfortable setting. It's decorated all rustic and cushy, and true to form there are antler-chandeliers. You will also find pool tables, darts, several TV's, jenga, bean bag games...they have plenty going on at the lodge to keep you and your friends entertained. Check it out...
