Jason's Deli is always solid. You have to try the French Onion Soup w/ their awesome salad bar. I also enjoy their "Wrapinis" and the Santa Fe Chicken Sandwich(SO GOOD!) Everything is FRESH! 

The staff at this particular Jason's Deli is always fast and friendly and the restaurant is very clean! 

Great, quick lunch spot!!
