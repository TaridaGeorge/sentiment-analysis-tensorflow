First, let me say, I was very afraid of what we'd find because of two reasons.  1 - It was Thanksgiving and we didn't have a reservation. 2 - We had been to another Mimi's in Scottsdale and it was horrible.  First, we walked up around 2 PM on Thanksgiving Day without reservations, but the manager found room for us to sit with two kids.  The turkey was probably my least favorite part of the meal.  The dark meat was good, but the breast tasted suspiciously like pre-packaged turkey.  Anyway, I had a couple of drinks also, and the bartenders were wonderful.  The staff were of the caliber of a much more expensive place.  All in all, I was very impressed.  We will be returning on a day that is not as hectic.
