My name is Greg i am a manager of an auto repair business in Santa Clara California. i was in a desperate situation when my local dealers could not find a part i needed and told me it was not available and was on national backorder until i talked to sam at the ford store in morgan hill ca, he gave me your number your friendly staff check the stock physically and overnighted it to me without fail. chuck in parts is a great guy as well as the gal in shipping i wish i remembered her name but nonetheless they both made my experience with robert horne ford a great one its people like that that make great dealerships successful, thank you
