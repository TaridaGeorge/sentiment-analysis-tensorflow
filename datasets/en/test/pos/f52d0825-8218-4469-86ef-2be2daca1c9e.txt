It does not get better than this.

I'm not one for hot dogs, so I always opt for the chicken dog. They have some crazy combinations that are absolutley fabulous. The pita bread they use for the bun puts it above the rest. It's different for sure, but so worth the money. It's filling for sure!

They feature a dog of the week sent in by customers which is pretty cool.

I never thought anything gourmet could be sold out of a truck, but Short Leash proved me wrong!
