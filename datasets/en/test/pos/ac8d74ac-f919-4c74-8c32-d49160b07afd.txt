THIS Little restaurant is my best friends favorite... and I don't blame him, this place is great!!! The food is oh so amazingly fresh and full of taste buds satisfying sensations to your mouth!!!

_ Carlos, the owner is fantastic!! :)  Small place, but great food and great service!! :) Give it a try if you haven't yet!! The service wait time was moderate, considering it's own and operated by the owner and a small kitchen staff, the wait time then is understandable!! 
 MY MOST FAVORITE THING FROM THIS PLACE IS the must try ENCOCADOS DE CAMARON, AND the also wonderful GUANABANA SHAKE!!! OH SOOO GREAT!!!
