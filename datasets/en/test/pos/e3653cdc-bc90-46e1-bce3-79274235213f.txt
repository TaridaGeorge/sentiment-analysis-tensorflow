Had the opportunity to take about 20 people here for dinner.  Service was outstanding.  We had one waitress with a helper but then when food and apps came there must have been 10 people getting it to us.  Food was great, everyone complimented, and the service which in  a large group is even more important was excellent.  Could not have ask for more -   Great Job server #71 !!
