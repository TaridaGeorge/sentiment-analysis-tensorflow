This place is like half movie theatre, half bizzaro museum. It's worth going to just for the weird statues and creepy wax figures that stare at you from every corner. 

The movies are only three bucks so you can't beat that. The theaters themselves are okay, nothing fancy for sure, and sometimes the sound quality isn't the best. But hey, it's three bucks.

I figure I'm paying $1.50 for the movie and a $1.50 for the entertainment of the statues.

I just wish Pollack would open up a museum of his whole collection. I hear he has a ton of stuff. I wanna see it!!!
