I recently moved back to Phx and visited the museum several times on free (with donation) Wednesday nights.  I really liked what I saw:  the Anne Bonfoy Taylor exhibit was stunning, all the great new contemporary pieces, the depth of their permanent collection, the Phillip Curtis paintings and the new Mexican modern paintings show.  I got a membership and plan to go often!  Also really like the restaurant and gift shop, and the museum is a must-do for out-of-town visitors.
