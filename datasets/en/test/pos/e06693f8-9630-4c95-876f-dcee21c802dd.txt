This is one of my favorite Targets in the area. I like the way it is setup, it's not *too* big but has a good selection, and is always pretty tidy. The biggest issue with cleanliness is people leaving their cups or drinks around on shelves randomly.

Generally it's not too busy, and even when it's been busy I've never really had to wait for a register which is absolutely unheard of at Target. That alone deserves 5 stars.

The employees working here are outgoing and extremely friendly.

Overall, this is a great Target, and the best I've found in the area thus far.
