I come to this Starbucks location 1 to 3 times a day. The staff are always cheerful and pleasant and if there's ever a problem with my order (which is very rare), they fix it promptly and with a smile. I love this place! By far they are the best Starbucks in the Phoenix area and I have mostly been to all of them. Keep up the great service guys.....you rock! :)
