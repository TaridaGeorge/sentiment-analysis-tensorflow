Ok so Im a resident here in anthem and me and my family go to this bbq place all the time! The family owned restauraunt is very cozy and smells amazing! Not to mention beer and football.

How could you get any better! 

It's great! the staff is so friendly and they genuinely care about your service not to mention very appreciative! We love this place!

The food is amazing and very well priced! Worth the drive wherever you are coming from.
