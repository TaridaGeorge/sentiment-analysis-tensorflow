The fare's are reasonable, and the van was neat and clean. I can't say enough about how courteous, an attentive they were, not to mention how great the conversation was while in route. They're on time and even called to remind me the day before I was using their service. I'm slightly disabled and unable to walk very far without considerable pain, they took that into consideration and helped me beyond delivering me to my destination. I really can't say enough good things about this service, but I know I'll always use them when traveling again.
