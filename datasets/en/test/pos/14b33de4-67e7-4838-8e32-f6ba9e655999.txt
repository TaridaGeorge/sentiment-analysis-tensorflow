I think I lived at this Starbucks for the last year that I lived in AZ. I love the outdoor patio and the chairs and couches inside are always comfy. I never got harrassed by the employees about hanging around for like 3 hours or chilling out in the front making lots of noise with friends. There usually isn't a line, because this isn't a busy Starbucks. There's also the random magazine stands right in front of the store which are handy if you feel like reading something, but forgot a book.  The parking lot kinda sucks, but there's like 10 other stores using the same lot. One of my favourite Starbucks.
