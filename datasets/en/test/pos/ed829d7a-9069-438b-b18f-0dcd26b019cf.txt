Hands down, some of the best hot dogs I've ever had.  

It always amazes me how awesome the grill master is there.  He gets your order well in advance so he can fire up the dogs with ample time to have it ready for you as you pay.  The selection of condiments is very diverse as well.  I always like to enjoy the delicious onion rings as well!

Really, you can't go wrong at Ted's.  The only thing that may seem to turn you away is the line can get long around lunchtime.  But, that line is very deceiving because they move along quickly.
