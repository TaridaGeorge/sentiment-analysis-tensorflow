Great neighbor spot and the food was delicious! The owner was very helpful and wanted to make sure everyone there was having a good experience. I ordered the Hana Dog. The owner recommended getting the mango sauce and I'm glad that he did. The portion was sized well and the ingredients all fresh... So no guilty bloated aftermath. I also sampled the coleslaw and vegetarian chili, both tasty! It was hard to believe there was zero meat in the chili at all. 
I will definitely go back to try the sliders and have a snow cone!
