I love this place, the service is second to none. The naan is always fresh and the saag is the best thing I have ever tasted. The lunch buffet is great cause they always have goat curry, saag, and chicken tikki masala. Then they have 2 random dishs. Best indian food I have ever had. and I have been to my fair share of Indian places around the valley.
