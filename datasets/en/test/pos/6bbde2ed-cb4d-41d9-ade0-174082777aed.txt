The coffee is so good it made me curse out loud. Hot dayum! I ordered the large carmelizer which was just the right sweetness with an edge.The large comes with 4 shots.  I dont know what's in this coffee but I became giddy with happiness half way through the cup. The menu is easy to read and the staff is helpful.

This coffee must have some kind of zing to it., because I drank a cup in the evening and when I got home I worked out for 45 minutes, and worked on some office work for 3 hours...all on a Saturday evening.   Does anyone know of any good night spots around here?  Woo hoo the night is young!
