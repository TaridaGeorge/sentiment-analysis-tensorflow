Best Sephora I've been to yet (San Diego, LA, Fashion Square). Girls are always super helpful and friendly. They never let me down with their recommendations. I tried new foundations out on my last trip and they even walked me outside to natural light with a mirror to make sure I liked it.  Store is nicely laid out and easy to navigate through.
