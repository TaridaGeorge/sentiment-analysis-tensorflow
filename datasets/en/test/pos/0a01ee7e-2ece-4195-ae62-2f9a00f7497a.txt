LOVE THIS PLACE! Great place to watch games with your friends or just hang out.. Lots of deals basically all the time. $4 for 32oz domestic drafts and $3.50 zipparitas on Wed. Favorite place to go to watch SF Giants games- best part is the Scottsdale Trolley goes straight there and its a short walk to the rest of the bars in Old Town. I had a buffalo chicken foccacia, wan't that great (companred to 4 peaks) but good for bar food. Personally I don't like the onion rings but the fries are good
