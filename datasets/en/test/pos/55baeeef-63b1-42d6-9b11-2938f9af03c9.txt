Bueno!

We had a very enjoyable experience at this restaurant. We didn't have a reservation but they had a high table available immediately for us which worked fine for us.

Bread and water were brought to the table promptly and a quick explanation of what specials were available that evening. Friendly welcoming staff is always a plus to me.

We had the kobe beef meatballs which tasted great but basically a meatball to me!

The manila clam linguine was very light tasting and you do get loads of clams. All in all, it was very easy to eat. If that's what you are after then you can't go wrong with this dish.

I had the veal which was also excellent. Complemented excellently with vegetables and mash. Yummy.

Thanks!
