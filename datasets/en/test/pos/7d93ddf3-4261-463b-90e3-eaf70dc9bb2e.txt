Good food on the cheap is awesome. Better yet when you can sit at the bar and watch the food being made.

No, Waffle House isn't exquisite fine dining. C'mon now.

I guess it's the fact that WH doesn't exist on the West Coast is what makes it taste SO good.

I love Waffle House. Its pretty much the only reason why I'd leave CA.
