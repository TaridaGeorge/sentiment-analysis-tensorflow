My faith in humanity and Cowboy Ciao are restored in one fell swoop. Marianne Belardi got back to me regarding my service issues and has made everything good in the world again.

I had recently moved within walking distance of the Ciao and was sad to think that the Cowboy had lost it's swagger. Thankfully, I can still confidently frequent the Ciao because the service is still there. One bad experience versus hundreds of great ones only means they are human.
