I truly enjoyed this great ambiance and the food was full of flavor. The service was over the top and that was what I expected when I we walked in the door. The staff was very friendly and attentive. If you are looking for a classy place to dine with that special someone or entertain clients this is the place. The only issue was when I tried to check in on Yelp it said I was to far away. LOL
