Convenient location off the 101 on Cave Creek.  It saved my ass today after being stuck in a half hour traffic jam.  Was about to run out of gas completely and I made it just in time and filled up with a solid 17.9 gallons. Priced the same as all the competitors in the area (at least today it was 6/11/11. Happy 98th birthday to my grandfather!).  There's also a McDonald's on the premises so that isn't a bad thing either.  

They have a special going on now, 2 Five Hour Energy drinks for $5.
