A friend of mine referred me to Dr. Zeman and I'm SO happy she did. I had this knee scoped back in 06 from another ortho doc in town and it was horrible. This experience is how it should be! I wished I would of known Dr. Zeman back then. I probably wouldn't be in this situation again if I had!  Dr. Zeman scoped my knee  Nov 2, 2011 and removed a 4 cm cyst and cleaned up the meniscus. I can't tell you how happy I am with not only Dr. Zeman but also his entire staff. I feel like I'm in really good hands and I know I am getting the best care possible. They actually really do care!
