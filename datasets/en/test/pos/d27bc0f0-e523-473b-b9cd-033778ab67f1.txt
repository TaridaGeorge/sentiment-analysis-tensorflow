While my mate was backing the golf cart out of the garage he did not notice the door had not fully opened. Hit bumped the door and dislodged two of the rollers. So I called Avondale Garage Doors. They asked if tomorrow will work for us. They then asked where we lived, after telling them he said our community gets priority service. They will do it now. Why we get such service I have no idea, but who am I to argue. They were here with in twenty three minutes and just left and the door is as it should be. Cool huh.
