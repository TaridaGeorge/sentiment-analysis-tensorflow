The Cornish Pasty is so full of awesome that it is really hard to describe it's awesome awesomeness. It's kind of hipstery so i can't say that i'm their target audience but whatever. I goes and eats where i please. I just throw a few butterfly sticker-tattoos on various parts of my body and blend right in.

I like places with a character and this place has it in spades.  The cooks/waiters/waitresses are friendly and the pastys are good eats! 
I must warn that they are more filling that you would think. 

Good beer good food! Ridiculously cheap (knock back a few Rogues for me) The dark lighting also makes your friends look sooo much better.

win win.  and win.
