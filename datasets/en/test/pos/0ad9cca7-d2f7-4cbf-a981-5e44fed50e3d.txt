Like a lot of people I grew up with Macayo and loved it.  But then I watched it slide downhill and swore I would never be back.

I ended up meeting friends there twice in the last month and I was impressed.  That sloppy, old tasting food and indifferent service was gone.  I had an enchilada sampler plate, and it came out so crisp and beautiful and tasted handmade  Our server was alert and pretty knowledgeable.

My first visit was reluctant, my second hopeful.  Well, they did it right again.  Macayos is back.  Any of you native Phoenicians who haven't been in for awhile, it's like you remember in the old days.  Good, affordable, comfort food, Mexican-style!!!!
