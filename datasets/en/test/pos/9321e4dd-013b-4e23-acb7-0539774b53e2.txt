Best Chinese food ever! I have never had North-Eastern Chinese food and am a convert. Don't expect your everyday Americanized Chinese food - expect to try something new and enjoy then experience. Don't skip the beef buns - and with the amazing prices, I recommend trying a bunch of different items. Everything is made in house - don't miss the handmade noodles. 

There is a bit of a language barrier but the owners are extremely nice and super patient. They checked on us frequently and treated us as if they were delighted that we came - and it was genuine. Great food and experience.
