In my last update, I stated that the Italian Beef didn't quite do it for me.  

I just had one today and it was completely awesome.  Totally soaked, and they gave me extra juice to boot.

I've also had a pizza puff and a slider.  The pizza puff was dead on...its all the greasiness and crispiness and gooiness that I remember from the Chi.  The slider was tasty, but don't confuse this with any White Castle offerings.  Both of these are cheap and worth tacking onto any order.

What can I say?  I love this place.
