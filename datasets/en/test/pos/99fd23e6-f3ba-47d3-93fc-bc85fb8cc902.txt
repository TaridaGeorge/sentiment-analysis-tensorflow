Make sure to sit at the chef's table. It's quite an experience! Here you sit at the bar facing the kitchen and the chef himself, Razz! They bring you small plates (priced at $10 a plate) until you tell them to stop. Both times we went, we stopped after 4 courses and then had the dessert (which was $20 for the shared plate and consisted of 3 "slices" of different desserts). I'd say the best part of the meals are the sauces - absolutely amazing! We made sure to have bread on hand to soak it all up. Each course is different from the next, and all of it is scrumptious! If you want a quicker meal, I'd say to get an earlier seating (6pm), as we were out in an hour. Last time, I believe we had an 8pm seating, and it was more crowded by then. Enjoy!
