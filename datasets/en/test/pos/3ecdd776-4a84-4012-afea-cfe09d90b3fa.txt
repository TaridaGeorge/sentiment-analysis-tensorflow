This is my place. So much so that I fear they will soon engrave my name on the outside patio bar. 

I love their happy hour, first of all. Incredible drink specials. $3 margaritas and half off all appetizers from 3-7 every day. I love this place.

There are four things you NEED to eat here before you die, in this order:

1. Bacon Won Tons - cream cheese won tons with bacon drizzled in maple chili sauce. In-credible.

2. Calamari - comes with a lemon aioli. Don't know what that is? It's a delicious mayonnaise-type sauce.

3. Queso dip - not your grandma's cheese whiz. Delicious white queso (no idea what kind, but obviously not from a can) with small slivers of a mild pepper in it. Delicious!

4. Southwest Chicken Egg Rolls - self-explanatory

This place is great and I don't usually say that about franchise/chain outfits.
