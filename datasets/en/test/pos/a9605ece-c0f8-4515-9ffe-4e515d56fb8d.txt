My lovely lady introduced me to this spot on our First official Date. 
I love it. It's intimate, cozy and serves good, solid beer. 

All of the times I've been, the servers have been courteous, warm and knowledgeable. They've explained in detail their beer specials, where it's brewed, what style it is, etc. 
The sitting areas make it easy to get comfort and get lost in conversation. The place is fairly quiet for such a small place. 
The prices are fair  and they offer a small, yet satisfying bar menu. 

I look forward to spending more nights at the Roos (as I call it) with my girl. It made for a great first date.
