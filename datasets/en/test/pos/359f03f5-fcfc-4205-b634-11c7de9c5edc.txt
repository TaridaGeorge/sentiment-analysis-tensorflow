I love this place. Great drinks and delicious food. The service... well, I've only had one bad server experience, so I hope it isn't a regular thing. 
I would recommend the mac and cheese or the Cowboy Burger. Best burger I've ever had. You'll love the modern atmosphere and cute outdoor dining area, too.
