I can't recall the last time I tasted a bagel this good. . .

PROS: service was prompt, and just ever so slightly abrupt, but in a manner that was in no way offensive--their message is efficiency and they are damn good at it. Two types of iced tea were much appreciated. The bagel? Slightly crunchy on the outside and fresh and chewy (in a good way) on the inside. Perfectly toasted. Wonderful flavor!

CONS: only one--they don't have a store near my home

Why can't we get bagels like this on the Central Coast of CA? 

Cheers!
