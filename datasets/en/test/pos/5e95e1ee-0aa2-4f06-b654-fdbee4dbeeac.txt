I have to say that I love this place! We have been going here for years for so many different occasions and I think thats why I love it so much. It is great for special days, like anniversaries or birthdays and my favorite time, Sunday night at the bar. 

My favorite things to eat are: The mussels, the pizza, Mr. Fish of the moment, the chocolate cake, the meatballs, and those little apple bites he won on Iron Chef. 

We love Jim and Harry and Patrick too! The people working there have been there for years and its always nice to see the familiar faces.
