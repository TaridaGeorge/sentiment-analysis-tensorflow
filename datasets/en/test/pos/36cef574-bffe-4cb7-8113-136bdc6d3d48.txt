I first started taking my car(s) to Bill's 25th St Auto when they opened years back and have been impressed with the caring ethical way they approach their customers.  If you need something done they will do it right but more importantly if you DON'T need something done they will tell you too.  There is no quota or amount they have to ' get ' out of your time there; it is just honest caring ethical service. ( and a bunch of super nice guys as well) Thanks Bill...and Bill....for taking care of my service needs and those of my family and friends
