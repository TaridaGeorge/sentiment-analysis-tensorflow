AMAZING!!! Discovered this place couple months ago and loved it! Just got back from my second dining experience here, and the feeling is still the same. LOVE the Agnello, Fungi and Pesto pizza - very decently priced. BUT, all good things come to those who wait.. hence the long wait times to get a table. As long as you don't mind waiting for 30 minutes to get a table for dinner, it's totally worth it.
