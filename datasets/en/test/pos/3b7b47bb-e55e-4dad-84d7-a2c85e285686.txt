Haven't been to The Lost Leaf outside of First Friday but it is always a stop on that night. Love it! 

It's crowded, loud, and there has never been a place for us to sit down but it has great beer and the atmosphere is just awesome. Another great reason to go, is that it's not filled with morons or those typical rude people that love to frequent most places I enjoy.

The local art that covers the walls is pretty sweet and usually right up my alley.

One day I'll venture out to The Lost Leaf on a day other then Friday.
