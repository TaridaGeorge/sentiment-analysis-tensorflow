Saturday, Dec 27, 2008, FIRST DAY - It's 267 steps from here to the platform.  Rode end-to-end-to-end.  It's great!  And it's gonna be greater as we infill the Valley and as Light Rail is extended the next 20 miles and beyond!

Crowded?  Of course - it was the first day, and it was free.  I rode it again Monday to work.  Very convenient, and I didn't have to fight any traffic, and somehow, I didn't burn any gas outta my car.  Go figure!  Stopped off halfway home for lunch at Alexi's, then back on the train to deliver the leftovers to the Fridge.  Nice.
