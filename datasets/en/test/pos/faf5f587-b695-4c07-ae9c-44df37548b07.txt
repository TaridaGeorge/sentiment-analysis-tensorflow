We are own a 5 year old Yorkie who needs frequent grooming. We had tried Petsmart and Petco here without any real luck. A lady at Petco recommended Pete & Mac's. So he went for his first grooming today. He was in and out within an hour. His hair cut is perfect! He got a bandana and he smells like cotton candy. The staff was amazing! You could tell that each and everyone of them loved animals, which is very comforting. We will definitely be taking him back again! Thank you!!!
