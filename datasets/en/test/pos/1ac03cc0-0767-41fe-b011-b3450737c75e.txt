Words cannot describe HOW fantastic the food is at Chino's! (on my most recent visit this week, the meat portions seems much less than usual, maybe a different cook???) Anyhow....

Get there at 11am for a table and a good parking spot. Hungry people start piling in alittle before 11:30am...lunch gets so busy that there is a line out the door !

Friendly and helpful staff!!! Food comes out quickly.

Like already mentioned, the strip mall that it's located is dirty and pretty gross. Not that you are eating in the parking lot, but don't let that be a first impression of CB.

Also, don't let the fact that CB is a real dive and very "low-key"....the food is so worth it, if you are in the mood for something different and OH, so delicious! FIVE-STARS for the AWESOMELY YUMMY food!
