Went here for the first time today.  Loved it.  Becca was fun/professional and did a great job.

I have been looking for a place to get a "big boy haircut" since I moved in the area a few months ago, so far Canyon Falls has impressed me. Normally I just settle for whats cheap and quick from an $11 haircut place. Yes, I paid more for my cut at Canyon Falls... but it was worth it.  

The place is clean, the employees are clean, I was greeted right away when I came in and I left FEELING like I got a good cut.  I was only in for a cut/shampoo so I cant comment on any of the other services they offer but,  I think I might have found a my new place to get my hair cut...at last.  Thanks Becca.
