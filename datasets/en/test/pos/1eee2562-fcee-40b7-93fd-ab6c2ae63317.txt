Arizona Falls is a not-very-well known attraction on the Arizona Canal at 58th Street. It is one of my favorite places in Phoenix to go and to take out of towners to. It once was a watering hole for people and was a hydroelectric dam. In 2003 it was rebuilt very well and had gorgeous waterfalls put in overhead that you can walk under. It is open 24/7 and is free to visit. It's hard to explain how amazing this venue is so you'll just have to go visit for yourself.
