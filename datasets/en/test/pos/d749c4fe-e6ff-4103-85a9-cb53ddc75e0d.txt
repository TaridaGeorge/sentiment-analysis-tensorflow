Consummate professionals.

I called at 8:30pm on a Saturday night with a broken A/C unit. They indeed called back within the hour (as promised on their web site) and offered to come out the same night. The woman who called clearly explained what the rates would be and what I could expect. I decided it could wait until morning (since one of our two units was still working) so we agreed on 9:00am Sunday morning.

The technician arrived promptly, was very personable and polite, and quickly diagnosed and fixed the issue. He explained that their technicians do not work on commission so they are not under any pressure to oversell or overcharge.

House is nice and cool now--everything is great. Huge thank you to AccuTemp. 100 degree heat + broken A/C = no fun.
