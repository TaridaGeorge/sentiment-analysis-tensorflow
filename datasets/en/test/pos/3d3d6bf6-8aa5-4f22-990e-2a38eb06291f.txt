I think this restaurant is going to be a hit when people learn about it.  I found Boomers when I was driving around one evening.  It was closed, but I liked the the pictures of the food in the window and the cartoon dog on their logo.

I took my family there yesterday to eat for lunch.  I expected more people to be there, but it wasn't very busy.  The lady behind the counter was the daughter of the chef, so it's a family business which I like.

 My wife had the fish sliders, and my daughter and I had the cheese sliders.   We also had fries.  They have a lot of food on the menu, so next time I want to try something different.  Maybe I'll try the sandwich Mike D. had
