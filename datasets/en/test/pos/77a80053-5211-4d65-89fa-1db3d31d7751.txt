I love Zing. Seriously I eat there all the time.  The burgers are perfectly spiced, juicy and meaty! I always get tiger sauce for my fries and it's so good. (If you like spicy food) Last week I had the philly cheese steak (it was a special on the menu for the week) SO GOOD! Brought it home and ate it alone so nobody could see me pig out on this one! LOL.  I enjoy American food when it's done right and Zing does it right! - P.S- I even had a salad once...OMG BEST croutons I've had in my LIFE!
