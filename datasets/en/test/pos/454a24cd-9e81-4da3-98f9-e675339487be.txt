Brenda is very friendly, responsible and I really appreciated that she was always flexible (including last minute requests). She's also very responsive, you can leave her notes, send her texts or emails and she will always respond to you in timely manner. I did quite a few research in the area for dog sitter and her price is also very reasonable compared to others in the neighborhood offering same services. 

Thank you for taking such a good care of my puppy!
