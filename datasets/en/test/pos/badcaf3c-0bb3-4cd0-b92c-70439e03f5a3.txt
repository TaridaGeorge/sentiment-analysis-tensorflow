I came here on a Friday to feast on a Philly cheesesteak; had it with the onions and peppers on white bread.It was phenomenal! So much that I spent the whole weekend dreaming about it. And so I convinced my co-workers we needed to eat here for lunch the following Monday.  I ordered the Philly again on white bread w/ onions and peppers, but this time w/ chicken as the filling. Wow! It was delicious! The bread was not soggy. And both sandwiches were flavorful. It was well worth the $7 plus change spent.
