like my wife said (and the only other 2 reviewers), Hey, it's Dairy Queen. so tasty and refreshing when it's 100 degrees out. thing about dairy queen is they go to an area where there's no other fast food and they dominate! 

i had the pumpkin blizzard which was extremely delightful. since we had to wait longer than like 5 minutes, they comp'd us a medium instead of the mini we ordered. my gal got the mint oreo but i didn't try it because i was gluttonizing in my own frosty treat.
