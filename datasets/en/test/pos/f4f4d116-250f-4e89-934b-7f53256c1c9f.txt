This place is great!  I've been here a few times so far and have ordered the Green curry, red curry and pad thai, all of which are great!!  The service is friendly, however once it was a little slow.  The food makes up for it though!

I usually do takeout because I have noticed that you get bigger portions that way.  The curry comes in a huge to-go container!!
