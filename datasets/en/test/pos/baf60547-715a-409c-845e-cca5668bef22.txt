Imagine a Hot Pocket hot from the microwave. Now imagine it tasting about 1,000,000 times better. That's InPockets in Chandler.

InPockets stuffs flaky homemade bread with a variety of tasty fillings. There is the traditional German family recipe of corned beef and cabbage, Italian sausage and marinara sauce, pulled BBQ pork, and my favorite (so far), of roasted turkey breast, provolone and bacon. They also have a breakfast pockets menu. 

If you're not into glorified Hot Pockets, try one of their fresh-baked pastries with a drink off of their wonderful gourmet beverage menu, including Caramel French Vanilla Coffee or Hot Chocolate Latte.
