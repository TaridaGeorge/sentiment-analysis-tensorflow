My experience couldn't have been better, from start to finish. Not only did they trade in my car for what I still owed on it (even though it wasn't even close to worth that much), they found an amazing SUV for me, helped me finance by myself. I did it without a co-signer for the first time. 
Sam also gave me tips on how to get money back from my previous plates and warranty. I drove away with an amazing vehicle, with warranty, no roll over from my previous loan, on my own, low interest and I have the monthly payments I was comfortable with. 
I am ecstatic with the service from everyone at the dealership. I have no cons about this place, which is rare for me:) thank you, thank you, thank you!
