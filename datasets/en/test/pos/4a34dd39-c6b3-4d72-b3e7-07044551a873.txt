Super tasty!  Went there for a romantic dinner on New Year's Eve and walked away very satisfied.

Everything was cooked to perfection, from the monkfish to the foie gras to the duck leg confit...sooooo yummy!  The attention to detail was insanely awesome!  I rarely give reviews, let alone a glowing review, so this is definitely a place to try, and then try again and again.  I highly recommend doing the wine pairing with your meal.  With the exception of the taster course (amuse bouche - sp?), there is a glass of wine with each plate of food that is excellently matched to the food.  Also, our server was very knowledgable, attentive, and courteous.
