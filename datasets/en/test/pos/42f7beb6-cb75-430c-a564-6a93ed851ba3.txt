I came here with a group of 20 for a work lunch.  Due to time constraints we ordered our lunches ahead.  I ordered the chicken con-fit but they change the item out.  They emailed our person that was setting up the lunch and notify me that they have grilled turkey breast served with butternut squash puree, brussel sprouts with crispy bacon, and a cranberry relish.  They sounded deli-sh, so I was OK with the change.  Boy, the change was welcome when I had my first taste.  OMG, everything was SO SO SO GOOD.  The service was excellent!
