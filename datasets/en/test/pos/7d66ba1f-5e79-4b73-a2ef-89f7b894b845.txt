Came out from LA to visit a friend here in Phoenix.... got off the plane and first stop: The Vig!!

Everything on the menu looked so good... I couldnt decide... my friend said the Carne Asada was SUUUUUPER good. Sooooo, that's what I got and let me TELL YOU... it was BOMB. 

Carne Asada on a Potato Pancake: sliced carne asada on a potato pancake with guacamole, pico de gallo, sour cream, cotija cheese and roasted tomato sauce

For people familiar with the LA area.... this place has the same look, feel and vibe of Beechwood in Venice. 

Go here!! Its YUM!!
