Of all the maaaaaannnnnny airports I've been through, this is one of my favorites due to the organization, variety of food options, and the usually cool art. Perhaps I've been lucky, but I've always been able to breeze through security in very decent timeframes, and the agents here are among the nicest in any airport. 

PHX's consolidated approach to handling car rentals should be required in every American airport...as well as the "Rental Car Return" signage on the way to the airport. 

PHX has Volunteer Navigators, who are most helpful in an airport this size. This airport is either quite large, or very spread out.
