Great burger place!  In a world of burgers are burgers, this place sets itself apart from the rest with quality ingredients, very good service and a friendly atmosphere.  You can build your own or order from the pre-defined menu.  My favorite, the Blu Burger with caramelized onions, blue cheese on an onion roll.  Fries are great, as well as the onion rings.  Well worth the price and the drive if you don't live all that close.  You can get a veggie burger or turkey burger but they stick to what they are good at.  It's a definite return trip for us!!
