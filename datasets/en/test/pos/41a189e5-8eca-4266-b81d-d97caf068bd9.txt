Dined at Wildfish this past Wednesday. As usual, the overall experience was exceptional. Here are some quick thoughts on the positives (in no particular order):

1.) Happy hour runs till seven. Decent choice of wines priced at $5.00. The apps are great -- same serving size I believe as found on the dinner menu.

2.) I've always been struck by the greeting you receive upon entering the restaurant. Every staff member you run across, from managers to the hostesses, welcomes you. Why don't more establishments train their people to be as welcoming?

3.) Wildfish does a great job for gluten free diners. Both my wife and daughter have Celiac Disease. The staff here does not "guess" as to what might be gluten free.

4.) We had Eric again as our waiter. Ask for him when you visit -- you won't be disappointed.

Five stars. We will be back!
