I am totally biased as I eat here way too often, but it is worth five stars. Everything is fantastic. I recommend the antipasto, for starters and for pizza, I am a fan of the capricciosa, the diavola, and the salsiccia. If you like white, the sienna and the di notte are both killer. The pasta specials are usually out of control good and the banana nutella crepe is probably my favorite desert in Phoenix (though the Pizzookie at Oreganos is a close second). For lunch the PLT (Proscuitto, Lettuce, and Tomato) is divine!

I would say that the staff is comprised of some of the kindest people I have ever met and I have never had a bad experience there! Highly, highly recommended!
