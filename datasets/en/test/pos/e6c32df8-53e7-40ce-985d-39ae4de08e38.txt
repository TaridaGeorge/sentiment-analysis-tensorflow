I went there again last Thursday for a quick lunch before my afternoon meetings. The food was served very fast and I love their sweet potato fries, very yummy.  I've tried them a few times in their different locations, but I think the one in Camelback tastes better than the one in Tempe Marketplace.  Would love to try it again sometime :)  I am actually not a big fan for burgers anymore after I moved to the US from China, but I do like their sides and feel a bit healthier than a big burger!
