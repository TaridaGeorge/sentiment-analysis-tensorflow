Cambodian food, where have you been all my life?

I know, I know, Cambodia.

I love this place.  I've ordered about 6 dishes off the menu now, and everything has been perfectly portioned and cooked.  Having never eaten Cambodian before, the closest thing I can compare it to is Vietnamese: it is very light, tastefully seasoned, and is best when the ingredients are fresh.

Everything from the shrimp to the herbs at this place has tasted uber-fresh, and the service hasn't seemed any slower to me than I'd expect at a restaurant.  Maybe some people are confused because the prices are so cheap.

As for atmosphere, the place is really cute.  There's always Cambodian pop music playing (which is often re-worked American songs), and the staff is always very friendly.

Great for lunch or takeout.
