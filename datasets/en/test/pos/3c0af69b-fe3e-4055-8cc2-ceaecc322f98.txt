I have eaten steak on 4 continents - the filet (bone-in or not) is the best in the world. This place is not cheap, especially if you add a glass of vino, BUT, for special occasions, impress a date, seal a deal or to enjoy the best steak in north america, this is the place to go. Ask for Alan as your waiter. You will not be dissapointed.

The sides are amazing - creamed corn (light on the cream), the gorgonzola mac-n-cheese and their house pinot (or reisling if its summer) won't let you down.
