Hands down our fav happy hour place!!
$5 sake bombers, $3-5 great sushi selection - what's not to love about it?
If you sit at the sushi bar you get miso soup and edamame complimentary.

My husband and I go there a couple times a month and the only thing that sucks about this location - we never ever get the same server - seems like the staff turnout there is crazy. Different girls every time. It's not really what we want from our fav neighborhood spot. 
Anyways, the food is really-really good. Try the DRAGON roll!
