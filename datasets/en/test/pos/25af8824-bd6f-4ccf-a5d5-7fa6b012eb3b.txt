One of my favorite places in Scottsdale.  This restaurant is so quaint and beautiful.  Definitely a must to sit outside during the nice weather!  The food is fantastic, the service is superb and the setting is spectacular!  The tortilla soup and the halibut were delicious.  The Sunday brunch is very nice as well.
