This is one of my favorite hang outs in Gilbert. The coffee is tasty, the atmosphere is relaxing, the cupcakes are deliciousness...and the food is surprisingly yummy and filling. 

Here's a little tip, they service quiche, breakfast burritos, oatmeal, etc etc. So, when the line is long at Joe's, don't fret, walk right over to The Coffee Shop and order up in no time. The staff is really helpful and they offer TONS (did I say tons? I meant it) of non coffee drinks for you silly caffeine abstainers. The lemonade is tart and sweet and so right.
