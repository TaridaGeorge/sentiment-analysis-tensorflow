I have been relying on a buffet to satisfy my hunger for Sushi.  My family decided to try this place the other night and I went back for more the next day.  The restaurant felt very clean and the staff was very helpful.  Family of four spend $50 on lunch which was a bit more than we typically spend but we will definitely be back here.
