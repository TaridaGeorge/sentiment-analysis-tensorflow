Hello there Siobhan!  I have received a confirmation email from my attorney has to how much she and her family loved the brownies.  Her question was . . . where did I find you and I had to laugh since it was based on your Groupon deal.  Now I am going to have to order some myself as they really must be something.

I will keep you in my arsenal for future gifts and thank you so much doing a wonderful job.

Now take a bow and pat yourself on the back for doing such a great job!

And yes -- I will be getting back to you soon with more orders.

Happy 4th of July Weekend and keep everyone believing in fairytales as apparently they really do come true!

Anne Morris
