I LOVE THIS PLACE. I have been 4 times since it opened and have yet to be disappointed. The french toast is like a cinnamon roll that is battered, pan sauteed and served for your enjoyment. The portions are enough to leave you full but not uncomfortably full. The staff also seem pretty knowledgeable which is impressive for it just opening. 

Daniel was especially helpful today when I placed a to-go order and realized their side of fruit had melon in it (I'm allergic). So he went in the back and cut up some strawberries, grapes and apples. Thanks Daniel! 

Anyway, I highly recommend this place. The service is fast, the atmosphere is relaxed and the food is good. What more could you ask for?
