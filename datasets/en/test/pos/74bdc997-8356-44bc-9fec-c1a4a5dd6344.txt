This great restaurant has morphed into "The Buffet", at the same location.  This was a 100% remodel of the space in the building, but it's still the same owners (& management, presumably).  The new restaurant in it's place is possibly even better, & you can enjoy the Lunch Buffet for an even lower price than before!  

The foods offered have changed some, but if you loved what they served at Harvest Buffet, you'll REALLY love "The Buffet"!  Also, it's very comfortable inside & the staff was super friendly when I was there for the Grand Opening today!     :-))
