Inexpensive delicious Italian food in a small and personable restaurant.  We tripped across Miele's in some 'best of' magazine article.  They were right.

This place is not showy, but it sure is right for dinner.  Your fresh bread will be brought out on a plastic dish, and you'll love it.  I also thoroughly enjoy and recommend the Lasagna.  I judge italian restaurants by this dish and Miele's is still the standard by which I rate the others.  

If I owned this place the only thing I would do would be to add regular Ice Cream to the dessert menu, but that's the same knock on most italian restaurants.  No real ice cream.
