I went there couple time, the food is great with fair price. Should definely try it, I love their general tso' chicken, taste different from other Chinese restaurant, the outside is crispy n with sweet sauce on top! Yummy! they just open less than a year, should go in and try! Oooo, and also the crab puff, make sure you order that!
