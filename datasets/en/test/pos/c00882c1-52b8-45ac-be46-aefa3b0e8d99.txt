Been going to Saba's for years. Ran across a Boot Barn on a camping trip in Colorado and was super impressed with them. When we got home I looked for one here and was surprised to find one within 40 miles of my house. Headed out for the first time today and found their prices to be WELL below the prices at Saba's. I purchased an MHT hat for $39.99 here that sells for $79.99 (no, sadly, I am not kidding) at Saba's. This price was not a sale, it was the same price at the Boot Barn in Durango, they just did not have my size. The man working the counter was quite friendly and knowledgeable. Sadly, for Saba's, this Boot Barn location has earned my future business.
