Ah Sprinkles. I curse you for coming into my life. So does my scale. This place is indulgent, delicious and decadent. Simultaneously, it is fun, fresh and makes you feel like a kid (what kid doesn't love a cupcake?) The customer service here is obviously a top priority to the company as it is always pristine. It is a little pricey but oh-so worth it. I bounce between the chocolate marshmallow cupcake and the vegan red velvet--you would never guess there is no dairy or eggs in these! The day we live in a city that doesn't have a Sprinkles is the day I will cry myself to sleep.
