99% Adorable
1% Creepy for the crazy mannequin that's usually dressed up outside by the road

And I never fail to walk out with something 98% of the time I'm there. I've bought everything from amazing glass pie plates to a vegetable steamer to little utensils. It's unbelievable how many different items they have, vintage and brand new. Last time I was there one of the employees told me they get a lot of items given to people as housewarming and wedding presents, and rather than returning or exchanging them, they end up selling them there. I've purchased several brand new small kitchen appliances there. Never mind the fact that I'm always drooling over the vintage cookbooks. Like I need more of those. 

Before you spend a bundle on something you're not sure how much use you'll get out of, head here.
