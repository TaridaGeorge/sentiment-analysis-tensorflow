As is true with Switch...I love Fez for a myriad of reasons...

-great drinks
-hip/fun atmosphere
-works for a loud night out with friends or a laid back dinner for two
-patio seating in front of the restaurant (a plus in my book)

go, if only to order the sweet potato fries with cinnamon sugar on top. amazing.
