I am in love with Hanny's.  They now have a new upscale classic drink menu that is on the pricey side, but looks AMAZING.  So far, I've tried the English Garden, which supplants any other mixed drink I've had as the best summer beverage.  It's 13 dollars, and contains the perfect proportions of Hendrick's Gin, St. Germain liqueur, and muddled cucumber.  Quite refreshing, strong, and yet incredibly quaffable.  Check it out.
