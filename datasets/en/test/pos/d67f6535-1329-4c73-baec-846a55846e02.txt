This is near my downtown condo, which is convenient since I can eat here multiple times a week without tiring of it.

Free newspapers, great service and friendly staff who remembers their "regular" customers, breakfast all day and huge glasses of iced tea - adds up to a very enjoyable, affordable meal.
