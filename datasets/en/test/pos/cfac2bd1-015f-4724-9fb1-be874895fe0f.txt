Best BBQ in the east valley without a doubt. Yes, better than Joe's, Waldo's, Dickie's, Dave's, or any others we've been to. Family owned & operated. Brisket, pulled pork, and sausage are all yummy, moist, and just enough smoke without overpowering the meat. Price point for their food is commensurate with just about every non-chain BBQ joint in the valley.

After dinner comes one of the best kept secrets at this fantastic little BBQ joint - the homemade pecan pie! The owners wife makes the pie from scratch. As a lover of pecan pie, I have had many & believe me this one is the best. I asked about buying whole pies & they do sell whole pies as well, yippie! 

If you love BBQ & have not tried Allison's...it is well worth the trip. Fortunately for us, we live very close to this great restaurant.
