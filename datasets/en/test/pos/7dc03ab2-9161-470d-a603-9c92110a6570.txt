This is the best starbucks I've been to, and trust me I have been to a few. The drive thru here gets pretty busy so you gotta hope that you get lucky and catch it when its quiet. The workers here have always been friendly and they crank the orders out pretty fast. I like to get my breakfast sandwhich and a drink in the mornings. I wish this place was 24 hours so I could come by after my late night workouts.
