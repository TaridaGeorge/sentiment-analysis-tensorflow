We tried this place out after receiving a free appetizer coupon.  The restaurant is bigger than I thought.  We were seated promptly after arriving at 4:30 and learned that it was happy hour until 5:00 with $5.00 drinks, wine and beer.  We ordered two appetizers, ( I cannot remember the name of the appetizer) cheese/meat/veggie and also the pretzel fondue, which included pretzels, apples and kielbasa.  Both were excellent and filling - I had the cucumber drink and my husband had the watermelon drink (very refreshing!).  Excellent service and food - the only negative for some may be that it is very loud!  - Not a place for a romantic meal - if that is something you are looking for try - Aiello's across the street.
