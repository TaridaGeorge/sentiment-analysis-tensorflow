We have been to Sidebar at least a dozen times in the last year and have had consistently great experiences! My husband even had his bachelor pre-party at Sidebar. The atmosphere has a cool vibe with exposed brick, cool lounge chairs, couches, good music (but not too loud) and since it's upstairs you can get a great view of Downtown. However, it is not a stuck up scene, there are lots of regular people just there to enjoy a drink and hang out with friends.  The specialty drinks are delicious and the bartenders always make them with pride....I especially love the Gin Blossom (I think that is what it's called) and the Pama Mojito.  There is also a really quality, diverse beer list.  They have a couple basic appetizers, but don't come here if you are looking to eat as it is not really designed for that.
