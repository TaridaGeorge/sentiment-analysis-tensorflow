First, I do not drop 5-star reviews unless I am blown away. One of my biggest peeves about Yelp is the low bar some people have for giving a PERFECT score after a only a visit or two. Small, friendly, good value -- day old cupcakes are cheap -- and vegan. I have bought whole pies, all kinds of cupcakes, tarts, all delicious. After becoming vegan I had to say goodbye to Barbs, but now I can satisfy my sweet tooth without the cruelty baggage. It takes real self control to not visit every day.
