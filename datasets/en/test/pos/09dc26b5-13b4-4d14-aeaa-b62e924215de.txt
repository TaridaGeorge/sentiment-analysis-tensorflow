Simply unbelievable bartenders. Nikki was amazing.  If you're into your cocktails, sitting at the bar is a MUST.  She knew all about obscure spirits & their origins, tasting profiles, etc.  She also customized drinks for us and works on an "ad lib" basis where she's always trying new things.  

We watched as they unpacked 4 bags of different fresh herbs.  "What are those for?"  "Well, we're not sure yet, but we love trying new things so we'll incorporate them as we feel like it."

Wedge salad was just OK.  The smallish menu looked very good.

This place gets really busy after 10pm, so if you're looking for an amazing/customized drinking experience, get there before then as the barkeeps get pretty busy after...
