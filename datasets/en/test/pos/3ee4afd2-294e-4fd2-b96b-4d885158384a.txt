1st time in Mesa location had the "Lovely Bit Salmon" and it was fantastic. Last time in the Tempe location had the "Vindaloo Lamb" and it was a totally different taste but same result ... amazing!

Love the story behind the main/only course the Pasty! Perfect restaurant to try every item on the menu. 

Also their soup/bread/butter appetizers are delicious.
