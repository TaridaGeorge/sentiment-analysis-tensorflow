YUM!
I always love coming here.  Breakfast is fantastic (HIGHLY recommend their Yogurt and Granola Bowl), Lunch is wonderful (Try the sea bass w ravioli) and Dinner is great as well (sangria anyone?).  This restaurant makes you feel like your not even in AZ with it's gorgeous patio on the canal and plush sofas. 
This is by far one of my favorite places to come with my girlfriends or alone and enjoy the atmosphere.  The service is always top notch and knowledgeable.  I highly recommend this place for drinks, dinner, chatting, munching, wine, breakfast, deserts, people watching, lunch and atmosphere; amongst other things...Enjoy yourself whatever you choose to do.
Cheers!
