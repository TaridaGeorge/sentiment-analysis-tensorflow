Simple THE BEST ravioli in the state of Arizona. Hands down. Homemade deliciousness in a cream and tomato sauce. The other food is all very good, as well, but it's the ravioli that draws me back again and again. Prices are on the higher side - you don't get great value for basics like apps, salads, etc. - but for the handmade pastas, totally worth it, especially since they come with soup or salad! Service is always attentive and friendly.
