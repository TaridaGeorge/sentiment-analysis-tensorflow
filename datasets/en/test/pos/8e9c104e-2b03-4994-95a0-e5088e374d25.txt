Excellent service, and excellent food! Trusted our server & took all of his suggestions ... our meal was amazing. Even the sides of mushrooms & sweet potatoes were fantastic. Impressed that the manager came by to ask if we were having a nice time. When she found out we were celebrating a birthday, out came the most amazing dessert! Thanks, Roka Akor, we'll be back!
