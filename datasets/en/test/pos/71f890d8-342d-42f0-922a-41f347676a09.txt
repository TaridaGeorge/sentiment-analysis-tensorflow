WOW!!!  This cute little places sits in an unasssuming strip mall on Indian School, just east of Dysart.  The owners take pride in this place, as the decor is very clean, contemporary, and colorful.  My first time was with three other friends, that were fairly educated Thai eaters.  I just went along with that they ordered...and boy was I glad I did!  We hade a coconut soup that was amazing!  So flavorful and the cute "fire in the center "pan it came in for us all to share was delightful!  Our pad thai and curry chicken was awesome!  I cannot wait to bring my husband here!  Way to go Orchid Garden!  Thank you for allowing me to have an amazing dining choice in my neighborhood (as opposed to all the chains)!!
