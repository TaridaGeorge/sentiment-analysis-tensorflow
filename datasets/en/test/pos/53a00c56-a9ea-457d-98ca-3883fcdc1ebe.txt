The Breadfruit has always been one of my favorites. I'm always welcomed by name with hearty smiles. Being a single woman, party of one, often, this is the best place in town to feel comfortable and never alone.

Always a fan of the bar menu, the new release of latest and greatest spring cocktails are stellar. The French Marmalade has been haunting my dreams for the last 4 nights. After last evening though, the smoked mussels will be doing battle with that cocktail for my dreams. Ire, mon! Truly ire!
