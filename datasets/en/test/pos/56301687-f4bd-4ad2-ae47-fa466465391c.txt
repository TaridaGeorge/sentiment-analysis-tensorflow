Our three Maine Coons had an excellent, relaxed first visit here yesterday. The facility is large, clean, and well-staffed by a friendly team. Same day appointments are often available and the practice is open 7 days/week. 

We were especially impressed with Dr. Rollins, who approached our cats quietly and gently, keeping them completely relaxed throughout the exam, and noting issues very calmly. He and his technician Mary had a wonderful rapport with the kitties--and with their human parents as well.

Dr. Rollins even called us today to see how the cats were feeling after their visit and shots.  

Yes, their rates are expensive, but for high quality care that keeps our little monsters serene and healthy, we are willing to make the investment. Their website often has coupons available and they also discount some services for multiple pets.
