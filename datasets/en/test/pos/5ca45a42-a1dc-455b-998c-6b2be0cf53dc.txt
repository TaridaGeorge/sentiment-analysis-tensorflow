BEST NY PIZZA IN AZ HANDS DOWN!!!! I am a huge fan of Buono's in Mesa, but I am now a Pat's Pizza Plus #1 fan....The gentleman at the counter was extremely friendly and gave me a stamp card and menu....The pizza is greasy, but it's sooooo delicious! I asked for Extra cheese and they do not skimp out! It's so fresh and the crust is cooked to perfection! Why would anyone go to places like Papa Johns, Dominos, Pizza Hut when there are delicious hidden gems like this in the valley! Don't waste your time on those changes and support your local businesses! The food is way better anyway!! :-)
