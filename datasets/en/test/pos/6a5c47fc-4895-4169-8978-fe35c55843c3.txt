I work about a 1/2 mile from this awesome place of food!! I was bored with many of the places in the immediate area and ran across this place by accident. WOW!!! It has become one of my all-time favorite places to eat now. I am usually a little bit on the frugal side but with this place I do make an exception. It cost me right around $10.00 for a lunch but I have to admit it will make you want to go back everyday. I usually get the pizza cheese steak with grilled onions and peperoni. and a side of frys.... and the awesome dipping sauce. Great dinning experience for sure. If you are looking for a great meal and friendly atmosphere this is the place for you. TRY IT!!
