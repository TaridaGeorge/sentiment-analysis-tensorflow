I have been to Bikram studios all over the country and rate Bikram Yoga Tempe as one of the best.  All the instructors over the two weeks I was here were spot on with their dialogue and had awesome tips for everyone, from the newest person to the most experienced.  The studio is CLEAN!  People are friendly!  And above all, their class schedule is HUGE!!
