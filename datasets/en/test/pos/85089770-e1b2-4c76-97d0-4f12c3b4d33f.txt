Oh Hell yes! This place doesn't fuck around. I assume it's authentic Italian food but I've been to Italy, technically a couple of times, and I never experienced anything this good there except for a $6 scoop of double dark chocolate ice cream in some famous Roman square. 

The food is simply amazing. Three words: Eggplant! That said, your experience is dependent on your ability to engage the owner. He's rad. Magnetic. Talented. Funny. So if you have even a modicum of grace and social disineptness or adeptness you'll do fine. If I was the type of person to do lunches, dinners, or generally engage others in a mutually beneficial exchange of thoughts or ideas, I'd be here all the time.
