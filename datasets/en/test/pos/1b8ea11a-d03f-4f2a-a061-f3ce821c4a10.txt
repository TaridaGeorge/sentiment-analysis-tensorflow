I'm hooked. The addition of the Lost Leaf to the downtown bar scene creates a trio of coolness as you walk from 3rd to 5th Streets, even in our 100+ degree July nights:  the Roosevelt for an appetizer or drinks on 3rd, Fate for dinner on 4th, and the Lost Leaf for drinks on 5th. This only reinforces my argument that the best place to spend a Friday or Saturday night in the Valley is not the douchebaggery of Scottsdale, and not Tempe if you''re no longer a teenager... but downtown Phoenix. The atmosphere and decor is exactly what I'm looking for, with wooden floors, cool art on the walls, a billion selections of beer or wine, and just a laid back, conversational vibe to the whole place. 

You'll find me there often in the future.
