Hvala lijepo Balkan Bakery for making my order of Zeljanica extra special. The bakery really did me a huge favor as I wanted to surprise a friend who loves Zeljanica for her birthday and unfortunately I have not mastered the art of making them myself... yet. Enter Balkan Bakery. I ordered 5 of them on Saturday afternoon for pickup Sunday afternoon and not only did he make them for me, but cut them so that they were enough to feed about dozen people. They were a huge hit (as I knew they would be) and my friend was so happy. So again Hvala lijepo!! I will be back for more soon!
