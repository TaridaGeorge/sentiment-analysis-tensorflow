I've taken my old beater to Frank at Honest Auto & Cycle numerous times over the last few years and would give 10 stars if I could. Frank is no nonsense and has kept my car in like new condition for what seems to be pennies. As a single woman (who knows less about cars than a 6 year old) I always feel welcome, and that I'm being taken care of, not advantage of. Go see Frank if you want both your car and wallet safe and in great condition!
