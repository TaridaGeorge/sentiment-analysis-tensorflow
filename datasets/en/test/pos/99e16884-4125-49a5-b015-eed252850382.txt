This is our absolute favorite place to eat!!! There are so many different healthy options.  Wheat noodles are a must!  The only weird thing I happen to notice every time we go there are so many morbidly obese people!  This place seems healthy, but are there hidden massive amounts of calories somewhere? Lol!
