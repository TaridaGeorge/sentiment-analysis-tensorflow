I LOVE this place! I've ordered takeout a few times since moving here from alifornia, and the food is terrific! Love the sweet n sour pork, Lemon chicken and just about everything we've ordered... and when visiting the restaurant, I found it very clean, the employees cheerful and the beer terrific...lol
