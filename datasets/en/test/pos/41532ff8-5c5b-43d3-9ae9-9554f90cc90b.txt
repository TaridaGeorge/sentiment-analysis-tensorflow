Sometime long, long ago, I had a wonderful brunch at Windsor.  I remember it fondly.

A No 2 cocktail (vodka, peach puree, prosecco) times 2.  An amazing bloody mary bar, too bad I don't like bloody marys.  Warm donut holes with mascarpone and jam.  A fantastic breakfast burrito with Schreiner's sausage.  And more than one bite of my husband's strawberry pancakes.

Wouldn't have changed a thing, especially when the bill came and it was far less than I would have expected.  Big hug to Shannon M (and an unnamed former Yelper) for introducing us to this gem.
