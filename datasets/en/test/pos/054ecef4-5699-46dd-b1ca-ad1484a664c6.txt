This is one of the best breakfast places in the Valley. The food is out of this world and the service is great. We showed up at 1:00 PM on the 4th of July. They close at 1:00 but they seated us anyway. I had met the owner over eighteen months ago. He remembered my name. 

The hash browns can't be beat. They are grilled to perfection on the outside. The chicken fried steak is smothered with sausage and bacon gravy. 

I would review the other food but I keep coming back for the chicken fried steak. Gotta try something else one day.
