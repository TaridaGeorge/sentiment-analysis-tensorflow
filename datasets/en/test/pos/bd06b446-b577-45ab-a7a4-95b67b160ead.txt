We would have never known about this secret diamond in the rough without the help of Yelp!  I surprised my wife and four boys by taking them here.  Everyone loved it!  The food is so fresh and plentiful!  The parking was a little scarce as we had to park across San Tan Blvd as there wasn't any parking available...but there was a fundraiser going on so maybe there's usually a place to park.  The dessert was excellent and the service was excellent as well.  We have a new favorite place.  Although I probably won't take the family every time as it was about $75 with dessert/tip.  I highly recommend this place!
