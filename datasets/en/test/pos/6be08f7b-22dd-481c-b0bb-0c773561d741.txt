Holy delicious cupcake Batman!

Okay, I haven't actually BEEN to their location, but today, my new office neighbors were gracious enough to deliver 2 dozen of these scrumptious little treats to say hello.. 

WELL HELL-OFREAKINO!  I'm not sure i've encountered a better cupcake (NOT EVEN AT THE INFAMOUS MAGNOLIA BAKERY IN MANHATTAN)! Their was a mix of about 5 different flavors, I consumed 2, within 2 minutes.. Red Velvet, which was absolutely heavenly & Chocolate Marshmallow, I will admit the chocolate was a little rich, but anything filled with marshmallow fluff is A-OK in my book! I think I have diabetes now, sorry Wilford Brimley.

Their marketing dept is on the ball with their daily whispers on twitter too, seriously genius! It is taking everything I have in my body and soul not to sprint into the kitchen to try the vanilla that is SCREAMING my name.
