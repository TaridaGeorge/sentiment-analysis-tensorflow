What a great place to find in Chandler! It's a tiny little space, but don't let that fool you. The flavors of the food are big! Not only was the food really good, and reasonably priced, but the staff was super friendly. We felt like regulars on our first visit. I will be back for sure! Thanks, Yoshi!
