Having lived in Italy I normally don't go to Italian restaurants because I don't like to pay for food I can make better and cheaper at home but Miele's is the one place I will go to spend my money. The food is great, everything down to the bread and the pizza is killer. Some people have complained about the prices, well you get a lot of food and it is good food I never leave here hungry. Also the email specials are a great deal. If you like seafood try the seafood risotto, it is a tossup between that and the stuffed eggplant as my favorite thing on the menu. 

If you want good real Italian food this is the place if you want all you can eat overcooked pasta and salad for 7 bucks go to Olive Garden.
