Great find! My wife and I tried out Grassroots for the first time Saturday night. We shared a Chopped salad and the Rib and Chicken platter. Amazing! My wife fell in love with the wines on tap! I thought the beer selection was awesome! We finished it off with a slice of key lime pie!Great date night!
