The absolute best pizza in the valley. Along with superb appetizers and soups, Lamp has become a weekly visit.  The owners and staff are friendly and pleasant.  The service is always top notch, unlike other pizza establishments we have visited.  The best true Napolitano pizza in AZ.  Be sure to try the milkshakes. The kids love them.
