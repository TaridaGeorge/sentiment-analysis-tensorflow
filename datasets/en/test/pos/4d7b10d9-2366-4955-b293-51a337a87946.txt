Was searching for a place to eat before a Halloween party. Saw rocket burger on the map and had heard someone mention them a week earlier.
Ordered the "Eddie Lopez" double burger, had pastrami on top.
Best damn burger.....not better than mine....but close :-D
Fries suck but i just wont order them again.
Service was good and the owner is there every time i go and is very friendly.
Which is probably the reason for 5 stars, i don't hand them out like candy....
They have over 200 different sodas in the fridge which is pretty unique.

Ive been back 3 times and will keep going back.
