I have been a patient of Dr. Hostetler's for 20 years and always received exceptional care.  They have a great selection of frames and professionals that insure a comfortable fitting and worked with me to select the optimal lenses as I have a sensitivity to some of the high index materials.  Recently Dr. Hostetler went out of his way to accommodate me with a specialized color vision test not readily available that I needed for a federal licensing requirement.  It would have been very easy to say no but he researched alternatives and set aside time for a follow up visit to administer the test.  Their new facility is excellent and conveniently located, I have recommended San Tan Eye Care to friends and family and wouldn't do that unless I was confident in their abilities and service.
