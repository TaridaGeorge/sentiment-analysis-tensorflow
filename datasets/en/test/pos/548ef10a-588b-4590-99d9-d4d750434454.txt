For all of the notoriety Joe's has gotten for being farm-to-table and all about the freshest ingredients, I - in my infinite wisdom - accidentally ordered something a meal that was entirely fried.

That's not to say the panko-breaded eggplant wasn't great, because it was fried well and came along with a great homemade marinara sauce. Similarly, the hushpuppies were equally excellent, made with pieces of actual corn for a little bit of texture. And the Friday fried cod was no slouch either, though given an upbringing where fish fries were the norm, the purity of ingredients approach did little to curb my ho-hum attitude. 

It's easy to see why the line was out the door by the time I finished my meal - Joe's is a bastion of fresh food in a desert, but I advise those ordering to choose menu items that best highlight that freshness.
