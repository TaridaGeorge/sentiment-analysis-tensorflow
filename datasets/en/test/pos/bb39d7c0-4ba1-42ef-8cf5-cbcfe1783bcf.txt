I only visit Akai Hana when I am in town visiting a friend.  To be honest, this little gem is one of the reasons why I love visiting her so much!

Akai Hana has a great happy hour with very good deals, a decent selection of sushi and hot appetizers.  The rolls and sushi are abundant and fresh.  I suggest the Las Vegas roll: it's spicy and cream-cheesy.  

The staff is friendly and efficient.  A definite bonus.
