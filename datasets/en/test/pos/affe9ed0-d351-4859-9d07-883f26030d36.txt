Ive heard rave reviews about this place for years and last night was my first experience at LGO. We ordered the baked chicken wings, and two pizzas; the gladiator and the avocado pizza. All three items were delicious, my favorite being the avocado pizza, it was very fresh and flavorful. We were stuffed after our meal but their desserts looks to die for too. We will definitely be going back.
