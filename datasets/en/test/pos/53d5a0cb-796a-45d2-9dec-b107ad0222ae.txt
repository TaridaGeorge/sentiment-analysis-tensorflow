Want some real Mexican food without hurting your wallet?

You've come to the right place.

But remember: the place is small. And I mean SMALL. To the point where if there were 3 people standing in line, you guys might be elbowing each other or bumping into each other because there are other people trying to reach around to you to grab condiments and refills or wait for THEIR food. I was sharing a small table with some stranger just because there was no space whatsoever. What makes it all worth it is the food.

The Chimichanga is only $5 or $6 and it is huge (in the meat of your choice) and tastes perfect in all of it's special cooked spices.

Come here and then come back again.
