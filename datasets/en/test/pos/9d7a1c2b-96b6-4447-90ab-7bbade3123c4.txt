Ever since I moved to Chandler, my husband has commented on how unhappy I look after meals.. and I always reply with the same complaint-- I'm unhappy because there's no real Asian food in Chandler! I never have a grimace after Thai Paradise though. I love this place! At the end of the day, nothing hits the spot like their curry pork ribs and Thai iced tea. My husband and I are trying everything on their menu because we love Thai food. The chef is super nice and it is obvious he takes pride in his dishes.
