Went for dinner tonight and it was awesome!  I took my kids and I probably wouldn't bring them on a busy night but tonight was slow so we were ok. The server was awesome and the food was great!  My 4 year old said that her mac and cheese was " the best in the whole world". And she would be an expert on that!  We had the jalepeno poppers, short ribs, bacon wrapped scallops, salmon, bacon wrapped pork tenderloin and pineapple skewers. Everything was excellent.
