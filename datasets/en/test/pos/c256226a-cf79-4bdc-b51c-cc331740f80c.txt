What a dream! This place is stocked to the brim but is not overwhelming. There are tons and tons of choices at various price points, so there is something for everyone here. I loved their dress selection - several were really unique and fun. Brands such as Velvet, Diane von Furstenberg, Frankie B, Corey Lynn Calter are the ones that come to mind when I remember this place. I just loved the selection of tops, jeans, dresses, skirts - dressy and casual. The girl that helped me was super friendly and helpful and not at all pretentious. I will definitely be back here to visit....nothing I tried on really wowed me this time, but there were so many things that I wished had worked because I truly loved them. My husband and bank account are probably thankful that nothing fit this time, though!
