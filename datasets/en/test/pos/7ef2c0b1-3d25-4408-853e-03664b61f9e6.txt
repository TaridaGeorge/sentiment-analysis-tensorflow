After some of the hikes I've been doing, hiking Pinnacle Peak the other day with some girlfriend seemed like an easy stroll . . . almost.
Still got a good workout in.  Could see bringing my 3 1/2 year old son here for a hike, could see myself hiking here on a daily basis.
It's all good.  Well maintained trail, beautiful scenetic views, full facility.
