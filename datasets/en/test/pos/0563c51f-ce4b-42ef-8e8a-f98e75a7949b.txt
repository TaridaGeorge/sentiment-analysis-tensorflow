As a member of the Society for the Preservation of Sonoran Enchiladas, i was please to see that Mi Patio does justice to this elusive souther AZ delectable.  The green quesadilla is not your simple garnish of green chiles, but a fantastic dish in its own right.  Goo selection of Mexican beers,  and the $1.75 margs are hard to beat.  

Laid back place with friendly staff.  You can't go wrong here.
