Far and away the best place to work out in the Phoenix area.

Amazing steam room, full court basketball court with space behind the baskets and a high ceiling, state-of-the-art basketball court, friendly staff, and CLEAN.  Seriously, this is the cleanest gym I have ever been in.

Most of their classes are phenomenal, led by great teachers such as Alex Austin, who has a reputation as being the most popular yoga teacher in the valley.

And the locker room is huge, spacious, with all the amenities that you can imagine.  Including towel service.  And did I mention that it's CLEAN?

Lastly, the gym is built in an interesting way, with a nice cafe in the middle, that leads to a lot of social interaction.  There is a warmer and friendlier environment than in most other gyms I belong to.
