They say love hurts. I love FnB, and the place hurts me.

Trying it on the recommendation of many friends, we snuck into the counter on late notice to give it a try. We had to try the appetizers, right? Oh, and they were so good not a scrap survived.  Our main course - same problem.  Stuffed, whimpering, we saw them trot out the desserts. Oh no, no... but we had to try them, right?

Moaning, aching, we waddled out of FnB stuffed to the top with good F and B.  If our poor bellies survive, I hope they toughen up as we want to put them through the challenge again!
