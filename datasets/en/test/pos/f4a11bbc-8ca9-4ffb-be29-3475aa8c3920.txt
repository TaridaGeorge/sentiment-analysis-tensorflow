The sales people especially in women's handbags are extremely helpful and knowledgeable. It's always a fun shopping trip when you can talk to a sales person about different brands and not feel pressured to buy. 

I love how the sales representatives are really put together. You definitely get a different vibe from them compared to a store like H&M. 

Anytime there's a sale, my eyes almost pop out of my head because I want to buy everything in the store. But even sale prices are still too high personally. 

The store is very clean. They offer a separate valet service but I don't mind parking my own car.
