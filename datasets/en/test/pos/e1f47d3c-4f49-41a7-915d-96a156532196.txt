I'm no expert, but I'm pretty sure you will need that 99¢ pregnancy test to go along with your 99¢ condoms.  

I think the 99¢ Only Store is one of the best values in town.  Unlike other dollar stores, this chain has fresh produce and refrigerated foods.  And enough cheap junk food to get you ready for your next sumo match.  They have potted plants, dishes, animal treats, car accessories and cleaning supplies.  They have everything.
  
Not everything is a super deal.  During my last visit, I've noticed that some of the national brands are downsizing their products and you can get a better value at the grocery store.  But I usually walk away happy knowing I've saved a couple bucks.
