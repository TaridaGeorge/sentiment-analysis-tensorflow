I do like the dill. The brocolli soup bread bowl got me through many a stoned afternoon in my ASU days, and I hope it's still as good!

Once I dropped the vegetarian bull, I started ordering sandwiches here and was always delighted by the quality of the meats and cheeses and the freshness of the bread. It gets incredibly crowded  as one might expect, but that's okay. It's totally worth it.
