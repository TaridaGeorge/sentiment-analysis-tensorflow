I love Sky Harbor.  The staff is friendly.  It's VERY Clean, plenty of dining/shopping options inside and out of security.  Security is INCREDIBLY fast considering sometimes the flow of traffic can be rather substantial.  There's always employees around to assist and they do so with a smile. An airport cannot be any better than this.  You can only pray to be as good.
