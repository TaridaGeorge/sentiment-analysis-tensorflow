My daughter and I are gluten free diets, and even though we both love Asian food, it is generally hazardous for us.  Tott's has been one of our safe havens in this area.  The manager is very willing to accommodate our needs, such as cooking without soy sauce.  For those who are highly sensitive, there will be likely be cross-contamination, but we have been eating there for years and feel that we have been far safer here than with Pei Wei, who has a gf menu.
