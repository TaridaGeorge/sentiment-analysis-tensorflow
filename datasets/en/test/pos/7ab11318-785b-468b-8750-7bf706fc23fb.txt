Oatmeal & Chocolate Chip Chippers
Black and White Chocolate Chippers

That's all I want and LOVE from this place.

I've had their sandwiches before but I wasn't too impressed. Something that I can make at home. Their baked goods are to die for though. Definitely drop by a Paradise somewhere in the Phoenix area and get their chippers.
