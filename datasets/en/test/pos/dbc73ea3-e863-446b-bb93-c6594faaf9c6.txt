I'm a BIG Joe's fan.  They have some really great products that I just can't live without.

A few items:

Kauai Coffee
Tzaziki Sauce
Hummus (any variety -- they're all good -- but I highly suggest the Cilantro Jalapeno)
Multi-Grain Tortilla chips
Peach Salsa (holy mother of God, I could just drink the stuff)
Thai Green Beans -- a new find for me, and it makes my tummy smile

The people that work there are always very helpful, and it's just a happy place to shop.  You always have a smile on your face when you leave Joe's!
