OK - This is the first "Oriental Supermarket" I've ever frequented, so I don't really know that it's a 5 star location in the universe of Oriental Markets - but - the place has never disappointed. Given any recipe for Chinese or Japanese dishes, I have always been able to find exactly what I was looking for at Lee Lee. In addition, they have an excellent selection of Sake, Japanese and Chinese  beers as well as the largest selection of fish I've seen in the east Valley.
