Two words: Espresso Martini 

a few sips and all my stress melted away.. along with a few inhibitions. 

I came here for a beverage and a dessert and was immediately enveloped by the warm atmosphere. All the servers are super sweet, young, and just great. I was worried that this place would give off a snobby-scottsdale vibe but was pleasantly surprised with the warmth I received from everyone. 

I indulged in the phenomenal Beignet dessert and soaked up the beautiful, classy, upscale, and relaxing environment. 

I highly recommend this place for an intimate evening with a loved one. The romantic lighting and delicious cocktails are truly the remedy to a long day.

I'll be returning, very soon.
