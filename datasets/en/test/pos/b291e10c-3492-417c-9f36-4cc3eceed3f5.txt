I've been going to Dayna for over 7 years for my back and eyebrow waxing needs.  She offers excellent service at fair prices and doesn't make me cry in pain every time the wax is ripped off.  She is the only one I trust to rip hot wax off my back and I will continue to visit her a few times a year for forever.
