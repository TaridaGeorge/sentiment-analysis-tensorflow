Recently moving back from the Land of Corporate Coffee Shops (California) i found myself looking for apartments that were close to the Xtreme Bean. yes i like this place that much! 
 free Wifi, Live Music, Cool outdoor seating, Plenty of inside seating (Compared to Starbucks) Pleasant workers, Hannah and Lauren are pretty cool people.
 Great place to chill with the laptop or just to meet friends... i have also made some new friends there.
