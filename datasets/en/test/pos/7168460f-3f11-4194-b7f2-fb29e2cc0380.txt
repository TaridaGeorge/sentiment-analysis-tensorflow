Absolutely THE BEST iced coffee.  The coffee is fantastic and the ice they use (it's like pebbles of ice and it takes a long time to melt, so your drink is super cold) really makes this the best cup of iced coffee in the area.  The blended drinks are so much better than any those sugar-coma frappuccinos that Starbucks serves.  

Free Wifi, great outdoor seating area, and friendly staff.  As good as it gets.
