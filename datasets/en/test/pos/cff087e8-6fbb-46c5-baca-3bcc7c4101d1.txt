Came as part of a large wedding party and the service was outstanding!  We were given a private room with just enough space for the entire party.  Service, though slow because of the size of our party, was prompt and polite.   The food was excellent and the two servers made sure we had enough drinks, salad, and breadsticks.   After the great experience, I would certainly consider this Olive Garden for a function of my own.
