This is a nice large shop with wide open spaces.  Too many cigar shops are small and packed these days.  There is a smoking room as well as space to smoke in the general shop area.  The humidor is very big and very well stocked with a wide range of selections.  While you pay the usual cigar shop price compared to online savings, the prices were reasonable and in line with being a retail shop.  Accessory prices are reasonable.  The staff is helpful and friendly.
