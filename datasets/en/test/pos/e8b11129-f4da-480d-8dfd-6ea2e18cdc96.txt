By far my most favorite sushi bar ever; beats out Ra & Kabuki. Their Happy Hour is the best; 3-7p Saturdays included! Their staff if great, although it seems they have a lot of new servers. They offer complimentary Miso soup which you rarely see anywhere else. LOVE their Vegas & Spicy Ninja rolls; great size/portions.
