I travel to PHX for business and this is my place to unwind and have some great food.  Came here twice and loved it.  I actually finished a whole bottle of wine with a co-worker once and that wine was DELISH.  

The only downfall to this place is that it's a little pricey (as in LA or SF pricey) -- a small sandwich was $10.  It was a little shocking since I was expecting PHX to be slightly cheaper than those areas.

Other than that, a great date place or a place to chill with co-workers.
