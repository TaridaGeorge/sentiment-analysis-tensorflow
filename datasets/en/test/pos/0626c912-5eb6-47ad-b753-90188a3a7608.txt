Could not ask for better!!  John N. was simply great.  I was in a pinch and needed to move some appliances the next day, and he was a able to get me scheduled.  He had all the needed equipment (truck w/ rails, blankets, dollys, etc).  John's is strong guy too, and is able to handle all the heavy stuff well.  Friendly and his PRICES WERE UNBEATABLE!  So, go ahead and send him your business!!  You'll be happy you did.
