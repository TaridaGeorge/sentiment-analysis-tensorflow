Had read some great reviews on here before trying it out myself. It's location is what I had looked for, because its not too far from Central and quite easily accessible by bus (yea, I ride it). 
Being it was my first time I definitely got to take advantage of the first time price, which is a GREAT deal! But I ended up having her do more while I was there so I ended up paying for the actual cost of the Brazilian (why I went there). 
I was penciled in with Amy and she was great. All the staff was very friendly and easy to have a conversation with. Amy was very gentle and I would definitely head back there.
