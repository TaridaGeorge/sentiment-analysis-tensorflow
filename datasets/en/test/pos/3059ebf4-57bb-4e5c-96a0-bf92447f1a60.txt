The employees are for the most part very friendly, and right now they've got some sweet deals going on for candy.  2 sodas, 2 candies, and a popcorn for $5, or 1 soda, 1 candy, and 1 popcorn for $3.  Plus they give out free gift cards for pre-ordering movies and games.  

They also have a new thing called Direct Access, where if there's a movie or game title that they don't have in the store, they can have it mailed to you within 2-3 business days for the same price as renting it in the store.  You can mail it back when you're done, or bring it back to the store for $3 off a movie rental or $4 off a game rental.  Sweeeet.
