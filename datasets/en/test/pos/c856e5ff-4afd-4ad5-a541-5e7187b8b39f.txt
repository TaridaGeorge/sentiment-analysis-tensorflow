Hubby and I were invited to join a friend for a seafood grilling class and wine tasting, what better way to spend an early Saturday afternoon? 

It was an intimate setting, three or four tables of people, everyone was friendly and interested in learning some new techniques. The chef was knowledgeable and made some excellent grilled fish and veggies. The waiter was also well-educated when he spoke about the wines. 

I hope they have another class soon on how to grill the best steak!
