Great museum for kids and family's. Took my son here for his 5th birthday so he could see dinosaurs and we all loved it. 
Has something for everyone. Has all the dinos for the kids and adults, the gemstones and meteroites. Also loved panning for gold and the mining and jail tour.
Prices are good and are even better with the culture pass from the library. 
I'm sure we will be back !
