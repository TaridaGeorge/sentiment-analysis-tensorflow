After returning to NM from a weekend at the Camelback Inn, I am missing it already! 

This bar was awesome- a huge open outdoor space with live music and immpeccable service. The first night we had some of their great happy hour- $4 maragaritas and queso fundido. Then the next day we came back and had some more great apps- all under $6! The filet mignon sliders and the guacamole were the favorite of our group of 4. 

When we first arrived at The Camelback Inn we were considering going out for drinks/dinner and we ended up staying right where we were- why leave?
