I hadn't had pizza in almost three months when I got to try Mamma Mia's last night at the Yelp In Bloom event.  The mini slices of pizza that I sampled were absolutely delicious!  I know I will be making the trek to Phoenix to have a bigger portion in the near future!  Also, the staff present at the event handing out pizza and pasta were extremely friendly and efficient.  My boyfriend also sampled their pasta and said it was delicious!  Well done!
