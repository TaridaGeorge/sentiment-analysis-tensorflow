We had our wedding there in October.  Blackstone Country Club definitely exceeded our expectations.  Emily took over coordinating and was absolutely excellent.  Everything we ever wanted was done, and the staff made our day so special and go so smoothly.  Every staff member was courteous and really went out of the way to make the day beautiful.  The site was amazing and our guests are still raving about the food.  We were a little bummed at first to use onsight bakery, but were definitely very happy with the cake.  Not only was it delicious, but so beautiful.  We could not have asked for anything more, we had a dream wedding.  Highly recommend!!
