This is like the Trader Joe's of beer.  Every type of alcoholic beverage you can imagine at very affordable prices. The best value in my book. The thing about Bevmo, is that their staff is very helpful about the different types of wines, beers and liquors. I also get my beer kegs from this spot, whether its Blue Moon, New Castle, Guiness, Coors. They also helped me carry it out to my car, very friendly! So if you're looking to party with some friends, wine to dine or just to lounge, there's no other place I'd go.
