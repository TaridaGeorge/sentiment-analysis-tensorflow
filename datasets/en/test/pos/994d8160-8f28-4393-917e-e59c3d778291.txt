I don't know why people are saying negative things about the customer service here, because they have always been outstanding with me. They always carry out the dog food and put it in my car for me. They always help me find whatever I need. I appreciate how knowledgeable they are about dog food. When Proctor and Gamble purchased Innova, they let me know so that I could make an informed decision about what to feed my dogs. I now buy Orijen at this store and couldn't be happier. They even have Scottsdale Strays doing doggie adoptions outside on the weekend and I adopted my little dog Lucy from them. Yes, it's a little on the pricey side, but I am always willing to spend more for good quality food, whether it's for me or for my four-legged friends.
