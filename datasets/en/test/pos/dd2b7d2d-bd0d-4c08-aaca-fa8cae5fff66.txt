Perfect ambiance. Friendly, personal service from owners and staff. And the food: the appetizers, salads, and pizzas are outstanding!! Their pizza would stack up to -- or best -- any of the admirable, better-known pizza purveyors in Greater Phoenix (a tall order, indeed)! And you can't beat the prices, which I found to be LOW, given the high quality of the product delivered.

It is with great reticence that I post this review, as, selfishly, I would like to keep this place a secret. But, alas, the owners and their stellar establishment deserve the 5 stars, and the high accolade!!
