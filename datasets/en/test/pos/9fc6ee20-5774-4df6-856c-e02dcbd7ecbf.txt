So this review is a little tardy as we dined at Marcellino's for New Years ... it was spectacular.  The service is top notch, friendly and professional, knowledgeable and prompt - the food was simple and delightfully tasty. 

Must admit I am a long time fan, though I don't go as often as I might like as a night out there will set you back a few dimes.  What I relish is the fresh, simple taste of dishes prepared with intention and care - easily the best Italian in Phoenix.  I also love to be greeted and schmoozed by the stunning Sima who always makes you feel welcomed back like an old friend.

I'm going to get back here again soon as every time I dine here I think, why did I wait so long.
