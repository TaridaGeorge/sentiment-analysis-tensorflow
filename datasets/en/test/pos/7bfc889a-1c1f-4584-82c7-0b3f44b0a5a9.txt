I've eaten sushi all over the country, taken classes in how to make sushi, and my aunt and uncle own a company that sells salmon for sushi, mostly to Japan - and Dozo is still my favorite place to get sushi.  The chef is VERY friendly and puts together some amazing flavor profiles.  I only wish they were on the coast, since they (like every other sushi place inland) have to get their fish from one of two suppliers.  Still, I've never had any problem with the quality of the ingredients, and Dozo far surpasses any of the experiences I've had elsewhere in Scottsdale (Stingray, ugh).

Try the sushi pizza, trust me.  I will the next time I'm in town.
