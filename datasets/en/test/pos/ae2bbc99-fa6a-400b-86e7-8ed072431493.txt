If I'm in the mood for a fancy burger, this is where I go.  Parking is hard to come by, but its always worth it!  I usually get the Delux burger & sweet potato fries.  LOVE them both, especially with the aoili sauce.  Their aoili has a kick to it so I usually put it on my burger too.   Great for lunch, tons of beer on tap for dinner/happy hour. 

Its worth mentioning that this restaurant is on the small side.  There's also quite a bit of bar seating.  With one (maybe two) long tables through the middle of the restaurant sometimes you sit right next to another party.  Its not a deal breaker, but if you're looking to have a personal or intimate conversation bet sure to get a table.
