Maybe I gave this one too many stars because nothing compares with Houston's Grand Opera, but the Arizona Opera is still good and definitely worth seeing.

Hint:  If you come at 6 pm instead of when it starts at 7 pm you can hear a talk about the opera, which will help you understand it better if you're a newbie!  Cool, huh?

Regardless, you're either going to just love opera or hate it.  I'm a lover = season tickets which includes the price of the parking garage at $8 (compared to $10 at the local garages).  I think the total bill ran $130 or $150.  So worth it if you are one of the opera lovers!
