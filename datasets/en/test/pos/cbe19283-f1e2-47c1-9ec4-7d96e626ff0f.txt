Spot on breakfast.  UNDER-rated!  Once again Phoenix Yelpers playing their tired entitled lines, based on Chili's and Applebee palates.  Check this place out.  We tried the Open Road combo, French toast, cinnamon roll, and chorizo scramble.  All were delicious.  Bacon was perfect, eggs were on point, and the breakfast combo comes with a beverage (nice).  Seasoning was just right, in contrast to the myriad of salt lick joints in downtown Scottsdale.  Service was friendly, perhaps a bit under-caffeinated.  Without a doubt we'll be back.
