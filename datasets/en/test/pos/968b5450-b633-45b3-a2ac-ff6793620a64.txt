OK. YUM. Just ate here the other night and it was fantastic. Loved the ambiance for a strip mall - dark and intimate. Loved the tapas selection - we ate the green beans for an appetizer and they were really, really good. We both had two kinds of sushi and loved each of them. I'm coming here again, when my wallet is full. It was a bit pricey, but we knew that going in. I plan on getting sushi again and trying another couple rolls. The only annoying thing is that there's no explanation of the rolls anywhere, so you have to ask about each one if you're curious about ingredients. I'd recommend this place!
