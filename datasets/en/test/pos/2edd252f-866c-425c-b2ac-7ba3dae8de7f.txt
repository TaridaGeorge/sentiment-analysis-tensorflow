Visited SaBai for the first time tonight after searching for a Thai restaurant while in Phoenix on a business trip. Couldn't have been happier with the decision! Portions were huge (we could have skipped the delicious Satay starter, but I'm glad we didn't) and we ended up with enough left for lunch tomorrow. The short ribs I chose were amazing, so tender they fell apart at the touch of the fork, and the avocado chicken curry my wife selected was even better. Hope to make it back before we leave town!
