This review is for Myra, I've been going to Myra since I was 14 years old, I'm now 24. She has never raised her price- I've always paid the same thing! She does AWESOME color, I get all over platinum blonde highlights and they are great! She has done my hair for numerous dances, events, and even my wedding and I always love it and am so happy! She is the sweetest thing, so funny, kind, and nice. I love talking to her and look forward to going so we can catch up! She is so great- over the years I've gotten my mom, sister, friend, her mom, her sister in law, and numerous people my mom work with to go there and everyone LOVES her. She is so great, if you go to Choices, you have to ask for Myra! :)
