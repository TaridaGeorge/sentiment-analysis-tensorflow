Best Mexican food in town. I would live here if I could. Mole is outstanding, salsas are incredible, and the made to order thin chips!!! Enchiladas are unparalleled. Been owned by the same family for over 50 years, they must be doing something right. Friendly service, especially if you frequent a lot. I love,love,love Rositas!!
