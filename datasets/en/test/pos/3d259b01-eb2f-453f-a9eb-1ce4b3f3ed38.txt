This is a fantastic Lowe's location. It's big & new so the aisles are big, light, and there are tons of different products. I find Lowe's to be better organized than Home Depot in general, so that's a good thing. This location has a good sized garden center. Customer service has always been great. We went the weekend after Thanksgiving, expecting a mad and messy place, but it wasn't crowded and everything was organized and in its place.

The paint section carries Valspar & Olympic, but they are able to mix Benjamin Moore paints without requiring a paint swatch to match (their computer database has a bunch saved).

The only negative is that their christmas tree lot is awful. The trees don't look great and they only had Noble Firs, not any Douglas Firs. No one was even out there when we went and it's poorly lit.
