What a fantastic job Matt & Ernie Pool with this new place.

A fantastic new bar for downtown folks. Great food, (try the Grilled cheese and Tomato soup) and a great beer and wine selection.

Deluxe people in a deluxe setting... My fondness for the Roosevelt is only equalled by the brevity of this review.
