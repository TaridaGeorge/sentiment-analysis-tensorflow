I really like this movie theatre - it's in a great location inside of Tempe Marketplace, it's nice and clean, and they have a good number of movies playing at once.  The Harkins loyalty cup is great too, buy it once for $5 or so and get unlimited $1 refills for an entire year.  Great marketing tool and I love that you can bring a reusable cup.
