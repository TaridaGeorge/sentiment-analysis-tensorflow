The service is outstanding!

The food is mouthwatering!

He usually has the ribs...I usually have the prime rib, both are delicious. I love how the corn is served, slices of the corn cob with tasty bites of corn left to nibble. The corn bread is a good as a dessert...sweet with kernels of corn within.  We have made it to dessert once. The sub zero banana cream pie is divine. The portions are huge and there are always leftovers to take home....plus the extra little treat they give each customer!

One of these days we'll try something else on the menu, but for now....we love ordering the same meal each time.
