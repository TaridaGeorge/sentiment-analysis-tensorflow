While in town I was told to go to Breakfast place on Sunday morning where I could get a Chicago caliber brunch. I was sent to a place on super busy Scottsdale rd where I had to wait outside in the AZ heat in what I named the "Hangover Pen". I waited as long as I could stand before I had to whip out the Android and look for another suggestion. I was directed to Orange just around the corner in the art plaza. What a relief, i t was calm and peaceful over there and despite being busy I was seated very quickly. After finishing my Green Flannel, I was sold. I don't give a lot of 5 star reviews but this place just did it for me. Im in AZ all the time and now have my new spot.
