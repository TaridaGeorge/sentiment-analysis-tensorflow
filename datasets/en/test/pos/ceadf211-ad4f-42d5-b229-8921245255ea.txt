When I stop in here after months of being away, I always feel like I'm visiting family or old friends instead of just a store..  And I love seeing what merchandise she's gotten in that's new and different.  I even signed up for a class on Mon 4/20 since I was still in town. We made the most beautiful cards.  It took us nearly 4 hours and we had a lot of fun.  I love cardmaking!
