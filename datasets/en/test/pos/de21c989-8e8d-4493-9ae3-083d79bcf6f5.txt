This place is not overpriced.  I thought it was priced very appropriately.  

AMAZING food!  I was so excited to see what Chef Nobuo was all about since I hadn't been to Sea Saw.  

We had the Teeter Tots, Grapefruit and Hamachi (almost ordered a 2nd serving of it), Ebi Salad, Pork Belly buns, and the grilled lamb.  All were wonderful!   That with a bottle of wine and a dessert----was around $125.  Not bad for a special night out! 

Can't wait to eat here again.
