I just tried this GC location after putting up with the insensitive folks at the Chapparel GC for several years, and am very happy that I made the change!  I arrived, was taken care of promptly by a very energetic, friendly, professional young lady, Colleen, and she did a terrific job!  I'll go back many times and recommend this shop, and Colleen in particular to anyone who asks!
