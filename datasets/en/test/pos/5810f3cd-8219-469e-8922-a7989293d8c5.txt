These are the real pro's - serious mechanics.  They are not cheap but they do exceptionally good work and they are very honest.  I always take my cars there and I recommend them to everyone.  

These folks have never tried to snow me of over sell anything.  The repairs are always "solid".  They also guarantee their work like no other shop I have ever been to.  I don't want to overstate anything so please do call them and find out for yourself, but my experiences with them have been exceptional.
