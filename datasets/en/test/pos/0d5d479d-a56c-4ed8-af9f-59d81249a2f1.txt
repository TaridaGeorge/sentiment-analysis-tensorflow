Some Catholic churches feel judgmental from the second you walk in the door, while others have no sense of community.  Neither of these things is true about the Franciscan Renewal Center.  My husband and I chose to join and get married at the Franciscan Renewal Center, because they made us feel welcomed.  Sunday mass never felt like an obligation.  Plus, the grounds are beautiful.  If you are looking for a new church or just a peaceful place to think about life, the Franciscan Renewal Center is a great place to visit.
