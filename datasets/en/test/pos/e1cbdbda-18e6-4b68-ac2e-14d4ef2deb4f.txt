Tried this place based on Yelp and it did not steer me wrong. I went with a group of 6-7 guys last week and we all loved this place. It was delicious, very well-priced, fast, and the service was outstanding. The woman behind the counter is a machine and she's one of the best servicewomen I've ever had. I got the trio with a brisket sandwich, chopped chix, and the pulled pork with fries. All of it was awesome! I think I loved the chicken the best but I'm going back this weekend to try the ribs and other stuff. I'm upset I didn't find out about this place sooner. I love these restaurants that are popping up. Fast, but not fast food, just delicious food in a very simple setting. Go here now!
