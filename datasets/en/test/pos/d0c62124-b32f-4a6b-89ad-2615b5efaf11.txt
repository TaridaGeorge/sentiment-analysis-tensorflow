First off Lindsay and both Mikes, Coldstone measures All their toppings, in EVERY store. It's impossible to get just 2-3 gummie bears.
This store is no different than any other. Work at Coldstone and see for yourself. I worked at Coldstone and they are very Anal about toppings, exact measurements, cleanliness of the store and Value. Sounds like a few bitter people on here....
