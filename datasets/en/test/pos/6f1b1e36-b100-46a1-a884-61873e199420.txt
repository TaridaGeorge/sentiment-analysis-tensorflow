Had a great lunch here today. We arrived at 10:45am, and they were kind enough to seat us before the kitchen opened at 11:00am.

The service was very good, decor top notch, and the prices very reasonable for the quality of the food. One of the best French Dip Sandwiches I have ever had. The menu is very simple with just a few choices... I have noticed that places who try to serve every dish for every taste only do so half-ass.

Really nice outdoor patio too!
