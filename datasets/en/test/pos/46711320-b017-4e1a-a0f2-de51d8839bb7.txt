Love, love, love this place! It's alway fresh and tasty. They have a pretty phenominal happy hour, half off your entire bill everyday of the week. That what I'm talkin about. Very friendly servers. Also they have gluten free options:) I love the sweet potato tots and and the ahi salad. My husband says they have the best pulled pork ever. I will continue to go back!
