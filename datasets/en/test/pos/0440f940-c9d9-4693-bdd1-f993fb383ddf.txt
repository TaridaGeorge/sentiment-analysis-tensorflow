Don't get two scoops!

One scoop is all you need - especially if you get it in a cone.  

I had some delicious coffee-flavored thing and my husband had something vanilla-y with chocolate bits.  

The location is great, the decor is a bit much, but fun, and the ice cream is pretty darn good.

Hooray.  An ice cream shop in the neighborhood.
