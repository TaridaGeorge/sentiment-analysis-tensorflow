the fun of building your own sushi, without the hassle of cutting those tiny strips of cucumber & then #$%(ing up your roll b/c you don't have a sharp enough knife to cut it! or maybe that's just me?

at any rate, had a great experience with the kiddos & sis tonight. we all got our own rolls made just the way we like them :)  ok amount of veggie options, bummer the miso is made with tuna broth (WTF?). but as I vegan I had no problem finding plenty to fill my belly.

there have already been many comparisons to Chipotle & Subway- yes, it is true! 

dinner for all 5 of us, including cucumber salad, seaweed salad & edamame, was about $40!
