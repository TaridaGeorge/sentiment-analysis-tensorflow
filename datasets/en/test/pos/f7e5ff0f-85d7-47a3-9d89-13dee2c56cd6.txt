Went here on st. patty's day after a spring training game. Excellent service, our bartender was really friendly/ helpful guy.  Had my favorite beer: dogfish head 90 minute which made me ecstatic since I haven't had it in a while.  We ordered the brie cheese, candied panchetta, and heirloom tomato bruschetta...must say, up there in the top five best things i've ever eaten.  The outdoor patio is badass
