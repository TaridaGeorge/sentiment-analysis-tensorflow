I think I've been here 3 times already and just never got around to writing a review.  My wife found this place through Yelp, so we decided to give it a try.  The first time I had sea salt caramel and dark chocolate.  To this day that combo is still my favorite.  The other times I've visited I tried the mango, pineapple, and kiwi sorbets.  I loved all 3 of those as well especially the kiwi.  This is our family's go-to dessert spot whenever we feel like some gelato.  It's about 10 minutes away, so it's not from us at all.
