I'm a "90-10" vegetarian, and I gotta say...I LOVE THIS PLACE! Healthy, delicious, Mediterranean-style food cooked to perfection and my favorite veg restaurant to go to.

Service is always fantastic. Even the less healthy dishes, such as hummus and the cheese crisp, are cooked to lighter, healthier perfection without sacrificing flavor. Warning: this place LOVES to put onions on dang-near everything, so be cautious of that. Kinda hipstery, but nonetheless a lovely place to go and chat.
