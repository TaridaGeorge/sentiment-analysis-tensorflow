This quaint little order at the counter restaurant is one of my favorites!  They always give fast service and really great food.  There's usually someplace cozy to sit - indoors or out.  

I LOVE their yogurt parfait!!!  They serve up an awesome grilled cheese and tomato soup.  Their salads are great!  They also have great coffee (ICED especially!)  and bev selection.  

If you're in Kirland and are looking for someplace to eat that's quick, this is the place.  Has Fox Restaurants ever screwed up with any of their projects?  I love them all!
