My husband and I frequent farmers markets around the Phoenix area and this one holds it own. It has adequate parking and vendors in the surpluse. From veggies to kale chips to fresh breads the amount of items offered are awesome. If your looking for a way to enjoy your Saturday morning swing by, try something new, talk to someone who can educate you on their fresh food and simply embrace the farmers culture. Enjoying fresh harvest from locals is the best way to nourish your mind and soul. Bring cash otherwise they offer a token system based off your debit card. Also bring some sort of reusable bag to store all your goodies in as you walk around otherwise your hands will be full. Enjoy.
