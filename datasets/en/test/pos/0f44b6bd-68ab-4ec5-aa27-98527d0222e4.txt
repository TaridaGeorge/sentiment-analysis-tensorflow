This restaurant has been a fixture on Main street Scottsdale for as long as I can remember.  If you like kicked back casual dining, excellent food and good value this is the place.  The staff is always friendly and service has always been good even on busy nights.  Don't expect fancy... just a nice time.  Try the Pla,
