This is how it goes each and every time I go to Liberty Market. Note to self: SAVE ROOM FOR DESERT. Honey can I try some of yours..... just a bite..... as I start my way through the white wood fired pizza, oh what did you get? Can I try some? I wish they had a sample platter of EVERYTHING....OK save room.....yummmmm...did I just eat that entire pizza? Yep! Oh I'll take a slice of the red velvet cake......... can you put that to go?........... Honey where's your fork?
