This is my favorite LBS (local bike shop). I shop here for everything. Me and Domenic's go way back. They've always given me great service and I really like everybody who works there. They're very, very polite and carry a great selection of parts. 

The best example I can give of how cool they've been with me was when I was buying my Surly Cross Check. I could have just ordered a stock complete and been fine but that's just not me. I had to hand pick every part so that it'd be exactly what I want. More than willing to accomodate, Jason (literally the world's nicest guy), stayed 30 minutes after he closed to go through the whole build with me and order all the parts. 

Anyway, Domenic's is great. I just wish they still had that Mill Ave. location open.
