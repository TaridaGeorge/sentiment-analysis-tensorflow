Matt's (of Matt's Big Breakfast) new bar.  Located in a cozy vintage home, this is my new favorite bar.  Handpicked beer and wine selection make this an excellent destination for downtown snobs (not rippin, I tend to be one of those)  Best of all, Matt has jumped on the smoking ban before it even takes effect, this means you can enjoy your beer without having to breathe in all that nasty ass poison you smokers keep pumping into the air.  Seriously, Lesley and I went to a dinner party recently filled with smokers, in a non ventilated home.  Jesus, God, how do you people stand it?!?  Smoking is gross, The Roosevelt is cool.
