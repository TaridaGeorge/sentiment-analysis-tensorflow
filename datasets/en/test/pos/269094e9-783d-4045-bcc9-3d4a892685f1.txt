RHR is perfect! A cute little vinyl shop with something for everybody. I never leave empty-handed.

If you have someone hard to shop for, this is a great place to buy some unique/cute gifts that will definitely get a smile. Figurines & plushes, little toys & trinkets, artwork, clothing, and cards to boot. My favorite item has to be the stuffed mustache with a mustache that I bought my boyfriend about a year ago or my stuffed anatomical heart sporting a smile (ala I Heart Guts).

I'm melting!
