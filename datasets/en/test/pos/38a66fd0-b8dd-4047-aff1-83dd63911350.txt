My family loves coming here!  I have also come for lunch with friends and brought out of town guests here for several meals.

It is pretty upscale and the service is always stellar.  My husband likes to order a couple of baskets of the delicious croissants to start.  They are light and flaky and my kids can't get enough!

He usually gets baked potato soup and the French Dip sandwich.  My kids like that as well, but will sometimes order the chicken strips.  I  highly reccomend the Champagne Chicken Salad.  It is the best!! I have also tried the chicken and bbq ribs and that has been outstanding as well.  The last time I was there I ordered the Grilled Salmon with glazed carrots.  I will never order anything ever again.  This was my favorite meal there, hands down!

Charleston's is a restaurant that we all enjoy!
