If I lived in AZ I would be a repeat offender for sure!
Thanks to YELP :) I found this amazing gem!
Came here for dinner otw to the airport to fly back to Las Vegas.
I ordered to bulgogi and kalbi!
I'm in love! Delicious!!!!
Would love to come back and try their tofu soup.
If you're in AZ and looking for fantastic Korean food! Chodang is worth the visit!
Good quality food, about $20 a person.
I'm a fan!
