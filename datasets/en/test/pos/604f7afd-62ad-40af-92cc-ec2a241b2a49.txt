I wish there was a way to give more than 5 stars.   I went back in for my second appointment and got color, highlights and Keragreen treatment.

I love love love my color and highlights.  I am also very pleased with the Keragreen treatment.   My hair feels so soft and silky. 

I absolutely love this place and Heather is awesome.
