Dr. Barnes was thorough, kind, and took his time with us. He was knowledgable and our Golden Retriever (the best judge of character) loved him! I was very impressed with the entire staff at Del Lago. I have been looking for a permanent vet for 2 years now and today I found exactly what I've been looking for! Thank you Del Lago!
