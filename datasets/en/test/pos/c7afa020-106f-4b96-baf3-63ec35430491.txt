The best Thai food I have found in the East Valley!  Great staff, great decor and atmosphere, very reasonable prices, convenient, and fast service.  The spices and textures of their food is just right.  Lots to choose from and has good lunch specials too.  All the hip Thai places I've been to in Tempe and Gilbert don't compare.  My favorite is the Mamuang Himapan (#25) and the Tohm Kah soup which has a really cool presentation too!  Would suggest for dates, family night, special occasion, anything.  Love Thai Rama in Chandler all around!
