I LOVE this place.

They have some of the best gummy bears around. I havent tried one of their oversized ones yet, but I throughly enjoy their normal sized ones.

Another awesome thing about this place? They sell a bunch of candy that I grew up eating. Clark bars, Big League Chew, every flavor of Pop Rocks imaginable, Pixi Stix (make you own, and theyre HUGE....thats what she said) just to name a few. They also have a bunch of fun candy themed gifts. Hershey products (lip gloss, pillows, etc), jars of Reeses peanut butter, bacon flavored gifts, Star Wars stuff, Mustache gifts, huge Rice Krispie treats/ boxes of Nerds/ tubes of Sweettarts.... I could go on but its just making me hungry!

Highly recommended for the 10 year old kid in all of us.
