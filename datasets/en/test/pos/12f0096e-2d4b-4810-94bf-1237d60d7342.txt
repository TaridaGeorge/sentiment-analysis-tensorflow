I have to agree, as so many others have said, it is one of the best sushi places in Phoenix area. 

It is a small intimate hole in the wall place with very friendly and personal staff. It's rather authentic especially compared to the many other fusion spots nearby. And their food is great! Thus far, I've tried a handful of their rolls, sushi, appetizers, and noodles. The fish is fairly fresh, the food well presented and authentic. Particularly liked their okinawa soba. The food isn't cheap, but the price is more than reasonable given the quality and portions. Typical dinner for us $20-30/person
