Delicious chicken fingers and awesome service! I ordered a 50 finger party platter for a work party and everyone raved about them. It's really good quality chicken and  the dipping sauces are delicious - we got special, ranch, honey mustard and buffalo.  They also made us the platter last minute and it was very affordable.
