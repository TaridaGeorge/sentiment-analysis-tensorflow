Went for lunch.  It's still within two months of opening and it's doing well from the size of the crowd.  Parking is a bit of a challenge and you may have to park across the street (or in Amigo's Appliances lot as I did...not suggested).  

The atmosphere is a nice change from most Pho places.  It has a modern, slightly contemporary feel to it with all the amenities of a social meeting locale (good bar, few small TV's in the corners above the bar).  Walls are exposed brick and it has the now required community table.

Had the Pho and it was outstanding.  Tough to find good Pho generally in Phoenix but their's is impressive.  Fun, upbeat staff.

Only hit was that it did take a little time to get the food but nothing too lengthy.

Try it out!
