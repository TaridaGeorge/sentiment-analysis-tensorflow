So you hate grocery shopping?  Especially when you decide at the last minute to have 6 or 30 friends over.  Well, here's the place that will change all that.  A great little store.  You can find anything you are looking for in this store and a few things you didn't even know existed. Their deli, sushi, and wine choices will make any event you plan (or didn't plan!) rock your world . . . and the best part is you don't have to do a darn thing.  Just head to AJ's and you can make a party in 15 minutes!  Service is something else.  I should be taking away one star for the parking at the Lincoln Avenue store - - you may have to circle the lot a couple of times to get a spot.  But everything else is sooooo over the top!
