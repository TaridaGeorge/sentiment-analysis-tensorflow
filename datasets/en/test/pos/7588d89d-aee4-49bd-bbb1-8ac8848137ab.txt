No cookie crumbs or candy dust here.  It looks like they pretty much cut them in half and call it good.

I had Snickers, Reese's, Butterfinger, and Nestle Crunch.  And about half a brownie.  I'm assuming the yogurt was fine, but it was hard to tell.  I'm pretty sure I had about 39 cents of yogurt in my $6 cup.

5 stars for toppings, cleanliness, and friendliness!
