Rolf and Chris of framers workshop provide a transcendental service:   They
transform and elevate art into finished and focused pieces to be treasured as a legacy.   The
technique, expertise, and discernment exhibited by their matting and framework
Never ceases to astonish the eye.   I just
Had a complex pastel on paper framed
With extraordinary results.   Rolf even
Framed a painted car muffler for me on
Oak plinth with plexiglass a few years ago.   If you would like to experience
the pinnacle of the art of framing, come
to Framer's Workshop!
