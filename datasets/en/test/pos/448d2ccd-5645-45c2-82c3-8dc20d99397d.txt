I discovered this place about 3 years ago and I've been coming back ever since. I love the little old man who is usually there to take your order, he is so happy and positive, and because of that I always leave a tip. I eat in and take out often. My favorite is the teriyaki chicken and house rice!! The house rice is the best I've ever had, I don't know what they do, but it's amazing!!
