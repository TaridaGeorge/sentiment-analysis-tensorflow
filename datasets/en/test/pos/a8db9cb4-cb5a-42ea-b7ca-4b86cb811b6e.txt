LOVE it.. great concept by Dr. Weil & awesome Sam Fox.. clean good food.. organic, veg, and vegan..yet meat on the menu too.. everyone will be happy.. The waiter was a man of intellect on the menu and the concept..as it should be! Had the hummus...some of the best Ive had.. warm pita .. yum. I had the harvest salad.. with butternut squash.. seasonal and fresh from local farms.. Ive nothing to say in negative about True Food.. its just awesome!
