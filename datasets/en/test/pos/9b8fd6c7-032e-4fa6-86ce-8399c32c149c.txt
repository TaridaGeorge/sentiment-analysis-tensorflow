I ordered the "Assorted Vegetable" combo which came with brown rice, an egg roll, and two crab puffs.  It was ~ $6.00.  It was very good, and freshly prepared. The vegetables were crisp and well flavored.  I have ordered this on two separate occasions, and found the quality to be consistent both times.  I would recommend this restaurant if you are looking for decent Chinese take-out and are close to 19th ave and T-bird.
