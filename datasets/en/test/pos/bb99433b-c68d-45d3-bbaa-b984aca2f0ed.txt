After reading so many good reviews about this place, we went and checked out.   The buttermilk pie it's out of this world and the owner was super nice and super friendly. Besides buttermilk pie, we also ordered our daughter six birthday theme cake from here. The theme of the cake was "Rio": the decorations of the cake were outstanding.  Every detail it's so real just like from the movie.  The cake was super moist, the aroma its fresh bake cake, and every bite it's full of flavor. We can tell that Shelly's put a lot of efforts into this cake.   All of our guests were delighted and some even sneak it in their purse.   Keep up the good work Shelly and I'll see you soon!
