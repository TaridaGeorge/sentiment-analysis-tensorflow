went to the grind last night. I had the mushroom burger and it was amazing. My wife had the field green salad and she really enjoyed it. We went there with friends who had the Peppercorn burger and BLT burger. All the food was great. We ended it with mini fresh donuts made fresh at The Grind with caramel sauce. We will be going back very soon.
