I love it. We come at a busy night but the staff still enough for us not to wait long. We are seated and given a couple of water. The waitress is really nice. Since it is my first time, my friend order foods for us. Yes, the idea of organic food kind of but me in a mood "Healthy food - not taste good." But it amazing how the food taste. You can taste the texture and sweetness of the veges. I like the pizza the best. Taste different than normal pizza but still have the flavor in it. I definitely come back for this.
