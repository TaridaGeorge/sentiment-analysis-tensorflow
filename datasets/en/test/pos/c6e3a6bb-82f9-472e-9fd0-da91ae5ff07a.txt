Coming from LA where you could throw a penny and hit at least 10 different great Asian restaurants, Phoenix is the complete opposite. With little options for a great dining experience with delicious food, it's great that this place exists. Traditional Japanese ramen, Yakisoba and udon dishes. Great sushi rolls and more. And if Japanese is not your thing, then try their Italian dishes. This is a noodle shop, so of course you can't leave out Italian dishes. Their customer service is excellent too!
