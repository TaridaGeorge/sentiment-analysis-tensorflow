The hub deli is my new favorite sandwich place!!! I had the godmother and it was the Perfect combination of meat, condiments an bread( which I am told is made at a local bakery)! I cant wait to come back and try their home made meatballs and turkey Chilli!!! Thank you for making me a fan!! Oh and u get a free cookie!!!
