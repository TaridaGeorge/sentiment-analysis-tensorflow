I checked out Matt's barber shop back in january due to its close proximity to my  house and it only took that one sitting for me to decide that this would be the only place that I visit. As I am in the military, I have relied on Matt just about every other week and his cut has always impressed. Matt is incredibly proficient and personable, the atmosphere is comfortable and welcoming, and the prices are excellent ( low to be honest when you factor in the quality of service and consistency). Matt's hours cater to the business professional and is always accommodating with any of my time fluctuations.  I can't say enough about Matt's barber shop and highly recommend his services to everybody.
