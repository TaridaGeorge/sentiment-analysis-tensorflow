Amazing food in a very unexpected location. This place is one of the best I've eaten and I wish it was in my hometown! 

Everything we had was fabulous. I started with a cucumber infused vodka with ginger ale and lime. We all shared bacon wrapped homemade mozzerella (got a second order it was so good), crab/corn/prosciutto cakes, cuban sandwich, pasta, a totally custom deli sandwich, and a salmon dinner. Outstanding service, prices, portions, and presentation. Can't wait to go back.
