Best experience I've ever had at a salon. I absolutely loved everyone who worked there and even the other clients. Everyone was so friendly and I loved my cut and color too.

I don't tend to like the experience of getting my hair done. I'm always self conscious, I'm not sure why; it's just my silly brain being silly in one of its many ways. I often like the product of getting my hair cut, but I don't like the process.

I enjoyed the whole experience at PureSalon. They even gave me some cheese and crackers along with a glass of wine. Awesome! 

I'm totally going back. I think I'm in love.
