Thank-you Buybuy Baby, for having a well-educated staff, a great selection of baby gear and, a quiet, comfortable room that mothers can nurse in.  

True story... one day, my little guy was unusually fussy and I was getting a little stressed out because I was out, trying to run some much needed errands.  I was still shy on the idea of nursing in public but in my frazzled, stressed state, I somehow realized that I was close to this Buybuy Baby and hoped they would have a private area to nurse in.  They did!  They have a room set-up for a mother's comfort. The lowered lights and comfortable chairs really helped me de-stress and get back to a good day.  Thank-you so much!  I'm glad that I often use you as my go-to baby supply store!

See ya there!
