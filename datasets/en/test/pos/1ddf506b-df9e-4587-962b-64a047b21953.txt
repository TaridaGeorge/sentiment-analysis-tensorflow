I've been to Ticoz many times usually for happy hour. This is not a happy hour snack. Two tacos will fill you up completely and I think they are about $5 for two.  You can't beat the fish tacos and the sangria can be amazing. Sometimes the mix doesn't come out right but the staff is happy to try again until it tastes just right.
