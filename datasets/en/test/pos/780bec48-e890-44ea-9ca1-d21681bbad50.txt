New to the area, read the reviews and recognized a skunk when I read the crap posted about this place.  Its close by so I slipped on in for a cut and was it ever wonderful!!  Make an appointment is the preferred method.

A very precise haircut followed by an "old-school" shave and a fabulous hot towel and message!!  Great conversation and I am a very happy customer!!  

So glad to find a legit CLEAN barber shop!
