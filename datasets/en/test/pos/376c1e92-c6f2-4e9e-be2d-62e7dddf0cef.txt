My last stop at an eatery in Scottsdale during my trip and this was a great way to end it. Went for lunch and was not disappointed. Tons o options for hot and cold sandwiches plus salads and I think some wraps too. I'm not sure simply because I stopped looking when I saw the Tina salad on walnut cranberry bread. And it was awesome. 
The sandwiches don't come with chips or anything like that, but they do come with a nice serving of deli pickle slices. Which were fresh and tasty!
Tons and tons of beverage options and yummy baked goods which are also quite good.
Worth a stop for lunch (which can be quite busy) and I will try to get back here next time I'm in town.
