Coming from San Jose, aka Little Saigon, I always thought anything out of the bay area was just ok. Except my mind did change over the last year or so when I started going to Pho Ao Sen with a co-worker. This place is just awesome! The broth is always the killer feature to set  pho-restaurants apart, and this place has always been consistent. 

Customer Service is always great, and people are always greeted with a warm smile from the owner who's very personable as well as the staff.

Definitely a must-go if you have the urge for Vietnamese food in Arizona!
