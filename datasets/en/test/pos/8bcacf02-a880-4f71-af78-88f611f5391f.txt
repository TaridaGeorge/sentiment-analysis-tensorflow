This is a one of kind flower shop.  I always request esperanza rose's and fortunately they have been able to get those roses for me.  We actually pass these beautiful flowers to my sons teacher's each year.  The way they arrange them individual is so creative and each teacher is so excited to receive one.  We really appreciate the extra special attention they put into our order.  I have never been disappointed.
