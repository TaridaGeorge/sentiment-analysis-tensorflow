I love this place, when I visit Az I visit a lot of thrift shops on the same block but this is my fave stop. LOTS to look at! And there is something for everyone. JEWELRY GALORE, Glass, furniture, toys, clothing, sports, epherma, military, you name it, they probably have it. I was on a hunt for vintage clothing and was happy to see a few booths even though I couldnt find anything my size it was fun to look. Their postcards, stamps, paper, old photo section is very organized with chairs to sit down in to browse as long as you need. The staff is great there, its very secure and watched also so a good place to sell your items with good security. And not too mention there is another huge antique mall next door. This is a fun place to spend on a hot day.
