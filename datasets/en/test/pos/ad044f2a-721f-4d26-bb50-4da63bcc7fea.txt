I am 26 years old and I've had a lot of good breakfasts, but I can honestly say this was the best breakfast I've ever had!  We waited 45 minutes at 10 am on a Sunday morning and it was SO worth the wait!  The bacon was semi-sweet, super thick, and had peppery spices on it.  The eggs were fluffy and were so good they did not need salt.  The potatoes had rosemary or lavendar or something and were amazing.  My husband had the steak, it was phenomenal, my bro and sis in law had pancakes that were the best I've ever tasted.  This meal was so good it was almost erotic.  Hubby and I slept all day after.  Eat there.
