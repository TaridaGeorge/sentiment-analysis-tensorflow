The food at Little Shanghai is plentiful and reasonably priced.  The architecture and ambiance is a little dated but still has a high level of authenticity that is fitting and functional.  I haven't been to a better chinese restaurant in Phoenix.  The house chicken is to crave for late at night in your  refrigerator.  The sizzling beef should be a little more dangerous, kind of didn't sizzle the way my imagination played out.  The bar even works functionally and has some character.  Highly recommend if your are in the Arcadia area.
