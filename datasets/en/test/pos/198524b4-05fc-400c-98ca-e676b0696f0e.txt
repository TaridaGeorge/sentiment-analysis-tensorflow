I started going here after V's started opening franchises left and right and started going downhill. I have been so happy and always get complements on my haircuts. I have very thick hair that grows like a weed so I am a Barber's nightmare but Arsen works magic with the clippers. I now have a little girl and take her to Marina on the weekends. This is the traditional East Coast style shop, take time, use scissors and clippers, black and white tile on the floor, you can towel and shave and closed on Mondays.
