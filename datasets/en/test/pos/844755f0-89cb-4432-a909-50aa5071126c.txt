Hooray to great coffee!
Came here for the first time (last night) which also happened to be First Friday. The place was PACKED! We must have come at the right time because after waiting in line for about 10 min there was a line out the door! 
Yes, service was slower then would have been ideal. Then again, if you're willing to wait in line to place your order, you should be willing to wait to receive said order.
I had a Soy Latte and after tasting it I could have cared less how much time I waited! The coffee was delicious, something I feel is very scarce lately.
I'd definitely like to come back and experience them during a normal week day.
