I am impressed!  Cute, clean, tasty.  And I'm hard to please with Mexican food.  It rivals some of the "better" Mex restaurants for traditional fare.  I loved the green chili burro.  The guacamole was very nice. The chips were fresh and not greasy.  

Actually - better restaurants could learn a lot from the decor and ambiance in Some Burros.  Tasteful, colorful flowers on every table - even on the outside tables.  That's part of a good experience.

Table delivery is a plus for a "fast food" restaurant.  Management and employees were happy and attentive.  We'll be back......soon.
