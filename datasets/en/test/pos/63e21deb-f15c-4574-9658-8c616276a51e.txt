I absolutely love this place. The minute you walk in, you're greated by either Starr or Chen.  The place is small and doesn't get too crowded. The place is always clean and the entire staff is friendly and always on top of things.   They have pictures on the walls if you're in question on what your food will look like, which I found very creative of them to do. They do have a mixture of Korean and Japanese food.  I usually just get the sushi, so whatever you're craving, Japansese or Korean, or a little of both, head on over to J.K. sushi.
