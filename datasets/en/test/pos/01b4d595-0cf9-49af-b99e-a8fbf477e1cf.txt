I LOVE THIS PLACE! I've been eating at Kyoto for years. The service is good, the food is amazing, and the atmosphere is chill. 
My friends and I go here and love sitting around the table for teppanyaki because the showmen are really funny and entertaining. 
I will keep going here and I will always name Kyoto first in my recommendations for great sushi places.
