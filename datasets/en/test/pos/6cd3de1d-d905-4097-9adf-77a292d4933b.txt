90-ish year old small house turned into a wonderfully inviting small restaurant.

We weren't too hungry so shared 3 appetizers - a smoked salmon spring roll, firecracker shrimp and crispy calamari, and finished sharing a ginger creme brulee.

Everything delicious - even the geezers sitting at the next table cackling over an Arpaio-inspired silent auction of pink underwear while we watched Ireland and Estonia square off in a soccer match from the bar.

Only in a city.  It's nice that downtown is starting to feel like one.
