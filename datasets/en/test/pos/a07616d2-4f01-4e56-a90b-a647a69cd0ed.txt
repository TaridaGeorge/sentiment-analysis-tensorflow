Debated about taking my son here for some time before actually getting his hair cut..Both him and I love this place now. It's the only place he wants to get his hair cut. It's a little pricey for a childs cut, but well worth it, and they have a rewards card so we get coupons every couple of months for money off or special offers. The kids love the games and movies they can play and all of the stylists do a pretty good job. I recommend making an appointment so you don't have to wait. And we love Miss Veronica, she always gives a great haircut!
