They specialize in the tortas (sandwiches) but I judge all types of Mexican restaurants by their frijoles... and these were great. They were frijoles like my tia used to make. Though I could have done without the extra cheese on top. Large portions, great flavors, solid service and CHEAP! I was stuffed on the chicken tacos and still had leftovers for a whole 'nother 2 meals. Sheesh! This visit and choice by Cookie totally makes up for the catastrophe known as Vitamin T in downtown. My new go to place for Mexican food. Muchas gracias!
