I loved this place it seemed very authentic the watress was very friendly and the food is delicious plus the price is great. we had just about everything we could order on the menu and it was great. I expected to pay a big bill at the end but didnt it was well and fair priced so the watress got extra for being extra special. I would say at least try it once.
