Yelp steered me here, and it sure didn't steer me wrong! I had the three sliders (2 pork, 1 brisket). The pulled pork, green chile mac and cheese, and hot barbecue sauce were all phenomenal, and the portions were large. I stole a rib off of another plate, which was also quite tasty. For about $10, I got a delicious meal I couldn't quite finish off, despite having not eaten all day -- a hard combination to beat!
