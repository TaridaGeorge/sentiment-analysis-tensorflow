I love this mall. You need a giant mall like this when it is 120 degrees outside! It is one of the only indoor malls that I like. I feel so calm when I am here. You can find just about anything in this mall.  The food court is pretty good.  I like Paradise Cafe for sandwiches.  There are sit down restaurants and a movie theater inside as well.  Plenty of parking or you can just valet.  My favorite Nordstroms is here.  I find the Nordies in SF to be too big and overwhelming.  The one at the Fashion Square is minimalist, well organized, and edited to suit my tastes.
