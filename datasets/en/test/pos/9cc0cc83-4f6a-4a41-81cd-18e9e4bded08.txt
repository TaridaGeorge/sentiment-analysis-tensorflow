Juan's is the kind of place that ethnically Mexican people actually go to eat (WOW, SHOCKING) because (a) it's authentic, both in feel and flavor; and (b) it's darn good. Juan's food is 100% delicious all the time - from the burritos to the chimichangas to the tostadas, rellenos, tacos, basically whatever your heart desires.

It's the place to go for the genuine article, quintessential Mexican goodness. I won't be surprised if most people from Scottsdalewood can't stand it, or find it "unrefined", but I don't care. It's great. End of story.
