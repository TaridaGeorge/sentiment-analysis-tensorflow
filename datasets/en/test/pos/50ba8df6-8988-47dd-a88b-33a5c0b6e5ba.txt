Took my nephew here two weeks ago and it is now his favorite restaurant... Two weeks later he is STILL talking about it! Even at 11 he is somewhat of a meatball connoisseur and he very readily will tell you that Lo Cascio has the best! 

Best red sauce in town... HANDS DOWN! Definitely a place to splurge the extra calories! 

We were in early and ordered off of the "early bird" menu... lower prices, closer to lunch size portions... but honestly... still SO much food that I still took half my chicken parm home! 

Service was absolutely flawless... so very polite and attentive. Not overbearing like some servers can be! 

Will definitely be going back!
