This place is great!!! all of my friends love going here for lunch.... if your in the mood for some really good chicken fingers, this is the place to go! The plates are served with french fries and a piece of Texas toast which is very good.  They have a good selection of sauces. I recommend this to all my friends and to everyone that comes into Tempe, AZ!
