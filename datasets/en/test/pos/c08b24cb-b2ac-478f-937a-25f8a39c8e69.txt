Coffee is clearly the breakfast of champions. 

The classy looking building caught my eye driving down Thomas Road (which I often do) and I was excited to try it out the following morning. I was greeted with friendly service and contemporary decor. The area was littered with young professionals tapping away on laptops using the free wifi service (which earns them a star on it's own, IMO).

My vanilla soy latte was priced only slightly above average cost, which I am happy to pay to support local business.

The taste was great- not too sweet and a good, strong flavor. Here's the kicker though... As an avid coffee aficionado, I don't often get a caffeine "buzz" but this latte had me WIRED. Please don't take this as a bad thing- I miss that feeling and boy did I get a lot accomplished that morning! 

I'll be back, Echo Coffee!
