WHY oh WHY do they not have a single decent hamburger joint in Chicago!!!! 

I was just at in n out last weekend with a friend and stuffed my face with glorious greasy in n out burger and animal styled fries.... mmm artery clogging deliciousness. I love this place. Its timeless, you go back after a week, a month, a year, the quality is still spot on, you get exactly what you ordered- and that is what makes this place what it is.

I cant wait to come back.
