I LOVE this place!  The owner Steve, rocks!  It's an eclectic mix of 1950's antiques, movies in the background, boxing ring, outdoor patio, unique clothes line and forthcoming "Pie Hole" for fresh pies!  He has a blend of everything for everyone and the atmosphere is local, urban, energetic, and tons of space!  Food and drinks are excellent and Steve talks to everyone!

If that isn't enough, go on a Sunday for his Punch & Crunch Brunch!  That is a workout you won't forget and work up an appetite for a great brunch!  You aren't a Phoenix Hipster unless you've been here!
