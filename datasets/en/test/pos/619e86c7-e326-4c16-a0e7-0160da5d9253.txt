Sea Saw is the home to my best meal ever.  The combination of Japanese-inspired tapas plus an uber-awesome bottle of sake recommended by Nobu created the best tasting evening I've ever had.

My wife and I have eaten at Sea-Saw twice now and we are counting the days until we can come back.  It's absolutely 100% fantastic and a great experience in every way.

I think the other reviews pretty much have it nailed so I won't make this one too long.  It's great.  Save your pennies and go have an awesome night out.  Ask Nobu-san to recommend a bottle of sake and take a taxi home!

Don't forget to get reservations!  We lucked up on our second visit on a weeknight, but it's such a tiny place that you'll want to call ahead.
