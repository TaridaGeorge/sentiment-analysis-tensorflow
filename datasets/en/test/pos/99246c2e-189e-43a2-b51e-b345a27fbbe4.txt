The man needed a dress shirt to go with the suit he brought for tonight's event and lo and behold, we spotted this place and didn't have to deal with Arrowhead Mall.

We walked in to a sea of young men getting fitted for their prom attire and a salesmen immediately approached us-grateful to see a few crows feet I am sure.

He was great-non pushy and helped us get a shirt and tie that was needed. He even steamed the shirt for us so we didn't have to deal with it ourselves.

$75.00 and not a single problem or waiting in line with all the "boys". Great service and EASY!!!
