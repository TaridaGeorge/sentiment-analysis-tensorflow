As a student and aficionada of Native American culture, I have to say this is by far and away the best Native American themed museum I've ever seen.  While it isn't that large, it packs a punch with razor sharp exhibitions and a physical plant that is both cutting edge and serene.  Well worth a stop for road-trippers driving between austin and los angeles, or anyone who is doing time in phoenix for whatever reason.  highly, highly recommended.
