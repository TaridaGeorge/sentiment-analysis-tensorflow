i love the roosevelt district. i didn't realize that there would be a little boutique inside the coffee shop (and a library too)! they were awesome. great shots, great milk, cool area, friendly service, really neat selection of local artists' stuff for sale.

if you are visiting from out of town or are looking for a place to bring out of town visitors, conspire is definitely particular to phoenix (in the best way).
