It's everything yoga should be -- inspiring, centering, thoughtful, opening, and as challenging as you need it to be.  I am a New Yorker and have family in Gilbert, and I look forward to coming "home" to Gilbert Yoga when I visit my family.  There is nothing in New York like it.  All of the teachers were kind, knowledgable, accepting, encouraging, and helpful; and have a sense of humor.  I wish they'd open a studio in New York!
