Stayed here last weekend and was blown away by how gorgeous this hotel is! We lucked out and got put in a corner room with floor to ceiling views of the valley. The room was huge and everything was decorated beautifully! The staff was friendly and helpful from check in to check out. We did not try the restaurant, but will definitely get there at some point. I will say that the cookies and milk on the room service menu was delicious!! Great place and I recommend it to anyone wanting to stay in the Phoenix area!!
