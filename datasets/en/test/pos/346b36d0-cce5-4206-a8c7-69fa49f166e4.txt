JACKPOT!  This is what I love about the Chandler / Tempe area.  I have yet to have bad Italian.  Thursday night at 6pm, THIS PLACE IS PACKED.  I think we were the last table to be seated before they went on a wait.

The service was excellent.  

The food was OUTSTANDING!  I was starving when I came in, I left stuffed!  

Shrimp and Shells and Veal Picatta and Calamari.  All of it was FANTASTIC.  This will be the place I bring people when they come to visit.
