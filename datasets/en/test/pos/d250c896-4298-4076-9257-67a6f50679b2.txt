We traveled  to Coolidge from Chicago via Phoenix  to meet my brother and his family from Tucson and visit the Casa Grande Ruins.  We were fortunate to have lunch at the Sunset Cafe which made the trip.  The food was very good, the portions perfectly sized and the service and hospitality remarkable.  A visit to this family run cafe alone is worth the 1 1/4 hour trip from Tucson and Phoenix.  The calabasita enchiladas plate and mexican cheesecake dessert were delicious.
