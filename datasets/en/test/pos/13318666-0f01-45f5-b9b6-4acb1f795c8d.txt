Yay - another indie coffee joint that's somewhat near work! Bonus, I can shop at the market at the same time. Well, sometimes. I usually go for coffee between 8:00 am and 9:00 am, and the market doesn't open until 11:00 am. But it happens once in a while.

Anyway, you can tell that Royal takes their coffee very seriously. Often, they have the roaster going out front. If you order drip coffee, be prepared to wait. They brew it right then, one cup at a time.  But it's worth it. 

The espresso is also rich and delicious.  I made the mistake of going to back to Starbucks once, and the americano now tastes like ash in comparison. Royal has spoiled me!
