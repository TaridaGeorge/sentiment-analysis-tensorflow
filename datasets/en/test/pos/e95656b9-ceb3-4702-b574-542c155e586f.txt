This place has the best food in AZ.  Perfect food and perfect service.  The butter cake for desert is worth the calories.  The best entres are the ribeye and sea bass.  I would ask for the sea bass to be slightly cooked just a tad on the + side so its not raw.  Shrimp cockail is great too.  Crab claws seemed overpriced to me.

Oh...the pretzels w/ butter are amazing but a gut bomb.  So in summary, best food in town but be ready to take in 3000 calories if you want to take it all in:)
