Excellent food and service.  I had cioppino and husband had chicken.  We had fresh mozzarella as appetizer and cucumber cooler drinks.  If you like cioppino as a stew dish and not pasta sauce - this is perfect!

The app is incredible and I'm craving it now.  

Atmosphere is nice.  Open and light and comfy for hanging out and pretty people watching.

This will be nice dinner out place in the future.
