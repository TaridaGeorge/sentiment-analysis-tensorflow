Our own little version of the Smithsonian in North Phoenix. The quality of the exhibits and the amount of different instruments MIM has is daunting. This is one of the most impressive collections of Music anything I have ever scene. A must for anyone who appreciates music, very educating, but fun and exciting at the same time. It is probably the best $15 dollar ticket in the city.
