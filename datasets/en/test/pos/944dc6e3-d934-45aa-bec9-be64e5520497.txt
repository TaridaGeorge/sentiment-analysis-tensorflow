Loved it, wish I had one close to my home. The service was excellent, the food was incredible. We went on Valentines Day at lunch. The restaurant was full but we were seated and serviced quickly. No question this is high quality food prepared with care.  I've been telling all my friends, go please go! We had the Sashimi Salad, Hummus appetizer, Red Chili Shrimp, a drink called the Red Moon and finally a apple cobbler dessert.
