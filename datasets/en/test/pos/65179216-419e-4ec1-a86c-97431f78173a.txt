Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous!  From the clean facility, to the friendly staff to the amazingly delicious food . . . Carrabba's rocks!  IF you want to be wined and dined . . . this is the place.  What a blessing to have them in the east valley.  Blessings to them as they provide quality service at a moderate price  :  ) KC
