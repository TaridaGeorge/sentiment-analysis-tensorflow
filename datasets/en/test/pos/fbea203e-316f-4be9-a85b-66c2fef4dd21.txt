So many flavor choices. Took the family tonight and we all agreed that it was the best we've ever had.  I had the toffee, which was good but I liked my daughter's cappuccino better. My son was crazy about his lemoncello and my husband had the whiskey cream, which he loved.   We were served by one of the owners and enjoyed looking at their pastries and various writeups on the walls about the owners, their gelato and their story.
