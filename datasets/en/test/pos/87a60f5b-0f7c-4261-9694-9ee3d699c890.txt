How do you improve on perfection? I don't know, but the last two times I had my fix of a marinated pork burrito it seemed even better than before. It's time to ignore the cramped quarters and give Los Taquitos the five stars it deserves. The marinated pork just might be the single best Mexican dish in this town!
