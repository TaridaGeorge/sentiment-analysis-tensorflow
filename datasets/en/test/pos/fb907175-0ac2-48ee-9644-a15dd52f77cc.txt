I love you Pita Jungle. Not only do you have a separate menu for us vegans, but now you have a Tapas Happy Hour and a kids menu?! Hold the phone!

The Tapas Happy Hour is daily from 3pm-5:30pm and the plates are all $1-$3. My favorites include the hummus trio sampler and the falafel (comes with 2). Delicious!
