AWESOME Cajun.  
Came in on a Saturday with my husband and sat at the bar to get some Cajun fare.  We got the seafood gumbo and the crab cakes. Both were delish! Shrimp in the soup was plump and juicy.  Sitting at the bar, we talked to the tender and the guests.  Everybody was friendly and the tender even was calling us by name when we left.  She made us great hurricanes too!  We will definitely return!
