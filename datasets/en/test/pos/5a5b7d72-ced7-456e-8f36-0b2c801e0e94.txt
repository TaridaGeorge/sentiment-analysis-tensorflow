I drive about an hour (from Goodyear) for facials and waxing at this studio.  Penny is very detailed and thoroughly educated in her craft.  She uses the best products and the most advanced techniques in waxing and facials.  I also had some permanent make-up done and I was completely satisfied.  She makes you feel very comfortable and respects your time at the same time.
