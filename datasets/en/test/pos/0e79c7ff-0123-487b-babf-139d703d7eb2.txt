All was delish here !!!

Had the 3 meat platter with 2 sides and cornbread that I shared with the husband: we got the brisket, baby back ribs, and pulled pork. All the meat was moist and delicious and tasted great even without the BBQ sauce. We mac-n-cheese and grilled veggies for the sides...and both were yummy. My favorite was the cornbread...it was the best I have had and i would go just for that . They also give you these little fried donuts with cinnmaon and sugar for free before you leave and they were super sweet and yummy!! 

Did not know about the 10% off when I went...ooh well maybe next time.

Service was great too!!
