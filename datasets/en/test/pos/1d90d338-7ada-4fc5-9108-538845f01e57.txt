The people here at this store are soooo helpful.  I needed new windshield wipers (like everyone does here in AZ right after monsoon season starts and you realize the hard bricks of rubber you've had on there since last year are not going to cut it!).  I don't know what was going on with me, but I was confused about what to buy and even how to put them on...the directions on the back were cryptic! The guy came outside to my car, showed me how to put them on and then did it for me. yea!  A few months before this happened, our battery was going dead and they helped me install a new one!!  I love these guys!  Excellent service!!!
