Super delicious!  The hummus trio w/grilled chicken is amazing.  You could actually have it as a main course with some cucumber slices!

The chicken curry salad that they often have as a special is fantastic.

The falafel platter is excellent.

Their kids meals are well-rounded and tasty...and they provide plenty of crayons for their kids' placemats which have lots of activities to help pass the time before the food arrives.

This place is so good.  Healthy and delicious.  Go.
