I've been going to Sweet Pea since they opened and it is one of my favorite things about downtown. Not only is Danielle, the owner, great but you can tell she really cares about the quality of her products and her customers. I love the anitpasto lunch, especially during our hot summers, but the baked goods are what lure me in everytime. Those pb & j cookies have me addicted and the cupcakes are far superior to most of the other Valley's offerings (especially Sprinkles- ick!). Give Sweet Pea a try. You won't be disappointed!
