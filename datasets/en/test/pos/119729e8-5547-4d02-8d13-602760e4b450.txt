This is the best place to get your groceries and produce in old town, where oddly, there is a shortage of decent grocery stores. You won't find a friendlier staff - very different from your standard grocery store wait-in-line experience.

This place has great quality groceries and produce and low, low prices. They've got a great selection of bread, an awesome deli, super quality and great prices. Huge beer selection. I even dig their granola and wasabi peas from the bulk bins. Lots of choices for hummus, and you've got to try the chicken curry salad (in the fridge left of the deli).
