Five stars solely on the fact that where else can ones toddler run around stark naked through the splash pads at lunch time on a Friday?  Even better were the looks and comments from the passer-byers we got.  We got a good laugh living vicariously through him and he had a ball.  I need to laugh that hard more often.  What else could you ask for?
