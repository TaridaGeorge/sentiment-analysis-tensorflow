I came here with Joellen on Sunday, and WOW!! Place is awesome!  I really really liked it here.  Staff was friendly, helpful, welcoming, coffee was tasty as well!  They had the creme in these really cool "old school" containers, and place was well decorated. 

I will say, they had a TON of seating!!  The only thing was, that after a while it wasn't all that comfortable, and I had to get up and walk around....bench seats were kind of hard on the rear end...but worth every minute we spend there.  LOVE LOVE LOVE This place!!!!
