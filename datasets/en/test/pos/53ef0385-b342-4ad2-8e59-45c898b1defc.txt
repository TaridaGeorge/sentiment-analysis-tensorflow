What do the Tuck Shop and a Drag Queen have in common? They both tuck there assets away so that it's difficult to find them and when you see them perform they have a lot of surprises.

After several recommendations and a lot of rave reviews on Yelp I finally visited this neighborhood gem.

I definitely recommend the Pasta Fries, Stuffed Medjool Dates, Baby Lettuce Salad, and Chicken & Waffles. I've never had such juicy and tender chicken that was this crispy before. Awesome! 

By the way, I didn't have all those dishes to myself or even during the same visit so keep your judgements to yourself :P
