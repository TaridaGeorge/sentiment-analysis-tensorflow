As much as I love the original Postino, this one is equally amazing, if not a little better.

The bartenders here are really sweet, and make sure that you are good to drive home before you leave.  For the record...I slur my speech after a few glasses of wine, I wasn't really that drunk.

They still have the amazing wine selection, absolutely delicious bruschetta (get the tomato jam and goat cheese, heavenly!), and great soups and salads.  And of course the paninis are a godsend.

Though this one is a little farther, I think I will frequent it more often because of the bigger space and bigger bar.
