I find it hard to believe no one has rated 2 Men and A Pizza yet! We gave it five stars because the pizza was fresh tasting, prepared on time and close to home!

The taste was one of the best we've had so far in the valley. Very friendly staff from the time I placed the order until I walked out the door with our pizza. 

Mamma Mia on Indian School is comparable to 2 Men...try them both!
