This has to be the best Thai food I've had in Phoenix. Their vegetarian hot and sour soup is divine! 

We came upon the restaurant by a friend's suggestion. When we pulled up and noticed how small and crowded the joint was I was a little concerned that we wouldn't get a table, but after a short wait we were seated and our server was very friendly and fast. 

We recommend this restaurant to all of our friends that like Thai food!
