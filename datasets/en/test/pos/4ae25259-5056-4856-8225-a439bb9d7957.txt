My daughter and I just went here for a late lunch before the movies, and got a sausage and artichoke heart pizza and a Caesar salad.  It was out of our way, but we had a Groupon to spend, so the extra drive was okay because of the savings.    OMG it was so good.  Lots of cheese, good quality mozzarella too.  And the sausage was spicy and plentiful.  Artichoke hearts were extra, but well worth it.  Crust was thin and soft, made the pizza somewhat foldable, which I like.  Service was ok, got what we needed when we needed it, like a refill on our Ice T.   We will go back, again and again!
