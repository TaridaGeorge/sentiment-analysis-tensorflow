Kabuki is my favorite sushi restaurant. The restaurant is nice, clean and lively. Happy hour is very reasonable to go for the rolls and drink specials, although regular menu prices aren't overpriced. I love getting their Dynamite roll and their Philly roll. I've even taken friends here that don't like sushi and they are able to find something to eat here. The chicken teriyaki is also delicious for those who don't enjoy sushi.

I would definitely recommend for sushi and an overall nice meal. I live very close to this place and love their sushi so I will keep coming back!!
