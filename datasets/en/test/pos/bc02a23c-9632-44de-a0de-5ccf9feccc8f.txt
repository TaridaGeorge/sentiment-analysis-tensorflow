Huh, what?!! 

Bikram Yoga Tempe is the best yoga studio ever. If I lived in Arizona, I would live right next door. I would do Bikram ten times a day. I would start a cult that involves worshiping these instructors. 

This is the sweetest smelling yoga studio of all time. The temperature is a perfect 105 degrees, with 60% humidity. The heaters here are super swanky. 

This is also the largest studio I've ever seen. We must've fit 200 people in one class on New Year's Eve 2010. It was amazing!
