I really loved Hula's.

Decor: I think it was an old garage or fire department prior to being opened as an upscale tiki joint.  Despite being a 'modern' tiki joint, I love that they have big-screen plasmas and projection TVs playing 1950s and 1960s movies, like Jack Rabbit Slim's from "Pulp Fiction".

Underneath the bar is a very large and impressive collection of vintage tiki mugs.  Lots of framed posters of 1960s surf movies.  

The food was pretty good.  The drinks even better.  Hula's mai tais go down smooth and, due to the typical Phoenix heat, it's easy to get two or three.

They managed to do a really good job of mixing the upscale with the vintage tiki stuff.  
Hula's is the best tiki joint in the Phoenix area!
