I have to echo what Ed has already said. My parents have been going to Bob for 10+ years now and he is truly excellent. Prices are fair and more importantly he offers good advice regarding your jewelry. 

The other day my mom wanted to know if she should get a diamond recut to sparkle better (which would give him several hundred dollars of business). He said that the diamond was in great shape and that while it would benefit from a new cut, he didn't think it would be worth it.

Honest, great selection, great service (while never feeling pressured), and good prices. What more do you want? Ah yes, a happy fianc√©e with the ring you picked out... well now I've got that too :-).
