It's probably not worth reviewing Changing Hands, since everyone else already has... but I can't help myself.

As far as the selection -- well, I've seen better at other indie bookstores. BUT most of those bookstores don't carry new AND USED books. And that, in my opinion, is what makes Changing Hands rock.

And, unlike a lot of other used bookstores, Changing Hands actually buys books back at fair prices -- and sells their used book inventory at low prices, too. The last time I came here, I brought three huge boxes of books. I expected the workers to get really annoying with me for bringing in so much - but they were nothing but polite. And, even better, I got a $98 store credit! I was definitely not expecting that!

I also love the staff's choices of books. There are always some great finds in there.
