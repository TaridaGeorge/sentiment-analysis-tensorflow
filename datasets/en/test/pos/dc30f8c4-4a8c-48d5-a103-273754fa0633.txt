My favorite place in Phoenix to grab a Perfect Pint. I think Guinness in an Irish pub just tastes better. And at Rosie's its even better thanks to the lively pub. My friends and I go come here whenever possible, its always a great time with great friends, great drink, and at a great place. Rosie's is that place where you always bump into someone you know. It makes this city seem just a little bit smaller. If you get there early enough for dinner, try the fish and chips, it's pretty tasty. But really, Guinness is a meal unto itself. Just grab a booth, sit back, and enjoy the night.
