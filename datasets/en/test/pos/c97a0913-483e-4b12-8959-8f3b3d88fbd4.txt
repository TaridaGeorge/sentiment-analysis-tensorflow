Beyond impressed with the manager that was so generous and helpful. I had placed an order over the phone which was not ready when I arrived nor could they find my order. The manager offered me a complimentary glass of wine while I waited and then gave me my meal free because it was a pretty busy evening! I was shocked and thrilled with the service I always get when I go to this location :) as always my favorite is the hummus trio with chicken!
