Took my son, Mike here for his 21st birthday and first drink (lol).  We sat in the patio area.  Everything was great.  I love the selection of beer and had to try quite a few.  My other son, Steve, ordered a gin martini with a twist and they even came back and asked if he wanted a twist of lime or lemon.  Attention to detail was great from the bar.  The appetizers were great and so was dinner.  

This was the perfect choice for the occasion.  I wanted something above a bar or a Fridays (I love Fridays so don't get me wrong), but I did not want a Mortons (which I also love).  I highly recommend Yard House.
