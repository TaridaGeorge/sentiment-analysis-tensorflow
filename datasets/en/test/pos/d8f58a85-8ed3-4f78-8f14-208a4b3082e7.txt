I'm a big fan of Sports Authority. I love getting the 20% off coupons through the mail and email! In addition to the coupons, there seems to always be sales on workout clothes. My husband and I love stocking up on Under Armour and Nike dry shirts. I like this location because it's new and even though it's stocked with the same stuff as other locations, this location looks brighter and cleaner than the rest. Employees here are also really nice and helpful.
