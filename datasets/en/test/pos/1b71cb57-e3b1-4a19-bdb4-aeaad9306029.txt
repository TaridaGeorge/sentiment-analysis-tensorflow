I was extremely skeptical of coconut and pineapple on a brat, but boy does it ever work.  The volcanic garlic mayo is amazing, the heat sneaks up on you but has a good flavor.  Been here a couple times and both times everyone was friendly and, like another review mentioned, the tater tots are perfect.
