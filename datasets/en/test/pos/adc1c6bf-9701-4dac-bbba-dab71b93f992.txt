After a day at Encanto park the kids (and the wife) wanted ice cream. After doing a quick search in Google maps via iPhone I found Pink Spot. It felt more like a coffee shop than an ice cream shop which I loved. It had leather couches and chairs as well as the typical table and chairs. They're also connected to a pizza joint so you have lots of options as far as food, drinks, dessert.

The ice cream selection seemed to be in line with a Baskin Robins with a few unique flavors of their own. One of my favorite things was that they had an espresso machine and advertised lattes and coffee drinks as part of their regular menu. They even have happy hour with $1 lattes after 6 pm. Oh yeah and free wifi!!

Overall a very awesome place for a tasty treat. Check it out!
