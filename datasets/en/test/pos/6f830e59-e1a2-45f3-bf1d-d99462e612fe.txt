Its a mint to eat here my wife and I used to each here before BC (before children) and its pretty damn wonderful. The wait staff it there for you to wait on YOU. They are excellent, they want you to be happy they want you to have an excellent menu, they want their tip. 

It is the old school-old world eats the steak is so tender you can slice it with a fork the lobster my wife had was massive and excellent. And they will shell it for you, you know how hard it is to get at the meat of these things. 

The wine is excellent and its a wonderful place to visit if you can take out a low interest loan. 

Our bill out the door with tip was $310.00 for two people but that was years ago and I know it has not gotten cheaper.
