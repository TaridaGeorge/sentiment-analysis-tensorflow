Just had my hair done for the 3rd time by Lori Vial. She is totally amazing. I am always switching up my color on her... from browns to reds, to low to highlights. Every time she does such a beautiful job.

She is very artistic & takes her time (never a mistake), quite the perfectionist she is! And she does amazing haircuts too for me!
