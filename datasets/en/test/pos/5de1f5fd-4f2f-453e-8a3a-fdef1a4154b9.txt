Yogurtini is beyond rad. 

First of all, I'm a huge fan of tart anything. It's so light and refreshing. And they have zillions of tart options! It's like a tart Utopia! 

Then there's such a variety of fresh fruits, and boy o boy do I love me some fresh fruits. Also, they have a plethora of other toppings. I'll admit that my somewhat healthy frozen treat gets less healthy as I gaze nostalgically on gummy worms and Reese's Pieces.... 

A girl only has so much will power.
