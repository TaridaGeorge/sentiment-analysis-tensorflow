Absolutely love this place! One of my favorite coffee shops. The people who work here are so friendly, helpful, and make you feel like you are at home. The drinks are very delicious. I love their tea latte that is pressed. They use actual tea leaves and after a few minutes add some love such as real vanilla to make the ends result absolutely wonderful. Best chai tea I have ever had! The chairs are very comfortable too. I can sit in them all day. This is a great spot for some family time, to chill, and to study. They even have a drive through.
