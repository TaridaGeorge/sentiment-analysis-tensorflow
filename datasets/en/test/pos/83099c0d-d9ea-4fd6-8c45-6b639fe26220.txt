This is my new favorite spot. I decided to take the advice from yelpers and try this place out myself. The prices are very reasonable, the two sisters are real  nice, my nails are too cute. I couldn't be more satisfied. If you've  never been here,  this is the place to go.This place is a keeper for sure. Two thumbs up .
