It had been several years since I'd been in, but we came for restaurant week back in Sept.  It was also my husband's birthday.  The prix fix menu was amazing.  I had  and my husband had a steak.  I would have thought the portions would have been smaller since it was a set price, but they were their normal (large) sizes.  The dessert, bananas foster butter cake is enough for 2-3 people to share, but it was included in the set price.  Of course, neither of us ate it all, but it is TO DIE FOR!!!!!   Am thinking we may go back for my birthday next week!!!
