Our national Sales Convection was held here! I loved it! The staff was amazing. This is the only hotel I've been to that offers an entire Gluten free menu and everything the chef made was really good! I lost five pounds throughout the entire week! Convention facilities were a bit of a walk in the heat. The rooms were great, bed comfortable, water pressure was strong! Bar closed way to early.
