I am a fan of Thai House, and love it is so close to my home.  The food here is quality thai food, and really full of flavor.  My favorite entree is the yellow curry dish with chicken, and a second runner up is the mussman curry with chicken.  The service is quick, and the staff is very friendly.  The place is pretty small, and since so close to our home, we order for pick-up.
