I biked the entire thing today! OMG I loved it! I started at the Mustang Library and went to Curry and Miller. Had a cereal bar and turned around. I did it on my mountain bike and had fun. It's the longest ride i've ever done. It goes through multiple parks and golf courses. Plenty of good looking women (i'm a guy) and nice people to wave to you. I had a great time. This is a hidden treasure in the Valley. Much nicer than biking on canal paths!
