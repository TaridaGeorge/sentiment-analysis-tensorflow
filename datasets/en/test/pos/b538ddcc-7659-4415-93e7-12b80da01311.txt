This was a beautiful hike within the McDowell mountains. They have many trails that you can follow of varying degrees of difficulties. They move with the landscape where you can see spectacular views of Phoenix as well as out into the desert landscape. The plant and wildlife is abundant in this area, nothing to be afraid of, just lizards, rabbits, and birds. There aren't a ton of people either, which is important to me when hiking. I like to get away from people and just relax and here you can do that.
