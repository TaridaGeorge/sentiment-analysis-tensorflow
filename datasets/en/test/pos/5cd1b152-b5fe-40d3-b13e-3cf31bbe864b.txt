It was great. In fact, I'm near speechless... The guides were VERY respectful while still being laid back and personable. Great at pairing horses to individuals' backgrounds so if you're more experienced, you have the opportunity to be with a horse that likes a faster gait. We only had four people plus a guide so it made everything much more personalized than the traditional "nose to butt" trail. Went through forest, open land, over logs, up/down hills, through rivers... the experience was BEYOND amazing. Nothing dull about this ride especially because we were able to trot or even gallop, if we wanted to. Will DEFINITELY be back to ride with them in Paulden, AZ!!!!!
