I was brought here by my boss, so it was sort of a business dinner.  I wasn't able to try the cocktails that looked so good on the happy hour signs.  Each course comes with soup or salad.  I have to say, the salad I had was delicious.  I was surprised, usually a complimentary salad only includes iceberg lettuce and carrots.  This salad had all the good stuff.  I had the shrimp scampi.  It was delicious, but SO MUCH garlic.  The angel hair pasta that it come with was great.  All in all, a great experience with perfect service.
