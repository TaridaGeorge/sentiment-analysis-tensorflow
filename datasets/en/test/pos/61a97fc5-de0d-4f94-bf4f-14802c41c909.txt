I've been getting eye lash extensions for years in Japan and CA from skilled ladies, and I was a bit worried if I could find a good person when I moved here.  

Happy that I finally found Heather!  She is a professional who  does a great job every time.  I'm satisfied with the quality of the lashes, and how pretty yet natural they look.

Peoria is a 50 mins drive away from my house, but I plan to stick around and continue to receive wonderful treatment.
