To be honest I am no Vietnamese food buff. However, I have had it about 4 or 5 times and this is the only place I actually enjoyed it. The food was flavorful, the tea was super yummy and the Pho actually had taste! The atmosphere was really nice too, super clean and pretty looking. I want to get back here when I get a chance.
