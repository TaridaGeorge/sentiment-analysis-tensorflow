While we were in Mesa AZ for a holiday we found Alessia's on Yelp and we are so glad we did. The food was delicious and the host was terrific as were the servers. We are not big wine drinkers but they have a very good selection of wines and the host knows his stuff and can make good recommendations. Nicely appointed little restaurant with a great menu.
