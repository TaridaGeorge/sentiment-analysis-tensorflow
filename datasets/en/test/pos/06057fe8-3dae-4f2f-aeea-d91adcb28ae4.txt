If you enjoy healthy home-cooked Italian food, then this is the place for you. When you walk in the joint the smell of GARLIC is overpowering, but in a good way ;) Try the lunch special for 9.99! I recommend the sirloin or the lamb, but I hear that EVERYTHING is delish. A huge assortment of veggies, so vegetarians will also be impressed. THIS IS MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT IN PHOENIX.
