I went to Valentina's sometime last year and didn't realize until today that I hadn't left a review!

My fiance is Bangladeshi, so for special occasions with his family I wear traditional Bangladeshi clothing.  His family was kind enough to send me a nice dress from their country, but unfortunately it was a little big and didn't fit me like I know it should have.  I took it to Valentina's, and even though it had intricate designs on it, she was able to alter it perfectly to fit my figure and even added a zipper on so that it wouldn't be difficult to take on and off.  I was very impressed with her work and will always come back when I need something altered (perhaps a wedding dress soon ;) ).
