Hands down, the best pizza in the East Valley!!!! Tastes like I'm back in New York City, that's how good the pizza is! They do all sorts of combinations and toppings. Mmmm mmmm good. The hero sandwiches and wings are good too. Located in a strip mall next to AMC movie theaters, it's a great place to go before or after the movies. And they deliver, too. Much better quality than chain pizzerias.
