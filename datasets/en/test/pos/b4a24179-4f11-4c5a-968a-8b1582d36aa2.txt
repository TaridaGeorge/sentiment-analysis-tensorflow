Elsa's Chicken Sandwich....THE very best! 

Whoever Elsa is, I would like to meet and thank (and possibly make out with). This chicken sandwich is perfect.

Tender flat white meat covered in a dragon sauce with green peppers and pecans. My gf couldnt stop eating my fries and the drinks...don't get me started! Everything features a VERY strong pour.

Tip your bartenders well! They are really taking care of you here.

Like cucumbers? Try the tasty Moscow Mule! Vodka with cukes and ginger beer served in an old school copper mug. One of the best drinks out there!

The atmosphere is fantastic and I have been coming here for well over 10 years. 

They always have some cool art featured in the place and the location is a bit off the beaten track...meaning less tourists and more locals. 

For the tourists reading this that are coming to Scottsdale--You're Welcome.
