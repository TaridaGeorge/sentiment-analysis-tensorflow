This is by far my favorite sushi restaurant in Arizona. I think I would eat here everyday if I could. Mo takes such pride in having the freshest fish around. I'm not into the  places that are all about "seeing and being seen" and not so into all the fancy rolls that mask the flavors of the fish, either. If you want phenomenal sushi, this is the place to be.
