This has been my home studio for 2 1/2 years now.  The owner Brooke, has the most beautiful spirit, and the whole place just vibrates a wonderful energy.  It's a place I know I can go and always feel good.  The teachers are helpful, informative, and very skilled.  Kevin makes me smile every time, his classes Rock!!!  I also love it when I can catch the occasional gong meditation.  Keep up the good work - and Thanks!!!
