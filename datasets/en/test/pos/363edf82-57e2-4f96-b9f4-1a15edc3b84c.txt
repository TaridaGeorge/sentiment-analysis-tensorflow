We had the most amazing breakfast buffet here while staying at the Camelback Inn. The restaurant is very beautiful, interesting glass fixture hanging thru out, rich dark woods, nice views of the patio. 

The buffet include omelets, the best hash brown potatoes in the world. Other food choices include juevos rancheros, fresh pastries, breads, bagels, muffins, bacon, sausage, cured meats, yogurts, fresh fruits, granola, cereal, etc. Service here is also amazing. I highly recommend Rita's for breakfast.
