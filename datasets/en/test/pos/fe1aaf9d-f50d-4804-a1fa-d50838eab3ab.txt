We eat at Fritzi's at least once every two weeks.  Their pulled chicken and pork sandwiches (or open face style) are excellent and the ribs are some of the best we've ever had.  The sides (mac and cheese, baked beans, greens, sweet potato casserole, etc.) are also very tasty.  This place is always consistent and is still one of our favorite restaurants.  In our opinion, none of the local BBQ places are as good as Fritzi's.  The best thing is that it's a local and independent restaurant.
