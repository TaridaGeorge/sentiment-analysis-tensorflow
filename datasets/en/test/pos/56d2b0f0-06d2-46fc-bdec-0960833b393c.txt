Te amo invierno en Phoenix.
J'aime l'hiver  Phoenix.
Ich liebe Winter in Phoenix.

The winter makes me enamored so, so much so that I want to proclaim I love winter in Phoenix in romance languages.

Let's face it.  We all love this time of year as the 70 degree days makes us the envy of the nation for a few months.  Here are some additional reasons to love Winter in Phoenix beyond the obvious great weather.

* Outdoor festivals galore
* Luminarias at the Desert Botanical Garden
* MLB Spring Training in March
* PF Changs Rock n Roll Marathon
* Endless hiking opportunities
* FBR Open and the Bird's Nest
* Hotties from Minnesota and Chicago who are snowbirding it (I'd hit it)

And best of all...
* The hibernation of Swamp-Ass until April.
