This is a first class facility with excellent service.  I have been to the Dynamite Bar & Grill on several occasions--mostly for lunch.  I have never had a bad experience here.  All of the sandwiches are excellent as well as the salads.  
The golf course is always in excellent shape and consistently has the best greens in the valley.  The Staff is very friendly and attentive.  I would say this is probably the best golf experience in the State.
