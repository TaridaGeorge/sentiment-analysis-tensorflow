Hands down the best buffet in Arizona. Seriously!

I tried the sirloin, roast beef, shrimp, mussels, mahi, and pork. All were well prepared and fresh. I also saw crab legs, salads, pasta, pizza, and calamari. They have a ridiculously large desert selection too! The atmosphere is very modern and open, with an optional outdoor patio.

It helps that this is in the new Talking Stick Resort & Casino, which offers several other upscale restaurants to explore. *Check out the 15th floor bar while you're here.
