I love this location!  The morning crew remember my very complicated drink and greet me by name when I walk in (They do this a for a LOT of am regulars...that's impressive!).  Chris is awesome and friendly perfect for my non morning person attitude.  Puts a smile on my face!  Keep it up-

Love: Starbucks Venti Double shot +/- add shot.  6 pumps white mocha and 4 Sugar Free Hazlenut, nonfat with cinammon dulce powder on top.
