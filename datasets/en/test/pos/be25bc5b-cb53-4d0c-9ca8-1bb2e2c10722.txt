Cappuccino will knock your socks off.  Not exactly sure why, but think its the coffee used, the coffee/water ratio, and the creamy dense topping that I was told is milk, not cream. 

This place takes its coffee seriously.  NYT's had an article few months ago about NYC coffee shops improving their coffee: each cup made to order, no espresso's or capuccino's to go, foamed milk done per cup (vs prefoamed in big container), ideal espresso/cap ratios(no skimping on espresso grinds) etc.  The Cartel's coffees are as good or better than any I used to go to in NYC.
