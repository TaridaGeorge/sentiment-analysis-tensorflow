We really like the food here. Their things are not your typical food that you find at an average eatery. This is a mecca for vegetarians and also for meat lovers alike. I am surprised by the average reviews for this place because this location is ALWAYS packed.

Food is always fresh, tastes awesome and even our lil'un loves their macaroni and cheese.

This place is not inside the food court but is infact right outside near Starbucks and BJ's.
