My boyfriend took me here on a date when i was visiting Arizona, this is quite possibly the best steak i have ever had. I ordered the filet...this steak is literally 2 inches thick, word to wise medium rare will be warm in the center. Green Rice sounds funny but taste fantastic. Bandera is pricey but worth it.
