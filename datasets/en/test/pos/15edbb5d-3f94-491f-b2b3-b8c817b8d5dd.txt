I can't get enough of the Phoenix Art Museum, I come every few months and always have such a good time. I really enjoy the Philip C. Curtis art, it is probably my favorite part of the museum, but the upstairs is also sweet with the more modern/contemporary art and the fun "firefly" exhibition. I also came most recently to a Heidi Duckler event, if you get a chance to see her dance group here I would definitely recommend it. The only issue I've ever run into is obnoxiously loud guests, which is not the museums fault. You've got to come here if you never have, or if you haven't been in a while, it's a beautiful facility with good staff and some schools get you in for free, and with a good sized gift shop with tons of cool trinkets, you just can't go wrong.
