Top-shelf bacon, the best I've found in town.  Overall this is a great store, a little expensive no doubt, but worth it IMO.  Their natural casing hot dogs are also excellent, better than the Boar's Head and about the same price (I think they are $5.99/lb).  If you've never had pickled sausage before, they have it - it's not as weird as you might think, it's pretty mild.  Since the store is based in MN (the owner relocated to AZ), they have all sorts of products you'd find in most markets in the upper midwest: condiments, sauces, pickles, etc.  On one side of the store is a smallish beer (including three varieties of Leinenkugel's, Summit, Labatt, etc.) and wine selection (common, low end brands mostly).

They also have hotdishes in their freezer section.  I can't give it any less than 5 stars.
