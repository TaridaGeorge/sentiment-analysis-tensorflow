This place ROCKS! I get all my morning Joe there. The product is awesome! The Baristas are very friendly. They know what I want before I ask, they are very tuned in to their regulars. I have never had a bad experience at Dutch Bros. Thanks to all the staff at Bell Rd. For making my day a lot better!
