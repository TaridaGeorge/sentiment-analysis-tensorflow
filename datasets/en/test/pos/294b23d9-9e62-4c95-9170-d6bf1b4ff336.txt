I don't drink coffee, my tummy doesn't like it...well I should say it gets VERY angry when I drink even diluted coffee drinks.

The interior is trendy urban industrial, and there's a huge fan to keep their covered outside area as cool as possible (still not cool in AZ summer, but I appreciate the obvious effort).

I've only had two drinks here: the iced chai latte and the orange blossom beer, both of which went down quick and well.

Orange Blossom Beer is locally brewed and has a persistent orange sicle note. Yum!
