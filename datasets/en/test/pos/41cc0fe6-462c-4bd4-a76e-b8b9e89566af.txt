holy cow! we don't frequent (actually, we never go to spots like this simply because we don't own enough cool clothes and we really can't understand spending money in places like these) fancy bars/lounges much anymore, but were glad we did this night. 

it was the kickoff party for the culinary festival, hosted at the w living room. it was beautiful. full sandy lounging areas, cool fire pits, waterfall bar area. man, it must be nice to be able to go to these cool spots all the time. 

and the eye candy? jesus christ man, i couldn't keep a straight conversation from staring at all the legs and boobs. but back to the hotel....extremely swank, trendy, gorgeous. don't know what it costs to get in or how much drinks are but i'm sure it's high.
