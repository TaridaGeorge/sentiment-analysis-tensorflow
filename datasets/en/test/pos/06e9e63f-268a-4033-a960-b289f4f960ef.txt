This is a great place. I've always had good food and the owners are awesome (and cute). Prices decent. The gyro meat is really moist , salads good, fries good.... They have burgers and cheesesteaks too but I have not gotten to that yet. The place is not fancy and looks like a diner but it's actually very comfortable and relaxing. Just all around great atmosphere and nice crowd. Outdoor seating too.
