Had to give this place 5 stars, because no place in metro Phoenix that I know of has hot dogs and Italian beef sandwiches (with red sauce if you want it) as close to real Chicago taste as here. So good. Great fries, too. Just a hole-in-the-wall kind of place, but worth the trip. Always pretty busy. Try it.
