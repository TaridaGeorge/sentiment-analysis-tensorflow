I've been on both sides, on the stage and in the audience at Gammage, and it's a top-notch facility to see just about anything. And after seeing "Hair" there on Tuesday (thanks so much Yelp!), I can honesty say I've seen just about everything in Gammage. :-)

The show (Hair) itself was ok. Enjoyable, but couldn't hear anything other than the music. Would have liked to know what they were singing. I hope they fixed that for the rest of the performances.
