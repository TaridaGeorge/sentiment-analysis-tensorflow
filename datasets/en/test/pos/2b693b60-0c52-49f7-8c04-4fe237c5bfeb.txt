The staff is friendly and knowledgable and the sales on stationary are always welcome.  Lots of specialty papers to purchase by the sheet or in packs of 25 or 50, with matching envelopes.  Oh so easy to give just the right touch to my correspondance.

Even when they are swamped with business the staff is always ready to lend a hand or help with a jammed machine.

When my puter is down I rent one of theirs for just $10 and hour with printing priveleges.
