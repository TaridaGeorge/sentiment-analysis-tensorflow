Dave and his staff are professional and honest which for me is number one when it comes to the A/C business. I was using another company when my a/c wouldn't kick on and after 3 days and numerous attempts at fixing the unit they were convinced that it was the main board which would be an expensive fix. I didn't feel right, I know I should have cut them loose sooner, I had High Country come out and take a look at the unit. It turns out the main power supply wire had shorted and needed two feet of wire replaced. So thanks Dave for saving me hundreds of dollars.
