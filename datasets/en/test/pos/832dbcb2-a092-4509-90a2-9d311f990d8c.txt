This is my favorite coffee shop. Their coffee is great, the staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is very relaxed. I bring my dogs sometimes, and they are totally cool about them being there with me. The drive thru is pretty convenient, too when I'm in a hurry. I'd say it's hard to find a better cup of coffee for a better price in the area.
