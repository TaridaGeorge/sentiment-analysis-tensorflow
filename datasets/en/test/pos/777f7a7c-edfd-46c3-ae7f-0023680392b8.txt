I love it here. I do a lot of trading here (used to work in fashion) and I always leave with something that I feel lucky to have found. The staff is awesome, I know some of their names and some of them know mine. They are so friendly, upbeat and love clothes. Buffalo Exchange is people watching at it's finest. 

I don't understand the reviewers that get sand in their bathing suit over them not taking all their clothes.... edit what you bring and don't have expectations... maybe don't take 4 garbage bags of stained clothes on a saturday... When they don't take something it's not personal or an insult... there are a lot of factors. 

For all you fashion lovers... why aren't you here yet?
