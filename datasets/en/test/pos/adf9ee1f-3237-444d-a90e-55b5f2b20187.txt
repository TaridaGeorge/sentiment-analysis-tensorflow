I went to the Chop House for a business meeting and lunch.
I have to say, from the immediate greeting we got as we entered this restaurant to the excellent service by the nicest waitress in town with great food, I'll be back.
Also, we needed help with our wi-fi and the manager came over and took charge and within a few minutes we were up and going with our business meeting. All in all, it was a great experience.
