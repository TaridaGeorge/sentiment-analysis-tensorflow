Husband and I have been trying to go to Urban Cookies for a while now. For one reason or another we kept missing its store hours. We finally made it today, and boy, were we glad. 

I had a vanilla cupcake and he had the urban cookie, which has chocolate chips and walnuts. The cookie was the perfect balance of moist and crispy. 

The guy behind the counter told us that the vanilla cupcakes was a special, but when they rotated it out people yelled at them. After taking one bite, I totally understood why. The cupcake is the best I've ever had. The vanilla frosting is not too sweet, perfectly creamy and melts in your mouth. 

I just hope they get more business so they can expand their hours!
