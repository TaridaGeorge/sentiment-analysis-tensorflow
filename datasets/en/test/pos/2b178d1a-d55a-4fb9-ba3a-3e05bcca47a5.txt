Not pretentious, not fancy ....... But the food is awesome!!
Found them by accident the first time BEFORE I knew they had been featured on The best thing I ever ate.  My wife and I felt welcomed even though you could tell the restaurant was filled with regulars. Straight forward menu, everything is the same price except the daily special, did I say unpretentious?  Not fast but friendly and GREAT food, no ambiance but friendly and GREAT food. We haven't tried everything on the menu yet, however:
Fried Chicken 10
Chicken Fried Steak 10 (gravy was wonderful)
Catfish 10
Mixed greens 10
Rice & gravy 8 (sometimes not as hot as it should be)
Green beans & Taters 10
Black eyed peas 8
Corn bread 10
Mac & Cheese 3 (sorry).

Great food from fine folks since 1964!
