Stopped in here for lunch after someone recommended it. Great local spot. we shared two sandwiches - the roast beef and blue cheese and the asparagus and harveti with ham. Both had great flavor. The menu is small, but they do everything themselves, so I don't mind a small menu. 

We also got cupcakes; however, I wasn't that impressed. 

Overall, the service and set-up was good; the sandwiches were good and the deserts were just ok.
