Great place in Heritage Square for a relaxing glass of wine!  I have been coming here for 8 years and have always been impressed.  They have a nice selection of beer and wine and it is reasonably priced.  The old house it resides in is very nice.  I love the wordwork and the built in cabinets.  I liked it better when there were more sofas and less tables/chairs, but I guess it is so popular and they are trying to fit more people in there.  Great place to spend some time while waiting for your table next door at Pizzeria Bianco!
