Chodang...I've been to Chodang several times.  All my experiences here are great.  I usually get the Bugolgi which is very similar to their teriyaki beef.  All their side dishes are always great which usually comes with some dried seaweed, fresh seaweed, radish kimchi, cabbage kimchi, sweet apples, and bean sprouts.  Awesome place if you like Korean Food!  This place is also friendly and is very neat and clean.   Always come here with the co-workers.
