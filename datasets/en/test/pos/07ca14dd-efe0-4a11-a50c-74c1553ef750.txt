I first went to Wongs five years ago when my fianc√©e first told me about it. He and his family had been going there for years, and it only seemed right to see what all the hype was about!

I was blown away to say the least! The food, service & atmosphere were all great. My cup never went empty and the portion size was great for the little money spent!

If you are looking for any recommendations, here they are..
*broccoli beef
*chicken fried rice
*Chinese sausage fried rice
*crab wontons

Look for more recommendations soon! 
This is a great family style restaurant where again, the service is just as good as the food!
