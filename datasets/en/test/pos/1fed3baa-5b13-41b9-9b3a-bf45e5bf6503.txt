I saw Jessica Rosenblum PA for a suspicious growth on my back. She was courteous and professional in her demeanor. After a thorough complete exam of my skin she found a total of 3 suspicious growths. Jessica removed all 3 growths for biopsies. I felt almost no pain from the local anesthetic injection. The results were called to me only 3 days later. Thankfully, nothing was malignant. I highly recommend Jessica Rosenblum PA for dermatology patients.
