This is the best hotel I've stayed!!!

I usually do not review hotels, but I just had to!!
We stayed in a room with lagoon view. At night they puddle boat while singing song as if you are in venetia. It's super romantic. In the morning you can see ducks swimming in the lagoon.

Their pool area is HUGE. I cannnot remember how many pool they have, but they've got water falls, several pools right next to lagoon and golf course.
It's dreamlike....
Their courtyard is pretty.

Their service also get 5 stars. Super friendly and nice people.

I am even considering having wedding here, since it's such a perfect hotel.
