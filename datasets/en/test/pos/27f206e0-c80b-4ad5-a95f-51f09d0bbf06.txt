Don't let its unassuming strip-mail location throw you off: this is one of the better places to eat in Phoenix. Everything is extremely fresh and very tasty. The Greek salads (with or without meat) are wonderful. Fresh sauces, lemon juice, and juicy tomatoes are at odds with the styrofoam plates and plastic utensils.  The colorful and friendly personalities of the staff are right out of a Seinfeld episode. The owner and his wife are frequently interacting with the customers to make sure that your meal is satisfying to you palate. Home cooking and conviviality are the trademarks of this diamond in the ruff.
