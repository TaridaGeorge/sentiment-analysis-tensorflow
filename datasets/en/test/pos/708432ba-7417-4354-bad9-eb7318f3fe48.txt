I went here during the Mexican American artwork exhibit.  The exhibit was full of diverse, remarkable pieces, including an entire vintage kitchen.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  The entire layout of the building was simple and modern.  I have gone twice since the first visit.  It's a good trip for a lazy day in Tempe.
