Awesome! I first went there to get some touch ups on an existing full sleeve. My artist Hanalei, their resident Polynesian master, did great work and I went back to have him do a custom chest and back piece for me. So far I have had about 20 hours+ worth of work done there and their reasonable shop rate has helped out with that. I would definitely go back. Very clean, great artists and loud music. It really has that feel like a "real" tattoo shop should.
