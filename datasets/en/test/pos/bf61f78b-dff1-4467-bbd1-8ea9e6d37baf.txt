Ever since TCBY was bought out in AZ I have been looking for a solid frozen yogurt place.  Golden Spoon worked for the most part, then I stopped in at Zoyo today and found my new go-to place.  I always test out a fro yo place with their chocolate and vanilla.  They were fantastic!  I love that they have fresh fruit for toppings (not the crap saturated in sugary syrup... yuck!).

I'll definitely be back... again, and again, and again!
