I love this boutique. By far one of the best vintage places around. You will almost always see Mle working away finding the best pieces not only for women but men as well. There is TONS of stuff here far beyond just clothes (which is unreal for how small it is). 5 out of 5 for being a refreshing new place to find incredible clothes and accessories of all kinds.
