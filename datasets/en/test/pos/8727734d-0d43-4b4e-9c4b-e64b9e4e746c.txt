21 Cakes is hands down my new favorite cupcake shop. I have tasted different flavors (banana nutella, salted caramel and cherry cupcakes) on 3 sperate occasions and they are all phenomenal.

Each cupcake I tried was moist and full of flavor. Best of all they don't drown the cake in frosting. It's a nice balance of both. 

The staff is beyond friendly and they have indoor and outdoor seating so you can stay and eat if you want (which I did). Next on my list to try is chocolate mint (it has an Andes mint on top - how can I not?)
