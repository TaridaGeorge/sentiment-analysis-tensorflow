I have been a client of Scott's Training Systems since March and I have lost 13% body fat!  They have been tremendous in creating customized workouts and eating plans that work for ME.  I am a busy working mom that has to travel for work sometimes and they have created a fitness/eating plan that is totally do-able.  I have other friends that are members and their plans are all different based on their goals - no cookie cutter, one-size-fits-all with these guys.  They are the real deal and it so nice to stop experimenting with all kinds of crazy diet plans and workouts - I just follow what they tell me and get results.
