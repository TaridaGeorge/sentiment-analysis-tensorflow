I will update this with a better address and directions, but this is one of my most favorite hikes when I am in AZ.  I can take the easy way and go up and down in an hour (quite a workout actually) or I can take more challenging and rocky routes to the top.  

Very nice little state park, well maintained with an interesting nature walk which identifies the plants and animals you might see while visiting.  The view from the top is great and you can see for miles, including the Fountain at Fountain Hills and also the layers of smog reaching toward Phoenix.  However, the air here is fresh and clear.

I love the desert, I love the sagurro, and I look forward to this hike every time I am in town.
