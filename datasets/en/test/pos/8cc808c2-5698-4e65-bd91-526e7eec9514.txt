This place has the best sushi in AZ, hands down.  In addition to the normal rolls, House has their specialty rolls, which were amazing.  Everyone that was at the restaurant with me loved their food.  The what the heck roll was so good that I ordered another.  Anyone who wants good sushi - just go to House and you won't be disappointed.
