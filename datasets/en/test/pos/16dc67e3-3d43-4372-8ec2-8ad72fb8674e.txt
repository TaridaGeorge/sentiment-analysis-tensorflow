We went here thanks to a Groupon I bought and am glad I did. We got a half dozen cupcakes and 2 cake pops. The cupcakes were great! I tried 3 different flavors, lemon/raspberry, chocolate cream cheese & chocolate chocolate, all we're fabulous. Next time we are in the area, we will be back.
On the service, we had a great experience. The guy who helped us stated that he was the baker and he was so helpful. Gave us his preferences and really did a great job describing all the cupcakes and pops.
