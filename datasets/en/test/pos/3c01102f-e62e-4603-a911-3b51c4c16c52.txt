Great ballpark. Just gorgeous with plenty of parking (5 bucks), nice grassy area if you can't get seats (us)...Yum food and drink. Saw my beloved Giants play the Diamondbacks (we won ...YAY! GO GIANTS!!). Lot's of practice fields and state of the art hitting cages. Looks like they poured a ton of money into this place and it's only used a few weeks out of the year.
