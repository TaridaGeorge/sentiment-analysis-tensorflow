This spa has the best amenities of any place I have ever been to.  Along with the standard sauna, steam room, and whirlpool they have a swedish shower, eucalyptus relaxation room, an outdoor waterfall grotto, a rooftop pool, lunch/dinner ordering and complimentary muffins and cookies, teas, coffee, and prickly pear lemonade all day.

I have had a relaxation massage and a pregnancy massage.  Both were wonderful.  The pregnancy massage was especially wonderful because they had a cutout in the bed so my belly could fit while I had a massage like a normal person - instead of having to be on my side which is what other places I have been to typically do.

It's very very expensive but worth every penny!  Spend a few hours there and go on a sunny day to enjoy the rooftop pool.
