My husband and I eat here about every other week. I've tried most of their wraps, homemade soups, and a few of their bowls. I've never had a bad meal here, it's a great place to go to get a healthy, reasonably priced, fast meal. They have really good iced tea and fresh lemonade, and their staff is always really nice. Also, they now have a $6 daily special. I would highly recommend That's a Wrap.
