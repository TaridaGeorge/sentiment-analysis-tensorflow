Super fresh, cheap price, high quality, big portions...these things don't usually go together...but they do at Sakana.  This is a nice little local joint that is busy, so you know the sushi is fresh out of the ocean.  They have an excellent lunch special where it is around 12 dollars and you get salad and about 10 big pieces of sushi...pretty amazing!  Also, if you don't dig sushi they have great bento boxes that have really great salmon and chicken.  Check this place out you will be pleased!
