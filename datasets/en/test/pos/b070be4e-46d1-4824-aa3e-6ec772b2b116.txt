Nate's Barber Shop has been at this location for 18 years now, but Nate is no longer alive. The shop is now owned by a father and son team who kept the business model the same. The father used to work for Nate, and he is now   the owner of the shop.

It's not a posh place, and more old school than upscale, but they do a good job.

I don't like to go to those snooty, toffee nose boutiques, and prefer to support  low maintenance shops like Nate's barber shop.

They take cash only. Good for them! Banks and merchants continue to rob small businesses with their high monthly fees, so I don't mind paying for my haircut with paper currency.
