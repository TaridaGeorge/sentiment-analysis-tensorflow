If you want a person who is willing to listen and investigate your aches and pains this is the guy for you. 

I had severe pain in my side to the back. It persisted for more than a year and I went to three internists seeking relief. None listen or cared and wanted to do whatever they wanted to do before addressing my concerns.

Jeffrey Trinka D.C. Listened and was able to give me the relief I was seeking. Dr. Trinka is a large man who is able to embrace a fat old fart like me fully and push and pull you in to shape. So give him a try when you are feeling crooked.
