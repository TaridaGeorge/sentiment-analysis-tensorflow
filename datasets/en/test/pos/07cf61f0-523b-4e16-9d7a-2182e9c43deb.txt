We had Calamari tempura, Boston roll, crunchy eel roll and Asian vodka. All were excellent!  Service was great (and fast!), staff was very friendly.  You are greeted in Japanese when you come in, and some the special plates & drinks are displayed at the door.  Although the place is small (can only seat about 50), there were 2 places we could sit when we got there about 7:30 pm on Sat.  We didn't need to wait at all.
We'll definitely be back.  I want to try their Happy Hour.  The menu has many creative items, and authentic complimentary items are a nice touch.  I would have liked to see a more extensive list of sushi rolls, but that's moot considering the extensive menu as a whole.
