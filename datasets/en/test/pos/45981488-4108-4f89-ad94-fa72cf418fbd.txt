I have yet to find a better mix of service and food at any Indian food restaurant. The place is dark, cool, and the food is incredible.

Palak Paneer - good for your vegetarian friends
Chicken Korma - sweet and savory flavors in a creamy
yellow sauce
Lamb Boti Kabab - the onions will melt in your mouth
Chicken Tikka Masala - tomato base with a little kick
Garlic Naan, I could go on and on...

Have the papadum and ask for the mango chutney as your appetizer. If you are so inclined, the veggie samosas are delicious with some of the tamarind sauce drizzled on top. Have some Indian Tea to drink, but save room for the Kheer for dessert.

They are also good for to-go orders and it's usually ready in minutes!
