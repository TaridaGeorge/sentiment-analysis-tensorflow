OMG!  We had the best lunch at Cafe Monarch a week ago!  We entered the restaurant and immediately Chris welcomed us and gave us options as to things to order.  We picked, he accommodated our special requests and we sat on the patio under an awning in the shade.  He brought us delicious Iced Tea with some sort of Hibiscus.  The food came relatively quickly and every bite kept getting better.  The combination of fresh ingredients, the choices that he used, you could taste the flavor of each different distinct element, all the time making the sum greater than the parts.  The conversation with Chris was also fun, we talked about life and it was much more in depth than you'd get at most places.  All in all, we are so grateful for Yelp finding this place for us and your recommendations which helped lead us there.
