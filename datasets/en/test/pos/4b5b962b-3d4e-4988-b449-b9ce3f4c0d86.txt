I just have one thing to say WINGS!!!! Wing Wing Wa, Wing Wing,Wing Wing! This location has the best BBQ wings. Go for the BBQ Wings and an Ice cold beer! And you can watch sports there TOO.

Unfortunately I have not been down to this location in a long time. I am closer to the Central location and go there regularly for the Friday FISH Fry! The Central Location serves up the best Catfish in town! 

****They deliver for Catered orders.
