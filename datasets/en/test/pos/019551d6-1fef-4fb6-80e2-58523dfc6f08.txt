After a day of sight seeing in the Flagstaff area, my daughter and I stopped in for dinner on way back to the East Valley. We were pleasantly surprised to find this restaurant with the help of YELP. Both of us had the meatballs they were excellent and really hit the spot. The perfect comfort food for weary hungry travelers. The staff was very nice, service was great and their deserts are to die for.
