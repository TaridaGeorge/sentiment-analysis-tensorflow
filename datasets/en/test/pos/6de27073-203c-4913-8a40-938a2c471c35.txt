Randy back in the hitch install bay is great. After another shop torqued my hitch down to 120ft lbs (really?!?!?!) he was quick to get it right and ease my mind. Work was quick and efficient, I would highly recommend Randy and the team here for hitch installation and service to anyone. Great job guys!
