I drive over 20 miles one-way just for the roast beef!  You can't get quality roast beef from any store today, not even the high end grocery stores.  But you can always get it at Casella's, and at a very reasonable price.  Sure, stop by for lunch and get your hogie and meatball sandwiches, every sandwich is made with love and they are all great.  But before you leave, ask for some sliced roast beef and some provolone to go.  You will never buy roast beef from ANY grocery store again!  BTW, get some cannolis too.  They are the bomb!
