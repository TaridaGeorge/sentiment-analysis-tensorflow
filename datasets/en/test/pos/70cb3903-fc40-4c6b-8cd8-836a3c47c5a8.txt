Came here tonight for my birthday... They have a vegetarian menu, woo hoo!!!! Went during Happy Hour, and had a Mai Tai (delicious), Fried Tofu (yummy!), and Eggplant with Garlic Sauce ( To die)... All my meal was extra-ordinary!  There were not a lot of people in the restaurant, which I prefer, and the waitress was so sweet! I will definitely be back next time I am in town!! Thanks guys!
