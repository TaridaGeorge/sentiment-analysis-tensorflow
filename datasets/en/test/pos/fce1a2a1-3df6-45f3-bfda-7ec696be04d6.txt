The food here is really spectacular!  We ordered the sweet potato planks, mussels and the shrimp and grits, and they were all delish!  The sweet potato planks are absolutely wonderful!  A must have for any visit there.  The little rounds of sweet potatoes topped with creme fraiche and topped with a piece of crispy pancetta!  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  And the herbed out peach tea was the perfect drink to go with my food.  The atmosphere is also wonderful.  It's very quaint and cozy, and has a really nice outdoor seating area.  I also love that this restaurant is right in my neighborhood!  This place is a true gem for the South Mountain area.
