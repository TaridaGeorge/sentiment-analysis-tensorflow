I love this place. It was so beautiful over the holidays with all the lights and garlands. I think the people who run this have a lot of pride in their business. The room was clean and the beds so comfortable. The decor is rustic but elegant at the same time. I liked how close we got to park to our room...super convenient. Lots of coupons given to us at checkin too. Great experience!
