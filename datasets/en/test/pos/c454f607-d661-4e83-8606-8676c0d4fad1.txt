Not sure what's up with all the hate for this place here on Yelp. If you show up any weekend you will find many fans of this place. I come here for the veal Marsala, bread, creamy Italian, atmosphere & service.  I love the olive oil and spices they put together for the warm bread, the creamy Italian dressing mixed salad is so flavorful, my Veal Marsala is so creamy and a little sweet just like i like it with the mushrooms mixed in.  This place is always busy and has a nice warm date night atmosphere with great booths and nice furniture.  The service has been always consistently good and I have been to a few locations over the years and everything is always consistent.
