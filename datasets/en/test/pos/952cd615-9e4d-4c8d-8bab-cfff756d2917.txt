I'd never really think to review Casey's if I wasn't leaving but I feel like I need to leave them a love note.

Casey Moore's has been my go-to late night spot for a long time now. The best part about Casey's is the variety of the crowd. I feel like everytime I go there to see one group of friends I end up running into several others that I know.

I'll definitely miss hanging out with everyone here on a Friday or Saturday (or Thursday or Wednesday or any) night. 

The service isn't always fantastic, the food is greasy bar food, but it's home. And for that I love them.
