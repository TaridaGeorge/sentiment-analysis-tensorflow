What a perfect, friendly, tasty meal we had there last night!  The absolute quintessential italian neighborhood kind of place - a little kitchy, a lot tasty, and an inviting staff and warm and friendly owner.   Butternut Squash Ravioli in a brown butter sauce (one of the limited rotating specials) was perfect, and the very large portion of lasagna (at just $13.5) was almost as good as mom's :).  Smallish, quaint, a touch of cheese on the billboard ("As seen on TV") make it a perfect spot for a quiet romantic dinner as well as a group of 6-8.  Larger groups may be challenged as I don't *think* they take reservations - but check on that ....
