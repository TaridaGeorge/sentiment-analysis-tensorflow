No hands down, the best place on Mill Avenue. your head will spin with their selection of used books and although the small space can feel suffocating in the summer months, it is truly, a one-of-a-kind place. The little old lady who owns the place is super helpful and can tell you if they have certain titles in stock...off the top of her head, without a computer. I've gotten beautiful vintage versions (Modern Library) of Dostoevsky, Kafka, and so on for very cheap. One of the only things I miss about living close to Tempe.
