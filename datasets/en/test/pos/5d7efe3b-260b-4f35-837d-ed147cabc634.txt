When I think of gelato, I automatically think of the Gelato Spot. First spotted them years back on Camelback and I've been a fan ever since. My favorite is the Stracciatella and all others fall into place. 
Their free Wi-Fi is always on and is an added touch. Let's you just sit and relax and not head for the door.
Keep up the good work.
