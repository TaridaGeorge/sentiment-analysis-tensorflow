I've died and gone to cake heaven. I'm a self taught baker & been to decorating stores in LA & Vegas. This place surpasses any store I've been to. 

They have aisles of cupcake/cake toppers. Every color sprinkles, candles & food coloring dyes. Every size of cardboard cake bases, pans, doilies & cupcake/cake boxes. Tons of sugar decorations like shells, flowers, shapes & holiday that make the pefect touch on a cake. 

I wish there was more selection on cupcake liners. Service was great & On point.
