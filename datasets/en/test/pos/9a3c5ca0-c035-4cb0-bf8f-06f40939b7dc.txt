I still love this place, however their desserts need some work. I've tried the Salted Caramel Sundae and on my most recent visit, I tried the Chocolate Bouchon. Nothing to write home about. Save your money and go to Grateful Spoon Gelato (which is in the same parking lot as Postinos). I'll still give the other two desserts at Postinos a try, but so far I'm unimpressed. 

Still gets 5 stars because everything else at Postinos is simply amazing and delicious.
