I really don't understand all the complaints about this place.  I've been going here for years, and the food has always been solid, cheap, quick and really tasty.  The menu is huge, and I have no complaints about the service or cleanliness of the place, either.  

I usually get the fried tofu with garlic sauce.  It's transcendent.  Crispy, delicious triangles of fried tofu and a fantastic mushroom-garlic-onion sauce with some brown rice....I have dreams about it.  If I have the cash, I'll get some spring rolls with spicy mustard, which are a hot, crispy delight.

Haters gonna hate, I guess.  I just wish it was open all night!
