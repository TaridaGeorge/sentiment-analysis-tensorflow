I give Cooperstown a five star - based on their pricing alone.  I ate lunch with 2 kids and our bill was $30 with tip.  The food is nothing fancy - just delicious and refreshing on a hot day.  The girls said their chicken fingers and mac and cheese was good and I really enjoyed the Ty Cobb Salad.  Also, love the giant glasses of iced tea.  

The service was attentive and quick for being so busy.  Neat place to go overall.
