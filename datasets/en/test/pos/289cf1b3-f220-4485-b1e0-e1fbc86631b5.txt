I went to Tryst Cafe as part of a Gluten Free Foodie Tour (#GFFoodieTour) and am now a huge fan! We all split several gluten free breakfast items so I got a chance to taste the waffles, Hawaiian bowl, pancake, scrambled salmon hash and bagels. If you eat gluten free you know the texture can often be a challenge for restaurants, but everything I tried was fab - especially the bagel (Which is Udi's) and the waffles!

I don't get up to this part of town often, but I will go out of my way to go to Tryst Cafe again!
