it was delicious.  We were freaking out and coughing about how hot the jalapenos were.  They sat the 4 of us at a gigantic circular table for 8.  We couldn't reach anything that was in the middle of the table and were a good 6 feet away from the person across from us. You may think it will be cool and adventurous to order the salted lemonade... but, don't do it. We will be back soon... after smoking a blunt of course.
