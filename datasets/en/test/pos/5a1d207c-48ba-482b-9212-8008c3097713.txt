Rating the CAFE only not the museum (didn't go into it).... lovely building, and this cafe is fabulous.... fresh, local farms, some organic... the beets and greens were out of this world.  I had braised mix of beet greens, mustard.., black beens, and 2.5 slices of fresh turkey breast and a nice sized GF cookie for $11.75 - - not bad for a dinner like meal of this quality.  Wow, just finishing the cookie, might be one of the best GF cookies i've had... fresh, peanut cookie... (The packaged/processed ones i've had from the stores have actually given me an upset stomach).  Bravo... Keep up the good work, and I'll be back!
