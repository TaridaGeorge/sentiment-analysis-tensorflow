Having visited this restaurant on numerous occasions, I knew I needed to write an updated review.  The double Cortadito is a favorite when I am in the mood for coffee.  Breakfast is exceptional and the "Best Chicken Sandwich" is entirely aptly named, so much so that I rarely order other items, though I have on occasion enough to know that everything here is good.
