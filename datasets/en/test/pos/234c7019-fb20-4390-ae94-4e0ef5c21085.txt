First off I must say the folks that run this family owned and operated restaurant are by far the friendliest restaurant owners I have ever met. All the food is homemade and really does taste like the food your Grandma would make. I highly recommend the Chicken Cordon Bleu. Unlike a regular cordon bleu made with Swiss cheese, the folks at The Beaver make theirs with brie which adds a unique twist on a classic. A very rich mushroom gravy sat atop real mashed potatoes as the side. Make sure you ask for a sampler plate and for all the Abba fans that swear this group was Sweden's greatest export you will be very happy to know that Abba always plays in the background at this place.
