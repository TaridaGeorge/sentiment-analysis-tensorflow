This place is great. The food, atmosphere, and service. We have been multiple times now and tried burgers, pizza, and salads. We have not eaten anything that has not been outstanding. Every time we go the owner and his wife are there and come and visit every table. They have a very large selection of beer, which the owner went over in detail with my girlfriend. It is complimentary valet parking, walk up a small flight of stairs, and enter a dimly lit posh restaurant, but you do not pay the posh price. It's such a great place to wine and dine guest too!
