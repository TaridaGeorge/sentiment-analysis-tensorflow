This place was reasonably priced, and had very good sports-bar food, along with a great selection of beers. I went with a group of 3, and we all enjoyed our meals. I recommend the Mediterranean Gyro.

The service was well above average for a sports bar, and the food / atmosphere were better. (We went during the NCAA Championship)

I will probably eat here again when I'm back in town.
