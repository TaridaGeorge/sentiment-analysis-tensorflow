Eddie Matney once cooked for us at a friend's surprise birthday party, so I was ecstatic when he opened up his new restaurant by my house. I can't wait to go back! The service was excellent and the food was incredible. 

Eddie puts an amazing twist on ordinary dishes. My favorite is the tuna tartar nacho appetizer. The spaghetti egg roll appetizer is also amazing. I was so full from the appetizers and gourmet bread that I could barely eat the bacon infused meatloaf I ordered. Amazing!
