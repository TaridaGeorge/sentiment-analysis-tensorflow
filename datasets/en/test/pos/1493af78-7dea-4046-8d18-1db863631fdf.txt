Wow what an experience! My friend and I stayed one night here while attending a design conference in Phoenix (hotel is walking distance from conference center and numerous restaurants). The Palomar experience started when we pulled into valet and lasted till we checked out. Everyone was friendly and helpful and you honestly felt like you might just be the most important guest they had! The rooms were impeccable, the furniture had a modern aesthetic and even embraced a bit of my typography passion! Also a huge fan of the soy milk option at the morning coffee and tea bar! I will definitely be staying here again.
