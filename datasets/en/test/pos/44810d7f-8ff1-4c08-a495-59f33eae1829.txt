Saw the bad review and had to put my 2 cents in!  I've been going to see Dr. Lucas since I was a teenager, and have never had a problem with her.  She is thorough, and is very friendly and has never had a bad attitude with me.  With the exception of one surly medical assistant extern, I haven't ever been talked down to or treated rudely by the staff.  As long as I'm in the Tempe area, I'll continue to see her.
