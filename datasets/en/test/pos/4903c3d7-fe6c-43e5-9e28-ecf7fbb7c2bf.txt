Yelp is telling me to review this location because I checked in here recently. Very weird because I thought I wrote one long, long ago since PJ is my favorite place for light, healthy (sometimes) food. I've been to pretty much all PJ locations but this is my most visited since it's in my hood. I regularly get take out and frequently dine in. My favorites are the broiled chicken salad, shawarma pita, falafel pita, glazed chicken lavosh pizza, all of the hummus but especially the cilantro jalapeno, tzatziki and pita chips, fruit and cheese "fantasia", and probably more I can't remember at the moment. Happy hour rocks, the prices are great for the portion sizes. I love that they now have most of their nutrition information on their web site (you might not want to look....some of it is scary!)
