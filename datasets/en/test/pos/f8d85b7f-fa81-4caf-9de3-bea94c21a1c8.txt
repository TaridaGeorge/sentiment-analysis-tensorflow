Scramble gets 5 stars in my book for having a vegan menu! Usually vegan breakfasts are limited to oatmeal and fruit cups, so I was pleasantly surprised to actually stumble across several options to choose from! The soyrizo tofu scramble burrito was pretty tasty, nothing crazy special. I was so happy that they had nutritional yeast, I added that for a cheesy kick. Cute place, wish there was one in the east valley!
