Oh man...if I lived in Phoenix, I would be here all the time. I stayed at a hotel right near here and tried it, not expecting too too much. But then I saw the awesome looking teriyaki bowls on the wall and I grew much more optimistic. I should have been let down...but I most certainly wasn't. 

The price was fantastic, and the portion size was fantastic. Not only that...but it tasted really really goooooood! I wish I could have had the time to go back to try more stuff as the beef teriyaki that I got was fantastic.
