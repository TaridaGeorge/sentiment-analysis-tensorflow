okaaaay...!  freaking yumm!  skeptical...just cuz i am... and i'm not a big sub person... too much bread in a carb addicted world w a 5ft bod... took me almost 2 months to check this place out... took awesome advice...order the "#9 mike way"  they cook their roast beef on the premises daily.. i'm a sucker for a good roast beef... won't eat if not worthy...
sooooo good!  ate the whole frickin thing... my friend got the philly cheese steak w jalepeno...darn tasty.....and a peanut butter cookie that i wished would never end.,.  top that off w yummo iced and great service w an affordable price(don't know where other peeps think too high.... for what you get, i'm down w it!) 
only problem....  i need to go back daily to sample whole menu....and i'm already craving another #9 mikes way...see my prob?
def b back sooner than not!
