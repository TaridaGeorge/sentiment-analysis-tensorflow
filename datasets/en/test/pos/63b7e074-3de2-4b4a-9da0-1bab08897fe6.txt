I did not stay here but did visit because I wanted to check it out for my next Arizona trip. I was pleased on all aspects! its gorgeous inside and out. The outside has waterways and gardens and the inside is hip n trendy but classy feel. The rooms are private w balconies overlooking the pond and pool area. The pool area has real sand instead of cement so its very tropical! The customer service stood out by far!
