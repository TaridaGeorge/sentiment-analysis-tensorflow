Definitely my favorite place to go for sushi. The rotating bar is fun and usually has a good selection of different rolls. It's also nice to be able to make special orders and requests. Great staff! Antony is so friendly and personable that I've actually gone in for lunch specifically to tell him about a new job, show him a hair cut, etc..  The music selection is very modern and they do get very busy during certain hours. It's a great place to hang out or do business.
