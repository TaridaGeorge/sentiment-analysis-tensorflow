Came here last for a wonderful dinner. Even though it was St. Pat's Day we opted to stay out of the craziness.  
We were greeted right away by a friendly staff. We were given a really nice booth and got our drinks right away. They continued to fill our drinks all through dinner, coffee and ice Tea. Our dinner was incrediable!! Really good chicken quesadilla and then i had a grilled chicken salad, my girlfriend and the ribs and Chicken. You  can choose 2 sides, any thing they have. She got the spring Vegtables and Burgundy mushrooms. Fantatic meal. No way to eat it all, so the dog was happy when we got home. 
We can't wait to go again.
