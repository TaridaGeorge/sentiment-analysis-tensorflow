If you like great fried chicken or catfish, run, don't walk to Lo-Lo's. The fried chicken is the best in Phoenix. Throw in a waffle - yes it's amazing - and a side of beans on rice, greens, mac and cheese and yams and you'll be set for the day, and left-overs tomorrow. The neighborhood is a bit rough around the edges, but that adds to the adventure. And there's one in Scottsdale just north of SkySong on Scottsdale Road. This is one of our favorite places to go in Phoenix. Highly recommended.
