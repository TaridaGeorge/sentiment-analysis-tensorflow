It's refreshing to find a dental practice that actually cares for their patients. I had a wonderful experence at Simply Dentistry. The staff is top notch and Dr. Tran is as nice as they come. I felt she took a genuine interest in my dental needs without trying to "upsell" me things that were not necessary. The office has a minimalist  modern vibe and champions    green design with various info panels describing their commitment to sustsinablity. In addition I loved the flat screen t.v's on the ceiling to watch while you getting dental  work done. After two terrible experences with dentists where you felt like a number it was a welcome suprise to recieve a hand written thank you after my visit. Highly recommended!
