This is truely one of the best places in downtown Phoenix. The food and drinks are consistently great and the people there are really friendly and courteous. The music they play is right up my alley but may not appeal to most people. This is definitely a casual place which I really like but if you're looking for a posh, trendy place this probably isn't for you. All in all, Carly's is just about a weekly occurance for me and mine.
