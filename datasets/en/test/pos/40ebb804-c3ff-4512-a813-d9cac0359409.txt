I LOVE Lux. I know- parking can sometimes be a bear, it's usually pretty crowded, and the ordering line can be somewhat chaotic. But I just LOVE it! The coffee is the best in Phoenix, food is great, atmosphere is artsy and energizing, the new building has tons of room to do work or sit down with a friend... I bring all my out of towners here and they always love it. I brought my Italian cousin to Lux during his first trip to America (he was doing a cross-country road trip and Phoenix was the last stop). He said that it was the best cafe in America and wanted to replicate it in Italy. Lux, I love you. Don't ever leave. Ever.
