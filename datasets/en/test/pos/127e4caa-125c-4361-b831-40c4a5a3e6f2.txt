I just plain love Guido's. There's something almost magical about the glow of Christmas lights in the window, the arrangement of black and white memorabilia photos on the walls and the deli/market layout. My other half is from Chicago and last night he was in food heaven. He had the gnocchi and I had the mostaccioli -- yum and yum!
