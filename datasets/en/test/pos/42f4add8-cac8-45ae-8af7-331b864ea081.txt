OMG- Forget In n Out! This place is fantastic! Ordered the cheeseburger with light mayo, grilled onions and pickles and wow, you are in hamburger heaven. Simply delicious. The cheese is melted perfectly, the patty is juicy  and the fries are good, with cajun seasoning. I'm not a huge fan of In N Out like most Angelenos, so when my friends said they compare this place to In N Out, I was a little reluctant to try it, but I'm glad I did!  I definitely love Five Guys  rather than In N Out! The next time I'm in AZ, I will place my order online. Oh, did I forget to mention that? You can order online and pick up your order! Awesome!
