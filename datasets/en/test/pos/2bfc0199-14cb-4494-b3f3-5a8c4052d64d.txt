A new, wine bar has just opened on Central Avenue. "Timo" occupies a storefront that used to house a firestation (Bomberos). The bruschetta was amazing. The server informed us that all breads are baked fresh in-house daily. The ambiance was lovely and the decor was contemporary. They have a unique wine list. I tried the wood fired sandwich with copa, prosciutto and brie cheese. My wife had the lemon oregano chicken. We finished dinner with the chocolate creme brulee with brandied cherries. All in all a memorable atmosphere.
