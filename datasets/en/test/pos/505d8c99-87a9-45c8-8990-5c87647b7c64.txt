If you like great prime steaks, this is the place for you. Dined here last night for our fourth visit, and it was awesome as usual. The filet is so frickin awesome I can't seem to get to any of the other delicious looking entrees. I tasted companion's sweet desert shrimp and found it wonderfully smoky. I ordered a Sazerac to drink, but they had no absinthe.   I ordered a glass of wine which came accompanied by an original cocktail offered up as a complimentary sub for my Sazerac. Thanks for making me feel like a bigshot! Get a table by the window for a charming view.
