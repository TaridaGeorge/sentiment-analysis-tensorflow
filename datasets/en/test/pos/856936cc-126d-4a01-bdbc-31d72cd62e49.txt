I almost didn't go after reviewing some of the other reviews but I went and was I ever happy Our server was B.G. and was great, it was delightful sitting on the patio drinks were good food was great burger and chicken sandwich were great. Loved the pretzel bun. 
I think sometimes fellow yelpers are a little too critical it is not dietetic but yummy good service good food . we will be back
