I grew up in Arizona and always enjoy visiting to enjoy the great restaurants. Chelsea's Kitchen is now one of my favorite dining spots. I recently was in Arizona for college graduation and my parents took me to Chelsea's Kitchen to celebrate.

The atmosphere is great and the service was fantastic. Most importantly the food BLEW MY MIND! Everything I ate was delicious! I recommend the tacos, (I personally had the swordfish tacos) homemade guacamole and make sure to try the ceviche. 

My dad had the burger and he raved about how great it was. I was also surprised at how delicious the French fries were.

I have always been a huge fan of Le Grande Orange, but I think Chelsea's Kitchen is 10 times better! 

I can't wait to return to Arizona to enjoy this place again!
