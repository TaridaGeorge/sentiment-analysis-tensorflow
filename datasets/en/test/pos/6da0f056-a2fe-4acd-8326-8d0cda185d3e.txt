Very cool little restaurant.  I imagine it would be very easy to drive right past this place...no sign!  I ordered the grilled baguette, lobstah mac and cheese, and the daily special: fish and chips.  My boyfriend and I shared each plate. Everything was delicious!  The olive oil served with the baguette was so delicious--complex and grassy.  The lobstah mac and cheese definitely delivered on the lobstah! The fish and chips was a nice surprise; tender, moist cod and thick-cut chips.  We were there during happy hour, and I ordered the Sunbru michelada...I can't believe this drink got me to enjoy beer! I never drink beer!  In all, this was a great place!!
