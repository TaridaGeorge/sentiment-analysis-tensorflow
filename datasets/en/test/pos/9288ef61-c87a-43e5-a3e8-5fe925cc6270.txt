Char's is an excellent venue for live music. It's a great mix of people (I see anyone from people in their early 20s through 70s) who are their for good music. It's also not a pretentious place, which is a welcomed change from the Scottsdale scene a few miles away. 

Make sure to stop in when the Bad News Blues are playing. It really picks up around 10:30pm on the weekends so stop in early if you want a good table.
