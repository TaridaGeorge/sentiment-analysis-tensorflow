Zipps is my husband and my favorite restaurant.  We LOVE the food.  Love is almost an understatement.  Their sweet jalapeno sauce is to die for.....The service is for the most part pretty good....but the food makes up for it if the servers are busier than normal.  The only bad thing is if it's too crowded inside, you have to sit on the patio with all of the smokers which is gross especially when trying to eat, but they have to cater to everyone.  All in all, get the jalapeno burger or the monacco foccacia.  DELICIOUS!
