breakfast. BREAKFAST. breakfast. Wow. Reasonable prices, gigantic portions and mouth watering recipes. 
 I don't recall the exact name of my meal choice, but it was something along the lines of "southwest veggies", which included a flatbread smothered with hummus and topped with eggs, black beans and veggies.  It was mouth watering.  I also snatched a little of the boy's omelet when he wasn't looking - equally delicious. 
The ambiance was cute.  A quaint little restaurant in a residential district a few blocks from DT.  The house was renovated into a restaurant and the courtyard and outside bar was a perfect way to spend a Sunday morning drinking a bloody mary. 
I wish I had more time during my stay to try everything on the menu.  Let's just say - if I were a Phoenician - this would be my local breeze!
