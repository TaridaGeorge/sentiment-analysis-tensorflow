We started by walking in thru one of the biggest doors I have ever seen - into a restaurant full of excellent ambiance. For starters, we split the rolled mozzarella with tomatoes, and a Cesar salad that featured fresh Parmesan cheese, olive tapenade, and a very savory dressing. My date had the herb chicken with fingerling potatoes and spinach - chicken was perfectly cooked and delicious. I had the grilled salmon over angel hair pasta with mushrooms.  Watching the owner cook our meals was a real treat. Our dinners were both perfect. Our service staff was helpful and attentive. On our way out, Eddie took time to shake our hands and asked how we enjoyed our night. I do not give many 5 star reviews, but our entire experience at Eddie's House was wonderful. We are very much looking forward to returning.
