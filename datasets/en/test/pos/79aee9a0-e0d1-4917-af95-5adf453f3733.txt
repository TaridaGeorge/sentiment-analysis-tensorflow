This is an amazing restaurant and a jewel of a find in AZ!  When you step into the restaurant you are immediately transported from the Southwest to Paris!  I was shocked... Yes... Really shocked to find to find the place. All of the staff love the restaurant and specialize in one thing or another. The food, wine, atmosphere, and ABSINTHE (yes, absinthe) are spot on!  Dustin is the sommelier and knows his stuff about French wines. 

Try the bouillabaisse, grilled asparagus, and the escargot!  You won't be disappointed. 

Most important!!!!!! Have the Absinthe!! It's prepare authentically and is fantastic. 

Bottom line:  This is a MUST try restaurant anywhere. It's one of my new favorite haunts!!!!!!
