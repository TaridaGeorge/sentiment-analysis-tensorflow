This is the greatest restaurant I've ever been to.  But I love rock music.  If you hate rock music and baseball and you have no sense of humor, you probably won't get as much of a kick out of this place as we always do.  We ALWAYS go here when we're in Phoenix.  Good food, awesome decor and quirky menu choices like "Wings of Mass Destruction" and "Megadeth Meatloaf."
