Interior: 10/10, Food: 9/10, Service: 9/10.

I lived in Hawai'i for a few years and miss the Asian inspired Pacific style dishes. Like fellow Yelper, Jennifer, mentioned, Kona is very similar to Roy's.

The huge fish tanks and interior of this place is very nice.

The food is awesome! I'm addicted and could eat here every day.  I only wish the portions were a bit larger.

Would I go back? Every time I have a chance.
