Got here around 7pm, the cashier got to us fast, asked if we knew what to do, and we were on or way to snag some yummy Mongolion Grill food!!!

There wasn't a long wait in line to grab food, or a long wait for them to cook your food! The resturaunt is clean, and the interior is roomy and doesn't feel cramped. They have vanilla, chocolate, or the vanilla chocolate swirl froyo in a cup or cone included with your meal.

The on on McClintock can't compare, but they are usually backed up with families. Since this location is a little more "hidden" you can enjoy a quiet night with family or friends while you enjoy your meal :)
