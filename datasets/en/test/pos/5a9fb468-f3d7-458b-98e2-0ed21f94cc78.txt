Dr. Angel's office is amazing. Her staff is very personable, skilled and efficient with clients' time. They use sonic picks and digital imaging which provides for a speedy, comfortable service. Dr. Angel is a skilled dentist who seeks a minimalist approach, rather than immediately pushing surgery our other high dollar procedures. I've never had a billing issue and my appointments have always been on time.
