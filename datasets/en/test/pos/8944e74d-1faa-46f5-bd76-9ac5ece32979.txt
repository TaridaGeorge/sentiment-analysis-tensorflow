I can't say enough good things about this hotel. The staff went out of their way to make my boyfriend and I comfortable. The breakfast buffet was much more than I expected. The room was incredible: very large and well-equipped with a full sized fridge and other kitchen amenities. 

I will be returning to this hotel in the future!
