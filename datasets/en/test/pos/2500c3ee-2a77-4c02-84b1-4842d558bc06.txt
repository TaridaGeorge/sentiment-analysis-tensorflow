Gourmet magazine turned us on to this place. The lines to get in are LONG, be prepared to bring patience with you when you go. They do not take reservations for groups less than 6ppl. But the wait is well worth it! There is nothing on the menu that is not good...even items you would not normally like or order...they are all good! Favorite Pizza place in the world!
