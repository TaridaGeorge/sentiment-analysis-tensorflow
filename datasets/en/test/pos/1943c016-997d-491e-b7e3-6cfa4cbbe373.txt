I had the Mexican Chocolate latte and the Veggie Hash.  When you're traveling and want unique food, it's often difficult to get the right servings of vegetables.  Nearly impossible for breakfast, but this place does an amazing job with it's veggie hash. It's a veggie dish with beets, green beans...well just look at the menu :D  

It was amazing.  The eggs were perfect, and it looked like they made their own english muffins, or ordered them from a bakery, or something.  They definitely were store bought.  

I also got the sMoCA mocha to go.  It was also very good.  I'm going to have a difficult time considering another place tomorrow. 

It's slightly off the beaten path, but it's worth the find.  If you're driving it's right next to the parking garage.
