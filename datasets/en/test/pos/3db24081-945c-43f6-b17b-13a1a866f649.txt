A few weeks ago someone backed into me in a parking lot.  

Needless to say, no one likes having an accident nor dealing with the aftermath of working wth claims adjusters, etc.  It's all a hassle, but Gerber made it easy & far less painless.  From Meg at reception to Keith who worked with me and walked me through the process.  They were all great.  

Now that I have my car back all I want to do is forget about the whole thing, but I do remember the folks at Gerber and how happy I was that I went there.  WOW!
