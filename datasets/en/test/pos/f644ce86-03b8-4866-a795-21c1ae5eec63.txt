Beyond adorable ice cream and candy shop!  There is a limited number of flavors but with all the different topping you can invent your own!

I love that they have a sorts of fun little trinkets and toys.  A great place to take your kids or satisfy a sweet tooth after having a meal at Windsor next door.
