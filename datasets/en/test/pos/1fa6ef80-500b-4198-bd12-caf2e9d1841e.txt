SR is on my way home from work just off the 101 and Shea.  I've stopped there half a dozen times in the last several months and enjoyed the most incredible ice cream ever.  Yesterday, I had the Key Lime Pie ice cream and thought I had died and entered key lime heaven.  I LOVE key lime pie and this is better!  The ice cream creates a greater depth of flavor and a wonderful mouth feel that pie can't compare to.  The graham crust inside is also nice and crunchy.  Get this flavor while you can.
