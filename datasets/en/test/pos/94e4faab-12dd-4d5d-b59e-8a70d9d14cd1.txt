I love the ambiance of this place. The rustic feel, the soft glow, the smell of delicious food. How can you resist? I ordered the Rosa pizza. It had Arizona pistachios, red onion, rosemary, and cheese. It was absolutely perfect. The whole party had a bite and it was unanimous. That pizza was delicious. A very unique pizza indeed.
