Lamar's donuts came very highly recommended by a coworker so my boss brought some to the office for everyone to try.  My favorite go-to donut is the Boston Cream so I decided to sample that one first.  It was good but tasted like a Boston Cream donut from just about anywhere else.  It wasn't until after I tried the Boston Cream that I was told about how the chocolate glazed were the real special ones.  So I gave that one a shot and WOW.... it actually was very very good and dare I say outstanding.  Crispy cream and Dunkin can suck it!
