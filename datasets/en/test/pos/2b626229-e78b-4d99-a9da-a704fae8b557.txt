Like you care, but this is where I do my grocery shopping. 
But you should care...you know why?
Because Safeway, this Safeway in particular, is full of old people.
And why is that important?
It's not.
Except for when there's only you and one of them headed for that open checkout stand.

Never a wait.
Not here.
