What an extraordinary resort this is. One of a kind that will never be forgotten. Built into the side of a mountain to co-exist with it.   Natural and architectual beauty wherever you look. Even in the cafe which has an exposed boulder face for a wall with a great view of the surrounding area. There I surely room for improvement with respect to the food. They can't cook a burger properly, but they sure make a a great egg white omlette.
