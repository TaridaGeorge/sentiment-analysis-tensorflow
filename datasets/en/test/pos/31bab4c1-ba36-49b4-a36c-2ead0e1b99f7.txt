This place isn't in my neighborhood but I wish it was.  For a Thursday afternoon at 2 there was a line, always a good sign.  I got the falafel pita which was nom nom delicious.  It also came with a greek salad that was fresh and crisp, lots of feta, tomatoes and olives.  The pita was thick and chewy the falafel crispy on the outside, soft and not dry on the inside.  There is a delicate balance when making falafel!
For under $10 dollars I got a plate full of food and a glass of wine, perfect!
