Pretty much the best pure veggie chow around.

Their not-chicken sandwich with fake cheese is better in some ways than the real thing.  You're not always reminded that you're eating vegetarian when eating here.  It's just tasty.  

A veggie place that you can take anyone and have them enjoy it is a great and rare find.  This is such a place.
