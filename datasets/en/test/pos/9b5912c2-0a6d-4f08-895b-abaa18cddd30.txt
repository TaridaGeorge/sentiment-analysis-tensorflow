This is my preferred place to sell my clothes, the staff is always friendly, they always give me good prices on my clothes, and they usually have some good stuff to trade for.

They also make it easy to donate the items they won't buy, and they tell you if they would buy your items during a different season so you know what to bring back...all good stuff!
