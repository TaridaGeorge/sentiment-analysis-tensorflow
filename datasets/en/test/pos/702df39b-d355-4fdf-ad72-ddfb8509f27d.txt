Dr O is the best, she has cared for our brood for years.  All of our pets are family there.  It is a very cat friendly office and the staff are always responsive and helpful.  You never feel like another customer here, there is obvious serious concern and caring for the well being of the "babies".  We have Dr Oyan to thank for saving the life of our Bailey and Ashley they both separately developed life threatening illnesses and she got them through it all, both are happy healthy kitties.
