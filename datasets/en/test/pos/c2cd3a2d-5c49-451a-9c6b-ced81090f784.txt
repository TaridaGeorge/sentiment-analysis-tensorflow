I went here with a friend after he saw it recommended by Guy Fieri on the food network. It's a true dive; it can only fit about 25 people, your really never going to avoid a long wait and it's nothing special on the inside.

That aside, the food is RIDICULOUS. The butter burger is easily the best burger I've ever had. It's incomparable. I got a side of country fries which were also insanely delicious and tried the waffles which were unmatched in quality. They actually added a slight seasoning to the waffles which give it a nice touch to the sweetness.

Highly recommended!
