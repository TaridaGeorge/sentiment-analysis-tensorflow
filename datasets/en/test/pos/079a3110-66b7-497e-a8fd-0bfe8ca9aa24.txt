I make a trip to the atm just to come to Lee's. You have to eat the bread fresh. Period. It doesn't help any that they come in a paper sleeve...

Secret: Buy in bulk, cut into pieces, and store in ziploc bags. Then, just nuke em for a few second. Good as new.

Enough with the bread. The iced coffee is ridiculous. It is pure espresso and cream. So sweet and strong. Dear lord I love it.

The sandwiches are good. Boyfriend loves the "croissant" side of the menu for the white folks. I'll eat anything, but I do like the bbq pork and grilled chicken sandwiches best. 

While you're over there, head to LeeLee supermarket and buy a live crab, some rice noodles, or whatever Asian goodies your heart desires.
