Best Burger I have ever had hands down!!!!  I had a mushroom burger filled with some exotic cheese in the center!!!!!  Beyond Amazing!  Chased down with a great beer!  They have quite a selection to choose from. Atmosphere great, service excellent, food to die for!!!!!  Wish there was one in Calif.:(
