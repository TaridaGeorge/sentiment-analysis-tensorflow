Phoenix finally has a juice bar!! I've been dying for something like this and now that it is finally here I can't say enough good things. Alexandra, the owner, is so knowledgeable about all things juicing and truly cares about her customers. Every time I've been in she makes recommendations based on what I'm looking for. 

In addition the the awesome service, I love the juice here. Not only is it fresh and flavorful, but there is such a variety that I am constantly finding myself ordering/trying something new each time I come in. Every single thing is so delicious. I am a huge fan of the quinoa salads--they come in huge portions and make for a perfect lunch when paired with a juice, and you will still have some left over for later.
