Our experience on New Year's Eve was perfect. The gentleman who held the door for us upon entering the restaurant was extremely polite and welcoming. We later found out he was the general manager. He ensured we had a fantastic evening. It is easy to see he cares about his guests and his business, and takes pride in what he does. Both the food and the service kicked off our night the right way. Thank you.
