Wow, serious burgers served here! If you are in the mood for a burger then i can't think of a better place to go. They also serve italian beef, chicken sandwiches, sausage sandwiches and chicago style dogs (I'll have to try that next time, they might serve as a respectable hold-over when a proper trip to johhny's isn't in the cards). Everything is made from scratch when ordered.
