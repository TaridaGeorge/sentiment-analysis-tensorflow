See my avatar?  That my friends, is a Tyson Crosbie original.  Word on the street is that he steals souls for a living, but not to worry since he actually gives them back.  ;)

Here's what I love about Tyson's method; he's all about capturing the real you and not the posed, fake mannequin 'you' that you try to pull off every time you take a picture.  Another great thing about Tyson's process is that he provides real, honest feedback from other creative individuals to help you see things things in your photo that you would probably miss.  Ultimately, I highly recommend Tyson for your photography needs.  ;)
