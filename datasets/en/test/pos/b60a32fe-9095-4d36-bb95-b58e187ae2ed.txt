Yes, it is small, yes, it takes time to get your order, but the quality of the food serve is excelent !!! Celina is the name of the owner (not Selena) of this fabulus resturant.  She takes your order, runs to the kitchen and then she serves your order too. I wouldn't say that this is a one person resturant, because she has help in the kitchen.  
Very few Mexican resturants in Phoenix serve food as good as this one. The Menu is limited but whatever you order you will not be disappointed.
