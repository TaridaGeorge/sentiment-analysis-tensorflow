It's 4 Peaks. 4peaks is awesome. What more do you need to know???

Fantastic beer? Check. (best heff around. Kiltlifter always a staple too.)

Great food? Double check. (nachos are amazing, wings are great, margarita pizza is wonderful. You won't get a better Veggie Burger at any other bar in the valley.)

Parking? Parking is... well... parking really, really blows.

That's pretty much all you need to know. My advice if you don't like crowds is to pick your spots and get there early. (I'll skip going there for the Big Game, as they'll be stupidly packed, but they are my 1st choice for weekend day drinking, and have been for years.)
