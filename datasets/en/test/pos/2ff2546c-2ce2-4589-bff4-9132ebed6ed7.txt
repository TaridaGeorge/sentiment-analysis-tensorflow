A gelato place in the middle of Chandler, AZ. Yeah, go figure. 

But once you walk in there, you see all the wonderful gelato flavors waving a big hello to you. They carry a variety of flavors that you probably wouldn't find at your local gelato store - they have many unique blends! 

The owner of the shop was very nice and friendly.  The store is pretty cute too and had comfortable seating to enjoy your gelato. One neat thing about this place was this adorable little water dispenser right by the register that you can help yourself to get a cup of water. I had a lot of fun with that. :)
