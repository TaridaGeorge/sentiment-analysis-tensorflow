I LOVE pinnacle peak park! Even the park ranger people are so sweet.

We just moved to the area and I love hiking anyways, so it this is just the cream of the crop! I had to write a review today because we saw a BOBCAT tonight!!!! Yes, a real-life bobcat! It was so little that I was only scared for the first second
