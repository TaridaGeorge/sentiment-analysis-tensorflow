We went to Bliss for dinner and Rebar for drinks last night.  Really great experience.  The dinner was excellent; I asked if a couple of changes could be done to one of the menu items and they were more than accommodating and our server, Johnny, was exceptional!  I will ask for him the next time we go.  The drinks at Rebar were prepared well and again, the service was fantastic.  Bottom line:  food quality superior, drink/drink menu very good, views are great and the service was exceptionally good.  We went via light rail and while it's not right on the line, it's not a bad walk - maybe 5 minutes from the Roosevelt stop.  The indoors seemed a little like a pizza joint but the patio for both restaurant and bar are the best.  Enjoy!...
