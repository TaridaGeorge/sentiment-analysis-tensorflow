Get Your PHX got me here for my second visit yesterday and I'm glad they did!  Two months ago they built a bar in the place, serving craft beer and select wine.  They'll soon have a full dinner menu as well.

We packed the house for a free wine pairing [I know it's a small business and know how much Virginia Senior, proprietress sacrificed] on their regular 'BU Thursday' wine pairing event - a mere $15 normally.  Virginia, at least for me, your sacrifice will not have been in vain - you've secured 2 new regular customers!

The sommelier's discernment shined brightly and the chef's pairing choices were competent and then some - I rarely get the 'frisson' I experienced in the Queso Manchego paired with the 2008 Edge Cabernet.

You won't regret showing up next Thursday for their weekly wine pairing.
