Decadent meal with 5 star service.

Took the in-laws for a treat and this was quite possibly one of thee most enjoyable meals ever.   We enjoyed a wide array of delicious food and were pampered each and every step of the way.

Desert is killer and is very much a requirement to have before leaving.   Drinks were especially pricey as  the cheapest wine by the glass was north of $7.
