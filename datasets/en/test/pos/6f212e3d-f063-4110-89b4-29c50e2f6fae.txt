I've been using Softque for close to 10 years. They have GREAT customer service, and technical knowledge. Many times I have been a real pinch, a computer has died and I need HELP. They got me right in and had me up and running quick, or told me it wasn't salvageable.  They'll tell you the truth and won't sell you something you don't need. Everyone I have sent there have gotten the same AAA service. And their cable prices are the BEST!! If you're taking a computer ANYWHERE else,  WHY ??????
