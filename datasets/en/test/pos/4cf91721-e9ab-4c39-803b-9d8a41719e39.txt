I had the worst of all things to do today.....put my beautiful old, dying pit bull...Miss Peaches down. I had moved and hadn't connected with a clinic yet. I was online and on my phone. The lady on the phone sounded so warm and understanding.....I got there and all three ladies at the front were absolutely delightful and very understanding.

They made the experience as easy and wonderful as it could be....yes I am devastated but they were very very understanding and I would recommend them to anyone.

Thank you...
