Domenic's has been my LBS (Local Bike Shop) almost since I started bike commuting three years ago.    very convenient as it is on my way to and from work.  Service is great, fine selection of bikes, and they don't sneer at you for wanting a basket or rack.  they are good to commuters and regular riders.   I have brought my bike in and had them work on it right then!  I bought my old Univega from them used after wrecking my first goodwill commuter, and it's still going strong.  Sometimes they have great deals on used bikes to sell.  Great place, friendly, no attitude and great service, what more could you ask for?  next time I get a pile 'o' cash Ima buy a NEW bike from them.
