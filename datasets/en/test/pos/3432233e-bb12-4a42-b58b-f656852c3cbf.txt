I love this place! The Meatball sandwich is great and so are all the pastas. Completely authentic and not gross like a cheapy Italian Restaurant.
Everything is good from the bread, to the meatballs, to the side salad. Order the half portion or full portion of all their menu items and it will not disappoint. Expect to wait a 1/2 or more for your food to arrive though, it will not be done quickly but it will be worth the wait. Call ahead if you are in a hurry! The desserts are also delicious, not to mention it contains a market with a surplus of Italian ingredients to make your own meal at home. Your Italian Grandma would be so proud!
