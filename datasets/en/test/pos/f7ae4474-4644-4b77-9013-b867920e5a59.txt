YELP totally missed the boat by not mentioning this place as THE BEST BIKE SHOP IN PHOENIX. I simply called them one day, knowing what I wanted: A Salsa Mukluk, Snow Bike, aka "Fat Bike"...  They "had one that  needed to be built."  I said: "Build it and I will come."  I rode out of there a couple of hours later with the coolest bike I have ever owned.  The staff was totally hip and cool and GREAT and communicating and relating to my needs as a cyclist. I would not go anywhere else.  Do yourself a favor and buy your next bike at  the Slippery Pig.
