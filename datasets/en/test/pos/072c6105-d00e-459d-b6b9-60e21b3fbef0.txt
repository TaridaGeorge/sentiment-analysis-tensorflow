Sushi Ken is not fancy but it takes you to any-town Japan with good food that is very affordable. The menu is highly diverse with tasty items like shumai, ramen and squid snacks that you don't normally find in US-based Japanese places. The dishes are high quality and the cost performance is excellent. Oishii! Highly recommended.
