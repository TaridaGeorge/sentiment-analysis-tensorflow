I highly recommend Dentistry of Old Town Scottsdale! had a very unpleasant experience with another dentist in the valley and I needed a second opinion. My friend recommended Dr.Brittain. This was the best dental experience I have ever had. Everyone was friendly, professional, and I all of my questions were answered with no pressure to receive or purchase extra services (which happened at a different dentist in the valley). I appreciated that they accepted Aetna vital savings as well. I never have to wait for appointments they are ready for me right on time which is rare at most doctor or dentist appointments. I am so happy with Dr.Brittain and his staff - what a wonderful experience!! I highly recommend them!
