Good tacos, good margaritas and sitting outside on a beautiful late fall day in Arizona...it doesn't get much better than that.  My parents really liked it.  They had plenty of taco combinations to satisfy all three of us including enough to make us want to come back, and an excellent margarita selection.  Plus, the wait staff was very friendly.  We had just hiked Squaw Peak, and our waitress recommended that we try hiking Camelback next time.
