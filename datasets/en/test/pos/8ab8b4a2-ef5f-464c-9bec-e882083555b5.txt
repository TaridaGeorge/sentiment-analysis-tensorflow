After leaving ZOE's for lunch, we spotted Easley's and couldn't resist. We brought presents back to the office for everyone.  What did we find there for our co-workers?

We brought back Liz some bacon band-aids.
For Lenee, a poop pen.
The other Russ got a pickle launcher.

They also have a ton of stuff for Halloween, probably thousands of costumes. 

Check it out.
