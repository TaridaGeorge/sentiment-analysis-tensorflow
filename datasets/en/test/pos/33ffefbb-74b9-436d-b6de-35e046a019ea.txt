I like it. They have good coffee and great food. The wifi is strong and it's cozy. It's a very comfortable spot to get work done. A lot of coffee shops have turned into pick up joints or high school hang outs. This is just a nice indie coffee shop like you see in LA and the parking is plentiful  

My only complaint is that lunch items are not served in the evening or late afternoon.
