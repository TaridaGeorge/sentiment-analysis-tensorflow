I really like this bar.

It's nothing fancy, there's no kitchen, and the crowd isn't the prettiest to look at...

But the bartenders seem to genuinely care about customers, the owner seems like a really nice guy who goes out of his way to get to know his patrons, and the beer is always cold.  The prices are good for what you're getting, and the regulars are all very friendly.

If you're in Surprise and you're looking for a place to have a few beers and watch some television, this is probably where you should go.
