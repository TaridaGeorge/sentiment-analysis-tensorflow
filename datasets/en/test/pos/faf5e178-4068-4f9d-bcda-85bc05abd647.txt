LIke most vintage consignment stores, it's really a hit or miss with what you find. As for Butter Toast, you will find something nice at least 95% of the time you go. I love this store, with all the authentic vintage dresses, shoes, jewelry, and everything. They even have authentic lingerie here. I go at least twice a month to check for new inventory. The owner is sweet and quiet and lets you browse the store in peace (which I love). She is very knowledgeable about the inventory and conditions of the clothing and will help you with whatever questions you have. Mention Yelp and get 20% off your first purchase! :) Oh yeah, and the adorable cottage-style boutique and pretty lawn aren't a bad sight either.
