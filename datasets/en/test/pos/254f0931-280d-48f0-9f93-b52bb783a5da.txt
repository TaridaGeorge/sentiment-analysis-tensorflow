What a fun shopping day! I found so many places I had never been and will be going back to. It was a lot of fun finding the clues and completing the challenges. Had a lot of laughs and met some really great people. Thank you Lindsey for your work organizing this. I have been wanting to try Fifth and Wine for some time and was happy that we ended there. I will be going back! The fries were amazing!
