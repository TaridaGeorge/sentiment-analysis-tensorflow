So why did it take me so long to visit this resort around the corner from me?!  Talk about romantic and beautiful grounds!  The bar spills out onto a gorgeous courtyard, complete with awesome mountain views and fabby fountain.  

Fantastic service, very ZEN, and prompt bartending!  Their cocktails are mostly all unique and fun.  Great wines by the glass & YUMMY appies!  

They have an amazing Happy Hour - i am sooo going back asap!
