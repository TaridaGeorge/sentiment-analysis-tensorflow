I've been attending for over 25 years and I can honestly say they have a huge heart for people and their community. From the top down, they are always looking for ways to serve. Although it's a big church they have friendly greeters, first time visitor parking and a lot of small group activities and classes so you can get to know others and become connected.  And because of the size, they are able to team up to do incredible things like their annual Christmas production, Fourth of July fireworks show, Thanksgiving turkey give-away and much more. With over 250 ministries, there is definitely something for everyone.
