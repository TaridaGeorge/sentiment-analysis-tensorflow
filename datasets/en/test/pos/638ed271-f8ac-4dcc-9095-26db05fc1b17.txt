Dependable, solid, AUTHENTIC Japanese food. The owners moved here from Sushi Ten in Tucson. The prices are extremely reasonable and portions are huge. Salmon kama (cheek) is buttery and fresh, makunouchi gives you a little bit of everything, they have lots of full meal combos starting from 6.50, and the umeshiso sushi is an acquired taste, but something different to try. 

This is the only place in the valley that I can highly recommend for everyday Japanese food.
