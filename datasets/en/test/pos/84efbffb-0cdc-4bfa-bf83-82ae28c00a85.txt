I always love going to Culver's. The food is always great and if not they are more than happy to fix it. The workers are always smiling and always want to help and do whatever they can to make my day. Also, one of the cleanest restaurants I've been in. I love the flavor of the day special and always make sure I go in when my favorite is featured. Make sure to try a sample of whatever the flavor is when you go it!
