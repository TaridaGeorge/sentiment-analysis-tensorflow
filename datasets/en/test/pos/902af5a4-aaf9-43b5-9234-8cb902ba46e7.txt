Tiffany is so sweet and adorable- I had an AWFUL experience at a mall nail salon last Saturday - she was so happy to fix the hack job that i walked in with-
I really didn't even have to elaborate what i wanted - she asked a few questions about shape and tip- and before I knew it - I felt gorgeous again. 

Michelle Give a great pedicure- her massage was long and relaxing- she did a hot stone massage  while Tiffany removed my ugly nails- 

These girls were so sweet taking me in at last minute - and even stayed late to make sure I was happy- They really made me feel comfortable and I left Feeling like my business was actually appreciated.   

There is a Previous review linking them to "XO NAILS"  these are NOT the same Nail salon-
