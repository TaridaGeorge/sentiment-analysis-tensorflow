cupcakes!...this place is adorable and cozy with a roomy patio with quite a few tables and they serve hefenveisen....their staff is friendly and helpful...which we all commented "goes a long way in phoenix"...and if that wasnt fabulous enough...you can even bring your dog to the patio. they play movies projected onto the outdoor patio wall and short leash dogs was there that nite...they closed at 8 so i didnt get to try any dogs but my dog had a fabulous time! woohoo- as good as it gets...they even have a lot of parking along both sides of the building...all n all...a win win of a spot!
