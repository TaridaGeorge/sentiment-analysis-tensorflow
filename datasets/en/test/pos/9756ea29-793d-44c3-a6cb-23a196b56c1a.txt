We went during their Sunday Funday specials, and it was great! We got a cheap bottle of sparkling wine and enjoyed the adorable atmosphere. We also ordered the warm brie, which came with apricot jam, hummus, grilled veggies and pita - yum! 
This is a cute gem in Chandler and definitely worth a visit!
