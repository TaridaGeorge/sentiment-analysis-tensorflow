WOOWOO!!!! This is the best!!! I have had health problems for three years and can't have gluten, dairy, eggs. I have not been able to find good desserts until now. My friend bought me a vegan, gluten free mocha chocolate cake. It was delicious! I ordered cupcakes which I will pick up at the public market.
