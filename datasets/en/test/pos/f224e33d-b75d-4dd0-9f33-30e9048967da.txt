Yay! I found handymen I can count on. I called these guys after reading their other reviews. Completely professional, smart, kind, and just all around great. They set a time in the not so distant future, arrived exactly on time, and did nothing but work. They cleaned up, even dusting an area where a TV they put up had once sat. I've now got them on my speed dial. And costs are very reasonable. They also did some minor faucet work, which was great; I definitely didn't want to call a plumber unless I had to. No worries about that now.
