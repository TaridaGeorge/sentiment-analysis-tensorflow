I was totally impressed with this Phoenix treasure! I love most things that have any type of history attached to them and this place was no exception. I loved the wallpaper, ceiling panels, creaky wood floors, lacy window coverings and all the time appropriate decorations and props. 

Definitely worth a visit!
