For weekends spanning from February to April, take a journey to rural Arizona masquerading as medieval Europe for a day of fun, fantasy and entertainment.  

Located in Apache Junction, the Arizona Renaissance Festival goes on for 2 months per year on it's own campus modeled on a middle ages period town.  Throughout the day, there are shows, food and fun to be had while you explore the shire.

The shows vary from family friendly to adventurous to rather bawdy.  The food is modeled after period food modified to modern standards to fit varied tastes. In costume or not, with friends or solo a good time can be had by all.  

Huzzah for good times in a time long, long ago at a place not very far away.....
