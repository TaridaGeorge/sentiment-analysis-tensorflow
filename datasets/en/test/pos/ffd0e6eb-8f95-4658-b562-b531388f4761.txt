I've been to many auto clinics in the past, but none are so friendly and reasonable as Shuman's.  Since finding Shuman's through my BNI chapter, my wife and I have never taken our cars anywhere else.

At first, I was skeptical whether they could work on my BMW, but Jake at Shuman's assured me he has the knowledge and experience necessary to work with German cars and SUVs.  Sure enough, his service and advice have been great.
