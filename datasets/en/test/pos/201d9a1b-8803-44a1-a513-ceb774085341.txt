Great restaurant! Great prices, cool atmosphere, young friendly attentive staff... But most importantly, the food was out of this world.

The stuffed portabella w/ sausage was seriously to die for! The bruschetta was different. They give you 6 crostinies and a bowl of marinated tomatos and you basically make them yourselves at the table. I thought that was cute and fun...

We were here on vacation from CT , and looking
For a small decent priced pizzeria/italian place and we certainly found a real gem.
If you are from town or out of town, check this place out!
