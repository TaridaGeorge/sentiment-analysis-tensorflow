So lucky to be in town to eat here again. 

Brie and Lavash: I loved it. Basically a brie covered cracker type bread with a little sour from the balsamic reduction with sweetness from the pomegranate and pear.I cannot adequately describe the dish but it's great. 

Cafe Meatloaf: I could eat this every day. 

I wish this place wasn't 400 miles away from me...
