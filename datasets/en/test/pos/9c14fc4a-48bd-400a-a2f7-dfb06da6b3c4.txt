This might be my new favorite breakfast spot. Went here a couple weekends ago with some girlfriends and the food was bomb.com. I got the chorizo skillet and it was amazing. I wasn't even hungry and I ate the whole plate. (It's a problem, I know I need to work on not eating when I'm not hungry but food is so GOOD!)

The service was average - I can't think that anything was wrong. But even if it was bad, I'd go back. I def have to try some other things and I'm sure I'll update when appropriate. I've been craving that damn skillet since I've had it. Isn't it a little odd to crave chorizo and eggs? Idk. Seems a lil weird to me. But clearly it made an impression.
