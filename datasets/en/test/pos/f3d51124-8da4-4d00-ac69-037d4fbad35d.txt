Ive always liked TMP , its fun , open and lots to choose from.  you got your clothing stores, so lots of shopping. You can also stop by and have some lunch/dinner and even a few cocktails along the way.  I think its great for the family and also a good time for a first date. 

One evening I went to dave and busters and had a blast, had a few drinks and food. than moved on next door to the San Felipe bar which is fun and open.  nice patio and cool people.  overall a great experience everytime I go.  Defenitely check out this place and support it.
