This was the best bar in Phoenix. Between playing shuffleboard, horseshoes, darts, volleyball, ping pong and various other games you were also able to grill your own food bought at the bar. Beer was only 2$ and the ambiance of the place was unbeatable. I frequented the bar for well over a decade and was truly sad to see it go.

I was able to bid on one of their more memorable pieces of art work. I ended up winning it and it is proudly displayed in the middle of my living room. It is actually fairly ugly, but in a good way.
