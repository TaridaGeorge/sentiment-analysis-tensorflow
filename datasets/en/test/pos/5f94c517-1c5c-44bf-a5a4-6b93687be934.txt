AMAZING customer service!!  I needed a tire changed same day.  Costco checked for the tire I needed and told me there were none in the region and that it would have to be ordered (would come-in, 2-3 days).  I did NOT have 2-3 days as I had a 30 mile commute to work and I wasn't going to do that on a donut in 115 degree weather.  They called around, pulled some strings and 5 min. after walking into the place, I had a price match and a new tire appointment later that afternoon.  Tire was changed in about 10 minutes with no fuss or unnecessary sales pitches about other products "i need".  I completely recommend discount tire- this is not the first time I have been blown away by their prices and service.
