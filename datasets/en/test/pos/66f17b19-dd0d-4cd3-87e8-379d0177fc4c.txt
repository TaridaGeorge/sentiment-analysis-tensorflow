Our food was absolutely delicious. Service, wine, atmosphere- all great, and the food.. well, I'm still dreaming about that food!

I had the butternut squash ravioli in some kind of white sauce (heaven).. everything was handmade and super fresh and amazing! It was filling, but a little small; I definitely wouldn't have minded a few more pieces of ravioli- (hint hint!) The spaghetti with shrimp and the chicken della casa were also really really good, but the ravioli was easily the best!
