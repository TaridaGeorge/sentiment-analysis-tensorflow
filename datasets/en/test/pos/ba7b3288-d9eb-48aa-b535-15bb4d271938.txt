This is one of my favorites. The food is great, service is prompt and friendly. The wait usually goes by quickly as you are able to get a drink at the bar and then next thing you know, they are summoning you to your table. The last time we were there was for my husband's birthday. There were 5 adults and the total bill was about $250, before the tip. 
One of our favorites is the short rib, yummy, yummy. It is so juicy and delicious. We have never taken any home as there are never any leftovers.
It does get "loud", but I like to call it "lively". 
We will be back again soon, I hope.
