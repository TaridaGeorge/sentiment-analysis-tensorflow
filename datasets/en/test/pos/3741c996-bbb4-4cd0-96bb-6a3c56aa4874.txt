Everything is great. Huge variety, homemade, and at least 5 soups featured daily.  I always get the California eggs Benedict. Their specialty berry bread pudding is "to die for." the Iron Ave location sits behind the Home Depot on Country Club just south of 60 in a grey "strip mall". Easy to find once you know where it is. There is another much newer location on Greenfield & Brown. The NE corner.  We go there frequently and have never been disappointed in the food or service;)
