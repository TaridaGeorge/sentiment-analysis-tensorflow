I live in Kierland and have wanted to try Deseo for awhile, Im glad I did. To start half price mojitos in the bar, then dinner, make sure you ask for the (RAIL) think Food Network. Chef Madrid knows his stuff ask him for his opinion, ceviche is the best in town, get the Cigar for dessert make sure you ask for Sara to serve you, she is attentive and very knowledgeable plus easy on the eyes ;)  A++++
