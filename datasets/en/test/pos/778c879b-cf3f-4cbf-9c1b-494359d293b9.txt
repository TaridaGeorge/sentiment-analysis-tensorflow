This bar is the coolest hang bar in valley.  I liked it so much I moved across the street from it.  The patio is huge and usually always buzzing with drunks and attractive women or the ever coveted hybrid of those two groups.  They have a decent tap, and the place is relatively well priced.  It seems to be the central nodal point of the Tempe hipster scene.  I met a lot of people through there.  A good place to go if you're single or as a couple.  If you're a guy, you even get to piss in their "blarney stone".   The bartenders are super cool, and make seriously stiff cocktails.  Go there, tonight.
