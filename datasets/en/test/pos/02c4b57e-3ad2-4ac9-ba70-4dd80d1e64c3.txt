Resort hotel in fantastic location. Very clean. Outstanding pools, great winding water slide for adults too, swim-up bars, cabanas, private areas, etc. Cactus gardens, mountain views, great Jean-Georges steakhouse is the bomb! Great convention place too without that stifling convention feel. Fantastic breakfasts-best omelet in a long time. The best part probably is the eager to please, totally friendly and hospitable staff!
