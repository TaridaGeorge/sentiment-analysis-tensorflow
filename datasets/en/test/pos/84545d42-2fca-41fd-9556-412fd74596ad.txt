Awesomely delicious rice bowl place.  The teriyaki chicken rice bowl, ordered light on the sauce, is particularly good, as is the orange chicken rice bowl.
I accidentally left my keys here once.  The proprietor was kind enough to hold them for me until I later realized and returned to retrieve them.
