Boyfriend and I had brunch here and it was truly awesome. Huge selection of stuff, from charcuterie, caviar, sushi, a big dessert room, omelette station, fantastic cheese station, bloody mary bar... the list goes on and on and on.

I will say nothing more than that... well, other than UNLIMITED CHAMPAGNE AND BLOODY MARYS INCLUDED WITH PRICE.
