This place is wonderful! Great band that sound so much like the real thing that you have to wonder if it's them incognito.  We have seen Rush, Heart, and Fleetwood Mac/Stevie Nicks here and all were great.  Rush was probably the best with Fleetwood Mac coming in a close second.  The food is good as well.  We usually do a pre-fix at $30, includes salad, steak, and desert. Oh and totally well decorated and well appointed.  Classy without being snooty.
