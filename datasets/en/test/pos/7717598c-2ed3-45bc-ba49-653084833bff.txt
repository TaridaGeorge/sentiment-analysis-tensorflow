I visited the Tempe Sunflower market today and I'm so pleased. Shane from the produce department was so kind and helpful. I had called him yesterday asking if he could roast some hot Hatch chili for my mom and true to his word, he had the chili roasted and bagged while we were there. It's so hard to find good customer service these days so this trip was truly a breath of fresh air! Thank you Shane for helping us and for your great attitude~ we walked out of the market happy and smiling!
