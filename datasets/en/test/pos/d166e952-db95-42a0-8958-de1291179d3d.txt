My favorite upscale Indian restaurant in Phoenix, hands down.  Their food is just more flavorful and more carefully prepared than anywhere else.  And the atmosphere is date-worthy.  As good as the best Indian restaurants in major cities like Chicago and San Francisco.  This is the only Indian restaurant in Phoenix about which that can be said.
