Gold Bar Espresso is a cozy, locally owned and operated coffee spot.  Its prior location in a retired bank vault (hence the name) was presumably much more charming than its current Valley-standard strip mall locale, but it makes up for it with friendly and helpful staff.  

I spent the late afternoon reading in Gold Bar with excellent live accoustic guitar for background.  This is a fine place to purchase and enjoy a Sunday New York Times.

The pumpkin pie was absolutely delicious.

Gold Bar also serves non-coffee drinks including teas, chai, and decadent hot chocolate also available in a refreshing iced format.
