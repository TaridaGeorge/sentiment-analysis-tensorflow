I am crazy about TJ's.  The food is fresh and the prices are outstanding. There are so many things I can only find there as opposed to other stores. For example, I love almond butter and they have an excellent brand at an incredibly low price. 

Plus, the people are incredible; friendly, helpful, and courteous.  Thanks so much to TJ's for coming to AZ.
