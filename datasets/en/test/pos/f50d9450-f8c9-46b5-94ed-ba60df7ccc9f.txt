I have never felt so cool, while trying so little, as when I am gulping down martinis at Char's.

This is the type of place that holds the idea of the smoky atmosphere even without the smoke. Everytime I go here I feel as though I have stepped back in time to a place where the blues are king, and the gin comes in a tub.

The music is loud, the dancefloor is crowded and the bathrooms are tiny...in short this place is amazing. 

Hang out with the hippest of cats, from all demographics. 

Please do not order girlie mixed shots with silly names as it makes the ghost of Robert Johnson cry when these sorts of things grace the bars of such genuine gin joints.

The drinks are simple, the music is great and the company can't be beat!
