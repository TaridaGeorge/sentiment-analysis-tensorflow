Nowhere else like it. If you're interested in getting out of the common "virtual office" locations such as where they serve burnt flavored coffee and call it Seattle's finest, try this place. It's got decent coffee and smoothies, fun bikes to ride around, reminiscent rocker music and free internet; besides you can hit two birds with one stone- quick cup of joe and a bike light (you know you can get a bike ticket without one at night, man).
