Best sandwich deli in all of Phoenix. A handful of signature sammies, but I prefer to build my own. Adorable space with knick knacks, culinary odds and ends, loose leaf teas, and mmmm cheese. They also have a wine shop for those gearing up for a romantic picnic at Papago Park. Quality ingredients, helpful staff, and decent prices. Why would anyone ever go to Subway or Quizno's when you could go to Duck and Decanter instead?? They also have dessert...mmmmm mmmm definitely one of the places I miss about living in Phoenix.
