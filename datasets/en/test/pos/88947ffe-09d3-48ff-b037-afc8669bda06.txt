The only downfall to this place is that it's so busy!!! The demand speaks for the quality of Micky D's Cafe. Everybody wants some! She's a very sweet little old lady, and provides a lot of jobs to locals. 

This place has wonderful biscuits and gravy and pancakes. I eat here once every 2 weeks or so. Wonderful breakfast, fast friendly service
