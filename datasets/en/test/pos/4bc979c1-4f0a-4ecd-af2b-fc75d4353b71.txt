I was at the social media day gathering at the Ritz-Carlton and found this place on the Veebow app's "nearby" feature. The place was empty so I sat at the bar and ordered a couple of happy hour drinks. The bartender, Maureen, recommended the a pork taco plate wi rice and beans. I wasn't expecting the tacos to have Mangos, but it was a nice touch. 

I'll keep it simple- food was great, service was great, ambiance was cool (they had art for sale on the walls) and even better, the two beers on tap are my favorites- Shock Top and Landshark. I'll definitely be back.
