Mikado is hands down my favorite sushi spot in Arizona. I was fortunate to live just down the street for a long time and was able to visit on a regular basis.

I've never tried anything besides their sushi so I can't comment on the other dishes. The sushi is terrific. The fish is top notch and has lots of rolls that aren't deep fried (which is what I prefer). They are priced very nicely compared to a lot of other places in the valley.

The staff are always nice and prompt. The sushi chefs are talkative and very friendly. If you're in Chandler it is worth stopping by.
