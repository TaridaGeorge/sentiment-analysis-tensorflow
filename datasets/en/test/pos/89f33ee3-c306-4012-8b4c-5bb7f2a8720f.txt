I have never been disappointed at any of the spinato's locations! 
I first went to the one in Tempe. It's a weird location, in a business park. It's byob, wich was great! I tried the spinach pizza and I could not believe how perfect it was. 
All the things I love at spinato's:
The spinach pizza, sometimes I add sausage or meatballs.
The L'Italiana.
The get meaty.
The mushroom sausage.
The Bruschetta.
If you want jalapenos on your pizza but others don't the will even heat them in the oven for you to put on at the table,instead of just slinging some cold ones at you.
The service is always super friendly without being annoying.
The only other pizza I like as well  in town is at pizzaria bianco.
Give these people your money, they deserve it!!
