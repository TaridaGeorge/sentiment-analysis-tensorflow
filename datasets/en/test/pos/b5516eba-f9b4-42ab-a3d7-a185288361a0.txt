Food is excellent, service is good, and the prices can't be beat. I had a Vegas roll, and the tempura-fried batter was perfectly light and crispy. The Jap-Chae appetizer (thinly sliced beef with carrots, mushrooms, and spinach over potato noodles in a sweet and savory sauce) was delicious and an amazing deal. Yakisoba with seafood - portion was huge, seafood was perfectly cooked, and the dish was tastefully seasoned. These 3 dishes and 2 alcoholic beverages only set us back $40 (plus tip - which was well-deserved). We will definitely be returning!
