The boyfriend and I wanted pizza for dinner, and a quick Yelp search showed a highly-rated pizza place practically across the street...there wasn't even a second thought.  And we were not disappointed!  

We had a margherita pizza and coke, and got out of there full and happy for less than $15.  Service was good; they weren't very busy and the server was attentive and available.  The restaurant had a good "pizza joint" vibe.  The banquet room off to the side looks like it would be a great area for large groups or parties.  

There was a lot more on the menu I'd like to try, everything looked great.  Definitely going back!
