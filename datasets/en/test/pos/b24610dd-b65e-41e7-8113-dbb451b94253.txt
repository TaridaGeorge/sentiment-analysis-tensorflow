Wonderful little burger joint!!  Very simple menu: hamburgers, hot dogs, and (Garfield) fried egg sandwich.  Everything is fresh and the burgers are like a thing from the past (fabulous)!!!!  Very little in and outside seating- most importantly its cash only!  Worth the drive! and an experience you shouldn't miss!
