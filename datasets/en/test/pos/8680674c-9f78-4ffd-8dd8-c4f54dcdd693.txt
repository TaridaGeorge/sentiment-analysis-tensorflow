Just went back again, after not being there for longer than I'd care to admit. I went to my old faithful, the fallen angel with an egg. We decided to get some wings, which were AWESOME!!! Wifey got this super secret pizza that's not on the menu, but used to be her fave when it was. It's called the Padre. it's got Prosciutto, Arugula, Ricotta and fig. She ixnays the fig and subs the ricotta for bleu cheese (yes, I am shamed at being Italian and my wife not wanting ricotta on her pizza) I had a few Stella's, the by-the-glass wine menu is 2 whites and 2 reds, which blows. overall, we always love this place. We even snuck into the little grocery before we left and score some jumbo Tammie Coe cookies!!!!
