Just moved down here to Scottsdale and I love finding places like this! Food was really good, I had a wild boar burger with coconut curry sauce and carmelized onions along with the standard beef/bacon/cheese burger. Both were delicious and their tator tots are AMAZING, brought me back to being a kid and eating tots, yet still were prepared and served in a classy way, nothing like well done spuds!

Service was really good also. The bartender spent quite a bit of time talking to me about local beers they have, their menu, where they get their meats and then suggested that I get the wild boar burger.  He was right on, friendly and helpful.

Two thumbs up for good service, good food, good location, cleanliness, and an all around good experience. Only downside is that it is a bit pricey...
