Love, love LOVE this restaurant.  I was stoked to see one outside of Vegas!  I would always make it a point to go to the Venetian JUST to eat here!  (plus it is open 24/7 in sin city ;))

The owner is the same owner as the Cheesecake factory, so you can totally notice the similarities.  However, the Grand Lux has a ritzier, uppity feel to it.  I would definitely suggest stopping in, even if you are having cocktails and apps.  The food is delicious and you will most likely leave with a doggy bag.  Just like the Cheesecake factory, the poritions are pretty ridiculous, but well worth the price you pay!  Yum, yum, yum!
