Loved the course! Great views! By no means is the course easy but is it very playable. Course was in very good shape, greens were nice (could be faster if rolled, which is good). Staff was very friendly, made me feel like a member. Practice area was nice and came with the round. Hitting, pitching and putting available. Price is more than fair.
If you haven't played here yet, book your tee time now! You will probably see me there!
