Wow, what a fabulous place! LOVE the setting and the ambiance there. The food is delicious, and it is so fresh! The service was so friendly, and we can tell that they really care about their customers. Over two visits, we have had:

 - Fontina burger
 - French fries
 - Onion rings
 - Fried zucchini
 - BBQ chicken salad

...and everything was fabulous! We will definitely be returning when we are in the area.
