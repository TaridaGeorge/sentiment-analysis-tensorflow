Took my 7yr old son here because of a mailer coupon I had recieved. 

Place was not busy (not sure if thats a good or bad thing), but staff was great. My son got right in and eventhough we had a woman barber(?), she listened to our requests and my son was happy with his cut!

They honored my 5$ off coupon even on the childs cut price. 

I was very pleased with this place! Thanks!
