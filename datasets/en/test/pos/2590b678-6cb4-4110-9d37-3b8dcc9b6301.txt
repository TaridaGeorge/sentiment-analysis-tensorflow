I have been to Mabel's a few times now and I think it is a pretty stellar place. The food is awesome (try the chicken lollypops and the deviled eggs) and the drinks are strong. The ambiance is nice and cozy and I think it works well for a romantic dinner or a big group of friends. The staff has always been pleasant and accommodating and that goes a long way for me in Snottsdale. 

Last night I was wowed by Mabel's. We had a fundraiser for a great friend who has cancer and they not only let us throw it there FOR FREE, but generously offered to donate 20% of the bar tab to the cause. The service was great that night and they earned a fan for life. Thanks Mabel's, for being so cool, you're a breath of fresh air.
