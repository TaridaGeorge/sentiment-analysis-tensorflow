My sister is a huge fan of this place.  She insisted that my whole family descend on it for breakfast one of the days we were visiting, and we weren't disappointed.  They have healthy options (like the Bialy breakfast thing I got, yummy), as well as less healthy options like scrambles with sausage and Hollandaise sauce or huge cinnamon rolls, apparently also quite yummy.  Our waitress was wonderful - all of our dozen meals were out at about the same time, without problems, and we were kept stocked with waters, coffees, and OJs the entire time.  I'd highly recommend it!
