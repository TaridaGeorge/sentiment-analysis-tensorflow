I recently met with a client here for lunch on his suggestion. When I arrived I was surprised...the decor/seating area leaves something to be desired. 

However, the FOOD was awesome! I had the Doughboy, which is their "most popular" sandwich and I know why. It was excellent and I highly recommend the restaurant.
