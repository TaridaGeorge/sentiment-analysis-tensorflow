I've been going to this store for years and am so happy they finally renovated and brought this store up to speed with the rest of the Ulta's. This Ulta still has their salon that uses Redkin products and now a Benefit Brow bar. This store is a lot more organized and thus easier to find the products you are looking for. Great job on the remodel! I've always had friendly service with employees.
