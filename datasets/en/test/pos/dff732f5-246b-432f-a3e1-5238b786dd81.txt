I wouldnt drive all the way from reno and not give it 5 stars. Ive been to the waffle houses in the midwest and south and i am a fan. I miss waffle house since moving to reno and this is the closest to us so guess what we drove here. There arent any places whose waffles even come close. I love the warm syrup and everything is cooked fresh. This place is definitely worth driving to and will be an annual vacation favorite.
