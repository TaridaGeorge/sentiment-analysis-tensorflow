S found this place on Yelp and suggested I try it out during my visit here in Arizona.

The Morning Glory Cafe is located at the Farm at South Mountain which has their own organic farm on premise. Their hours are limited to serving breakfast - but, oh my, do they do breakfast good!

I ordered Chef Manuel's chicken enchiladas topped with two eggs over easy. I know, I know - it's a cardio slam, but it was worth every biteful! The enchiladas were filled with an herb roasted chicken breast that was savory and moist. The tomatillo sauce that topped the entire dish was one of the best I've ever had - a little bit of tang, but oh so flavorful! I sat savoring every single bite!

The beverages are self-service. The coffee, tea, orange juice and lemonade are available.
