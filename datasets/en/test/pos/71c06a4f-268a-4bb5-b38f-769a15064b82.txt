Since I myself have only made the trip to New York twice, I cannot be considered an expert on NY-style pizza. But a friend who lived in the Big Apple swears this is the best authentic NY pizza in the area. NY-or-not, all I know is it tastes amazing. The homemade sauce is killer, the toppings fresh and tasty, and the crust thin and chewy. Mmmm. The cheesecake is also wonderful. You will NOT be disappointed!
