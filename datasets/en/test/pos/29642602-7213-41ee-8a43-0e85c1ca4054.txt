My all time favorite spot.  Best sunset in the Valley.  Steller views and decor.  Amazing martinis.  Excellent food.  I don't usually order seafood in the desert but the scallops here were amazing.  When I ate here in May I saw Mario Batali leaving!  I call this place the vortex.  It is so serene you never want to leave.  

The spa/resort (the Sanctuary on Camelback) also happens to be my all-time favorite resort.  I wish I could live here.  Too bad it is sooooo expensive.  Go during off season.  

The Jade Bar is one of my favorite bars.  The killer martinis are served in bucket-sized glasses and strange things are always afoot...  very entertaining.
