This is no ordinary bike shop...

Typical mountain bikers aren't a picky lot when it comes to buying bike parts and where they get them but that all changes the second you step in the door at Ryan's place. 

It is a hole in the wall with only a few actual parts on the shelf but they make up for it with better than the best customer service and an attitude to match.

I have been into some pretty horrible bike shops (Airpark Bike) before and this is truly a breath of fresh air. 

If you want a great CUSTOM bike at a great bargain then this is the place for you. If you like getting jerked around by those other guys (Airpark) then this is definitely not your cup of Joe...
