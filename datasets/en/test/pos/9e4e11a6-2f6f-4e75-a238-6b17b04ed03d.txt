i've been here a few times, and they do actually close at some point during the day because at 7am one morning, they were closed.

but it's like any other convenience store, but not as glitzy and there's no buffet of cheap coffee, donuts, or lunch-ables like the modern circle k's. 

what sets D's apart is the family that owns it. while there one afternoon, the owner, George, greeted everyone as if he'd known them for years. he even knew their names. Same with his wife...she had just baked some cookies and gave me a few. yes, i'll pretty much eat anything so i did, and they were good!

a great little local establishment.
