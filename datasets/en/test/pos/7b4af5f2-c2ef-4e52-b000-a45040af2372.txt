So my girlfriend and I are big thai food fans and we are from So-Cal. We came here because of the lunch special. We had better specials, but the quality of food was great! Portion was smaller than what we get but it was not unreasonable and the owner was super nice!

It was really good, a nice hole in the wall place.
