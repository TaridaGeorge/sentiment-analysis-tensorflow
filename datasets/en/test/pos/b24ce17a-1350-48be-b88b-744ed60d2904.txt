So I have worked in the catering industry for 6 years. Which means I work many weddings. Which are droll and predictable at best. As are the cakes. I despise Tammy Coe for her fondant cakes that are blissfully boring yet so cute (why can't I use italics for cute). Many others have little flavor or are repeating an idea that was authored by betty crocker generations ago.

This is where Honey Moon is different. Fresh fruit on top. Shaved icing on top in a simple and unpretentious manner. Moist but not disintegrating as you cut into it. Light yet flavorful. Good website. Free coffee. By far this is the only cake that I will steal from a wedding party for a taste. Everything else is fodder.
