When im in Central Phoenix and looking for a pick me up that won't land me in jail, Urban Beans is the only place I get my iced coffee from. I guess it is slow brewed for 12 hours, and honestly you can taste the difference.

Also they support many local business's as well as purchase locally roasted beans. Staff is always friendly and knowledgeable. Great patio seating area right off 7th street and also a spacious interior, to work, study, meet, or just have a cup of your favorite beverage. 

They also have a great little market area with tons of cool local companies products on display. Check it out, and stay away from that green place. Put your money someplace that actually cares!
