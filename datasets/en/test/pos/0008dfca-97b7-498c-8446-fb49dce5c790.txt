There's probably not a lot that can be said about TexAz Grill that hasn't been said, but  I feel the need to put in a good word for their catfish. It's great - perfectly battered, flaky, great flavor and the two massive fillets are enough to share with a friend, making it a fairly inexpensive, reasonably healthful dinner for two.
