Had the great fortune to have a friend take me to Wy-Knot today for lunch and it was superb!  The owner Jackie makes it a delightful experience as she welcomes you and acquaints you with the menu which has many breakfast and lunch choices for all appetites.  I had the potato soup and roated turkey sandwich which were tasty and well presented.
You are made to feel so welcome.  It's like being in a cafe in Europe with the owner and chef waiting on you!
The decor is nice with local artist showing & selling their framed art work!
I highly recommend Wy-Knot for a tasty and cozy-fun dining experience.
