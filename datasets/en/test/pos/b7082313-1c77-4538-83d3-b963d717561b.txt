Perfect getaway with your spouse.  Great location for quickly getting to many area attractions (list below) and the property is top shelf.  Love the small size but access to cozy bar at Lon's, great restaurant, pool, allows Hermosa to compete with larger hotels.  Beehive fireplace in the room and we had patio doors open to sunny, grassy patio (room 117).  Perfect for relaxing after your day drinking excursions.

Use Hermosa Inn as your base of operation for hiking (Squaw Peak and Camelback are less than 10 minutes away), day drinking (Postino has fantastic happy hour starting at noon), and dining (Postino, La Orange, Chelsea Kitchen, St Francis, The Vig, and many more).
