50ppl Sunday Night, Family Style Service! Difficult to pull off! These folks did an amazing job! Shrimp, Tuna, Beet Salad appetizers all excellent. The Yorkshire Pudding (Popovers) Best I've ever had. I could have eaten 2 or 3 of them as my dinner!

Kobe Steak, Short Ribs, Branzio, Chicken, Au Gratin Potatoes and a Tomato thing. Again all incredible considering the pace and scale of the situation.

Flan was the highlight of the desserts! Definitely need to come back with a party of 2.
