These guys are awesome. 
I was recommended Jack's through 3 co-workers who had various repairs done there and when the compressor went out on my car I called them to pick it up... 24 hours later I picked up my car and was super please with the bill... That has never happened before.
I will be back and I am recommending them to anyone looking for good honest mechanics.
