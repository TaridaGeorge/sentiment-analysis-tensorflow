Chick-fil-A is always good, but this location is awesome. I'd like to do a study on their training program and corporate culture and this is the location where I'd start. "Oh, my pleasure!" See how many times you can hear that when making an order through the drive-thru. 

Oh yeah, and the food it good too! I don't know what they do to the chicken breasts they make their sandwiches with, but man they are good! I'm addicted to the spicy chicken sandwich. Let's face it, nothing fried is "healthy" but using fresh ingredients, peanut oil (cholesterol free and no trans fats) is a good start; and they do have truly healthy offerings if you want to go that route (sorry, no waffle cut fries on that menu!)
