She did an amazing job. I have a whole new closet full of clothes becasue of her. I got my clothes altered a year ago and they are still in great condition. She even made a cute skirt out of a long skirt I wore that was Dolce & Gabbana. I trust her with anything. It took about 2 weeks because I had so many clothes. I told her time was not a problem. I would imagine if you need something faster that she would work with you. I love this place.
