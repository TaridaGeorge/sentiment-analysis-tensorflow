Great place for lunch. If you are looking for a place to hang out, eat great food, this is the place. The Bruchetta is fantastic along with the Pub Board. When you are there, ask for a Pretzel stick. They are hot and devine. Also, make sure that you are there for the $5 pitchers. The 9-Iron is my favorite sandwich on focaccia bread. (I like this location better than the one on Campbell.)
