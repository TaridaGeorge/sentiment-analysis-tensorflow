I can't live without my Sprouts!  We went there tonite and got some of our staple foods like fresh berries, juices, kefir, fruits, milk and some other fun stuff like dark chocolate bars, hummus and pita bread. 

And then we passed by the bakery section...Blueberry Pie!  Oh, yum.  Want, gotta have.   Who can resist?  Sold!  

So got home, had a slice - warmed up, with a glass of milk.  That just hit the spot.  Now, I know I will sleep well tonite.  Thanks Sprouts!
