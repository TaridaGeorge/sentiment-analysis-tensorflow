I love all the staff here. They really care about you and your dog. I will continue to bring my dog and future dogs here for every problem they have. My czech german shepherd is very protective of us and they take precaution with him and take him to the back room to prevent any of that. My dog a couple months ago was at the vet for some minor limping, then took him back the next month because he was still having the problem. They gave me an xray and sedative quote incase I needed to have it done, and even called to check and see how he was doing. =) THANK YOU! I trust all the vets this is a great establishment. I do not prefer one vet over the other I think they are all simply amazing.
