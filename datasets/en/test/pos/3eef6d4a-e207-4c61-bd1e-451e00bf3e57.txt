It's a five star boutique hotel inside of a five star resort. It's beautiful, quiet, the staff is lovely, they bring you free tea and coffee to your room in the mornings, there's a lovely wine hour each day at 4pm, the staff is impressively friendly and helpful, they'll golf cart or mercedes you to anywhere nearby that you want to go, and the infinity pool and hot tub in the back are gorgeous. Great off season rates, too.
