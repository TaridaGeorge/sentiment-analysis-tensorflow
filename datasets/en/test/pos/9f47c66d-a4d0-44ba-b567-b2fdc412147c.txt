This is a small family run Sushi place.  It is similar to many small place found throughout Japan.  The Sushi is fresh and excellent.  All of the standards are there.   I have also tried the Salmon Toro which was a treat.  The Temprua, Gyozas and noodle dishes are also excellent.  It closes 2-5 and fills quickly at 5.   If you have a group of more than 4 it will be tight!
