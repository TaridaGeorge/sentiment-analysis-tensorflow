Unfortunately my years at ASU were spent at the building dedicated purely to the Computer Scientists/Computer Systems Engineer majors.  Probably the majority of creepy guys were in this major so they tried to keep them away from the main campus as much as possible by putting us half a mile away from all the other people.

However, I did meet my current g/f here(ASU in general, not the creepy guy building), there are tons of interesting classes such as ballroom/swing/latin dance courses and lots of studying to keep you busy (or parties if you're not into studying).  I'm glad I took the chance to find classes that I enjoyed such as music history, dance classes, and basketball to go along with all of my engineering classes.

5 stars because I enjoyed my 4 years here and I'm glad it wasn't any longer than that!
