One of my favorite choices. What can beat five bucks for a pizza ready to go when you walk in? The cheesy bread and wings are a solid choice too.

Not to long ago my wife was having a rough day. I wanted to surprise her when I came home from work. I stopped by little Caesars, picked up a pizza, then picked up a movie and spent the night cuddling with her on the couch.
