Ok, this is the best Creme Brûlée money can buy.  I've been to many 5-star restaurants and they haven't been nearly as good.  I'm very picky when it comes to Creme Brûlée, but this is nice and creamy and loaded with flavor in every bite. If you're in the Phoenix or Scottsdale area get in touch with this guy.  His twitter handle is @Torchedgoodness and his website is www.Torchedgoodness,com. I believe this will become the new revolution amazing food out of high end food trucks!
