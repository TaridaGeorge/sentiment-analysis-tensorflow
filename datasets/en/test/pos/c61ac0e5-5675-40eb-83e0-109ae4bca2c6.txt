This is the Rolls Royce of all Fry's Marketplace stores. I've been shopping Fry's or its sister/brother stores for more than a decade. This is the best store that I have been to in the chain. The parking was easy. I was promptly greeted by a door greeter and since this was my first time in this particular store, he was also very helpful in pointing out where I should head to for things I needed. The aisles are spacious and roomy. This store might actually be really good for those of you who are claustrophobic. 

The cashier who checked me out was super friendly. Very cheerful.
