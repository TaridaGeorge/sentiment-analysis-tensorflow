I have used Tina for years starting when she was associated with Shea Animal Hospital.

She has groomed my cat and does a great job!

Tina definitely knows her stuff and listens to us to make sure the grooming is done correctly to our satisfaction.

If you are looking for a quality groomer, you will not be disappointed with Tina.
