My girls and I love this place... We take a walking field trip to Smeeks whenever we need a little pick-me-up. The candy selection includes all of my childhood favorites, their favorites, and then some... The novelties are fun to look at for a giggle, too. But, we spend most of our time and money in their photo booth. So much fun! Also, Smeeks does a great job packaging treats for birthday parties and small presents... Highly recommended.
