This is my new discount tire store.  I needed a tire rotation and happened to find this location on yelp since the last location I used was not a great experience.  I called them on a Friday and they made an appt for me late Sat morning.  I showed up a little early and was checked in promptly even though they were busy.  My truck was taken in on time and I was in and out in about a half hour. 

The staff was very efficient and polite and i was very impressed.  i will definitely be coming back to this location in the future.
