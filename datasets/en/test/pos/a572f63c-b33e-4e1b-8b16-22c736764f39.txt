Yes this place is small but that what's makes it ooze character. The Rusty Spur is a true country bar smack in the middle of Scottsdale. They have live music every afternoon and night seven days a week. It's locally owned, has been around forever. You're always greeted with a a warm welcome from the servers, band and patrons. The atmosphere is great and dollar bills cover the walls and ceiling. Little known fact... every year they have a party where they take down all the dollars, Rusty Spur then matches the amount and it all gets donated to a local Charity. Yee haw!
