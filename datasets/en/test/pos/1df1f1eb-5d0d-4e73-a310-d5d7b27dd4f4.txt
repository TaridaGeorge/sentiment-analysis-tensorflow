Really cute place and the food was delicious.  LOVED the sweet and sour soup (unlike any version I've ever had before).  It was yummy spicy, with pasta, veggies and a great light broth!

I loved the shared tapas plates and enjoyed everything we had a tofu red curry (spicy and yummy), rice and beef bbq.  What a great spot and recommend if your in town that you grab dinner!!!
