If you don't want to have to bother with parking, go shopping at around midnight. Me and my father have done this twice already, and while they are usually restocking shelves (which blocks some access in the aisles) it is very peaceful and we can get through for the basics. Not to mention it is cooler outside then. :)
They do, unfortunately, have some sections closed off at times at night. No big deal though.... And some of their graveyard staff seem a little on the unhappy side, but since it is a graveyard shift I understand if they're a little irritable. 
Prices are good and lots of stuff to choose from!
Also: This location used to be a Costco back in the day, so that explains the large size.
