This popular joint is my favorite pizza place  in the ASU vicinity. Nope, not in ASU itself but easily accessible from there, especially by bike - which is a good mode of transportation to this restaurant because the parking lot is often full. The servers are gracious and friendly, and the pizza is very good. I'm not much of a pasta person so I haven't tried their pasta dishes yet. Be prepared for a bit of a wait during dinner, although you can get seated faster if you opt to sit at the bar.
