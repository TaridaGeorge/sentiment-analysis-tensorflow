So as the current Duke of Press, I feel obligated to speak on this local gem.

This is my daily fix. From Coffee to fresh brewed Iced Tea and the best Cappuccino Ive had, Press is fantastic.

The staff is always friendly and super knowledgeable about what they serve.

The valley is lucky to have a homegrown business like this to call its own.
