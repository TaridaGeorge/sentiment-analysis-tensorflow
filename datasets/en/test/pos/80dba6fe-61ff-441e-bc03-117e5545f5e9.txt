Just as the card says.... Sorin the owner/operator of ABSOLUTE POOL CLEANING & REPAIR ... is HONEST. Truly a rare find here in Arizona. 

He services the Scottsdale area but will travel within the Phoenix Metro area. He does: Repairs, Maintenance, Service and Sales. Best yet aside from not wanting to rip me off is he really knew what he was doing.

We moved to a new home and discovered the pool was a disaster in every way. He has an engineering mind and really knew all the mechanical aspects of the pool and was really logical too. He is a rare find and everyone who reads this should use him or at least call him and find out for yourself. He is a keeper and probably the best pool professional around.
