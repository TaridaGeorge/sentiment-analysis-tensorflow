I was at school (ASU) over by Mill Ave and I had this outrageous craving for a frozen smoothie or ice cream shake.  I Yelped for the nearest spot and headed over.  The yogurt spot that was supposed to be there was gone, but I found "Cookiez on Mill" instead.  What absolute luck!!

This place has Italian soda, ice cream shakes, cream soda, cookie shakes, and more!  Wait?  Did I just say "cookie shake?"  Yes I did! And it was fantastic!!  I had a butter pecan cookie shake with white chocolate chip almond cookie blended into it.  OMG, talk about a flavor explosion of buttery pecan goodness in my mouth, this cookie shake was awesome.

I will be back, many times, to feed my insatiable sweet tooth that now craves cookiez on mill.
