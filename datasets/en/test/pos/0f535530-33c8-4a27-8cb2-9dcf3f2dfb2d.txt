We have been using Trustworthy Air for about 10 years.  They have always been honest and reliable.  When our old AC guy retired, we needed to find another company.  We saw the Dateline show where several companies were hired to check out an air conditioner in a home in Scottsdale.  The air conditioner was in perfect condition and Trustworthy was the only company in the test who said it needed no work.  That was very impressive since all the others were dishonest and found things wrong that weren't there.  We have been having them do our maintenance work ever since.  They are very honest and fair with pricing.  When it is time to replace our unit, we will be calling Trustworthy.
