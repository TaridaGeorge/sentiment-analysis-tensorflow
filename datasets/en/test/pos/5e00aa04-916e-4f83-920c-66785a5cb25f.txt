I was brimming with trailer trash jokes when I first heard about Delux. The idea of a classy hamburger joint seemed like an oxymoron to me. Now it just seems genius. They have an excellent selection of micro-brews. An upscale atmosphere and the burgers are some of the best I've had. I guess its not so much fancy than it is quality. Its a nice enough place to feel comfortable if your dressed up or in t-shirt and jeans. 
Hagan Daz milkshakes are better (and cheaper) here than they are at the Hagan Daz store.
