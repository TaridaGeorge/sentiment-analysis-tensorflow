Jack is the best barber in town.  I have been going to him for going on two years every other week.  Gotta keep my hair clean and tight,.  What can you say, he has been in the business for years and knows men's hair.  

I like that for $20 I get my hair cut (correctly), hot towels, a neck shave and message...  Why would you go to a crapper-cuts and pay 15 for a run of the mill cut when you get so much more, mainly quality, for an additional $5....

About once a month I take my son with me and we get a discount for the father/son combo, so it is $34...  

Jack's days off are Sunday (closed), Tuesday and Wednesday, so I try to get in on Mondays.
