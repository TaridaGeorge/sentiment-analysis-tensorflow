I came to Phoenix on business, I live in NY where there is truly great dinning and I have to say that Bobby Q's is the best BBQ I have ever had. I had the baby back ribs - which could be eaten with a knife and fork, but the BBQ sauce was so good, I had to clean the bones - they were amazing, the corn bread AMAZING!! Lindsay was our server and she was fantastic. So incredibly good, anytime I am in Phoenix I will def go to Bobby Q's. I am not leaving for a few days and intend on eating there one more time before I leave. Yum!! We also got 10% off our bill for saying yelp!! It would be worth double the price of what we paid without discount!!!
