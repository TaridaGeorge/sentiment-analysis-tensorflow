I have been seeing Dr Milana and his staff now for about 3 years (amazing how fast it goes when you see them every six months). The first time I met them they were friendly, professional, and engaging. Each time I go in they continue to ask me something about our last conversation we had six months ago. The hygienist have all been gentle but yet aggressive towards the culprits that linger in my mouth and Dr Milana has always been very efficient, effective, and professional. He will always take a few minutes to chat and see how I am over all. They have now moved over to their new home on Indian School and it is gorgeous! Great space and great location! I appreciate everything they do for me and will continue to take all my teeth needs there :)
