H. L. Mencken once said, "The martini: the only American invention as perfect as the sonnet."

Sidebar does this quote justice.

Quite possibly THE best Tanqueray Martini I've ever had. These guys (well, "ladies" to be proper. The blonde behind the bar is one of the best bartender's I've encountered) are amazing. They have a devilishly interesting cocktail menu which even enticed a gentleman like myself who usually drinks something straight to step outside of his box. Definitely try the Gin Blossom and the Whiskeyberry Sour. They're creative and delicious. If you've never had a Moscow Mule, please, do yourself a favor and get one here. It's too good to pass up (but just make sure to return the copper mug they serve it in!)
Maybe it's just me, but I was also impressed/very happy they had spearmint mints in the bathroom. It's the little things, I suppose...
