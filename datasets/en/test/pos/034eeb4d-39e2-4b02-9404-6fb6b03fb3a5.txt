Hand's down one of the best Apple Pies in town.  I've never actually eaten the sandwiches which appear interesting and delicious (clearly freshly made).  I generally run in here for a quick sugar pick me up back to the office.  The large display case will showcase large slices of cake, cupcakes and pie.  They are also selling mini-cupcakes in case you are feeling guilty about the sugar/fat thing.  I've never had a baked good here that wasn't delicious.  But seriously, try the pie.  A great mix of apples, cinamon and somehow the crust stays crispy without that weird feeling that you are ingesting too much shortening (which is my love/hate/complaint issue with Marie Callendar's pies).  Yummy goodness and you can get it by the slice.  A slice of heaven for about four bucks.  A better use of my lottery money than usual.
