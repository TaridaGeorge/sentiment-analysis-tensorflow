A little paradise tucked away around old town Scottsdale. If you've always wanted to have chef to cook for you this is the place! If you're a picky eater I suggest you call ahead of time to check up on what is being served here. The menu varies day by day and is usually up to the chef to decide. If you're having dinner here I recommend bringing a nice bottle of wine to enjoy with your dinner. Talk to the chef and you'll have a lovely dinner!
