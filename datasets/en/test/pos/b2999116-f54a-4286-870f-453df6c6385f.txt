Great steaks, perfectly executed side dishes, exceptional "steakhouse" wine list, meaning lots of full bodied choices, all the names that some diners seem married to and just enough obscure stuff to satisfy those who prefer smaller vineyards.  For a chain, they've also done an amazing job of giving the place a local feel.  Wine lockers with name plaques at the entrance, walls adorned with portraits of Arizona figures and a bit of Western Chic decor all help to set it apart from locations in other cities.  Oh, and their lunch menu is reasonably priced and packed with great stuff.  Solid place.
