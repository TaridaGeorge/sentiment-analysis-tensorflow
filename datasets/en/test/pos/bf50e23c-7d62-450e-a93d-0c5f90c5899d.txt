I love this place. I had researched a lot of offices and picked this one based on the reviews I found. It's a beautiful office with great staff. I didn't feel like they were just emptying my pockets.. Infact, when I couldn't afford the initial price quote they found a cheaper option for me that still included everything I needed. Foothills Smiles goes above and beyond to help you out. Very recommended. And this is coming from someone who HATES the dentist!
