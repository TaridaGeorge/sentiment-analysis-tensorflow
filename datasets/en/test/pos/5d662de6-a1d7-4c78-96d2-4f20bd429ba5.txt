My husband and I went to Binkley's this past weekend to celebrate our anniversary.  The food was outstanding, which is totally an understatement.  If you have been to French Laundry, you will appreciate this place even more.

To start with, the service is top notch.  They had us on the waiting list but went out of their way to squeeze us in.  They even gave us special menus with a "Happy Anniversary" message printed on top.  So sweet.

We each went with the tasting menu and wine pairing.  I had a steak that had this amazing truffle sauce with it and had the black truffle fondue for my cheese course.  By the time we left ($300 lighter) we were stuffed.  But it was absolutely worth it.  And it's a bit cheaper than French Laundry, so live it up!
