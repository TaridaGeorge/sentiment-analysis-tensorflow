Ice Ice Cream Baby
By The Rue

Mid-day snack is what I want,
Here is where I end my hunt,
It is just ice cream but that's okay,
If I could I'd go here every day,
Free kids scoop if you can guess,
The trivia on the board try your best,
I've been coming here for 5 years,
It's a shame they don't serve beers,
Cookies and cream and butter pecan,
I'd even eat it on my front lawn,
Sorry Julie H. had a bad experience,
At least it wasn't like Deliverence,
Jim the owner is a good guy,
Ask him for a sample, he will comply.

BR31!!
