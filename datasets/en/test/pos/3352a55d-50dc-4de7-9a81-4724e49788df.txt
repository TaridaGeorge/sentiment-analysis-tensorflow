Everything was phenomenal. The patio out back has the perfect ambiance for an intimate evening. Inside is bright and constantly moving. 

The Three Cheese Flatbread has a mouthful of magic in every bite. Even the bread with pesto and butter was the best little loaf of bread I've ever eaten. The Chicken BLT is highly reccomended for the bacon lover in your life. The owner even stopped by our table to say hi.

I love this place. You should too.

EDIT: Oh man, I almost forgot to write about their potato chips. They are kettle chips, and I can't place the flavor (Spicy Tangy BBQ-y Limey) except that they were so delicious I wanted to take a truckload home with me.
