I have only been to Fez a few times, but I haven't had a bad experience yet.  The ambiance is chill with a trendy LA vibe. Service is good and the servers are friendly. They have good cocktails, the salads are fresh and are topped with out of this world dressings, and the harissa fries are brilliant.  The veggie burger is a hit or miss.  If they get it right it is delicious, but sometimes they overcook it.  I look forward to trying their Sunday Brunch.  Overall I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Fez.
