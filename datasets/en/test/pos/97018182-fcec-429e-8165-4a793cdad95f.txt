I frequent this place during the week for lunch and have never been disappointed! The food is delicious and the portions are outstanding for the price. 

Extremely friendly service and it doesn't take them long to learn what you like. Always willing to cater to the guests. 
My one & only "complaint" would be I wish the place was bigger, sometimes it's hard to find a seat at their busy times.

You really ought to check this place out. Besides, it's hard to wrong with Greek food!
