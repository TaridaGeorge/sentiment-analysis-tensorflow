What a great park!  I went to my first Spring Training game yesterday (the Brewers were playing the Dodgers) and had a great time.  The park is small enough so that wherever you sit, you have a great view.  You may even be able to snag an autograph or two!  The atmosphere is very friendly all around.  Lots of food choices and Brewer souvenir stands.  You do have to drive through a crappy neighborhood to get there, but the parking inside is plentiful (with lots of BBQ's going on) and felt very safe.
