Really a nice place to go.  Wether your on foot or bike there is plenty of space to cruise.  My dog loves the birds around the lake!!  They have a dog park which gets crowded but it does have a lot of space.  I have not been to the pool yet or the tennis center, but from rollerblading by they look nice. 

Definently one of my favorite parts of living in the area
