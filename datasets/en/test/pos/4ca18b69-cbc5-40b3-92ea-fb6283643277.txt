I wish I could live here. The views are breathtaking, the architecture inspires confidence and pride and the library card this year is so cute! 
Libraries are not irrelevant, they have served a vital role in the development of the world and still have a place in the modern world. I'm the biggest supporter and user of modern technology and the Internet, but I could never undercut the value a good library brings to a community. Ours is over 280,000 square feet with 706,000 items spread across 5 floors. This library is a gem and makes me very proud of Phoenix.
