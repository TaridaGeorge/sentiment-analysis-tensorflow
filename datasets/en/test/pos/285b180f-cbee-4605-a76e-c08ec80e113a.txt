We made a quick stop for a late lunch as we were drove through Wickenburg the road from Phoenix to to Las Vegas. The food exceeded our expectations and was served up faster than most "fast food" restaurants. We ordered the pulled pork sandwich, brisket sandwich, baked beans, sweet potato fries, and potato salad. My wife thought the sweet potato fried were the best she has ever eaten. I thought my brisket sandwich was great until I tasted the pulled pork, which I rated even higher. The baked beans were to die for. And to top it all off, they served up a warm triple chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream. Wow!
