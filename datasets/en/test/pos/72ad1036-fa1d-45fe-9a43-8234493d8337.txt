A bunch of city folk (my family) heard about this place one evening and decided to give it a shot. It's located in the middle of god-knows-where and once the sun's gone down, it was certainly more of a trek than I am accustomed to. Once you get inside, though... man alive, you will be rewarded. The atmosphere is hilarious, the service really down-home friendly, and the mountains of meat they cart out and drop in the middle of your table are extremely special. And the sauce... oh what a fantastic sauce. Come hungry, leave the snobs and vegetarians at home, and you won't regret finding the Mining Camp.
