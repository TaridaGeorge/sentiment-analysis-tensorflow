Love the service and food. Nice, trendy Italian restaurant without the upscale cost and a fine dining experience. On top of that, our waiter was also Italian! The Chicken Parmagianna al Pomodoro was amazing as was the Penne Alla Casa and the Ravioli Checca. Food was delicious and presentation was stunning. The salad that came with the meal was also wonderful seasoned and served with perfection. No complaints whatsoever. Definitely a treat and a hidden gem in the city of Glendale. Five stars! :)
