Went there last night with a group of 32, for a special family celebration. I heard through Facebook of the excellent food and great selection of beers, gotta tell you we were not disappointed the food was soooo good that several members of our party requested to meet the chef, our waiter went to the kitchen and soon we were speaking with chef Diego, what a true professional who took the time to explain the dishes and their origins. A great experience and I look forward to returning.
