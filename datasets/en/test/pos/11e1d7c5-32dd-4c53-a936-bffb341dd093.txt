Amazing, especially for the East Valley. Their coffee has always been great - and they're one of the few places I've found that has butterscotch syrup! Butterscotch iced lattes are dreamy...

The Field Veggie sandwich is equally delicious. And their cupcakes are always dependably yummy - I tried the coffee and cigarettes one when they had it...so strange, but really good!

A really good find in the sea of Starbucks stores that is Gilbert.

Awesome atmosphere, too!
