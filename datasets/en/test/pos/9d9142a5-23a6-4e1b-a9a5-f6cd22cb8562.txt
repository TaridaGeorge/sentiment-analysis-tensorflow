We have been coming here since my son was 6 months old (he is now 2 1/2) This is the one place we can come and i feel 100% comfortable letting him run around and explore. The entire museum is kid friendly and has something in every corner. My son's favorite attraction here is not the giant play kitchen, the 3 story climber, or the huge arts and craft room.. but the simple noodle forest. He loves to walk back and forth through them and hide. The prices have gone up since we first became a member, but I still think the prices are well worth it ESPECIALLY in the summer when it's 114 out :)
