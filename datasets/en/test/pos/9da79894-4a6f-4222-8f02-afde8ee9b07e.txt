There really isn't much more to say, because you can see how awesome this place is from my original review. Or from the reviews of others.

I came in for the Yelp Eats UYE, and went to town by crushing some mad food.

On this particular night, I had the Yellowtail Sashimi, Pork Belly Steamed Buns, Soft Shell Crab Sandwich, and for dessert, another appetizer....the Teeter Tots. Yes, two entrees, and an appetizer for dessert. It was that damn good.

Don't waste time reading any more reviews. Just go. Nobuo. Now.
