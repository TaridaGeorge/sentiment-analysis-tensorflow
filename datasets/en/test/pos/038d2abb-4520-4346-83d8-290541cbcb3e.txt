My absolute favorite place for happy hour, and during the summer happy hour lasts all night!!! I've never actually eaten dinner here because the happy hour food menu is enough to fill you up, but I think I've tried almost all the items on the happy hour menu and I would recommend every one: Ahi tacos, guacamole, green chile pork stew, big ass burger, seared ahi, lamb chops and fondue and the drink specials are all mouth wateringly delicious! Also, they have bleu cheese stuffed olives which top off an already perfect dirty martini. I'm in heaven in this place and go back often. 

The bar area isn't too large, but happy hour is offered on both patio areas also, one of which is screened in and cooled. Very reasonable prices for happy hour items also, especially for the quality and quantity you receive.
