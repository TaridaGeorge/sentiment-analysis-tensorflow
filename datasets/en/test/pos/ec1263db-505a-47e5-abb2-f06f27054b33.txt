very healthy, delicious food. everything tastes fresh and not heavy at all! definitely great, healthy place to eat! even their nachos didn't make me feel sick and heavy afterwards!

i would recommend the chipotle black bean burger. packed with flavor!

i just have to say that it's NOT authentic Mediterranean food, they've taken the idea of Mediterranean food and "Americanized" it and they have a whole mix of different types of healthy food.
