We all know mattress shopping can be a bit of a pain, unless we know exactly what we want, which i didn't!  After laying on a few, I asked for a recommendation - and got a great one!  They had a $2500 mattress on sale for $800.  While it was more pricey than I had originally planned, the mattress came with a 20 year warranty, and he threw in a free bed frame,. as well as an excellent mattress pad with a 10 year warranty.  Plus the mattress is incredibly comfy, which was necessary for me since I fractured my back a few months ago and was having a hard time finding something that worked well with my back issues.
