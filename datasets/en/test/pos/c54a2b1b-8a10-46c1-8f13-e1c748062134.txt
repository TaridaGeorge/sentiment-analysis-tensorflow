Honest, efficient, high-quality. After moving from Central Phoenix, I didn't think I would find anyone as good as my last mechanic. Well, I have, and his name is Tim. The bill I received was $250 less than I expected, and the job was completed within six hours. I called multiple times to check in, and they were always happy to update me on the status of my car. 

Insofar as getting your car fixed can be a great experience, TMK Automotive delivered! Highly, highly recommended.
