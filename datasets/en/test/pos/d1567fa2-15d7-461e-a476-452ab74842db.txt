This place is great.  Everytime I go I either get the pastrami or the corned beef, so I can't comment on the rest of the menu but everything looks delicious here and I am sure it all is.  The pastrami and corned beef are amazing, never too much fat and never dry, and most importantly never chewy and always tender, perfect every time.  Granted I have never been to New York, but I feel their pastrami and corned beef is probably as good as anywhere.
