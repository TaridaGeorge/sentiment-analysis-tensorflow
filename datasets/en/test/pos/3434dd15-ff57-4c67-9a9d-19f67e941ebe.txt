How did I not know this is right across the street from my house??

I woudn't describe myself as a crafter or DIYer, but man this place has all kinds of fancy papers, from traditional to fun and contemporary! I bought these vintage anatomical papers that I plan to make posters from. The best part is that they were only $3.50!

They even sell Japanese Copic markers, take that Az art supply!
