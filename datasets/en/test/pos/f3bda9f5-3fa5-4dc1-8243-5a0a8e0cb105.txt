Great local chain.  I try to shop here instead of Whole Foods and not just because its closer to me, but because its nice to support locals for sure.

The quality here is amazing, awesome butcher case (Kobe!), great deli (Boars Head!), great prepared food (pizza is awesome!) and a fantastic bakery.

i try not to go here too often just because its bad for my wallet and my waistline!

Oh, and great beer and wine selection.  

I do all my "regular" shopping at Frys or Fresh and Easy and then get the luxury items here.
