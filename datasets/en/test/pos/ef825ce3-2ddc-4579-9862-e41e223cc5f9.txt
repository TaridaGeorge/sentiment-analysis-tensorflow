The tom yum soup (w/tofu) in the fire bowl was out of this world!! I had never had tom yum served like this. Give me this and a side of rice (I like to throw rice in there for more substance and to decrease the surface area of my tongue affected by the spicy soup) and I can die spicy happy in love. 

XOXOX TOM YUM!
