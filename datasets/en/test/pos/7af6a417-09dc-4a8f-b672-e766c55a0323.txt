James and his crew was very professional.  I would highly recommend them.  What I was most pleased with was the level of detail.  My tracks were cleaned out with who knows what, but they were dust free!  

I will say my windows are the only ones in my nieghborhood that stand out and I got them done about 3 weeks ago, who know clean screens would brighten up my home.  

I am very pleased, my second time using them and I got a 10% discount for being a repeat customer.
