I can't say enough about this store and the beautiful farm it resides on... 
I come here at least twice a month for all of my dairy needs; milk, butter, yogurt, farmer's cheese, ice cream, eggs and savory items that change often. The eggs are so delicious. 
The Mootique has so many adorable farm themed gifts. It is a wonderful place to take children. I always get a kick out of the cute unique things they have here.
