I can't say enough about this place.  The food is wonderful.  I am half middle eastern so I grew up on authentic arabic food.  Haji Baba is the only restaurant I have found in the Phoenix metro area that is VERY comparable to my Grandma's cooking.  The hummus and tabouli are excellent.  And if I were to recommend an entree, it would have to be the Chicken Shwarma plate.
