If you are in Phoenix, Pizzeria Bianco is a must!  
It is legendary and the wait is worth it!  Enjoy the experience, take it all in;
the pizza is brick oven fired, the wine list is great and the atmosphere is amazing.  Set in two of Phoenix's historical buildings, one is the waiting area and wine bar and the other is the main restaurant.
