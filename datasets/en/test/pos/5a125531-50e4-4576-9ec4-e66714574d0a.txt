great food-thai food as good as any I have tasted, I travel and have eaten Thai all around the southwest. excellent customer service. staff was very friendly-it showed in the way customers were greeted and responses from customers as they left. I just went in for food to go. got my food back to the hotel, tasted it, couldn't stop eating, well, except I had to take a breather and had to type this. if you want an appetizer get the the chicken lettuce wraps, shrimp and garlic-great, spicy noodles w/chicken-unreal. get some extra peanut sauce-am beside myself with the mixing of these dishes.
