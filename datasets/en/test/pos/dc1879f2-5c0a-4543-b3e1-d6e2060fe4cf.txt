Been coming to TexAz since 1985, back in the "Lonestar Steak" days. Never had a bad meal, had bad service just once in all that time, and 23 years later the prices aren't that much higher either. If I'm ever convicted of murder and sentenced to death my final meal has to be the Mulligan prime rib medium rare with mashed potatoes and that to-die-for cream gravy. I take friends here and buy them dinner just to see that look on their face when they see their plate for the first time. I've had everything on the menu except the catfish and all of it is great! I'd write more but I'm hungry now. See you there...
