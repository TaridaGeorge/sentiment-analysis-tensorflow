REALLY enjoyed this place. My parents found it in the newspaper a few months back, and have been raving about it. I was in town over Turkey Day, and they brought me. PHENOMENAL food. The Kung Pao beef was unbelievable. I won't even waste my time trying to tell you why, because there are just no words--go order it! The Sun Devil chicken was equally amazing, my mouth is watering as I type. Great / fast service and very modern spin (decor-wise) on a Chinese restaurant. Shanghai Grill only affirms my believe that the BEST of the best restaurants are found in strip malls.
I HIGHLY recommend this place!
