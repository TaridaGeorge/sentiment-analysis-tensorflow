Great place for brunch- especially their bottomless mimosas! Sitting outside by the fire place is so relaxing and smell great too! 

I was slightly disappointed when our heater ran out of fuel/gas right as we sat down and the servers said they couldn't A) move it and replace it with one not being used in the corner (even though the heaters have wheels and the patio was basically empty) or B) put a new tank in it...I would think for Saturday brunch when you know the patio is going to be full within the hour, an establishment such as this one should have an extra tank (or two) should the heaters need new one. Just saying...

Overall, one of my top favorite restaurants in town. :)
