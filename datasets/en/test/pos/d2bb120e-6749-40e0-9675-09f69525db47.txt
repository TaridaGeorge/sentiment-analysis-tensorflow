One of my Arcadia faves. Their sliders are great and so are the burgers, when I'm not in the mood for a burger their Chicago dogs are awesome (fully loaded w/all the fixings). Their french fries are my favorite, I always ask for them well done so they come out extra crispy. They also have fantastic malteds.
