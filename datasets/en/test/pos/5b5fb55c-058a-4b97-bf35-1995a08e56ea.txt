Ooohh Aunt Chiladas.  I came here last Friday night and was inside at the bar area with girlfriends.  It was my birthday, and as soon as my waitress, I think her name was Nicole, found out she offered me a birthday shot!  What a great way to start out the night!  Anyway, the food is mediocre but oh boy do they have a great tequila selection.  lets just say I dont remember much past the tequilas shots.  Anyway, if you want to have a great time, be sure to hit up Aunt Chiladas on a Friday night.
