This was AWESOME!!!!   

Ultimate way to bar hop.  What I saved on drinks paid for my seat on the bike.  Super nice guys that helped our large group keep moving.   They also traded out with some of the girls and helped pedal after 3 bars.   Definitely not difficult to do since Old Town is pretty flat.  

You should try this!   We went with a group that took up the whole bike, but had we gone with total strangers, I'd bet we have been good friends by the end and have had just as good of a time.   loved that we could play our own musice to pedal to. 

very unique and fun experience.
