Wow...this place is so darn good!  I checked out nocawich for lunch and was not disappointed at all!  The Doogie Howser was so flavorful...the carmelized onions were delicious!  The parsnip soup is not something I would normally order, but boy, was it good!  I can't wait to go back and try a Sunday Supper sometime.  Beware, lunch takes a little while to come out, but believe me, it is worth the wait!
