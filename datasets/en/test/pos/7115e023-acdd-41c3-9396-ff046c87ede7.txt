Cheap fare, clean, GPS accurate schedule times, fast, I feel safe, and well planned around major landmarks.  I could go on and on, but I say go give it a try!  The light rail is a fantastic alternative to going to Sky Harbor, a Sports event or concert in Phoenix or on ASU, a gathering at Tempe Lake Park, or just to grab dinner and drinks.  The best part too is the fact that future expansion to Glendale and deeper into Mesa will make the rail only better.
