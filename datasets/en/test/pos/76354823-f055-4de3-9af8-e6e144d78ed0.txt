To those of us recent and longtime sufferers of either wheat allergy or celiac disease this place is a godsend. Their breads, bagels and donuts are way beyond anything I've been able to get at either whole foods or sprouts. 

As other reviewers have noted they have several sandwiches they can make for you and every one I've had is good. By far my favorite is the philly cheese steak.

Additionally the staff is very friendly and helpful, and the decor of the bakery is bright and cheery. I cannot recommend this place enough!
