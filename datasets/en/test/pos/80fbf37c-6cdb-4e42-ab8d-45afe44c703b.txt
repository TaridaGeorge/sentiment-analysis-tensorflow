I almost cried during my meal here because Phoenix needs this restaurant SO BADLY.  It's hip and kind of elegant at the same time with stylized comfort food that's familiar but new at the same time.  

The cheddar scallion biscuits with bacon jam and a sunny side up quail egg...sublime!  Basil risotto was simply perfect and a great vegetarian option.  And while the lemon blueberry cheesecake was good, the accompanying tortilla ice cream changed my life; I could have eaten an entire plate of the ice cream alone.

Blue Hound is attached to the new Hotel Palomar, which is also well worth a visit, if only to see the ultra cool Arizona wing back chairs which I now want for my living room!
