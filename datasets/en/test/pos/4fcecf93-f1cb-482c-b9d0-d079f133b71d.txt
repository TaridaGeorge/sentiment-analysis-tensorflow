Central Valley Dentistry is the BEST dentist i have been to in quite some time. The front desk receptionist was VERY friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. I trusted her with billing as she was very confident about my insurance and her office billing procedures. Dr. Cook was Awesome! He took the time to explain thoroughly; in regular terms  course of treatment and the health of my mouth and teeth. The dental hygienist was Very knowledgeable explained everything before and while she was doing the procedures, also discussed costs up front, nothing hidden. Overall my experience at this office was spectacular. I will definitely   stay with this office and doctor.
