Definitely shop here if you want to set yourself apart from the Affliction wearing masses.  What you get here are hand selected items from the keen buyers at the store.  They keep a close watch on what is happening in the world of fashion.  Need new denim, this is the spot.  They know every curve of every cut to fit you skinny or plump juicy butt.

It does come with a price, but it is a small price to pay.

Plus, if you are lucky, you will get a nice cold beer when you shop.  Can't beat that in my book!
