I love this place! The custard is smooth and the folks running the place are very quick to offer up a sample. Everyday they have new flavor to try, but my favorite is the Custard with mint chocolate chip ice. Red velvet is another must try! It's nice to see a new place come to the neighborhood and great to see them doing it right!
