The food is amazing. I love the salad with the grapes, and of course, the bruchetta. 
I love the atmosphere, the music, the prices, and the service. The servers, bartenders, and manager are all oddly very good looking, which sometimes suggests a bit of snobbery, but not here, they are all fantastically friendly and good looking, so don't be fooled when you see all the sexy people. :) 

Definately one of the best places one could choose to eat at when in Phoenix. Brunch is awesome too. The scone with apricot jam, don't miss that, you will keel over with delight. The cucumber honey lemonade is sweet, but pretty fantastic too.
