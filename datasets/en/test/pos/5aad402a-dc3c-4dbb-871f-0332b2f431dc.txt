words can not describe the goodness that is matt's big breakfast. i came out here while on business/vacation and had matt's waffle. i have since been on a tear back here in L.A. looking for a waffle of equal caliber, but to no avail. 

light, fluffy, perfectly sweet. i've even contemplated braving the 120 degree + weather just to savor the waffle that obliterates all other waffles.
