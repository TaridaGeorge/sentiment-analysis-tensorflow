Fantastic food, service, and experience.  Will return regularly, as often as I get to town. 

Chilaquiles are fantastic.  Outstanding menu with sweet, savory, healthy if u r so inclined.  Next time, it's the fried chicken and waflles or is it the corn beef hash or an omelet.  So many decisions.  I'll have to come back again (and again, and again).  Service couldn't be better, and with a smile.  Well done Over Easy, well done.
