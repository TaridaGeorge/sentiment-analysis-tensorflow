As a geezer who never claims Omg. 

OMFG.

This places makes you wish you had Pavarotti's lungs and a full cello suite. 

Great food, great service. Order the Veal Francese or the Veal Marsala, with the inky Super Tuscan; Modus 2006 Ruffino.

The Tiramisu was superlative.

This is the ONLY place in Arizona I would put on par with my favorite comfort-preset phenomena: Flemings.

Do try it.

As for the 'strip-mall' woes below me; note that you're not on the pavement, yeah? Once you're in, you're in. 2 stars is bogus Scrapbooking-PMS whining. Get with the program, lass.
