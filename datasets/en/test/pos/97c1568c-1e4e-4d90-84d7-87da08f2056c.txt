My husband & I were getting ready to relocate after a year in a assisted living facility. We had our furniture & things in a storage unit & in the AL apartment. We are both disabled & needed lots of extra help at a affordable price. We decided to see if any other Yelpers had suggestions for a good moving company. 
We read the great reviews on Yelp about A WISE MOVE & decided to call them. So glad we did because we hired Mike & his crew for our big move. They took great care of us & our stuff. We were very impressed with  their professionalism, speed & efficiency.
