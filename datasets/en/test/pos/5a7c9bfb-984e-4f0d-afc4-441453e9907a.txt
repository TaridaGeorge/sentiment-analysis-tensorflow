I went out to dinner with some friends here for the first time. I loved it. They had live music outside, and heaters because it was cool. I love the option of outdoor seating. We got a cozy table in the back, everyone ordered tea. I got the indian spicy tea, which I don't know why because I only like it when Indians make it. I got the special and boy was it awesome. My friends got the capricolla and they loved it. I'm really excited to go back and try more pizzas :)
