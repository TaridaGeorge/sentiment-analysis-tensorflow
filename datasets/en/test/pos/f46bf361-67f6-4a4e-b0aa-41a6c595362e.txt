All I can say is that Capital Grill is always consistent.  I dine at this location regularly, but its truly good at any location I've been to: NY, Boston, Pittsburgh, etc.  The food is always great, but the service is top notch which in my opinion makes it worth the expense for what is typically an 'expense account' type restaurant.
