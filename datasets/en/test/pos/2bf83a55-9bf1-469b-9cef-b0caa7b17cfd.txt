Very diverse menu. First time visitor and I had teh Brie and Bleu omelette. I'm not a bleu cheese fan, but this was de-lish! It was broccoli and water chestnuts in it which was very unusual. The potatoes were good as well, not greasy at all like some places. The staff was very friendly and our server got our order exactly right even though she did not write anything down. Impressive!!!

Highly recommended.
