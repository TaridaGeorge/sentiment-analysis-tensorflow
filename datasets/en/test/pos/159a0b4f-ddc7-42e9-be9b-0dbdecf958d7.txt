I visited 5th and Wine with a large group, and this visit was as special as each past visit.  Despite making the reservation for only about half the final party size, we were all impressed with the service, which was attentive, quick, and accurate.  As our party grew larger than the reservation, 5th and Wine promptly reseated us and ensured people received drinks quickly upon arrival.  For such a large group, 5th and Wine handled the drink and food orders promptly and even split bills with no trouble.  On top of that, the wine was excellent, and the bruschetta alone is worth the trip!  Saturday night live music is also a worth-the-trip bonus.  I visit often and will continue to visit 5th and Wine for special occasions and for regular happy hours with friends!!
