When it comes to sandwiches, it doesn't get much better than this without going much further and paying much more. The food is ridiculously cheap, but you wouldn't know that just from eating it - you'd have to go to the establishment itself, where the various cost saving measures become obvious. The ambience is non-existent (you might as well be sitting in the middle of a supermarket eating), but it's clean and quick.
As others have said, the baguettes are absolutely delicious, but the drink, meats, and vegetables are wonderful as well.
Unless you're adamantly opposed to sandwiches, meat, or a plain atmosphere you're going to at least like this place.
