My friend and I have literally spent the last week at this place studying for a national exam we have coming up. We've eaten 2-3 meals here per day for the last five days and honestly everything I've had has been so good. And the prices are great! What I love the most are the people who work there. They are so friendly. Everyone coming to our table and promptly removing plates, the manager just asking if we're doing ok, and making sure the Internet is working right. I mean really a nice place so spend a morning, evening, and like us... Entire days!! :)
