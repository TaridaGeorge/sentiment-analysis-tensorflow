Been going here for almost a decade.  Never had any problems.  Very affordable, speedy cleaning and I don't have that funky after-drycleaning stiff feeling you'd normally get at these cheap $2.29 cleaners.  (You know what I'm talkin' about)  

They really do a great job and don't damage your clothes by putting stickers on your clothes like they do at the "organic drycleaners".  Just a safety pin with a piece of paper on the clothing label. 

They only accept cash or checks. Worse case scenario, you can use the ATM they have inside their store.
