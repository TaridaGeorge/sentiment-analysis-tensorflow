I don't think I have ever had anything here that I didn't like.  I like their sliders, although it changes daily I think.  You have to ask the server what the chef has chosen to serve for that day.  I do always have the same dish, the prime steak with a mushroom gravy.  My husband loves the fez burger.  They have a drink special everyday for the whole day.  I always end up going to FEZ on Fridays so when they serve their vodka pomegranate press for $3.  You can't really go wrong with that.  They have happy hour 7 days a week and reverse happy hour too.
