Halloween pub ride!!!!!! For the upteenth annual Rage Halloween pub ride, things ran a little differently. same rowdy crowd, same meetup locale, but this time, they had some serious organization going on. 5 bucks got you a wrist band for the after party, which was a big ordeal in itself....a carney show, bike wrestling, a band, and alcoholic beverages. 

we headed out from rage promptly after 5pm.....closer to 6pm, to Frashers for the first stop, TT roadhouse for stop 2, then to a private clubhouse/function hall area for the 3rd and final stop. hundreds of halloween dressed characters winding up and down scottsdale and 68th street is nothing less than a treat!!!!

thanks again rage for a fabooooooo night of fun!
