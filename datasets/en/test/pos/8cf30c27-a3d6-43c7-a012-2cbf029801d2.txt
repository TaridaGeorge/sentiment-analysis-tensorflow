I used to go to Munch A Mania a lot years ago when I worked at my family's nearby business. Recently, I popped in there one day when I was in the area during the week (they are closed on the weekends). Gordon, the owner, recognized me from literally about a decade earlier! Once I remeinded him where he knew me from, he asked me all about my family members by name! They still go in regularly. 

The food was just as great as ever. The fast, friendly service hasn't changed a bit.

Unique breakfast choices and good prices, especially on the daily specials. Try the B.B.C.T.O! Bagel, bacon, cream cheese, tomato, onion. Add an A (avocado) too. The onion is a paper thin red onion and the combination of it all is fantastic!
