This place rocks!   There's no fire or gigantic koi ponds to captivate your senses but if you're looking for fresh fish and food that will knock your socks off...  this is the best sushi.  Toyama's a quint sushi bar with an extremely cool owner/sushi chef named Mo, who aims to please!   Mo is from Japan and as authentic as the food, plus a funny guy to talk with.  It's really cool to see an owner take such pleasure and pride in his craft.  The food is awesome and shows Mo's passion for delighting his clientele.  I highly suggest not looking at the menu or the specials and ask Mo to "hook you up".  I don't think I've had the same thing twice.  I'm a new "regular" and I like it!
