So beautiful and peaceful.  (The best one I've been to is the one in SF).  It's close to a park, and has multiple waterfalls.  We came before it closed on sunday (check hours, sunday closes at 3pm). So i didn't get to drink any tea. They are building something near the entrance. Forgot what it is, but it looks like it will be nice. They have a tea ceremony on the 2nd sat of every month (call ahead to verify, that's what the lady said, i missed it by a day).
