This was the absolute best experience I've ever had buying a car!  Desiree and Jason, in sales, made me feel so comfortable and right at home at the dealership.  They were beyond courteous and efficient, making the transaction effortless.  I can't forget to mention Patty in financing.  She was very kind and informative, and made the whole financing process painless.  I'm so impressed with this dealership and am extremely happy with the purchase of my vehicle from start to finish.  I will definitely purchase my next vehicle from Land Rover North Scottsdale!
