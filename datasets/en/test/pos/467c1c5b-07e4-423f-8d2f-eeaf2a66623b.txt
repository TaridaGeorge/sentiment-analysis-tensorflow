I have nothing but positive things to say about Tuck Shop.  The decor is contemporary and thoughtfully laid out.  There's a small bar and a comfortable seating area in addition to the main dining area.  You can order in any of the three areas and the wait staff is both kind and helpful.  We had two appetizers and three entrees to share among three people and were plenty satisfied.  The potato wedges with aioli were fantastic, as was the beet salad.  The panini "bites" were large enough to share and the chocolate souffl√© was a great end to a terrific meal.  This place is a great addition to the "downtown" scene!  It's both casual and a pseudo-foodie place.  I can't wait to try the owners Sunday prix fix meals.
