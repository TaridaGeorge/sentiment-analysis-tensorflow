This place is amazing! I catered from here for my company and everyone loved it. At first people were hesistant because they thought it was going to be just salads but they have so many other delicious things on their menu! Their dressings are amazing and they put a lot of meet on the salads. My boyfriend also tried the tilapia wrap and pan fried noodles and was in love with both! If you want to eat somewhere affordable and healthy, definitly try this place out :)
