we stopped in for an afternoon snack and a glass of wine on th weekend.  They were doing a brunch thing....breakfast menu plus BLT and the burger. We split the BLT and loved it...get a side of that sandwich's  pesty mayoo to dip your sweet potato fries in. Delish!  Very cool setting, nice decor, great service.
