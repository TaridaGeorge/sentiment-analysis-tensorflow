Mmm ...FEZ...

The food is delicious, the desserts are sinful, the drinks are amazing...and the service is great! (Attentive, but not aggressive/Kind but also genuine)   : )

Try the FEZ Burger (The vegetarian version is glorious: with hummus, grilled onions, ciabatta bun and black bean burger patty), and the the Rosemary and Garlic Fries (with either of the aiolis). Both are addicting. They also have really great seasonal specials, if you're interested in trying something new/venturing outside of your comfort zone.

They have a wonderful Happy Hour (and reverse) as well as Brunch Saturday/Sunday.

BEST of all: they're also open really late, which is wonderful when you really don't want after-hours drive through "food".
