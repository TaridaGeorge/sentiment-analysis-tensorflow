This place is a hidden gem!! Service was awesome & the food was even better! All of Victoria's suggestions were perfect.  You really cant order anything bad here! Such a cute family restaurant. And you cant beat the WEDNESDAY $1.25 fish tacos and $1 margaritas!!! I'll never go to another mexican restaurant in the valley!
