Came here for the first time the other day and I was impressed. I guess I'm used to chain Mexican restaurants where the food is mediocre at best, so this was a pleasant surprise. 

I've heard there is always a long wait, but it took only about 20 minutes to get seated.  The atmosphere is nice, but the prices were a little higher than I expected.  That being said, once I received my food, I wasn't bothered by the price anymore.

If you're a sangria fan, you're going to fall in love with this place. They have a fantastic sangria here, but be careful because it's also really strong.
