Some people like Pottery Barn I LOVE Crate and Barrel. As much as I love Target they don't always cut it in the cooking section. If you need some crazy and fun cooking gadgets Crate and Barrel probably has what you are looking for plus a million other things you never knew you wanted. Besides an awesome kitchen section Crate and Barrel also has home decor, furniture, and bedding. 

One day when I am ready to say I DO I am getting registered here! And I'm going crazy with the scanner!

My only question is why do they call it Crate and Barrel?
