Now called the US Airways Center, this is one of my favorite places to be. Not only because I am a huge Suns fan (which I am), but it's just a generally good vibe in there. Food is, well stadium food, but who goes for the food? The sound system is good and the seating structure is intuitive and easy to navigate. 

The Suns still have the best introduction ceremony I have ever seen and I think a big part of it is this arena.
