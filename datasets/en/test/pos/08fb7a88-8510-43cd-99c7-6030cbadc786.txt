This is one of the best vintage shops I've ever been to. She has a wide selection of things. You need to be prepared to really spend some time in here. Like any vintage store, there are lots of different types of things all thrown together that you need to shop through - the difference is the quality of stuff in here. I could have spent hours and tons of money in here. 

The owner has a great selection of vintage jewelry, handbags and clothing along with stuff for the home. I walked away with some really unique pieces. The best part is that she was super friendly and really helpful. She even called a friend she has who shops vintage in San Diego to let me know where I should focus my searches - that is awesome customer service!
