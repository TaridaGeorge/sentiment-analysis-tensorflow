Okay. I think it's safe to say that the Cine Capri at Tempe Marketplace is the best screen to watch any movie. There's usually a couple dollar increase in the ticket price, but it's worth is if you want to enjoy the movie you are there to watch. This theater gets the most attention from staff as well so it's always clean. It's also the best place to watch a movie on opening night. Go see TRON at this theater December 16th.
