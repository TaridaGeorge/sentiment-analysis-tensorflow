We tried The Olive Tree tonight after many positive reviews from friends. It was so good. My husband had the Gyro plate and spinach pie and I had the #1 veggie plate (hummus, falafel and babaghnooj). My husband had told them it was our anniversary and they brought us some tabbooli salad to share while we waited. We had baklava for dessert. The service was excellent. Overall a great experience-we will be going back for sure!
