After a frustrating experience at Lowe's, I drove over to Ace hoping for better service. 

I was in luck. The employees were very helpful, even for an unusual request like mine. I received personal service, and the cashier was very friendly and chatty. 

Ace earned my business, I absolutely recommend them over the Depot or Lowe's.
