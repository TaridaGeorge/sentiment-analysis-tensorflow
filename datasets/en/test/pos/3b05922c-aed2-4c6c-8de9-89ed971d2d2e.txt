I love this museum, you see the instruments and you also get the opportunity to listen to what they actually sound like which is really cool also it shows each country and what they have brought to the table as far as music goes interesting indeed.  the place itself is beautiful my friends and i really enjoyed it.  i recommend everyone checks it out
