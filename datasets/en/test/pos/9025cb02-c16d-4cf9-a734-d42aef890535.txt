Winco is a great grocery store. I can get almost everything I need there.

Here's their angle: They don't take credit cards (but debit is OK) and they don't hire people to bag (you just do it yourself). Then they take the savings and make their prices lower, and I don't see anything wrong with that.

There's no pharmacy though, so there's still a need for me to go to the other stores. But they have awesome stuff there. Tons of things you can but in bulk by the pound (Candy, rice, dog food, snacks, nuts, coffee, honey, peanut butter, and more)

And the $2 pre-made pizza crusts...amazing deal.
