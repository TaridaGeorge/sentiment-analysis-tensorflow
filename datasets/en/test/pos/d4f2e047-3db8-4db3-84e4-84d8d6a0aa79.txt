Did I tell you I love Dim Sum!?  This place is fast becoming my spot for Dim Sum.  The owner actually walks around trying to sell what he's made for the day.  He's got that old Chinese, kung-fu man look haha!  He's so awesome and funny.  Anyways, the Dim Sum here reminds me of the good California Dim Sum places.   They definitely have stuff here I've never tried, but sometimes that's a good thing haha!  I love their staff always so friendly - so it was a surprise to me...where's my crappy Dim Sum service I enjoy so much!  This place is located next to Lee Lee's supermarket...so go have some Dim Sum and go buy your bag of rice for dinner in one shot -- Bam! :)
