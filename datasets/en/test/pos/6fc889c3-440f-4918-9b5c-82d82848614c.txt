I have been to Carlsbad tavern for dinner and lunch several times. I never eat the same thing twice in a row. The only reason i do this is beacause everything that I try is awesome so i can't wait to try something new. The place is cool and the staff is great. They are always polite and helpful. The manager and owners are always in the restaurant to help the employees during crunch times. I think that is very important to any business. I recomend Carlsbad Tavern to everyone i meet.
