This restaurant is fantastic.  The food is wonderful.  The location and outdoor patios are great.  There is a private room for parties.  The food is amazing is a great place to go if you have food sensitivities.

Pretty much everything on the menu is or can be Gluten Free.  This place is a must stop for Celiacs and the gluten intolerant.

Bravo.
