I went for a facial yesterday and had another great day at the spa. It being summer in the desert, there were hardly any people there and I had the steam room, sauna and soaking tub all to myself while I did the purification ritual. The gym was also practically empty and I got in a great workout in minimal time with no stress. 

Brandi gave me the most enjoyable facial I've ever had and my skin looked fantastic afterwards. She also gave my hands and feet a moisturizing treatment and a nice massage that didn't tickle at all!

I love Golden Door and the Boulders. On this trip I saw deer, javelines (wild pigs), quail, chipmunks, toads, roadrunners, a huge tarantula, etc. such a nice getaway and relaxing couple of days, I can't recommend it enough!
