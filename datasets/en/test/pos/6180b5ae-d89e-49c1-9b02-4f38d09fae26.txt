O.H.S.O. doesn't stand for anything in particular but who cares? This place has a nice feel, friendly service, and a terrific brunch. The food was uber-tasty, but what really wowed us was the $10 price for a brunch item plus a 10 ounce beer. Where else can you be fed like that? Good menu choices like breakfast burritos, green pork chile, and a fantastic french toast with toppings. Love the open garage door windows and the cool mist on the toasty Arizona patio.
