Our son has been happily swimming at Gold Medal for years. He's just finished his third summer swim team season and is more excited about swimming than ever. The school does a great job of teaching swimming, including fine points of technique and nuances of competition, while keeping it fun and keeping kids interested. We've also enjoyed having some of the same coaches and instructors for our entire time at Gold Medal, so that they really have come to know us and our son and are able to tailor lessons to him to keep him improving and, again, into it.
