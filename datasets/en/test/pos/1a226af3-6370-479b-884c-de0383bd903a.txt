I've been here once, because my hours are not quite "bakers hours".. but it was really really good. The service reminded me of being back home in my small town. Hubby had turkey on marble rye and I had a bagel sandwich. Both delicious. Service was fantastic. Don't live on this side of town anymore, but this is definitely a gem worth visiting.
