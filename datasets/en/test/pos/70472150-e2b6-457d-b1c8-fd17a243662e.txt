We've been coming here for over 10 years. I grew up in Europe where the Asian restaurants are far more authentic. Golden Gate is about as good as it gets in Phoenix.
It's small and intimate, the service is fast and friendly, the food is amazing, the prices are remarkably low, and it is privately owned and operated. You can't beat it!
