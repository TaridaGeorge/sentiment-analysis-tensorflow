I love Eddie's House.  I ordered the sopes for an appetizer which were really good, and for the main entree I had "The famous, one and only, whats in this steak"...This has to be one of the best meals that I have ever had.  I love a good steak, and rolling a filet mignon with garlic mashed potatoes is a whole lot of awesomeness.  I had a great time, good service and I definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a nice dinner!
