Great selections and prices. Super easy to find what I need. They offer coupons, both on items and off total purchases, as well as specials on products needing to be consumed by the end of the day. I like many of the house brand products, especially unsweetened organic soy milk, eat well frozen meals, and the tortilla chips. I love that they clearance out low sellers such as certain scents of laundry detergent or cleaning products, etc.  I have been shopping at this location for about 6 months and plan to continue until I am no longer in the neighborhood.
