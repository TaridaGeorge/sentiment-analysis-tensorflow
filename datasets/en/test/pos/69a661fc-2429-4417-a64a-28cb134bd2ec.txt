Delicious!

Order the Risotto.  

That's all I can really tell you because that's the only entree I've had here, but I haven't found a need to try anything else.  And that's big coming from me because I usually love to try different things.  But here I've found something so good (the Risotto) I don't want to try anything else, at least not yet and probably not for a long time.

Try it!  You will love the Risotto!
