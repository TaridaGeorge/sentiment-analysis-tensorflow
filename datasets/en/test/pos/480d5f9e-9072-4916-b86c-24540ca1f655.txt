Hands down: my favorite place in Phoenix  to hang out. Great beer selection, the jive turkey sandwich with it's jalapeno spread is amazing, and the crusty mac'n'cheese with green chilies has me drooling on my keyboard as I type. The mix of hip-hop/eclectic music with the relaxing patio and great service make for an awesome place to chill with friends.
