LOVE IT!  Drip is a FAB place!

The service was generous & friendly.  Coffee & treats? Delish! 

Free wi-fi and many easily available electrical plugs make it a hot  meeting place.

I met one of my clients there for the first time  2 weeks ago - we enjoyed it so much - we are going back again this week.

The owner Gina Madrid is as hip & gracious as they get.  Gina introduced herself & made us feel right home.   

Mod decor.  Mad good cookies.  My cup of Joe!  

Definitely worth the trip to Drip!
