This is what I love about Phoenix, you find these little treasures where you expect them the least!

Loved everything about the place. We had a team dinner in one of the rooms and it really felt like we were having dinner in someone's dining room. Super cute atmosphere, loved the pictures from all over Europe. I has the vegetarian rellenos (sp?) and my mouth is still watering just thinking about it. 

We also had the only malbec they have by the bottle and it was delicious!!
