Terrific place! Two words: Chai Latte. Delicious! Best coffee drink I've ever had. The Clucker breakfast sandwich is awesome too.  Eggs, ham (or bacon or sausage) and cheese on a bagel is elevated to sublime by juicy tomato and peppery arugula. We have also gotten ice cream there.  The mint chocolate chip was very tasty with nice delicate mint flavor. 

Overall, a very cute place with exceptional coffee and food!
