So I went in here and saw that they have Mac n Cheese. What I got was better than I could have ever hoped for. It's homemade Mac N Cheese, the noodles were cooked perfect and the mixture of the cheeses( I believe 3 of them) went perfect together. I am embarrassed to say but I not only for seconds, I went for thirds! And they are very big portions too, I just couldn't get enough. The tomato mozzarella sandwich is awesome as well. The staff is super nice, don't pass this place up.
