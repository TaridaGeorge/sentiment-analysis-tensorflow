This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Goodyear area. Every single dish I've ever had is good. Try one of the soups. My favorites are the potato cream cheese and the mushroom. I also love their chopped salad with salmon. If you don't like fish, though, you can substitute chicken. The cranberry-oatmeal cookies and the cranberry scones are delectable!
