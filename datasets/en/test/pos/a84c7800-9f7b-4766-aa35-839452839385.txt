This place is wonderfull!! I eat there at least once a week...the food is flavorfull and delightfull...I have spread the word about med fresh and my friends agree its wonderfull! They never use a microwave and prepare everything in fron of you.

This place isn't fast food so don't compare it to Mcdonalds, it gets the job done and I highly recommend it.
