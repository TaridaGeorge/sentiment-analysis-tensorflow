At another recent trip to Humble Pie after work with friends, I was introduced to a slightly off-menu item that has to be tried to be appreciated. Order the Garlic & Potato pizza and then ask them to include Pancetta as a topping. The combination of all of the flavors really works together: the bacon-y goodness of the pancetta, the herbal notes from the rosemary-seasoned potatoes, the rich roasted garlic and pungent Gorgonzola. A new favorite!
