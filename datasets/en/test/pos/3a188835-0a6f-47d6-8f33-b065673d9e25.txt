One of the most incredible space in downtown Phoenix. 

Always a delightful experience. 

This last Art Detour (2008), on the second floor I saw two ghosts.  So that was pretty awesome.  My boyfriend opened the door and then closed it and I said let's go in there.  He said there was nothing in there.  I said I saw two people walking.  I really did.  He opened the door and in the back of the room, I saw a light and two people walking.  We opened the door again, and it was pitch black and empty.  Totally freaky!
