I am equaly surprised at a 2 star review.  I am fairly new to the Phoenix area and was introduced to the store by a friend.  I cannot begin to tell you how great this store is.  The service I have received here is outstanding!  No question!  I had a special holiday dinner and needed a product customized.  The staff went out of their way to "get it right" for me.  Not only once!  Their prices are unbeatable.  I can gratefully overlook any minor inconveniences, I just do it another way.  It is a little out of my way to go there, but I go as much as I can.  Keep up the great work.
