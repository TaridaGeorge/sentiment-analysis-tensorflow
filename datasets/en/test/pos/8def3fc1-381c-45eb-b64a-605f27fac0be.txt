Been going to Biltmore Fashion Park for years now, and love it, it's well manicured and landscaped walkways make for an excellent treat from the grit and road-happy-facing-shopping-strips, we seem to be so fond of in Phoenix. I only noticed the huge eucalyptus tree near the middle square only recently. I loved hanging out at the old Coffee Plantation, now replaced by a Hollywood type of dining establishment. I have yet to go but hope too. Some of my best dining experiences have been there, and I even love the California Pizza Kitchen's ambience. The bookstore is wonderful not to mention the apple store, and of course every G-Boy's favorite, or at least should be, Macy's! Biltmore may you always be there to save Phoenix from the drudgery of street-facing-strip malls.
