ever watch mtv and see the people going to some redik spa that has everything you could possibly want?

yeah, that's the boulders.....

words can't describe how amazing this place is on the whole. it's out in the middle of nowhere and there are dirt trails leading everywhere. your room is this amazingly choice hacienda along the path (close to everything) which is great. they have a couple of pools, but what you need to come for is the spa.

we're talking saunas, steam rooms, smoothies, a decent gym, robes, you name it. fountains everywhere, amazing deco on the inside. just unreal. 

very expensive. but very worth it.
