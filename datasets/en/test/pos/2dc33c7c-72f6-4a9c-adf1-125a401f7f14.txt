12 hours before my flight, my Boxer jumped through a plate glass window and ended up with a bad laceration on her front leg. At my sister's suggestion, I drove to her vet (Dr. Cruz) and arrived 15 minutes before closing time. Not only did he take his time with us, he offered to keep my baby all weekend because he knew I had to fly out first thing in the morning. His prices were upfront and competitive, and he took great care of my princess for the entire 4 days I was gone. I appreciated that he didn't rush us, and even more appreciative that he didn't "price gouge" us for emergency services. He even tried to find us the cheapest route possible by bundling services and providing discounts. Dr. Cruz was just amazing, and I will definitely be returning with all of my pets!
