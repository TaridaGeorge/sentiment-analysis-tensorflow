A friend told me about the wine club they offer and I went in to check it out. What a great little place. Very cozy with a wine bar, couple of leather seats to relax and a few high top tables all within a great wine store. The wine club provides 2 bottles a month and tons of specials, including discount wine tasting every weekend.  It is great for someone wanting to learn more about wine and get into the hobby.  The owner is knowledgeable, friendly and not a wine-snob.  I feel very comfortable here and relaxed.....
