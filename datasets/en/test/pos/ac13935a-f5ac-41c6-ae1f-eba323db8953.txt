Bombero's is the BOMB!  Went for my first time Friday night, And it will most surly not be my last! Perfect Place to "wine" down after a loong week and just chill/drink/conversate with your most charming friends and watch their faces glow next to the flames while the warmness melt onto your skin from the pitfire..  ahhh... Oh yeah and the waiter there that night was one of the coolest I have yet to meet.
