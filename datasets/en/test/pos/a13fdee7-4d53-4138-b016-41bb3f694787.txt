Find out where your little potatoes came from! That was so fun.  
 
This is the place you come to enjoy a good burger before you head upstairs to enjoy a comedy show or a night of bowling with the pals. The fries come is  a huge paper bag underneath the juicy burger. The peanuts were the only thing I did not undersand about the GUYS menu. Well the peanuts are not on the menu but they were available. I felt like I was at the game again...  
 
The price is right when you make it a combo night. So spurge and know your little french fries were once from Sugar Sugar City, ID! well not every night but mine were. Haha
