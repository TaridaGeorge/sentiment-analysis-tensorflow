Gotta love a Scandinavian restaurant that also serves German and Polish food! The food in this family-run business is really good and service is warm and very friendly.  You certainly won't leave hungry, and depending on what you order you may be taking some of your lunch or dinner home because the total amount of food you get on your plate is quite generous. My favorites are the laxpudding and the Beaver Supreme dessert.
