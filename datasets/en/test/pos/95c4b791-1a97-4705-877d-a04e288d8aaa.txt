Dennita scores again with her latest Costume Institute function !!!

The focus was Halston, his work and a strange but highly inciteful film about this American fashion icon prevailing over the 1970's and beyond.

Lots of young stylish men and women seem to echo my sentiments.  Dennita is the chief curator of the Costume Institute. For the last 8 years approx. she has brought needed energy and momentum to this faction of the museum. 

We are blessed to have her in our midst!

Anxiously awaiting her next event !

This one was entirely affordable at $20, offering a pre-party with yummy food and a 2 hour film.  Cash bar was reasonably priced as well.
