I'm a huge fan of Tyson Crosbie's photography. 

I really like his art and his 21 series. I love the images he creates as well as his philosophy. I think it's intriguing the way he chooses a city, digs in and discovers it and then reveals different parts about it.

I'm also a particular fan of his event photography. I love the way that he is able to wander around unnoticed and then snap shots that I would never think of getting let alone be able to capture. I'm amazed at the images he creates from often the same events that I have attended. He brings out beauty that I don't even notice.

I do also love his portrait photography as well. His ability to take advantage of existing lighting and his artistic framing are remarkable.

Big, big fan.
