Arrived during happy hour on wed evening.The Bartenders and managers were very busy serving and getting orders perfect. Everyone was happy and gave me the best service ever! They gave me a great menu to choose from and a great selection of happy hour items. There were people around getting perfect service and sipping on their beautifull drinks. Sapporo was perfectly clean and the dishes, drink glasses sparkled! I had the spicey tuna rolls and the ginger boneless chicken wings. Amazing! Great variety of tastes that hit your tastebuds and the drinks washed it down perfectly!  The order of ginger wings were the best ever! Furthermore, spicey tuna rolls were just enough to make the night complete. Overall everything from temp of the food and quick service was outstanding! An amazing place that has the best service and sushi in town!
