Absolutely delicious! My boyfriend tends to stray from any restaurant associated with terms like "organic" or "vegetarian" but after dining at true foods we were both believers for this anti-inflammatory food diet. The butternut squash ravioli was so light, yet full of flavor. The mushrooms gave an amazing meatiness without the heaviness. The bison burger was moist and topped with the perfect accoutrements. True foods left me happy, full but comfortable, and now on the hunt for more.
