Fabulous store!!  My husband and I purchase all of our dog supplies from here, and we come back over and over again!  We love the high quality food they sell (no gluten, fillers, etc.), as well as the exceptional service.  They remember us very time we come in, and they are always excited to see our dog, Lucy.  We lived close to this store for a while and never knew they sold dog supplies, but after we've shopped here, believe me - we won't be going anywhere else!!
