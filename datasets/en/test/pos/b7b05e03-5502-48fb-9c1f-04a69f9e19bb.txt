Just finished my first half marathon on cheap running shoes and needed real running shoes.  Went it today and was offered exceptional service as they watched me run on the treadmill to see what type of shoe i needed.   they brought out 6 pairs of shoes and spent plenty of time explaining what i should be looking for in a shoe.  i was able to test them outside running and see which ones were the best fit.

they were all great and i would go back in the future for other running items and maybe even join their group runs.
