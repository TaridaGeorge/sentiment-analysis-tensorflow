I arrived at 10:30, intending to grab an espresso at Lux before picking up my sandwich and heading to work.  An ad hoc line had already loosely formed around the door and front window.

The caprese salad was divine.  I'm not a huge fan of tomato and was in it for the mozzarella and basil, so I pulled it out and passed it on to my delighted coworkers.  The soppressata?  Just as amazing.  The focaccia was perfect and I couldn't ask for anything more.

Honestly?  There's nothing I can add to the other reviews and simply wanted to chime in with "me, too".

Also: Cowgirl Creamery cheese!  That was a delightful surprise.
