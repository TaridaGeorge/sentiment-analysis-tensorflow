Wow! Totally impressed with this academy. After my last hair gal moved from AZ, I gave the academy a call and they got me in on a Saturday. I grabbed a photo that I wanted along with color ideas and off I went. The girl I had was fabulous! She had been there for about 4 months and I didn't mind at all when she would ask the instructor for help! The color turned out great and the cut turned out way better than the photo I brought in! Since the instructors have to approve all their work, you can't go wrong. So, cut, color, highlights only cost me $55 and its one of the best cuts I have ever had!
