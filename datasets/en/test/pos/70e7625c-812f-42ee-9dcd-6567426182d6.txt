Tonia and Tony...two Yelpers on a mission...attempting to answer the question...

'Why has My Florist received mediocre reviews on Yelp??'

Tonia and Tony decided to see for themselves and try My Florist once again.  The results?

Tonia giggled in delight over her delicious salad...

Tony practically dove in head first into his bowl of tiger prawns.

And beware -- the frosting on the carrot cake is like crack.

I gave My Florist four stars the last visit...but now I see it deserves five stars for quality food,  great service, a super cool space, and for being totally light rail convenient.
