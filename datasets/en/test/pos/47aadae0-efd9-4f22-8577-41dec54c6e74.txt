Nordstrom is simply the best department store.  Hands down.  I frequent Nordstrom's, Nordstrom's Rack and Nordstrom's Last Chance.  They just know how to do customer service and make you feel so good.  I actually just bought my wedding dress here! My bridesmaids bought their dresses at Nordstrom because I did NOT want matchy matchy and they also had a great experience.  They told me Nordstrom sold wedding gowns and so I thought I would try it out after about two dozen bridal boutiques.  I worked with a wonderful woman named Gaye who was simply a blessing.  Ask for her! You'll want to invite her to your wedding she's so great.  I finally said Yes to the dress! :)
