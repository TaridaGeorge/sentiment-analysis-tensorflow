By popular request I'm reviewing this gem of a shop in the heart of old town Scottsdale. After all, where else can you buy a candied scorpion? That's right, here I bought a real scorpion encased in a sickening candy that cleverly resembles amber (anyone remember Jurassic Park?)

This was prior to New Year's in 2000, I think, perhaps 2001. Either way, I brought in the New Year by chomping on a scorpion. 

This store has all kinds of stuff, like dozens of hot sauces that will rip you a new asshole, literally. In the back area you can buy Mexican Coke which tastes different because they seem to use actual sugar in their Coke.

Good fun for tourists and locals alike.
