An eatery that deserves more praise than there is room or words for.   The atmosphere was quiet even on a busy weekend evening.  The wait staff was attentive and timely.  

  The food was outstanding.  I personnally had the Seafood Spendour, and it was definitely the best dining experience I have had in quite a while.  The freshly baked rolls were right from the oven and put those from the corporate chain restruants to shame.

  Pricing was definitely reasonable.  Will definitely be dining here again.
