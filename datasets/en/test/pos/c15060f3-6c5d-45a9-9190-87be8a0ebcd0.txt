Love, love, love this place. I've been there several times over the years for lunch & dinner and have NEVER been dissatisfied. My favorite appetizer is the Tuna Poke-all 4 of us shared it and everyone loved it, the goat cheese app is also amazing.

Last night I had the special-Halibut on sun dried tomato risotto. I finished every morsel of this plentiful portion.

The atmosphere here is beautiful inside or out and the staff is always pleasant and happy.  I love happy staff, thanks Arnold.

If you like dessert you'll love this place. All of the choices are as tasty as they are beautiful. Their presentation on all their dishes is phenomenal,  compliments to the kitchen staff!
