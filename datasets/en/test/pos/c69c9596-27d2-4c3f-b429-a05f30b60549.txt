Good, FAst, Cheap!

the production triangle. in my world your to pick only 2 of the 3....

Here you get it all...

had Chicken and Humus and Pita...delicious!...had to run to my yoga class only had 20min...there where blazing fast....serving was anapitizer but a big serving and under $10 ok so not taco bell cheap but a good value.. (at SAnta monica peir I once had a $25 taco bell bill for only two people! so location is every thing) 

Decore- I was really impressed I was afriad i need reservations!

can't wait to go back

edit-the coke was 2.25!  the meal was only 6.75 not sure what i feel about that yet...
