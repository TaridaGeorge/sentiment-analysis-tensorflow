What a great find. We came for spring training and found Tim Finnegans. We came on a Sunday night during happy hour. One of the best happy hours around. The food was fantastic. The lamb skewers were to die for. The service was fantastic. We have told all of our friends to go to Tim's when they come to Phoenix. They and you will not be disappointed.
