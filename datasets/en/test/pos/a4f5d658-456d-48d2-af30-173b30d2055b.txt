This place is INCREDIBLE. 

I'm not a fan of macaroons, but from what I understand, theirs are great. 

However, everything else here I've ever tried I've loved - from the quiche lorraine to the cookies to the amazing little cinnamon dough balls they sell at the front counter. 

My FAVORITE thing here though, is the granola. Granola in soy milk with fruit - dates, apple, berries - just the best kind of breakfast or meal. 

I just wish their hours were later! 

If you're in Tempe, a MUST TRY.
