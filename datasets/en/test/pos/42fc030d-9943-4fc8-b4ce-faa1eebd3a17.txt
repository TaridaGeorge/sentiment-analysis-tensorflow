Green has the best vegan food in Phoenix. Weather or not if you are vegan, there is something there for you. Very artsy inside, fantastic staff, amazing "soynamis" AKA a vegan DQ Blizzard. They have a small grocery area in the front as well, all vegan but all amazing. I always get their special without even looking and have never been let down. The spicy Po Boy, and the Mexicali Burger are my fav off the menu, you also get a side and I never stray from the delicious curry pasta salad. On top of it all, they are very fair priced, 2 meals, 2 drinks, and 2 deserts, usually runs about $20. That's great for in house made healthy food.
