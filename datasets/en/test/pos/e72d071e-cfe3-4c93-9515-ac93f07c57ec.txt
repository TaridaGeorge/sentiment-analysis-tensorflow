This is by far the BEST Middle East restaurant i have ever been to.
I have read a lot of good reviews of this place and it lives up to it.
The hummus is simply superb, it with the bread melts in the mouth. and I had chicken shawarma which was delicious.

The service was fast and courteous.
I moved from San Jose , CA and with the restaurant options up there i had hard time finding good ones here in Tempe.
Well here is one i love to go over and over again.
