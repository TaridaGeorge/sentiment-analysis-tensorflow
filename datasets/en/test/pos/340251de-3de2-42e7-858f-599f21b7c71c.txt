I have eaten here many times and have always had excellent food.  The  service is very good, and the ambiance nice.  It's a little pricey but worth it.  I usually try the daily special because so far I haven't been disappointed.  The food has a nice sw fare but isn't too heavy.  If you are  looking for a solid choice for dinner that will please  just about anyone, try Phoenix City Grill.
