One of my local pizza joints that I can eat every week. This place has a great pie, and crispy wings. If you eat there in the restaraunt the crust for the pizza crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The wings are also best eaten in the restaraunt. They have a great assortment of fried food as well.
