I usually do not go to movies simply because I get bored with the same predictable plot. However, I love going to Camelview because they actually play movies that are unique, thoughtful, funny and smart. 

I was already sold on how great this theater is, but my experience last month cemented my feelings. I went with a friend to see "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly", a wonderful film, but the camera movements made both of us quite ill. We left half-way through and talked with the manager. He was very friendly and understanding and gave us our money back as well as film recommendations for next time. I took him up on one and came back to see Persepolis. It was a great film. 

Most theaters have managers who have no sense of customer service or satisfaction. It was refreshing to be treated so well.
