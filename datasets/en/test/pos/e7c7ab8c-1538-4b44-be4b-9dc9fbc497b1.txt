Three words: Qual. I. Tee.

what can be said about PB that has not already been said? go before it opens. eat everything. die happy. 

sure, it's not uber fancy or complicated, but that's the beauty of these simple, but amazing pies.

and if you go? please be nice to your fellow pizza-lovers. if you are sitting inside at a table, and are no longer eating, just be curteous, pack it up, and go yap next door, or somewhere else.
