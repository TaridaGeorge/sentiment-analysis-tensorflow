We tried Mimita's for the first time and it was a great experience.  The servers were very helpful and pleasant.  The food was wonderful and we tried several items and just shared them. We loved the sandwiches and the sides.  We will definitely be back for supper to try some of the entrees too. 
We have a new favorite!
