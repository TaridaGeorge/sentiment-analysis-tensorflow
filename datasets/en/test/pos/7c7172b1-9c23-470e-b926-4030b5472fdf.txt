If you are vegetarian, this is an oasis in this desert!   If you just crave something outside of the norm, this is the cure. The food is spicy and delicious!  Prices for specialty food are decent!  The decor is not exceptional, and the utensils are plastic, but the quality of food makes up for it.  I have had the Paper Masala Dosai, Paneer Dosai, Vegetable Curry, Vegetable Manchurian (my favorite), Vegetabel Byriani, Vada Pav and they were all delicious!  I recommend you go with a friend so you can try a couple of things. They have a chutney bar that is quite delicious and adds yet another layer of flavor.
