My husband is an ice  ream fanatic but tonight I wanted something a little different.  Wow! What a nice surprise.  The service was great - the girls behind the  counter were more than helpful suggesting ftheir favs and popular choices while handing out samples of whatever you wanted to try.  We both got the medium which had two flavors. My choices were tiramisu and pistachio.  They were both great but the pistachio was by far my favorite.  My husband got bellini and black cherry.  Again both were great as well but he felt the black cherry could have had more cherries.  Overall however it was a nice experience.  In fact, a nice touch was they brought around a tray of cups of water to pass out to customers.  Something so small makes a huge difference. We will definitely be back again to try more flavors.
