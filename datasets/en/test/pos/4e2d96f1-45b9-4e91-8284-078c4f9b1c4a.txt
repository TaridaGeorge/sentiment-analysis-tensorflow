To be honest, their super attentive and friendly service is one of the facts that keeps me coming back in a long term. I am just so impressed with the way they treat customers -  very nice, warm, professional and just awesome overall.

I have been here twice, and never have had a bad experience with the staffs at Kona Grill. I have to give them Kudos for a perfect training and customer service. Honestly, I feel like my business is being appreciated and I always get treated like a queen (Haha, ok that's just too much but urgh, super dooper great customer service I'm telling ya)

Oh and how I love the decor with the aquarium and dimmed lights. Happy hours are full of great food and drinks. I love the sakes and also the atmosphere.

I'm sooooo coming back every week :)
