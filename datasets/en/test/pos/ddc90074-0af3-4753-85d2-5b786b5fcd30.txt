I ordered a 7 beer sampler (4 oz glasses) and it was $8. Firreal?! I got the cochinita pork that was delicious, a huge portion, and came out lighting fast. My only complaint is that, as another reviewer said, it does get pretty loud. The beer was great, it's a fun atmosphere, and I can imagine the rest of the menu is pretty awesome too.
