Friendly, excellent service  
My handyman recommended Accurate, and I bought a Groupon for it.
I went in after the Honda dealership gave me a list of needed repairs, thinking it would be cheaper at a smaller shop. Not only was it cheaper, I didn't need all that stuff anyway. Ron in the office did recommend tires. They took it to Discount Tire for me, I picked it up at the end of the day with the work completed, new tires on, ready to go for my vacation.
Very good customer service.
