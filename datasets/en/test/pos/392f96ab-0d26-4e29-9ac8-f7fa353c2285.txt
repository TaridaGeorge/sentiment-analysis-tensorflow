This is hands-down the best chiropractic care in the valley.

I came to Drs. Frank and Sarah with extreme and chronic neck pain and headaches.  I did not have a lot of faith that my pain would subside and I was skeptical of chiropractors in general. Dr. Frank was really patient and earned my trust over time.  Within days of starting treatment, I felt tremendous relief. Initially, the relief lasted several days. Every few visits, the relief would last longer and longer.  After about a month, I was completely pain free. I am now on a "maintenance program" where I get treated every couple of weeks. I truly was in such bad shape that I never expected to fully recover. Dr. Frank is amazing - like a miracle worker.
