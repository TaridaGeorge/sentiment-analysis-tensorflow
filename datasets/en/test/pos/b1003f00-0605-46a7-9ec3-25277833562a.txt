I've had heels replaced, rips fixed, shoes stretched, worn leather soles on my favorite Cole Haans completed covered with a new rubber sole (I though they were hopeless!), purses stitched, luggage zippers repaired...  Good gracious I don't know why I haven't thought to review this shop sooner!  They are quick.  They are good - sometimes miraculous.  They will discuss your repair with you ahead of time if they think there will be any issues with it.  They are very reasonably priced.  I'm always pleased with the results, no exceptions on the 8 or 9 years I've been going there. No one else touches my shoes!!!

They are closed Saturday, but open Sunday.
