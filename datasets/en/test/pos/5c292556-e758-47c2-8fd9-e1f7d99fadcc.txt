Kind of like a warm, outdoor version of the National Gallery in DC.  I would even be willing to say you'll see more interesting collections than what is housed at our DC gallery.

There's plenty of Southwestern scenes of Native Americans and the Grand Canyon, but I did manage to admire 2 pricey Picassos, and multiple paintings of faraway landscapes.  The galleries on Main St are amazing and have an ecletic collection.
