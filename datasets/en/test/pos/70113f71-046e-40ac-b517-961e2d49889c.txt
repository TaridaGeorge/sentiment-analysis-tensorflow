The Improv is a lot of fun.  I've seen quite a few people there and I've never been disappointed.  I can't remember his name, but the best was a ventriloquist- he was awesome.

If you see one of the comedians at 8pm, it will be a dinner show and the food is actually pretty good. They serve pasta, sandwiches, hamburgers, desserts and there is full cocktail service as well. 

You can get food at times other than the dinner show, but the menu is limited.  Prices are reasonable too for tickets, food and drinks.  

If you're tired of always doing the same thing on the weekends, the Improv is a fun way to break out of your routine.
