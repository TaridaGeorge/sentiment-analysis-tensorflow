I can't say enough about this place.  I originally found out about it last year with a Lunchclub email.  I tried it and have been hooked since.  Going there for lunch today actually with my brother and his family.  I will never have a chile relleno anywhere but Fuego!  Mojitos and Sangrias are great!  The food never disappoints!  Glad to see the nomination and review on PBS' Check Please! Arizona.  The firm I work for recently had them cater an event as well.  I was thrilled.  Fuego Taco at The Esplanade has the same great food, but the drinks are smaller and the atmosphere can't touch Bistro's.  I plan to go there forever.
