Barros is my favorite pizza joint in town. We frequent this location for lunch. $4 for two slices and a drink. C'mon, you can't beat that.  Their crust is delicious, generous toppings and it just tastes damn good everytime. Go there and get the meat trio and kick back watching ESPN. 
The slam and negative comments below from Brett B crack me up. That dude is way off. Why does he have 59 check-ins here if he only gave the place one star?
