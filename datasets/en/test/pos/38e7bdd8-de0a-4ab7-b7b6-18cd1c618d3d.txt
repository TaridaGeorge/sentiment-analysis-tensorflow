This place is an awesome gem tucked away in a plaza. Greeks Grill is family owned and they are super nice. The owner definitely knows the meaning of customer service, the first time we went we sat and ate there and the owner gave us free hummus which tasted amazing, great blend of spices and just the right amount of olive oil. I ordered the original gyro which was stuffed full of fresh ingredients, the meat was so moist and had great flavor. My Fiance had the Chicken Shawarma pita, that as well was stuffed to the top of the pita with meat and fresh vegetables. The food is amazing and has become our favorite spot to eat when we are craving for some Greek food. They have great prices and always have some sort of lunch special going on.
