I had a home inspection by this company and Steve was my inspector.  I found him to be very friendly, kind and highly knowledgeable. I also received a report that was very easy to read and professionally done. I liked dealing with a family run company. I had my home inspection done in less than two days of making my offer. They were prompt, efficient and the price was very reasonable. My realtor had nothing but positive things to say about JDewey and always trusts them with their clients. They were right! Thank you!
