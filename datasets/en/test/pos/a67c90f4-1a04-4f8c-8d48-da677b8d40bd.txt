This place is easy to underestimate by appearance, which is why I lived down the street for a year before I ever checked it out! But, since then, I'm hooked! I like to get a pita combo, it comes with a salad and drink for about $7 and the pita is fantastic.  Beware - the salad container is STUFFED - they certianly don't jip on serving size here. :) If you have driven by a million times and never noticed it.. check it out! You won't be disappointed.
