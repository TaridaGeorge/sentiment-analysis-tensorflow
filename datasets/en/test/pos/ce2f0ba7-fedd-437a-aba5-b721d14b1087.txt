If I look at my shopping list and had to pick one place to get as much crossed off....I'm heading to Wal-Mart!!
I think that is has a great selection of items that I can get at a bargain - even when I am travelling and need something quick...each Wal-Mart is set up pretty similar so you can zip in and zip out. I have noticed a few times that their prices are below any other mass retailer for the exact same item!! They have recently installed the 'Self Check-out' counters now - I LOVE THESE!!
I cant say that I really shop there for their produce but many of my household items are from Wal-Mart.
Like their tag says....'Save Money. Live Better'
