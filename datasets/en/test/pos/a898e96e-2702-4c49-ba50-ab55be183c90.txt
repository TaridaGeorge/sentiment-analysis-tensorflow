Giant Coffee was a beautiful and welcome respite from my pedestrian excursion yesterday in the unexpected blustery wind and cold. The interior is modern and clean, yet comfortable with live! happy yellow flowers placed on every table. I enjoyed a delicious mocha (made with organic Strauss Family milk) and a cheddar dill scone, and the laid back atmosphere and music.
