YUMMY! Great little place.  The atmosphere is fun and the food is wonderful.  It was a little hard to find at first but worth the hunt.  The food is so fresh and the ingredients they put together in their soups and sandwiches make my tongue do a little dance.  This place is family owned and operated which I also love.  Gotta support the locals!
