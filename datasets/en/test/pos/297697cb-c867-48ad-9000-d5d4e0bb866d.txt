A Costco for food lovers. If you can borrow a membership card, this place is a wonderful adventure. 

They have EVERYTHING. 1 liter of Sriracha sauce? check. 1 whole spit of gyro meat? check. 12 in wheel of brie? check.

Make sure to dress warmly, the warehouse is cold, and the refrigerated section is even colder.
