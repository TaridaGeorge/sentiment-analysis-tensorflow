Same great food, new location.  I like the leaner brisket, but have tried everything at different locations and EVERYTHING is good.  Forget the sissy sause and just go with the good stuff, BUT this stuff is so good try it without first.  There are no plates, so just get over it the food wont be there long anyway.......
