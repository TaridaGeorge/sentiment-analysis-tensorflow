I am giving a 5 star rating not because I think Subway is a 5 star restaurant, but because of the service. At most Subways around Phoenix, the service leaves much to be desired (and occassionally straight pisses you off). Every time I've been to this location, the employees have been incredibly friendly and make your sandwich with care. Whoever owns this franchise obviously pays attention during interviews.
