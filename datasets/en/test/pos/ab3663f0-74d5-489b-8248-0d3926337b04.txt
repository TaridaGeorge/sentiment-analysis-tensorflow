Ok, so I love coffee, especially from places like Dunkin Donuts.  I mean, its how coffee should be.  Not over roasted burnt beans, at crazy prices served by people in green aprons.....just really good coffee, along with some donuts and muffins.

Apparently, this location just opened, and its exciting to see another DD in the valley.....the coffee is great, pastries are awesome, and its at reasonable prices, with awesome hours and wifi.   This place has a drive thru as well!  Parkings kind of a pain in the butt (small, cramped lot with crappy drivers and loads of people blazing through the lot to get to the drive thru.)

When I'm back in the area, I'll be sure to stop back in and hang out here, as its worth the time and effort!
