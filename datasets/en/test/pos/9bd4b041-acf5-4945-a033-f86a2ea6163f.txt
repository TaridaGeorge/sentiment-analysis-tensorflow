I just keep going back!!! If you want the best burger, best service, nicest people. This is the place to go. Now I have not tried everything on the menu (Yet). But I am trying. We go there almost weekly to see what is new. I always ask Steve what I should try this trip. He never steers me wrong. Their burgers are not just burgers like you get in most places. They are what you would call a work of art the way they combine different tastes. You can go many places to get a hamburger but you will not find a better burger or sub anywhere. On top of this you will be greeted  by the nicest group of people in the valley. 
THIS PLACE IS MY ATF (all time favorite).
Keep it up Rocket Burger. Can't wait to see what is new.
