I was very impressed with this family business! More than fair with me about their appraisal of my jewelry. I sold some to them and was given a fair price for it. I will use their services again and I highly recommend them to my friends and family, as well as, anyone who needs help with their jewelry purchase or sale. I worked with their son and he is a nice young man who was most helpful. They insisted on cleaning a necklace I was wearing at no charge! I look forward to my next visit and when I purchase my next fine jewelry, I will go their first. Ann D. Phoenix, AZ
