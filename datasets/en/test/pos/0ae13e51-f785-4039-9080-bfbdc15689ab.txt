Love my Ring! Great Job on resizing it. Patrick was not there when I picked it up, be he called me on the date when they said it would be done, and he told me it was ready to be picked up. The quoted me $50 and that is what I was charged. The quality and craftsmanship seem outstanding so far. I am very happy with my decision to go here. It was a great recommendation for me from a friend, and I am and will recommend them to others.
