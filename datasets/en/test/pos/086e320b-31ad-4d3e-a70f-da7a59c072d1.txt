I have a very reliable auto and typically go in for oil changes. They do check things over when it is in there an let me know when things like, oh, your alternator bolt is missing. Good catch, better to find out in the shop then on the road. 

The lesson i have learned is that the basic oil change becomes a nightmare event for too many people when, the plugs are not properly replaced, filter not properly replace, wrong filter (transmission) changed, fill cap not replaced... i have heard lots of bad stories from people who take their cars to the chain quicky lube.
