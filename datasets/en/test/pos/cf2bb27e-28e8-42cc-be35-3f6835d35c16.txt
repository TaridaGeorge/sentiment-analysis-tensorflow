I love Sushi Time. Before I moved out of the Tempe area, I used to go there once or twice a week for carry out. They are a very clean, cute place for eat-in or carry out. They always have two specials (A or B). Special "A" was usually a roll or sushi pieces with a hot entree and Special "B" was usually two rolls. Both were usually served with miso soup and usually less that $12 total. 

The staff is always very friendly and polite. They also have a lot of good specials for their dine-in guests. And they have a good variety of rolls and other menu options. 

It's in the same shopping center as the Whole Foods and I think a lot of people don't really know about it. But it's a great sushi place!  I'd go there more often if I lived closer.
