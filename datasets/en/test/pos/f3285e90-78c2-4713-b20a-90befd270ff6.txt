O this was fun, unique, & informative!
Good day trip/drive - who knew?!
GR8 little caf/bistro
Fun Tour - a must!
Yummy samples
(pick a bottle of wine of the shelf to have with your meal - shhh)
AMAZING olive oils - take some home! (the truffle oil is to DIE 4!)
Kids will enjoy as well.
Little bit of picnic grounds near the olive orchard, btw. (cute)
