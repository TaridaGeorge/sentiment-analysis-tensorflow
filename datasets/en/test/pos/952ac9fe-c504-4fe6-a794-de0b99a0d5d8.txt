Absolutely adore pita jungle.  I'm not a vegetarian but I love their food.  I get the fattoush salad which is warm rice and beans and tons of garlic on romaine.  I've had their schwarmas, their falafal and their hummos and have never had a bad experience.  The new location makes me super happy.  Parking can be hard sometimes but there is a garage just next door.
