Oh man, as good as it gets! I love their coffee and espresso. Art is hanging on the walls, lots of books, conversation. You're not treated like a number, rushed out the door as fast as possible. I used to go to a coffee shop like this in Moscow, Russia. I love this place. If I lived a little closer to it, I would go daily.
