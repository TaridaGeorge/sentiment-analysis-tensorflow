My God, this is the most delicious Mexican food ever!  Talk about authentic!  Started the evening off with a Michelada...delicious!  Had the tableside guacamole with those pomegranate seeds.  Wow!  Amazing combination of ingredients!  For dinner, I ordered the Enchiladas en Mole and my partner had the Chiles en Nogada.  Let me say, both were unbelivably delish.  Ended the evening with an order of the Churros Rellenos d Cajeta...another heavenly dish that did not disappoint!  -  What a great night, perfect service and very cool decor!  We'll definitely be returning soon!
