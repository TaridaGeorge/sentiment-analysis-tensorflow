I called Kelly only two before a graduation party and she still had some delicious and eye-pleasing desserts ready to go! 

She baked us three different kinds of cupcakes as well as a larger, personalized cake. All of our guests had only compliments (though it is hard to understand what a person is saying when the mouth is stuffed full of cake goodness).

I would recommend Butter & Me for similar events.
