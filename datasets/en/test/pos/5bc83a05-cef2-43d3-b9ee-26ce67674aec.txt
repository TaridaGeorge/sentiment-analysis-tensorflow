macaroni + cheese = 100% true love  
(never have i experienced such a magnificent execution of this equation!)

everything about this place is homey, yet sophisticated.  the location, the ambiance, the food - beautifully & seamlessly weave together to create the ultimate culinary experience.

when it comes to the food, i really appreciate how such bold statements are made out of such simplicity.  the citrus-brined fried chicken is out-of-this-worldly and the white cheddar waffles made me and my dining partner simultaneously sigh and say "tastes like christmas."  

highly recommended if you are feeling decadently comfortable.
