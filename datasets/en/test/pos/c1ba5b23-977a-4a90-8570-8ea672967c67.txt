I love having this place so close to my house. My husband and I walked there yesterday and I picked up a jump rope and a 10lb medicine ball for 35 bucks total. I am going back again today (with the truck) to get a bench, a stepper platform thingy and a chest press bar. Wish I had a whole room in the house for just gym stuff. Going to have to get creative with where I will put these things. 

This place seems to have everything for almost every sport. It even has a skateboard-ski thing which is like a board on the top but instead of wheels it has four mini-skis. Good selection of cleats, wrestling shoes (didn't know there was such a thing), and other sports shoe types. Has steppers, treadmills, ellipticals, gym exercise machines, dumbbells, and tons more. Awesome!
