If I am away from home (meaning not 10 minutes from my favorite local ice cream shop) I am going to Churn.  This darling little gem is AMAZING!  I love it!  The staff is always friendly, the cookies/ice cream flavors seem to always be changing, and where else can you get your ice cream in a PRETZEL CONE!

We are new believers (just found the place) in Churn - and we will be back many more times!
