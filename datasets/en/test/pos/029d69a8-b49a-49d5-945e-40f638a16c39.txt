I've been quiet about this place for far too long!! I have been coming here for the past 4 years and won't go anywhere else!! Lillian takes such good care of me.

 Right before I started coming here I had an accident that damaged my thumb permanently. I don't have a thumb nail to work with but that didn't stop Lillian. She knew just what to do to make it look beautiful again. Seriously no one can tell I have a deformed thumb. She is an artist!!! 

They have the best pedi chairs around and plenty for all of your friends to come together. 

Although they do accept walk-in appts, I recommend calling ahead to make sure they can accommodate your schedule.  Oh, and ask about happy hour, not sure when it is but they do give a discount during that time.
