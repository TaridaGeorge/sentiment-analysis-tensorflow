Found Dr. Scott Lee because he went to high school and Marine boot camp with my brother. Now my whole family goes to him.

This is my first visit here and it's as a parent taking their kid to their first dental visit. Everyone has done an awesome job with my son. First and getting a cavity filled... The team did an awesome job explaining everything to my son. He was so comfortable and relaxed the whole time we were there, and I think a good share of that was due to the quality environment.

We found ourselves a new family dentist!
