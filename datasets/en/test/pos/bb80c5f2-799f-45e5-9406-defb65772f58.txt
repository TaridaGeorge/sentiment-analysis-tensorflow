Do you drink coffee in the afternoon?  I don't (I know...a sin, a sin).  However, unlike most other coffee shops, they understand that sometimes people just want to come to a place, chill, read the paper or fire up their kindle and NOT have coffee.  So they serve smoothies, soda and flavored water.  I only drink coffee in the morning so this is great!

The place is very well designed.  The main area has a good amount of tables, yet there's an oasis away from the main part for those wanting a quieter spot.  It also has plenty o' plug ins.    

Overall a great coffee shop, I go out of my way to visit it due to the atmosphere and variety of beverages.
