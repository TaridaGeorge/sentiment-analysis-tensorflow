So happy they have a location in Old Town now! When my co workers and I try to figure out where to go to lunch, we ALWAYS consider Zoe's.  They are super efficient and the food is really consistent.

I had the steak sandwich last time and talked about it for the next two hours. Would also recommend the chicken roll ups. I've only ever gotten the pasta salad as a side but I'm sure the other sides are delicious too!

I was surprised to learn that it was a chain but don't let that scare you off!
