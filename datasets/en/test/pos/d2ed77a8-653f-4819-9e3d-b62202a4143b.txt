Fantastic location, close to everything.  The rooms were recently completely redecorated and in good taste.  Our wedding party and guests from the US and Canada stayed several nights at the hotel, in all we had over 20 rooms.  The guests chose to stay at this hotel for its location and updates.  They were very pleased with all of the services, friendliness of the staff  and the rooms.  The front desk quickly gave directions to nearby and further afar destinations they wanted to visit and provided taxis to the wedding in Paradise Valley.  Couldn't have asked for more from the negotiated rates down to the actual event.  Terrific experience and it's the best location in Old Town Scottsdale.
