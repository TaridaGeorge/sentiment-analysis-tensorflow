Stopped in for a quick lunch with a friend.  Tried the pho lon xao again and was again assured that it was gluten-free.  But, again about an hour later (now), I'm having some not so good reactions.  I can't be positive that it is the pho lon xao, but I don't think I will be ordering it from now on just to be on the safe side.  But in any case, I will still be heading to Noodles to satisfy my cravings for pho, spring rolls, and papaya salad.
