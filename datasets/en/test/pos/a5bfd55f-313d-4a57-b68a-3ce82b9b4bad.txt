Take it from a real live Indian who used to live in New Delhi: this is the best, most authentic, just like mom makes it food in phoenix. And the groceries are good too - this is one of the few places in the Valley I can get a Thums Up (if you don't know what that is, you best find out!!).

Great selection of namkeen (salty snacks) and decent fresh asian veggie section (kerela, persian cucumbers, daikon, the works). I love going there, pickin up my faves, and having a quick bhel puri. :) 

Yes, all these things I have mentioned above may not be the mainstream type of thing, but seriously, TRY THEM OUT! You're missing out if you don't!
