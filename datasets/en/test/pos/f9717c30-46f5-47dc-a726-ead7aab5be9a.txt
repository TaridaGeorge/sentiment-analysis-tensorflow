Had my bachelorette party dinner here! 

Must trys: TRIO. Trio was amazing!!! Gnocchi was so soft and pillowy, filled with perfect brie and covered in brown butter sauce. Mushroom ravs were crazy good. 

Service is beyond amazing! I absolutely loved our waiter Hernand. He was funny and entertaining, but had the special skill of knowing when to gracefully bow out and when to return with refills. Upon leaving, one of my girls asked for the bread to go and they packed us a whole new loaf and a full on stick of butter. 

Great place for large parties. We had the back part of the restaurant to ourselves, it closed off with adorable curtains and made us feel like we were in a world of our own- which is great because we are one loud group of beezies. hLove!
