I LOVE Rock bottom. My husband and I live down the street and go here frequently. I always get a burger (99% of the time), and my husband alternates with whatever sounds good. 
We like it so much we often order for pickup on long days! 
They have great, accommodating managers, very kind, attentive staff, and a fun atmosphere!
