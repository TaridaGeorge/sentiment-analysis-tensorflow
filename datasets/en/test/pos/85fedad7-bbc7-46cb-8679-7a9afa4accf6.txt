This is probably one of my favorite restaurants that I've ever been to- not exclusive to just Phoenix. Who can say no  to carbs and alcohol????  They have a very extensive wine list and their cocktails are delicious as well. Some of their cocktails take a bit of time, but that's because everything is freshly squeezed. 

I've tried some of their sandwiches here and they definitely don't hold a candle to their bruschetta and other appetizers. Try "the plate" from Postinos- a blend of peppers, salami, asparagus, olives, etc.

The staff here is super friendly, helpful, non pretentious, and good looking! You get a bit of a hipster vibe here. 

Mondays are a great night to go here after 8 for their special : 20 dollars for their bruschetta and a bottle of wine! 

I miss living down the street from this place.
