Phoenix's foodie scene is in full bloom, and the Coronado Cafe is the best in the bundle.  Coronado prides itself on excellent ingredients, delicious recipes, and fantastic service and it delivers on all counts. This is one of my favorite places in central Phoenix.

Coronado has a stunning dinner menu, a lighter but still delicious lunch offering, and hosts a Saturday and Sunday brunch that is probably my personal favorite. Everything Coronado serves up, from its pepper-crusted sirloin with carmelized jalapenos and onions to their cafe meatloaf with sauteed pepper, squash, mushroom, and a balsamic reduction, to their home-made sticky buns on Saturday mornings is to die for. 

My only words of caution would be that first, it's a rather small and intimate space - groups of four at the most are recommended.
