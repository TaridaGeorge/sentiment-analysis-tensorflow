Ok, this place rocks!  Fantastic all around - the atmosphere, price and of course the food all hit the bullseye.

We had the fig bruschetta appetizer, salad, and pizza (made our own).  The appetizer was amazing and you should definitely get it!  

The pizza was also great (we ate a few other places and this easily beat everytthing else).  

Do yourself a favor and go there!
