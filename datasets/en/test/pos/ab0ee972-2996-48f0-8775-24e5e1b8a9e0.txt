Spaghetti meatball calzones!  Delicious!  My husband and I eat at this Spinatos way too often, but the food is just too yummy.  The strawberry spinach salad is amazing and the pizza and calzones are fantastic.  We definitely have stopped going to other pizza places as there are very little places comparable to Spinatos.
