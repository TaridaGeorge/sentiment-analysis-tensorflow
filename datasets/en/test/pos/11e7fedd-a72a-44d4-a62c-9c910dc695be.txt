I have been going here for over two years.  I moved 30 minutes north, and I still make the trip to go to him because he is the best!  He is certified in pediatric and pregnancy.  I started coming here when I was pregnant with my second daughter.  I know he is also a certified sports chiropractor.

Kathy, in the front office, is one of my most favorite people ever!  She always has a friendly smile and is so helpful!  I also love Heidi, the massage therapist, who is there on Fridays!

I have recommended him to friends.  He is the best!
