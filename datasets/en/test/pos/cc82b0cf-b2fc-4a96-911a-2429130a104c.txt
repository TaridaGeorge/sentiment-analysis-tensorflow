After a mishap at another restaurant, I gave Shimogamo a call where the owner graciously agreed to cater to a rather large group of us at the last minute.  The food was fresh and delicious, and the place itself was very clean and beautiful.  There was an easy access to a full bar next door, and the service was amazing.  I highly recommend the restaurant!
