I whole-heartadly and HIGHLY recommend this restaurant.....the service was perfect and the food was phenominal.....we ate here for my wife's birthday on August 1st and I can't say enough.  I love the tastings between courses, the exceptional food quality and energetic staff.  They have taken a strip mall location and made it one of the best dining options in the area.  Congratulations!
