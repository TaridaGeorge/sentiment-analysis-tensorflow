The Camelback Inn concierge recommended Doug when I was looking for airport transport for my family that includes an infant and a three year old.  He had car seats for the little ones, and the van was extra comfortable.  Doug is clearly all about customer service.  He kept track of our flight on line and met us inside the airport-- a real treat when traveling with kids.  He was knowledgable about the area and interesting to talk to and made us instantly at ease.  We booked him for the return trip and will book him again next year!  A great experience all around, and we highly recommend this service.  If only every place we travel we could Ride the Dougie.
