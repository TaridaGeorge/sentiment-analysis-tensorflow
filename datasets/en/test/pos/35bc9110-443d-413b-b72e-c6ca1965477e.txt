This appears to be a must after a Pita Jungle meal. Even though I was stuffed, I knew I needed to stop in. 

I hardly ever come to places like these and get the first thing I try. Today was the exception. One bite of the Salted Caramel and I was hooked. With a TON of delicious looking and sounding options, this is a place I would frequent weekly if I was in the area.
