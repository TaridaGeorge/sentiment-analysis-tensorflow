Fantastic!!! It was the first time we were at this location,Biltmore, the food was perfect. I never had Sea bass before and I loved it. It was a bit pricey I think but it was well worth the price. It was very tasty with mushrooms, purple potatoes, snap peas and a little asparagus. It had some tasty sauce on it just a little, not too much sort of around the fish. The fish was on top and the veggies were underneath, I will order this again for sure. My hubby had the turkey burger and kale salad and loved it as well.He did say my turkey burgers are better LOL. I do't mind paying higher than usual for dinner as long as it is good and this totally was worth the $24 range.
