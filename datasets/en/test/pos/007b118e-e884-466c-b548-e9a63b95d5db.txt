Okay here's how I do it: peanut butter mixed with raspberry creame (sic) with white chocolate chips.  that was before, however, the day I refer to as enlightenment: the day I had the cheesecake chunks.  practically better than anything I've ever had. 

so I now recommend some fruit flavor, such as the raspberry creame (sic) or strawberry, with a heavy dose of cheesecake bits.  deeeelightful.

for half the cost of other such establishments, yogurtland is truly happiness embodied.  also they have a root beer float flavor that's pretty tasty if you're into that...
