Simply the best Sonoran Mexican food in the states.  The green machaca burrito is awesome.   Actually it's all good.  The tortillas are so great I bring 6 dozen home everytime I visit Phoenix (and they're so convenient to the airport)

Yeah, it's grungy dive but truly amazing.  Go for the food, not the lack of valet parking
