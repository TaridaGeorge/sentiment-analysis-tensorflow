This place is definitely as fun as you make it! One of my new favorite hole in the wall bars for a chill-axing Friday or Saturday night! They have okay food but may favorite experience is on Friday nights with Karaoke! So much fun and nobody there judges :) A good time for people who are down to earth and not - up-ity.
