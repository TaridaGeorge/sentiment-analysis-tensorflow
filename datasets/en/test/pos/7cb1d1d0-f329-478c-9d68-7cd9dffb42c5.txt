let me just say that this place is a gem! the bartenders are super pretty and the food looks and tastes awesome! the mussels and steak Au poive are SO good! the well liquor is top shelf and the happy hour is a steal! $5 wine and great martinis as well as $5 paninis that are huge and come w a salad too {the dressing is addictive! the super pretty blonde behind the bar also told me they do events for local charities and she also plans party's.
i had my birthday there and she took care of everything from the drinks to the DJ. the owner is a refined man and this bar actually cares about the city and its people on all levels. i love it!
