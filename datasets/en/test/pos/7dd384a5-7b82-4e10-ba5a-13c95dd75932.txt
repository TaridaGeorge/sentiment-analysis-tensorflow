At my first visit I remember being very impressed with Dr. Marcus. He really took his time with me, and as a result I felt completely safe and very confident in his ability to help me.  I was so thankful to him for taking the time to really explain what chiropractic adjustments do and what he would be testing me for specifically.  I had been experiencing back pain with certain movements, and after just one adjustment, I felt significant improvement.  His adjustments continue to keep me pain-free. Also, Dr. Marcus is very personable and friendly, which is important to me when I look for practitioners.  I couldn't recommend him more!!
