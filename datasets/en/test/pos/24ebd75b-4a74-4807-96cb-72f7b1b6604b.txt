Bacchanal has an FQ (fun quotient) that just can't be beat.   My journey to Bacchanal was just a hoot.  We held an office related function at this hidden treasure and simply had a blast.  The food was good, or at least that that I took the time to eat.   I was so enthralled in our belly dancer, plate throwing and eventual group dancing that I failed to really enjoy the food, but from what I recall it was all good.   The owner treated us all like family and made us all very welcome.   They also worked exceptionally well with our company in advance of the event and customize the evening to our group.  If you go, go with at least a small group and make a night of it!  Opa!
