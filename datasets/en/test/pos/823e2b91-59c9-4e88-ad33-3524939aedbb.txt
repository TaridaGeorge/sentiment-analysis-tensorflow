We heard about this place off of Angie's List, and I don't think we could have been more pleased!  The office is a perfect atmosphere for kids, with an in-door playhouse, video games, and movies.  The staff was also amazing!  Gwyneth and Dr. Julie greeted us warmly when we came in and instantly made all of us feel comfortable.  It really shows that they enjoy their jobs and have a genuine love for kids.  This was my son's first visit ever to the dentist, so I was a little bit nervous, but he felt completely comfortable and even had fun!  He told me he can't wait to go back, so I'm a pretty happy mom!!
