I get my haircut here once a week and it's always great..my barber's name is Al and he is awesome but all of the barbers are really good here.  You can even get a razor shave or a shoe shine while you are here.  Recommend scheduling an appointment because it can get pretty busy sometimes except on Saturdays because they don't do appointments on that day..1st come 1st serve.  Go check it out..you want be disappointed!
