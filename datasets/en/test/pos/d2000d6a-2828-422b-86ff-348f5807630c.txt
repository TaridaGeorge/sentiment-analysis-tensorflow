This is my favorite coffee spot in AZ.  They know how to make a fantastic Americano.  They use very good coffee and a real European espresso machine.  I hate those machines that Starbucks uses with the coffee storage on top and the preset grinders.  YUCK.  

The cafe has a comfortable and welcoming Vice.  Everyone will say hello to you when you walk in the door.

They do have free wifi, but it is REAL SLOW!!  That is my only complaint.  They need to crank it up!
