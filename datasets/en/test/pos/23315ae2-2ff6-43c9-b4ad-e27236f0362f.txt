Another one of those places that maybe should have remained in childhood. My mother used to make wedding cakes, and many a weekend was spent in the Sacramento version of this store. Mom pouring over decorating tips and sugar crystals, and me pouring over the fun trinketries such as plastic babies, flags of all nations, and sombreros. The store seemed much smaller than I imagined it as a child - yet, I was still able to acquire exactly what I sought: violet frosting coloring gum, and purple metallic sparkles. Mission accomplished. Now on to make a purple i-pod cake. Not sure if they're going to let me use their photo-to-cake topper service to make a Silversun Pickups album cover for my ipod cake though. Bummer.
