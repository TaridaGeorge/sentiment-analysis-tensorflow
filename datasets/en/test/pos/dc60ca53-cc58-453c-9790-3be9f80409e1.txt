Alice Cooper's Town is a mix of good food and rock 'n' roll, and has a fab bar.  Being one of the world's biggest Alice Cooper fans, I also loaded up on Alice stuff at the merchandise area before leaving.  The walls are covered with Alice memorabilia, which is cool.  True Alice fans will also note items on the menu named for his kids.  

Location is convenient to the arena where the Phoenix Suns play, and I believe may be within walking distance to the Arizona D-backs' ballpark.  Seating is good, and I agree with another reviewer that the make-up is a bit cheesy (especially since they only do the bottom half!) but it adds to the atmosphere.  The locals say you can even catch a glimpse of Alice here when he's not on tour.
