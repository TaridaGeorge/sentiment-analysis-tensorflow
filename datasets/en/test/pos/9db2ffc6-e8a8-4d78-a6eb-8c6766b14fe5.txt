This is the best Vietnamese I have in Phoenix is worth the trip to Mesa.  If you want great fresh Vietnamese food at reasonable prices, then make the trip to Mesa.  Service is outstanding, I really enjoy the service - they explain in detail.  I've been able to venture out and enjoy new things.

Try it and you'll be pleasantly surprised.
