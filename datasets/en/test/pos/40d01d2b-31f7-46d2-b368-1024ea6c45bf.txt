Charleston's is one of my favorite restaurants in Mesa.  You cannot go wrong with anything you order.  The inside decor is top-notch.  Dark, romantic, plenty of space between booths, and almost every table area is a booth.

I saw plenty of people eating chicken marsala and ribs and key lime pie, but I love their soups, salads, chicken, and seafood.  Their house citrus vinaigrette is yummy, and their tomato soup has vegetables in it for a wonderful flavor.  The key lime pie has nuts in it also.  The entrees are mostly $10-20 and there is an immediate seating sign outside, so check that out even if the parking lot is crowded.
