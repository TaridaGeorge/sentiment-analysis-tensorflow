Amazing experience.  My boyfriend and I came here for our anniversary dinner and it was amazing.  The food was authentic and delicious- best Italian food I've had in the Phoenix area- maybe in the U.S. 

The ambience was great, we sat outside under a tree with lights all over it. Very romantic setting. 

We had a bottle of wine on the waiter's suggestion, It was a cab, I don't remember the name, but it paired very well with our meal. We started with the burrata which was so fresh-- to die for. We each got a pizza and shared them, and then we finished it off with a Nutella crepe.  Needless to say we had to be rolled out, but it was amazing and I will definitely be back soon!
