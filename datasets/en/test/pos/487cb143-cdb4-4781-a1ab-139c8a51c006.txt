Adrian, I hate to say it, but you fail at burgers.

I'm going to have to report you to the burger authorities for disciplinary burger action.

This location is stocked with suburban teens, so they don't really like to work too hard.  It takes away valuable time from sharing the url to their myspace profile, taking pictures of their emo hair in the in-n-out bathroom mirrors to post on their myspace profiles, talking to any hot girl/boy that comes in, etc.  

You'll get your food eventually, and when you do, it'll be the best you can expect from a burger experience.  If that's not what happened, you failed to order correctly.  I suggest remedial study of the In-N-Out website for access to the secret menu options.
