My new Tempe addiction! I recently moved less than a mile to this place and have been 4 times. I have tried different sandwiches each time and they are always perfect! So far my favorite is the wake n bake. It has bard boiled eggs on it which add such nice texture and flavor. The staff here is also very friendly and attentive. And who doesn't want a nice glass of kool aid to go with your "blunt"?!!
