Fantastic venue! Province really adds a touch of class and elegance in a way that isn't pushy or over the top. Located in the Westin Hotel, the restaurant feels very modern! You can choose to sit inside in a beautifully decorated and spacious dining area or enjoy their fabulous patio with fireplaces and a great water feature. 

The food was unbelievable! I sampled their tuna and watermelon appetizer and fell in love - what an amazing combination that I'd never have thought of.

If the food isn't enough, the service is superb. Every interaction with the staff was excellent - you can tell they enjoy their restaurant and are happy to be there. 

I cannot wait to come back to Province as soon as possible.
