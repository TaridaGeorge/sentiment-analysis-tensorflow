What is not to like about this place?

Their pizza is awesome.  I cannot rave enough about their pizza... did i mention that it is good? All of their other food is great too, but 90% of the time I couldn't pass up the pizza pie.

I love their happy hour (2-5PM Mon-Sat) with $1 beers and $1 slices.  The staff is very friendly in this family-owned restaurant.  They are transplanted from Cape Cod, so their Clam Chowder is a hidden gem.
