My wife and found this place last summer when we first moved here to PHX.  We had the soft pretzels and fondue which was amazing.  The sweet corn Cannelloni is one of the greatest things I have ever eaten... in my life.  Go here.

P.S. Get dessert too.  Monkey bread and the carmel custard will make you drool.
