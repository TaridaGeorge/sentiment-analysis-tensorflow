My boy Sonny past away unexpectedly.  I was a mess. Mary opened the doors after hours, she was so gentle with my boy, and so kind to me and my husband. She has so many options to remember your pet, and offers you options, but doesn't push you into anything. She held on to Sonny for a few days for us to decide what we wanted our next step to be. Mary was so compassionate, and she took wonderful care of boy Sonny. I am so thankful for Mary, its hard for most people to understand how much he meant to us, Mary was professional and very sensitive to our needs.
