Finally, a major ethnic supermarket in the Arcadia section of Thomas. This El Super is spacious, very clean, has lots of regular supermarket items as well as an abundance of Hispanic food items, at prices that are of no stress on the pocketbook. Comparisons to the Ranch Markets are inevitable, so here's my take on it: while large and spacious, this El Super is a bit smaller than a Ranch Market (no sit-in dining area), but cleaner, less confusing, and less crowded - at least for now, and there's no problem with parking even at peak hours. And I just have to add this ... yummy cakes at the bakery section, especially my fave: tres leches  - a delight for this aficionado of simple baked goodies.
