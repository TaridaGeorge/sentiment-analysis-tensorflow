I love Middle Eastern food and am constantly in search for a place that can cook a meal as well as my Nana could. There are many great places nearby but this place was really great. We went there for the lunch buffet which was small and oh so authentic. We all loved it! 

The prices were great which made this place even better. There is also a nice little market and hookah to smoke if you're into it. 

Lastly, the location is great. While I love pita jungle, I say beat the lunch crowd and head over to this place. We sat down and ate a quick, delicious buffet lunch. You won't be disappointed.
