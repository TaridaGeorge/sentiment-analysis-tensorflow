I took my 3 year old daughter here today for an issue that wasn't going away, and I couldn't get in to see her pedatrician.  

There was no one in the waiting room when we arrived, and we were seen, consulted with, and sent on our way with a prescription in less than an hour!  They were so kind and sweet, especially to my little daughter.  

Would use them again in a second!
