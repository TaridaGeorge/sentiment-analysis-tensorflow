Went to Khai Hoan for lunch today with my friend Sam.  Pho is something I've just recently gotten into, and this place was awesome!

Little place, not super easy to find, but worth the effort.  I got the chicken pho - I don't have the huevos to try some of the other things - I just don't do tripe....  As everybody else has said, the broth was delicious, noodles plentiful, and add ins like basil, jalapeno, lime, etc were very fresh.  Couple dollops of sambal oleek and you're good to go!

You get a big honkin' bowl of soup, and it was less than $7.  

The place was totally full by 11:30, so if you go at lunch, keep that in mind.  I'll definitely be back.
