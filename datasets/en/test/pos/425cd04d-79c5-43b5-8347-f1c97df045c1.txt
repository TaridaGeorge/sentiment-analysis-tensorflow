SO GOOD!  I love this place!  They have fantastic pasta and sauces!  Both the tomato and alfredo are amazing. 

My favorite item on the menu is their stuffed peppers and it comes with a side of pasta, so it's the perfect lunch.  I go here about 3 times a month for lunch... and have for the last year!

The family that owns the restaurant is super nice too... and they have a cute waiter that my friends like to look at when we go here.  Gotta love Italian men!
