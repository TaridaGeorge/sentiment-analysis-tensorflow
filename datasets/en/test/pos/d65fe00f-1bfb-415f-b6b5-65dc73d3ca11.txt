The beau was a skeptic about the restaurant being in a hotel, but that didn't deter me from the reviews I read. We came during happy hour, and the tacos were phenomenal. We attacked them like vultures. We got every kind of taco (except for pork), and they were all mouth-watering delicious. Although we came during an off-hour, the service was pretty fast. Food was cheap (because of happy hour specials), but the only thing I didn't like was that there were many flies in the restaurant.
