What a lovely park!  Obviously someone was thinking when they designed this place as so many seats are in the shade.  The stadium has a sense of being very intimate but at the same time you're not feeling squished in the seats or at the concessions.  Definitely appreciate the free parking--- the place is so set out from anywhere that they could fleece you if they wanted to!  Concessions are 25% cheaper than Scottsdale...  it was a great day!

I also think it's funny that there's a Holiday Inn Express right next to it... makes for a cute one-two punch compound out in the desert!
