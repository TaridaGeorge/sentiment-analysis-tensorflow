OMG - this place is amazing. I am not sure if I have words, but I will try. I can't believe places like this exist. A place with fresh made everything from scratch?? YUM. I am a traditional girl, so I opted for a hot fudge sundae with pecans and madagascar vanilla. UH-Mazing. I also tried the mint chocolate chip (my 2nd fave), complete heaven. Made with real, fresh mint, you can totally taste the difference. I also tried the Desert Honey Sorbet since I love our local honey. Again, UH-mazing. I am seriously impressed since I am grossed out by Dairy Queen and not happy with the Sugar Bowl. I drove farther and spent more and totally worth it.
