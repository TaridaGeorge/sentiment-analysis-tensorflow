I was impressed with the clean and calm office environment, but especially the bedside manner and skill of Dr. Voigt. Your first visit is an hour and she listens attentively to your concerns, checks your back and responses out and then explains what she's going to do. I've never been to a chiropractor that gives a mini massage before the adjustment, it was awesome. I also appreciated her being very experienced in working with pregnant patients. 

A very nice doctor, I look forward to going back for regular appointments.
