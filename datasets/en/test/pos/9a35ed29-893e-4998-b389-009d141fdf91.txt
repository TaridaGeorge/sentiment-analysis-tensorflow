Wow, Chill rocks. Frank and his lovely wife, the proprietors, are fantastic. The prices are super low and the gelato/sorbet is awesome. While we were there, a little kid dropped the top part of his cone on the ground. Frank replaced it for free. 

Then he gave us a sample of the fat-free, sugar-free chocolate sorbet, which made me want to buy a pint of it... after I had already eaten a baby sized Mango/Pomegranate mix. Yum. 

How about this: Go have dinner/lunch/breakfast/whatever at Pita Jungle, then walk across the parking lot to Chill for dessert. That sounds like the perfect evening.
