Love Love LOVE this shop! I've been meaning to go here for a while and I finally went taking my mom with me. What a fun place to visit! We had fun reminiscing at all of the fun candy and toys. I thought everything was very reasonably priced and it's the perfect place to go if you're looking for something unique and special. The lady who worked here was super nice and helpful and she told me that they do birthday parties here, which I was thrilled about. I will definitely be back!
