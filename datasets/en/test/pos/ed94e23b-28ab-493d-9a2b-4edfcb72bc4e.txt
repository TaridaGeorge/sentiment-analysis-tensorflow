Think you should explore Phoenix during a long layover? Sit your ass at Barfly at the airport and enjoy some Ronnie Wood. Your bar compatriots are either coming or going and the bartenders are great. Down from the A1 gate in the A concourse. Maybe one day a bar at the airport would be cool enough for locals to brave security? If so this is the pioneer. Worth the moving sidewalk voyage from the D concourse 8 days a week.
