Really enjoyed myself! We went here for dinner and a drinky. Tuesday special is chicken fried steak. It was pretty good, 8 out of 10. Reverse happy hour starts at 8. Half off appetizers and dollar off drafts. Had a house merlot for 2.50 that was pretty dlish. I will definitely be back here!

Happy hour starts at 8 PM... Awesome! Food is Awesome! My new favorite place! Go there...NOW!
