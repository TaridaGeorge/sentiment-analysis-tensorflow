When I was younger, my parents would take me picnicking around Papago park.  We invariably ended each time with a short jaunt up Hole in the Rock.  Since then, I save it for my time-outs from the world, where I can go with a friend, carry up a 6-pack of beer, and sit there... watching the beams of lights of cars coming towards, or the red dots of cars moving away.
