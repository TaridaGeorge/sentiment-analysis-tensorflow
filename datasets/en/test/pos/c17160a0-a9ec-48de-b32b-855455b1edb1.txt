Oh yumminess.  Met a friend for brunch here.  I love brunch and now when I am in Arizona, must have some mimi's!  Delicious french toast, omelettes stuffed with goodness.  And fun drinks too!  Our waitress was delightful!  The whole experience was fun, good and belly filling.  Why don't they have a mimi's on the east coast?  Good stuff!
