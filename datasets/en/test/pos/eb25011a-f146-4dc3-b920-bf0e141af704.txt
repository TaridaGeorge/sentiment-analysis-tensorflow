This is where it's at.  Guys... the definition of "wine and dine"... yes go here!  I believe it is now called "Drinkwaters"... but it's still one of the mastro's so I don't care what they call it, this place is awesome!!!  The steak comes sizzling on the plate, you can smell it from across the room.  Fancy, classy, but still laid back... you can wear your cutest pair of jeans :)  Cool atmosphere with some live music, a busy bar, fireplace, and then a white tablecloth, service at it's best, low-light dining room.  Perfect date spot if you want to spend a penny or two and really impress her.   The seafood tower is TO DIE FOR.  You have to order a steak for your main course and the warm butter cake is the perfect finale.  Oh City Hall... I dream of you often..........
