In a metropolitan city like Phoenix, it is definitely nice to have an outdoor retreat just minutes away. The park is easily accessible. Free parking in its huge lot. 

The first thing I said after getting out of the car was: It finally feels like Arizona. Mountains. Trees. Cacti. Ponds. Omg dirt!

After strolling around the entrance of the Phoenix Zoo, we made our way over to the popular geological formation called Hole-in-the-Rock. Giant holes caused by erosion millions of years ago. A short trail around to the back and a small climb to the largest hole. Great landscape view from the top. The other holes are also accessible, but for more experienced hikers.

There are other trails throughout the park and other attractions such as the Desert Botantical Garden and Hunt's Tomb.

Papago Park! Highlight of my trip!! =D
