Our administrative assistant at work is a big fan of Bertha's.  And now, I am, too.  She's ordered in lunch from Bertha's a couple of times.  The first time, it was the Thai chicken salad, which I loved.  Today, we had two salads and a sandwich tray.  I don't even like sandwiches.  I helped myself to both salads, and picked up a sandwich, intending to dismantle it and eat the meat and cheese.  Inexplicably, I took a bite of the sandwich, and said "OMG!  This is so good!"  It was the turkey w/bacon and avocado sandwich.  My friend seated directly to my left said, "Let's go to Bertha's and order more of these after lunch."  They were truly that good.  The salads were both great, too.  I think we'll be frequenting Bertha's a lot in the immediate future.
