I thought this place was great.  I was there for a work event, and we had the whole park to ourselves with open bar.... can you really beat that?  (plus, it is where my boyfriend and I had our first date... only in the batting cages and diving range section though...)

Highlights of my trip were... and bear in mind some of this stuff is part of our party, and not part of the park.

1) Face Painting/Animal Balloon Making!

2) Scott and all of his ridiculousness.

3) Skee Ball - I kicked Thoms ASS!

4) Go-Karting.

5) The DJ.

The only thing I didn't like was not being able to drink wine on the kiddie rides.. Boo hoo.  I'll get over it.
