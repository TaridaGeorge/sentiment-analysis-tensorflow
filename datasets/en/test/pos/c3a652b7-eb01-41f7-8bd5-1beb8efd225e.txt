The Big Bang is most definitely my favorite bar in Tempe, if not the greater Phoenix area. I am usually there a few times per month and the entire staff is very friendly, the drinks are flowing and the entertainment is great! The servers are friendly and the piano players provide a great show! 

Its a great bar for getting away from the usual douche bag Mill Ave crowd.
