MB Motors is a great shop!  The owners and staff are extremely nice and knowledgeable.  Great service and reasonable costs for repairs.  Bud worked for dealerships for almost 20 years and he brings all of that expertise to the table, including the latest tools like Star Diagnosis System, WIS, and more.

If you have a Mercedes and like saving money, make sure to give them a call.  Otherwise, you can continue to bring your car to the dealer and get ripped off
