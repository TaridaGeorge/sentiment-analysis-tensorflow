Cupcakes everywhere! Good ones, crazy ones, gourmet ones, and a few not so good ones! I like that they host this on Veterans day weekend and that the proceeds go to help Veterans. A fun way to earn money for a good cause. The vendors were all really nice and Yelp was on hand to add some more fun to the mix. There was also water, milk, and a bar area to wash down all those sweets. I really liked the photo booth too. My favorite cupcake was the one from Bourbon restaurant with the bacon and blueberries. I was really skeptical about trying it and it was very good.
