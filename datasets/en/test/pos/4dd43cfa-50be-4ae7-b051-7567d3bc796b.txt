Been eating here for years and I try something new every chance I get. I love the food and every dish shines in its own way.

Go there, meet some friends or take a date, try anything. You'll be back!

The drinks are cold and strong & the atmosphere is great. A rare combo in this town.

Also a great place to celebrate St. Patties Day, green beer & all.
