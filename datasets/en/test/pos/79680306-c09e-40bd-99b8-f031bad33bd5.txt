Yahoo to discovering AZ88!!!  Just stopped by for drinks with a new friend last night but damn was it fun!  Really nice vibe, beautiful space with a truly elegant yet casual feel (who knew this was possible) and killer cocktails.  I learned how to slurp last night since your martini glass is filled so full you have no choice but to bend over the bar and slurp from your stemware!  Heard that that is how the bartenders can spot a newbie: newbies essentially spill all over the bar...or was I drunk by that second dirty martini?

Cannot wait to go back for a burger...and so damn close to Casa NR!
