We hit the mall in search of dinner on 9/30, figuring we'd find something cool and casual. We actually hit the jackpot.

The food was pretty good but what blew us away (and earned the 5 stars) was the service. Our waitress was Karyl and she was awesome. She said she'd only been there about a week but it sure didn't seem like it. She was great, very personable and attentive. 

If we're ever back in Tempe (and we're there a few times a year), we'll definitely be back...hopefully when she's working.
