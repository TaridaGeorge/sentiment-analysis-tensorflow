They have 24/7 delivery! And the food tastes awesome after a night out! First was introduced to this place after an night out in Flagstaff and it was the only place open in downtown after the bars closed. Found this location in Tempe and it is just as good as the one in Flag. Personally, I'm partial to the Philly Cheesesteak pita.
