An overpowering craving for tres leches cake came my way today, so  I searched yelp for that item and Christina P's review came up. So I hopped into my chariot and headed for this Food City. It was a pleasant surprise - the place is spacious and clean, quite festive, and going around the store I found the prices to be very reasonable. Then I headed to the bakery and found the holy grail. I brought my treasure home and immediately tried it. Each "single-serving" tres leches portion was actually huge, and oooooh-so-delicious! Thanks, Christina ... I now have a new addiction!
