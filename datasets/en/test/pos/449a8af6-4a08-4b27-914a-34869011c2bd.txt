Rock solid food and service!   We came down from Sedona this morning before heading to the airport.  This was my second visit and first visit to the new location. I had the ham steak with red eye gravy and hashbrowns.  Almost licked the plate clean.  Gross, I know, but it is that good.  My husband had the wolfpack and loved that too.  Super attentive service. 

Folks, this is what it is all about, great food, great service at a very fair price.  I have not been for lunch, but would highly recommend for breakfast.
