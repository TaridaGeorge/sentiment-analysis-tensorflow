This place is awesome! I ate a chicken sandwich at the Farm Kitchen for lunch and couldn't be more pleased, it was delicious!! The menu carries a good selection, the food is fresh, and the desserts.... WOW! 

It is a little pricey - I paid $32 for 2 sandwiches/2chips/2drinks. Parking is confusing - especially if its your first time. I went at about noon and drove into the property only to get stuck. Too many cars are trying to come in/out of a small space which creates a mess. There is a lot directly across the street that handles the overflow - just park there! 

The employees are very pleasant and the overall feel of the location as a whole is very welcoming. I definitely recommend it - can't wait to try the breakfast and dinner restaurants :)
