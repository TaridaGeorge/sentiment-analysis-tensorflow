Smeeks is enough to make any grown adult throw a tantrum, drool sugary syrup down the front of their white T-shirt and spend their entire allowance.

The tiny corner shop has an entire spectrum of peculiar and obscure candies, toys and gifts in a carnival jamboree setting. Because my boyfriend was with me and running his mouth, I ripped through like a 10 year-old on their way to soccer practice. I left with a mini red Chinese-takeout box of jujubes, scallop-cut cupcake papers, and a hand-shaped notepad that say "Talk to the Hand" on it.

A perfect stop for good kids you want to reward, bad kids you need to contain and big kids who still pound candy like it's their job.
