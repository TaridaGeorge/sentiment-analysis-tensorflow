revisted this place, and honestly... it was exactly what I was looking for.  A place to kick back with some friends and have some sushi instead of deep fried everything from other places.  The sushi was well rolled, the wait staff was friendly, the chefs interact with you and if they don't, it's probably cause they're concentrating on making sushi haha.  I like how people show up at restaurants at 945 when they close at 10 and then B about it... get a life, cause obviously the chefs and their families have one.  And why are you watching monkeys masturbate anyways... sick nasty, get a life.  Eat at Sake Bombers more and maybe the chefs will invite you to chill after work.
