My wife and I have been to the Golden Spoon on several occasions since they opened (my wife has been several more times than I have) and we are always happy with the flavors and service. I usually ask for three and sometime up to five different flavors to sample just to make sure I am getting the one I really want. So far I haven't found that there is any limit to how many samples you can try. :) Bonus!! 

Not to take advantage but I am adventurous and like to try new things and they let me with there yummy little samples. :) 

We like golden spoon, and if you haven't tried it yet you should head on over.
