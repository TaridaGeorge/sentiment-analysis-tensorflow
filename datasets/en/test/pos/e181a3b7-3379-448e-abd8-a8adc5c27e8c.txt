I grew up in Scottsdale and was there last weekend for a wedding, and I had never set foot in the Valley Ho, even though it was a landmark.  We were really pleasantly surprised, especially since the price was so reasonable (we booked on Hotels.com and got a better rate than the hotel had given for the wedding party).  It was fresh, cool, spacious rooms, really nice bathroom, good food in the cafe.  If I were coming for a resort vacation I wouldn't be totally psyched about the pool, which is small, but the lounging area around it was really pleasant.  Great location (if you can stand Old Scottsdale, which I can't) and close to Fashion Square mall which is something of a shopping mecca.
