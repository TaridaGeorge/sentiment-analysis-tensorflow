Greekfest has something that drives it to the top of my lunch list:  friendly, warm wait staff, cook and owners who remember my name every time I go.  This is why you return to a place - it's not so much the food or the ambiance, but how you are made to feel when you walk in, and Greek Fest needs to file a patent, because they have it.  The authentic delicious Greek food is an added value.  The mousaka and youvetsi defninitely shine here, as does the curious greek salad with the peppery, sharp taste.  Don't be shy - order what the Greeks eat, and leave the gyro alone.
