mmmm mmmm delicous!! This is by far one of my favorite "different" places. Im not known much for trying new things when it comes to food, but here I feel like I can branch out a little! My friends and I were recommended to this place a couple years ago, and now we take everyone we meet there! My husband and I went the other night, he got the special which was the Thai Basil with lamb, and I went with my always favorite spicey noodles with chicken! The Thai Basil was full of flavor it made mine taste whimpy in comparison, but I will always love the spicey noodles! The waiters and friendly and try to get you a seat as soon as they can even when its packed on a friday night! 5 stars from me!!
