Alright this is the deal of deals, 2.75 for students and Im not sure if its a quarter more or not, but less 4 dollars. half an ice cream cookie sandwiches, trust me its enough.  

Its a great pick me up for something sweet on mill

Cookies are made their along with the good ice cream, and if your not into that they have italian ice.

Place is small, but is packed with flavor, and smells like fresh cookies.

Recommendation: If you love cookies made into sandwiches
