Matt is a Kansas City native like me and like Kansas City folks knows great food.  Though breakfast is busy, it is worth the outside wait even in the middle of the summer.  The wait staff is great and always on their toes, it is fun to see the owner's wife active in the restaurant filling coffee, delivering food and following up on your experience.  Though the menu is not too long, it has all the classic greats, plus great specials.  For those who like to feel at home for breakfast, this is the place to go.
