The castle is what drew us here.  It's just the front of a castle with a reading nook in the bottom of the tower.  The 3 year old was impressed as soon as he saw it.  There is also a play area with big activity walls.  It was a little hard for my son to comprehend being quiet while playing.  Getting to the library was confusing with the GPS.  Just follow the signs and park in the garage at the end to the left when you pull in.  Well worth a one time visit.
