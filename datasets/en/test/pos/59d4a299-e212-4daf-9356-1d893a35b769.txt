GREAT burgers.  Almost best to share and each get your own sides, because the fries and the coleslaw are both great.  That way you can get an appetizer - like the shrimp quesadilla - open face, shrimp, cheese, I think it was 2 kinds, and stripes of pesto.  I think I could eat that 3 times a day.  I think I'm now going to have to go again soon because I won't stop thinking about the quesadilla and burger until I can have it again!

Atmosphere is nice.  Bar is nice.  Feels like a warm neighborhood place.  Service is very good, always attentive, even when it's busy.
