The char-crust on the burgers are friggin' ridonculous! Every bite is an explosion of flavorness and juiciness, and whichever other 'ness' you could imagine.

The Garlic fries here have utterly ruined any other chance that any other garlic fry out there would have-ever.  I have not tasted their equal anywhere! First taste brings me back to my childhood.  With it's escargot-like butter concoction, I lost my mind!  They get extra points for the pool of residue that collects at the bottom of the fry boat. My mouth is literally watering as I type...sigh

Chocolate shake rounds out the dining experience due to it's bombness! get a spoon, they're thickness.

Clearly they have more to offer, but I have found the magic equation and will stick to it.  The pizzas do look good however....
