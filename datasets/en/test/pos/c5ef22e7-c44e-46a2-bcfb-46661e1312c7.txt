I've been here a couple times now and have had the gyro. I'm no gyro expert but that is the best gyro that I have ever had. The place is very clean and the staff is fast and polite. I recently had the Spartan Club due to the recommendations on here. Now that's a damn good sandwich! You gotta try this place out.
