This is by far the best Chicken Fried Steak around!  Not to mention their mashed potatoe's, salad and biscuit!  I've never been able to clean my plate here, which is great since I always have an extra meal!   Of course you can always get the lunch portion which is smaller, but then you don't have the extra goodies for later!  

It's a small down home place, dress comfy and go there to eat up!  The wait staff is always the best and they know their stuff!  

I've had their T-Bone here, and it's good, but really hard to go there and not get what made them famous!  Wonderful food!

Prices for lunch are around $7.00 and dinner around $12.00 - really hard to beat for real down home cooking!
