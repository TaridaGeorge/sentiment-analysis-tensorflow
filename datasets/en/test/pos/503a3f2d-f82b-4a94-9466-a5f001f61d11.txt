I must  say that I was very pleased with this salon!  I called at about 6:30 on a Monday evening asking what time they closed to see if I had enough time to get a pedicure or not.  The lady simply said to just come in.  I was the only one there and they were very patient with me as I walked in at 6:45 (I did not know that it was 15 minutes before they closed!)  I did not feel rushed or over charged! I will go back to this salon because of the service I received that night!
