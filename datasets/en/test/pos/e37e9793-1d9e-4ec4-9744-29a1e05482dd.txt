My review concerns the store, in general - Not their rental counter.

I like this store because it has the "Mom & Pop" aura - The employees that are there have been there for some time, and Russ himself is always there to help out when needed.  That says something.

The employees are EXTREMEMLY helpful - Overly-helpful at times, but I'm not going to complain about that!  Checking-out is super-fast, and selection of items is good.

Sure, you might end up having to get something at Home Depot or Lowe's, but try and give Russ some of your business - You'll like what you find here.
