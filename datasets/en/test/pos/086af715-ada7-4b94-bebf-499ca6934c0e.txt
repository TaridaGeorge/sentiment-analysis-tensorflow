We came in on a busy Sunday for Breakfast. Their was a wait for a table with our large table but thats usually a good sign. Once we were sat we had prompt service from beginning to end. I love that we had our own coffee carafe :) The cinnamon roll was delicious with a cream cheese frosting and the food we all had was perfect. The Benedict was delicious and the creeps were a hit. Overall great experience. Thank you :)
