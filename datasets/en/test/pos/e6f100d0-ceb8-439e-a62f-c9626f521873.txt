I have never worked with a better contractor. AZ Cold AIr was prompt in setting up a meeting to look at our 16 year old system and advise on a replacement. The price was fair but Wayne explained all of the details and how we would have a "filter drawer" when they were done instead of the goofy system of bending filters and weighting them down. The installation was meticulous and testing was rigorous. APS wanted a ton of data in order to give us their rebate and Wayne provided that stack of written data. After one full season, the new Ruud system cut our electric bills by 30% and the winter gas bills by 40%. It is everything Wayne promised and then some but the installation is elegant. It looks like a professional job. We could not be happier.
