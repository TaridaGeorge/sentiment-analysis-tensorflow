Love this place.  In fact MMP is one of the reasons I moved to Fountain Hills, well that and the nightlife.  Seriously, if you like to ride single track- fast get your fat tires out here.  As you see in the other reviews the competitive loops offer some great terrain and variety and, yes, the long loop is long.  The short loop, though, is short and fast and fun as hell.  Also, there are other trails in the park if these are too technical- but those are open to hikers and horses, so be careful.  It's all making me wonder why I am sitting here yelping when I could be riding!
