Tempe Town Lake is one of the few places in Arizona that I can go to clear my mind. Granted it is not a true lake, but having grown up in Colorado, I will gladly frequent TTL.
The designers made it very modern and convenient. The bridge lights up at night (great when walking back from Mill at 2am!)and the glow on the water is beautiful!
There are doggy stations and water fountains every 1/4 mile, so your little one can always be 100%. If you park at the PAC and run to the end of the lake and back it is 3.5 miles - perfect way to start your morning. 
There are constantly events going on; art shows, concerts, carnivals, borgata etc. 
Writing this makes me wish I was still in AZ to experience it!
