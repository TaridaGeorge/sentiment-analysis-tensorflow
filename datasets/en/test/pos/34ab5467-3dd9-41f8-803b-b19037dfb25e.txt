My boss brought me here and bought me bread as a treat. I wasn't too hot on the idea of getting a piece of bread as a snack but once I bit into it, I wanted to curl up with the roll that I got and sleep with it for days. It slapped me in the face with deliciousness. I got this roll that was stuffed with jalapenos and cheese and baked perfectly.

The guy working there was really awesome too.  I got some free samplers of this turkey and cheese-stuffed bread that was pretty bomb as well.
