What a great place to go and hang out after work and drink an ice cold beer.  I have spent a lot of time here with my co-workers and sit and cool off and talk stories about the job.  Also spent this last Friday here after work celebrating my birthday.

I believe our favorite waitress' name is Miranda and she is an awesome gal!
