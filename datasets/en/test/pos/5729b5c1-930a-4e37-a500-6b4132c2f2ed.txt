After first going to the City of Phoenix Vehicle Impounding, Fingerprints, etc building and having the #38 and hearing them call #12 and #13 in 40 minutes I started wondering if there was a better, faster way to get fingerprints.  Found Arizona Livescan on my web search and was so glad I did.  Not only was it only 15 minutes from the time I walked in the door until I was complete, but the lady (Thanks Val) told me I did not have good quality prints on four of my fingers and spent extra time getting the best quality.
I would highly recommend this business.
