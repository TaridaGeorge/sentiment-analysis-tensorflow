This place gets 5 stars for hiring Connor. This dude is awesome, he was on point with making our drinks, and making sure we were having a great time... and it was his first day. Make sure you sit at the bar and chat with him... he made the place with the visit. We got the fries and coal roasted veggies (fries were ok.. i like them crispy, and the veggies were awesome) A ton of different liquors and pretty great burgers.

Check this place out!!
