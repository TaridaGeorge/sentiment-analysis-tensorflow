I LOVE this place. It's close to campus and has free WiFi. 

It's the ONLY place I go for a chai tea latte. No one makes it better than Cartel. (Trust me, I've been to wayyy too many coffee shops trying their chai lattes) 

The only downside is that the coffee lab is small, and sometimes it's hard to find a table.
