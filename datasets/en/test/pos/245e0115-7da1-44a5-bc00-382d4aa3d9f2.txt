I love Gelato Spot. Anytime I'm in old town, I always come here after dinner or the bar since they are open so late on the weekends. I'm one of those people who always craves salt and rarely eats sweets, unless it's gelato. I've tried every flavor and always end up with roasted almond. It is perfection. 

I know several people that have said Gelato Spot doesn't taste like real gelato. Maybe it's just me, but I've tried lots of other gelato in the valley and elsewhere and can't find anything that tastes as good as this place (except Italy of course).
