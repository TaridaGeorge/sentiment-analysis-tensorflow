cheese. and wine. i'm sorry, how do you not love this?

i stopped by for lunch and ordered the sandwich with asiago, proscuitto, fig and balsamic on marble rye . It was warm, melty, and utterly delectable for such a simple combo. I didn't care for the dressing for the salad, but eh, minor detail.  will i be back to try the other sandwiches? absolutely. 

The husband/wife duo that own/run this shop are SOOOO nice!!!! And the staff is pretty phenomenal as well. 

they have a pretty incredible selection of cheeses and charcuterie, along with wines. they have wine tastings here as well. 

finally; a local business more than worthwhile supporting!
