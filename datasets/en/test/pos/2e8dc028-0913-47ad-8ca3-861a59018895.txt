I had been getting my glasses at another store with a Colorado sounding name. When I needed new lenses I called for a price and it was almost $700.00... just for the lenses. I did some poking around on the Internet and found Sassy carried my specialty frames as well. 

Dan helped me out with the new lenses, a bit of frame repair and saved me a bundle. Plus, he is a nice guy. I am a big fan and will be back.  

Plus, if you want some very disctinctive eyewear, the have the best.
