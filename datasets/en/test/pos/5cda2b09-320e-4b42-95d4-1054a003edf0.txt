Robyn has done our taxes for two years now.  She is professional, thorough, and very easy to work with.  Her hours are flexible and we were able to do much of the paperwork virtually (but securely).

Her rate for tax prep is incredibly reasonable considering how much she was able to capture for us and how knowledgeable and detailed she is.
