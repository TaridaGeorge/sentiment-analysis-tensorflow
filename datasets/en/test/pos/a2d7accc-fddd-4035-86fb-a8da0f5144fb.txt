I was left with a good impression after my first time there. We went on a Tuesday and it was still pack at night. Very small parking, but there was compliment valet parking. 
The valet parking guy was also very friendly. The low-lighting environment seem to be a great get-together place for group of friend or even a date. 

I'm not much of a wine drinker, but we order Moscato and I like it! I also love the bruschettas there, especially the salmon one. They also have a variety of sandwiches that you can order from that will make you quite full after a few bite. 

I would definitely come back to this place. ^_^
