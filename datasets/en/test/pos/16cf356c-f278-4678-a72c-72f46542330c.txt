Always good food and service but yet another reason to love this place...there is a young man who works here. Always friendly and works hard. While we were there an older couple came in with the lady being in a wheelchair. This kid RAN across the dining area to hold the door and get them comfortably seated. You just don't see that stuff any more! Attitude and the desire to make someone happy is a big indicator of the work ethic of a person and this young man is awesome!
