I love Mojo Yogurt! You can't go wrong with a frozen yogurt company on Mill Avenue. With their late hours, you can practically get a cup at any time!

Here's a tip: hit up the goodies bar before you fill your cup with yogurt. Layering the goodies can be fun! And if you are really adventurous, ask for the Cheesecake Bites that they store in the refrigerator in the back. YUM!
