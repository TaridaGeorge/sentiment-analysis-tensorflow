We recently had our wedding luncheon at Fleming's and the service/ staff was fantastic! We worked directly with Lesa.  She was very personable and helped to make the wedding planning process stress-free and easy.  She was prompt in responding to all of our emails and was very accommodating of all of our requests.

As far as the food was concerned, everything was prepared to our liking and all of our guests raved about the food which was served.  Some of the stand-out favorites were the Mac & Cheese, the Filet Mignon, and the Lamb Chops. The Fleming's staff helped to truly make our day a memorable one! We'll definitely be back for our Wedding Anniversaries!
