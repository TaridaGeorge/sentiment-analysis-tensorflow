This place is pretty awesome. You usually don't expect much on the taste side from a sports bar, but everything we had was very good. Our waitress was very friendly and sweet. Put up with about 20 of us hooligans! She was also ridiculously hot (freckles). She gave us a couple of places to go out that night, and even split ALL of our checks, which I was later informed that they have an old school check out system. They are all paper and calculators, so it must have been such a hassle to do that, but she did it with a smile! Great place!
