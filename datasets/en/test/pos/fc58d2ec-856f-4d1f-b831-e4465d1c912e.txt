I ended up here on a Saturday afternoon because the place we were going for lunch was a long wait and walking back to the car we saw the sign, which worked out perfectly!

I had never been to a place like this before and the server was super helpful with suggestions. I had the avocado salad and it was amazing and really fresh. For dessert, we shared the sweet potato pudd'n with vanilla ice cream (at the servers suggestion) and it was absolutely delicious! I now find myself craving it from time to time. 

I liked the atmosphere as there is a small dining area, perfect for a party of two. There is a very Jamaican feel to the decor and it complimented the menu nicely. I definitely intend to go back and try out some other sections from the menu and get some more of that pudd'n!
