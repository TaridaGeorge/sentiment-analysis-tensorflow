I brought three girls here, ages 4, 7, and 11.  ALL of the girls really enjoyed the exhibits, in different ways!  My 4 year old really liked the "real" dinosaur shows that go on about every 30 minutes.  It was very cool, and kind of Vegas-like in the quality of presentation and showmanship.  They all enjoyed the technology exhibits, stones, minerals, and critters of the Sonoran Desert, and the gold panning was great!!  Cute little outdoor area.  This is a very fun place that only takes you maybe 2-3 hours max to get through.  I suppose you could spend more time as an adult, but kids just cruise through very superficially.  I was pleasantly surprised at how much we all enjoyed it...  and will definitely return.  If you like the Arizona Science Center (who doesn't?)... this is almost like a mini version of that.  Love it!!!
