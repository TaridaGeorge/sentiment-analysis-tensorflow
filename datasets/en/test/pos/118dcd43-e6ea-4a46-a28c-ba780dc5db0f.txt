This is by far my favorite sandwich place in Chandler. The fresh baked wheat bread is mouthwatering. My coworkers and I make Planet Sub our lunch stop at least once a week. The creamy club is definitely my favorite. They have a lot of different sandwiches to choose from and you can turn any sandwich into a wrap. The other sandwich places in the same vicinity don't have anything on Planet Sub. My only request is that they would open more locations in the valley. This location is very easy to find and the service has always been superb.
