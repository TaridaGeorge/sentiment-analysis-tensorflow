I have only had 2 Brazilian waxes in my life, and the 2nd one was just done by Deyna. I had a horrible experience during my first wax in Canada, so seeing Deyna was delightful! She made me feel 100% comfortable, and she was very chatty and kind. She uses bed sheets as waxing strips and they work so well! She even showed me the roots of my hairs on the strip and educated me about how waxing works. I would recommend her to anyone! I'll be back to see her when I'm back in Mesa later in the year. Ask her where the "F spot" is. ;)
