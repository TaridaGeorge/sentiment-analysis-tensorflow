Local Breeze is the kind of place that you could go on a Saturday during nice weather and spend the entire day. Get there at 9am for breakfast/brunch, have a few mimosas, play some bean bags, have lunch, couple beers, catch some sun, afternoon snack, get some laptop work done, have dinner, drinks around the fire. Done. And done.

Great food on an AMAZING patio - this place exists on a different plane for the months of Feb-Apr and Oct-Nov. Maybe the only issue I have with the place is that the portions might be a little too large - OK, a lot large - so take a friend and share.
