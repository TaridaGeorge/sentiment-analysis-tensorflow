how can this be the 2nd most reviewed restaurant in phx and it only has 4 reviews?

casey moore's (or as i like to call him, Casey) is like megatron. they have a back dining area (which is supposedly haunted) which looks pretty classy and is quite serene, perfect for a nice dinner with your family from out of town. after dinner is over and your aunt and uncle drive their chrysler sebring back to their hotel, you can your cute cousin can head over to the main bar area and get tanked and you'll never realize you're in the same building as before. hopefully you'll get her drunk enough that she admits she's always had a crush on you too. bonus points if you find out she's actually adopted.
