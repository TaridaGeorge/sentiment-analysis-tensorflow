I love love love this place! The tmb sandwich is the best around. Everything from the bread, to the cheese to the veggies are fresh and flavorful. A definite must try if you're downtown. But don't expect there to be much seating though. It's pretty much a to go kinda place. There's a few benches outside, but it's pretty much take and go. So just a little heads up. They even have a few salads there, the caprese is the best. Try it, it's good and a definite repeat kind of place.
