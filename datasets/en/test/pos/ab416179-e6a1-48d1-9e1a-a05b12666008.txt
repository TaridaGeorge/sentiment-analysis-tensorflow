A delicious way to cap off a long day on the road to the Arizona Biltmore. We ordered the BR Cohn and the Kilt Lifter on the recommendation of our friendly server, Dannon. He did not steer us wrong all night...we had the "Desert Flat" for a starter which was simply amazing. It was a foccacia pizza with red onion marmalade, goat cheese, warm spinach, chicken (optional for veggies), and mandarin oranges. I might have to have it for lunch tomorrow! 

The entrees: grouper for him, Waldorf salad for me, were also excellent, but I can hardly get the butterscotch pudding we had for dessert out of my head. It was salted to perfection and well worth every last bite!
