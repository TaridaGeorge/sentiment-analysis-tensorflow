I make the 20-mile drive from the east valley to Tempe Feed & Tack for several reasons (in no particular order): 1) Huge selection of ultra premium dog & cat foods. 2) Arthur is very knowledgeable and spent a lot of time comparing food options. 3) Special orders are welcomed and arrive quickly. 4) Friendly customer service. 5) Competitive pricing (plus some manufacturers have frequent buyer programs). 6) I like supporting local businesses over the big chains. I am very happy with this store!
