We had the best service ever!!!!!!!!  We sat on the patio and our waitress was Taylor.  She was so attentive, we got our food right away and of course it was delicious!!

One thing that was very odd was that we wanted to speak to her manager to tell her what great service we had, then the manager came out and acted like we were wasting her time.  It was the strangiest thing?????  Just not sure if she wasen't interested in what we were saying, or she had other things that she was doing.

So I would give Taylor 5 STARS, and the manger 1 STAR!!!!
