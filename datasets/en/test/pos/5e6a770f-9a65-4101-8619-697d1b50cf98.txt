Great food, great service. Excellent quality and yes, you pay for quality sushi. 

The owner, wait staff and chef are always friendly and extremely attentive. We have a favorite deemed the "Saturday Night Special" created by a chef  after we sat at the bar and sampled some of his creativity. We arrived at one we really liked and, being Saturday, adopted the name.

Great place and very unexpected for Chandler! Locals would like to keep it to ourselves but the word is out and well deserving of your business! My favorite sushi place - not snooty, great food, great service and no long wait. What's not to love?
