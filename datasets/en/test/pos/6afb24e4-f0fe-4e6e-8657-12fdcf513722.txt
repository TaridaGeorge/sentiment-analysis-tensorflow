My favorite pizza ever. 

it DOES live up to its hype! people are always complaining about the wait, the wait isn't even that long anymore. the longest I have waited since they started opening for lunch is 45 minutes. dont like it? Im sure there is a dominos near there where you can enjoy your cardboard pizza in 10 minutes. I have waited for 4 hours prior to them opening up for lunch and it was worth EVERY minute. O have had guests from Italy taste Biancos pizza and they loved it. 

The margherita and Rosa are amazing. 
The staff is great. For being as busy as they are, they are very helpful.

I highly recommend Pizzeria Biancos!

p.s. dont compare this place to Cibo, Cibo is great but its not Biancos, however, it is a great alternative choice.
