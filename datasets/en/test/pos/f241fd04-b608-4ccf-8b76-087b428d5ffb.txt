Probably the most serious restaurant for food in Scottsdale.  Great attention to detail from the chefs, management and servers.  Shin does warm up after a few visits - we've been there probably 10 times in the last 18 months.  ShinBay is a must for anyone truly into food.  Given the ingredients - both the sheer number of them and the overall quality I would actually call the pricing here a downright bargain.
