One of the very few places one can get a breaded tenderloin sandwich. I used to have favorite place back in Iowa for tenderloins...this is better. If anyone reading this is from Des Moines and knows Smitty's Tenderloins on Army Post Rd they you'll love this place. The tenderloins taste the same but they're thicker. I have yet to have a pie there but I hear they're to die for.
