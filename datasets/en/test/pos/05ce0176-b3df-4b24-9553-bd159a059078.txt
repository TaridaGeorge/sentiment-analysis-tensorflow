I work near this Outback and was just introduced to their curbside takeout. On nights I work late and have to pick up dinner this is a snap! PLUS with their 6oz sirloin with two sides for $9.95 who could go wrong?

The steaks are always really good and tender and well seasoned. I usually get a baked potato and salad with fat free tomato dressing and dont feel guilty about anything! My man likes a ceasar with fries, and you can get garlic mashed, sweet potato's or steamed veggies too. 

Outback is now on our takeout rotation for being cheap, easy and most importantly- a good meal!
