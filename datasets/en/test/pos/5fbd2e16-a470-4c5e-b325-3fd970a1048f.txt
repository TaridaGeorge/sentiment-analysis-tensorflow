One of the best burgers in town!  Awesome fries that come in a tiny shopping basket with ketchup or chipotle sauce.  .  Place has a great vibe.  
Burger by itself is about 9.50, a bit pricey but very good.

It's gets packed at lunch time,  so be ready to sit very close to other people as the seating isn't so great.
