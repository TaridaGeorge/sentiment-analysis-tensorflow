YUMMY breakfast spot! Matt and his wife are super nice and the food is excellent. Tried the porkchop breakfast and it was soo good. Even Guy Fierri from foodnetwork thinks its the best breakfast he's ever had! 

The restaurant is really tiny but didn't wanna take away a star for that cuz its definitely worth the wait. The homefries are reallly good too and you get that on the side with almost every dish anyway. =)
