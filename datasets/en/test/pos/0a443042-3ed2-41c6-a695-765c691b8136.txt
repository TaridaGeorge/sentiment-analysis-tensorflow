this place is a straight throw back to simpler times.... when you just wanted to sit down and have yerself a dog and a soda... and a float, and a sundae.... 

plus, after yer done fillin' yerself up with all the delicious foodie goods, feel free to walk it off as you meander and shop yer way through the vintage offerin's. 

good food, great antiquing, amazing atmosphere.
