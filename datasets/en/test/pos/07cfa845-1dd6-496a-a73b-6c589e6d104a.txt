Great company me Thomas and Scotty had a blast with the Tomcar only problem was the diff lock would not work we got stuck and it made us late returning it ontime they understood and didn charge us a late return fee ! great company as a owner of a offroad shop and many UTV's the Tomcar was very impressive power streering would be a plus only because I am handicapped and found the bump steer to much for me to handle. Next time im in Arizona I will be renting from this company again!
