One of the top 5 places I have ever been to for dinner, hands down.  One word to describe this place: lovely.  The outdoor seating area with a heated brick patio is a dream on a brisk desert night.  I could go on and on and on about this place but all I will say is that you must go if you are in AZ and looking for an evening that is simply divine.
