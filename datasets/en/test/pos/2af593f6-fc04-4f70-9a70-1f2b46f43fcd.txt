I've been here more than a few times and appreciate most of the food here. It's very trendy. The staff is friendly and the seating is comfy.

I love the lettuce wraps to the point where I've almost been able to make them myself.  The phyllo pockets are good but lots of flavor so some might not like them.

If you like chicken, try the tan-tan chicken sandwich, with baba ganoush, green olives, spinach and some other nummy stuff.

The cinnamon dusted sweet potato fries are good for a sweet side dish.

The martinis are delicious and different. Try the banana split and the key lime pie martinis....heck, go ahead and see if you can try them all!
