As a reviewer below said: "As much as I love Lux, I'm kinda glad that it's not closer to my house, otherwise they might have all of my money." 
So far it is the BEST coffeebar I've been to in the Sun Valley, not just the atmosphere or their chic and comfy couches, but because of the coffee bean quality. Sipping their aromatic coffee (either Velvet aka White Mocha, Latte, or just black coffee) is enough to make the rest of my day better!
