Fresh salads!  Had the spinach salad with apples, feta, red onion & grilled chicken. Fabulous & plentiful!  I always love this hidden spot for their fresh ingredients and homemade daily soup.

I have never had anything on the menu that I didn't think was 5 stars.  Keep in mind this is an old building and the owner keeps the decor the same no matter what century it is!  Know that your going to an old neighborhood pub and it's all good.
