Thank you Lee Lee's for opening up on the west side!
I can now find all of my beloved Thai ingredients right here! This store is divided in sections. Thai here, Japenese there...you get the picture. The produce section is great too! Kaffir lime leaves, lemon grass, galangal, thai chili..its all here!
I went opening weekend and they gave me a 10% discount card that I can use everytime I am there. Not sure if they are still being offered, but you can give it a shot and ask the cashier.
