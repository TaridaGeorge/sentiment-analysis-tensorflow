The boys and I wanted to meet up in Phoenix and do some partying. After a quick internet search we saw all the great reviews and decided to give AZ Elite a try. It worked out perfect for us. No DD rock,paper, scissors game to be played. Like others noted the vehicles were clean and our driver, Chris was  very personable. Everyone had a blast and made it home safe. Oh and the best part is the price. Try this service and you will not regret it.
