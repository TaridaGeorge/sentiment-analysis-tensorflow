My wife and I had lunch at T Cooks twice this weekend.  We visited the second time simply to confirm that it was as good as the first time.  Beautiful ambience, excellent food and service, this place has it all. I had the winter pear salad and the crispy salmon.  My lovely bride ordered the lobster bisque and the chicken salad sandwich.  We each ordered a flight of wines, which is a bargain at $25 and highly recommended.  We shared the dessert tasting (your choice of three small desserts for $8).  They also have a cozy little chef's table for two. T Cook's was the highlight of our weekend in Phoenix!
