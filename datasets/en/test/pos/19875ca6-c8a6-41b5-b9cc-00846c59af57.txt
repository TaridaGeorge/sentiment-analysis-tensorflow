What can I say...it was a really good happy hour.  This is definitely a place to be seen as there wasn't an empty table in the place.  Luckily we got seated right away on the patio...heat lamps included!

The waiter was able to keep up with the busy demand and made sure we were aware of the 2-for-1 happy hour!  The Fez Lettuce Wraps were a pleasant surprise.  Not the strong asian tastes that you most have come to love.  The Fez Lettuce wraps have a lighter taste with fruit and a light vinaigrette.

How do you say no to a rectangular burger?!  There are a wide variety of burgers and chicken sandwiches on the menu.  The Duxelles Burger was absolutely mouthwatering with saut√©ed mushrooms and onions...I skipped on the provolone cheese and it was still juicy.

Very trendy and great lighting inside.
