Maitre D' Ann B. was welcoming and suggested a wonderful table for two that offered a great view of the restaurant. I recommend the Butternut Squash Soup to start of any evening. This dish made my wine selection, the Girard Sauvignon Blanc, so nice I asked for another glass with my entre. I completed my meal with the Wild Striped Bass al Cartoccio. 

We had a great time and the pictures in front of the fireplace were fun to take.

We recommend Prado for any evening. Great for and Beautiful Staff!
