OMG!! Jen of Cake Frenzy is an amazing baker and decorator! I was in the area for a work conference form Los Angeles and someone brought some cupcakes to the conference and I tried one and it was to die for!! I contacted Jen for a very last minute request since I was only staying there for a few days and asked if she was able to make me a small creation to bring back home and she squeezed me into her busy schedule! I can't wait to schedule another trip down there - I will definitely order advance and bring it home for my friends and family to enjoy =)
