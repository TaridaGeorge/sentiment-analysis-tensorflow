The Meat Shop has been my exclusive butcher for just about 6 months now and I am VERY pleased with their products. I mean, where else can you get fresh pork, right out of the pig and on your plate? It's amazing. Paul and Beth are great people and they always take care of me. They recently contracted with a cattle rancher up in Camp Verde, and now they have fresh GRASS FED beef as well, which is interesing and delicious. 

If you are any kind of cook/bbqer/foodie, you have to check this place out and stock up on the freshest meat you will ever have. Thanks Paul! Keep the good stuff comin!
