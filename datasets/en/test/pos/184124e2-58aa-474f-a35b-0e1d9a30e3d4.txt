I can't believe this place has only been reviewed once! Crazy! This place is so friggin out of this world. I don't crave Italian food but this place is so good I think about it all the time. I had the best escrgot I have ever had in my life. They offer a gluten free pasta option. The red sauce is great. The wine selection is good. The service is on point. I will return time and time again and I don't even have to have a special occasion.
