My favorite smoke shop I've ever been to. Great atmosphere, massive humidor (probably as big as they get) and incredibly knowledgeable staff.  Not only that, but they don't even mind if you just bring a cigar in from somewhere else and smoke it there. I brought in a cigar I bought off the internet (which wasn't even that good although it got rated a 90. I found out I hate Olivia cigars) and smoked it there, but still bought a cutter just so I didn't seem cheap. haha. They didn't mind at all. Overall, as long as I live in Arizona I will be going to Ambassadors and no other smoke shop for my cigars.
