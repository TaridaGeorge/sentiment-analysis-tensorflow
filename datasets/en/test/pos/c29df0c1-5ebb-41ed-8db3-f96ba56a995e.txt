We were on our way to the Pink Pony only to find it closed down...so sad another tradition gone...thanks economy!  

Luckily Bandera is alive and kicking...this place was packed...hostess told us it would be a 30 minute wait for a table (Saturday Night)...we were able to snag a spot at the bar immediately.  We got lucky!  The food was fantastic...like always.  I don't think there is anything bad on this menu.  The Bartender talked us into the trout queso as an app...it was really good. The prime rib was so good (medium rare) and don't forget a side of mac and cheese.  I'm getting hungry again just typing this. 

We did not have desert but I've had the key lime pie here in the past and it is fantastic.  It is not always on the menu...so call ahead.
