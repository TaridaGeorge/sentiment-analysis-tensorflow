I visited this spa during a weekend retreat for work at the Wigwam resort. I got the most a-MAZE-ing manicure and pedicure. Monica was my nail technician. She took such great care of me and did a gorgeous job. My hands were so soft and delicate after my luxurious manicure. I would drive all the way to Litchfield Park again just for this 5 star treatment. I highly recommend this spa!
