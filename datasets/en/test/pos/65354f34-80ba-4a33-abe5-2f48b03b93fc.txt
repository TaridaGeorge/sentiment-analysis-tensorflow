Narcisse is the perfect spot for a bit of bubbly on a lazy Sunday afternoon, or a sexy Friday night out on the town, or Tuesday lunch, or Wednesday dinner. Wait.. Bubbly is good anytime. Well whatever,

The atmosphere morphs very easily from day to night because of the ambience of the space. The space is very white and airy, with lots of tables, comfy chairs and couches everywhere. They gave us the pick of the room and didn't try to rush us out even though they were closing down to reset for dinner service in 45 minutes. 

The food and cocktail menu looks great and I thoroughly enjoyed my freezing cold glass of Schramsberg Blanc de Blanc at a very reasonable $9 a glass. 

Would definitely return.
