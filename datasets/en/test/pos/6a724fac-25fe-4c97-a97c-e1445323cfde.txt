Had the California Club(breakfast sandwich) and an Ice Americano for breakfast here. Both were amazing! The California club was delicious! In addition to great food and a cool little restaurant the staff was super cool! The two employees that were there were very nice and I chatted with them while I ate. great food, great people = win.
