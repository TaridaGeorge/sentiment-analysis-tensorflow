After a long day on the road, having dinner here was a no brainer after checking into our room at Harrah's AK-Chin. (This restaurant is inside the casino-Hotel.)

The Boyfriend ate his weight in crab legs and shrimp. Apparently, so does everyone else except me! Sorry too much work for so little crab.

I had a little bit of everything; the calamari, some shrimp, penne and cheese, Szechan chicken and rice, eggroll, chow mein, salad, green olives, ice cream and a piece of pumpkin pie. Everything was either good or really good.

It was definitely better then some of the buffets we've been to in Vegas. 
All the staff were extremely friendly and attentive, which was unusual for a buffet.
