Was in the area a little too early on a hot day, came in to kill time and rehydrate. 

Ordered a nice sounding smoothie from the menu: Kool Kiwi. The first sip made me question whether I was really in my senses to have liked something so much in just one sip. The second sip confirmed it; this was no ordinary smoothie! It was tons of quality and freshness packed in one (large) serving.


 The option to add whey protein is wonderful, would've kept me coming back regularly if i were a local. Very pleased by the freshness of ingredients, cleanliness, atmosphere and service. 

Recommended, heartily!
