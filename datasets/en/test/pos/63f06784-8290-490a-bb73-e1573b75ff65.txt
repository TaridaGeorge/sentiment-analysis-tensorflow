Oh boy!!! If you are in for some scrumptious, finger licking good home-made food this is the place to go. Chris is the chef and a wonderful host. He has an amazing talent with the kitchen. Everything he makes is devine and deliciuos. I had the honor of celebrating my post graduation lunch here with my family. They were all very impressed with presentation, taste, and mood; that they want to return, ASAP! More importantly, my 104yr old grandfather (who is a very picky eater, I might add) ate everything we served him and ZERO complaints. I believe he ate more than me!
Thank you Chef Chris for such a memorable dining experience. 
You are soo talented.
I will definately be returning.
