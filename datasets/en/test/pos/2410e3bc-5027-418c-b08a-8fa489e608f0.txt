I can't believe I have lived in Scottsdale for 3 years and just recently visited Penzey's. I needed file spice for Gumbo. File can be hard to find outside of the Bayou, and they had it. The prices are surpirisinly low for the quality and specialization they have. I ended up buying about 6 little spice jars, they have all had great flavor so far. I will definitley be going back when I can spend more time. The employees are very friendly and helpful as well!
