egg and prosciutto pizza!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

Sooooooooooooooooo goooooooooooooooooood!! 

Worth the drive, worth the wait, worth 5+ stars! 

Yes the decor is not so good, so what! 

We also ordered a pepperoni, it was a good pizza, but it just couldn't compare to the oh my goodness amazing egg and prosciutto pizza. 

The service was great, friendly and accommodating! The bar tender was so nice and our waitress was too!
