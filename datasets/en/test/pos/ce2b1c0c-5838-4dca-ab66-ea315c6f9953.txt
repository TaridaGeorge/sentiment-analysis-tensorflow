Frickin' unbelievably awesome.

I want to go back every week until I've tried every single variation.

I had the carne adovada pasty.  Delicious, spicy, meaty... mmmm!

My man had the lamb vidaloo, and that was equally spicy and soooo tasty.

I got the banana carmel graham dessert thing too.  OMG!!!  So freakin' great.  Awesome.  Unbelievable.

Not sure I did the crampdness of the place, we ordered our stuff to-go and will probably go this route in the future.

Yum.Yum.Yum.
