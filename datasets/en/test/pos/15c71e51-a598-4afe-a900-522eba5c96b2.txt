The good thing about going here alone ...its practically no wait. I came in got a seat right at the bar. Yay for me.  I order a coffee omg it was delicious home grown natural. I ordered the special three egg scramble with sundried tomato chicken sausage, button mushrooms and local baby organic spinach and fontina serve with potatoes and toast.  I also order a side of Bacon because I had to try it. THIS PLACE FOOD was so good and filling.. I will definently come back here when I come back to Phoenix.. It was very much worth the drive.
