So glad I found this place, and in my neighborhood at that. My car's tires need to be replaced, so I went to their website and was able to view the specs, ratings, and reviews for the tires. When I went to the actual shop, I was treated with courtesy and did not have to deal with any high-pressure sale pitches. I was even allowed to review my options in the shop and chose a set of tires that was well suited for my driving style and budget. It took them only 30 minutes to do everything, and I used that time to get coffee and breakfast in one of the many dining establishments nearby. A pleasant experience overall.
