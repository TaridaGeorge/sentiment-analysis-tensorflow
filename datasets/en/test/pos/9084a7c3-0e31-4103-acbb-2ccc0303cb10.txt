Decided to call CityWide based on positive online reviews. We suspected a slab leak and a really expensive repair. Robert showed up within 20 minutes, determined the source of the leak within 5 minutes, and it turned out to be something really simple and inexpensive. He repaired it with a brand new line, we paid, and he left within a half hour of us calling CityWide. Very professional, friendly, and efficient! Would definitely recommend CityWide for anyone's plumbing needs.
