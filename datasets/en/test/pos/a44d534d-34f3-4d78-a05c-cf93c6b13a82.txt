Let me start out by saying the baked ziti is the best i have ever had, and my mother is a first generation Italian American :0).  Major kudos on that recipe!  The wait staff is extremely attractive and friendly!  The owners are outstanding guys, you can tell that with in the first 5 seconds of talking to them.  The environment gives vegas sports bars a run for their money with the amount of TV's in the joint.  You walk in and are consumed by every live sporting event.  (thats a dream come true)  I live in scottsdale and will drive up every sunday to watch NFL games at Santisi!  Best sports bar hands down!  

Coors Light is my beer of choice and they have $2.75 16 oz aluminum pints and $10 buckets of 4!  GREAT DEAL!
