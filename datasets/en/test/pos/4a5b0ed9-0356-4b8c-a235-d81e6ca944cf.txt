This one will be short and sweet.

If you like a fun, clean, social, inexpensive, fun pool, great people, food, wi-fi, active , gym.. pretty much anything awesome , you will love your life here at Trillium!!

However if you hate finding a parking spot or finally finding a spot around ,what feels like , a mile away from your apt, you will not like it. 

But hands down , Trillium is the best , any location.
