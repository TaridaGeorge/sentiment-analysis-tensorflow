This is the second of two locations. The first in Tempe has been there for years. I was happy that they finally opened one closer to me. The food is simple pita wraps, beautiful salads, burgers, and pizza with many selections being vegetarian. The menu tends towards middle eastern, with nothing on the menu exceeding $8, this place is a steal for good cooking in a nice atmosphere and great service. There is a wine bar. It was packed on Saturday night. The place was hopping, and rather loud and high energy. I highly recommend it!
