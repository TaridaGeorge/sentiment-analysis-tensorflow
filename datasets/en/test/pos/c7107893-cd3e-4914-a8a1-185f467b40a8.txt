This lab is the very best, state of the art! Very efficient, professional and friendly staff, technicians and doctors. I had a lump I was worried about so they took extra pictures in that area and a doctor performed a sonogram and explained what we both watched on the monitor. I had peace of mind instantly. They really understand your stress! And there was no waiting for both procedures, the mammogram or the sonogram. I also had my bone density test in the same appointment and the tech gave me the results right then with advice about vitamins. The whole experience was fast, relaxed and painless. The best of the best. I felt so happy when I left because I didn't have to wait for a phone call and was treated with TLC.
