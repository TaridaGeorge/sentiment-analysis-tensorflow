Personal 8 inch pies starting at six bucks baked and served within 10 minutes of ordering?  What could be better than that?

I know - that they're simply delicious!  They must've raided the best produce from every farmer's market in the Valley to get that earthy musty tang into their fungi variety and garlicky tomatoey basily frisson in their margharita-like variety.  That was all I could eat the first time last night on Roosevelt Row.

I've gotta get on their list - so I can eat my way through all their mouth watering fare!
