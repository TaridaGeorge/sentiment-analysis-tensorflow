I went here with friends who were regulars there, and I'm so happy that they introduced me to this restaurant! The service was great, the atmosphere was comfortable, and the food was out of this world! For an appetizer we got these "make your own springroll" type of dish, which was tasty, and the egg rolls were tasty as well. For my main dish I had something that consisted of veggies, shrimp, pork, and crunchy noodles. Delicious! All the food was fresh and fabulously cooked. If you are looking for traditional, high-quality Vietnamese food, go to Pho Thanh! 

**and ask if they will start staying open later, maybe if enough customers ask, they'll extend their hours till 10 pm :)
