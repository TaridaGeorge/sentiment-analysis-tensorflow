Oh The Pasty, how I love thee, let me count the ways!  I have never, not once been disappointed.  If you've never had a pasty, I would tell you that you need to go.  I really like the atmosphere, the church pews as seats and the alcohol bottles as candle holders are awesome.  I would say that the staff seem like hipsters, but they're all really friendly and helpful.  They have pretty good drink specials, and their hibiscus tea is mighty tastey!

PS.  Their vegetarian menu is LONG, and like I said, it's all good!  I think my favorites are The Greek and the Eggplant Parm.
