This is one of my new favorite downtown lunch places!  Sandwiches are made fresh and the place has a HUGE variey!  Every sandwich is paired with a little chocolate chip cookie which is also delicious.

I had the Michaelangeo - an off the menu special that my co-worker recommended.  Soft bagguette with grilled chicken, sauteed mushrooms, cheese and fresh spinach with a creamy balsamic dressing.  The sandwich was slightly warm with a combination of fresh toppings.  So yummy!
