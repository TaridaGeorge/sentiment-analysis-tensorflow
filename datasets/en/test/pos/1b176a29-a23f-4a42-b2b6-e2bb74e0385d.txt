I was posting another review and came across a rather poor review for Brio.  I have been here about 6 times, but have never ordered a real meal.  We are more of the order 6 appetizers and drink a bottle of wine crowd, so I can really only comment on the service, apps, and wine.  Service has ALWAYS been great.  Never had an issue, or a wrong order, anything like that.  Everyone has always been friendly and competent.  The wine list is very good, and I am a wine snob.  Always served at the correct temperature, and nice selection.  The appetizers have always been really good - we especially like the seared scallops, gorgonzola lamb chops, beef carpaccio, and the lobster bisque soup!  Don't let the mediocre reviews here scare you away from trying it... pick a nice night and sit outside on the patio!!
