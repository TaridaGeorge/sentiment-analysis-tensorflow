I LOVE THE SUSHI HERE!  I've eaten here MANY times and I've never had a bad roll!  Their rolls are large compared to local restaurants- always a plus!  Drink menu is so-so.  Decor is fun... orange can be a tad too much sometimes.  I LOVE sitting outside and people watching.  A definite stop if you're in the area.
