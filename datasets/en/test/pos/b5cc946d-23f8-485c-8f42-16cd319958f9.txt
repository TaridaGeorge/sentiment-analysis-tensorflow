This place is so good I honestly am at a loss for words.  They literally have the best Cheese steak I have ever had.  I highly recommend stopping by for lunch sometime.  The portions are huge so bring your appetite. They have parking in the back so don't be intimidated if you don't see parking when you first drive by.
