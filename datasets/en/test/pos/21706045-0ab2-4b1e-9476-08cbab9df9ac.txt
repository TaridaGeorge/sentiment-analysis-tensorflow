My first yelp review! The food here is always consistent. It's nothing crazy, just good pizza joint fair done right. Great service. Delivery times are always pretty good and prices are pretty fair considering they're so much better than the rest of the pizza places in the area. I order from them once or twice a week so I figured they deserved a nice review from me
