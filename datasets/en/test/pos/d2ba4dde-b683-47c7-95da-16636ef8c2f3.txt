Great food & outstanding service. I love, love love the Crab cake sandwich, the Hong Kong and Fattoush salads.

The servers are friendly, helpful & knowledgeable. I am usually fortunate enough to have Lisa as my server, & let me tell you they don't come any better than her.

It has become my go to place!!!
