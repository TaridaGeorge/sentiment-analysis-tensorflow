Palatte makes me want to live in central Phoenix - I'd be a regular!  I've enjoyed breakfast a couple of times and am looking forward to a First Friday wine and cheese evening at Palatte.

The lemon cream french toast with a side from the smokehouse selection was incredible -- and the portions large enough for my midwestern brother-in-law! The egg with roasted grape tomatoes on a puff pastry was equally delicious - the pastry was very light and tasty.

Palatte was previously Tara's garden, a lovely plant nursery, and I was so sorry to see it close, but delighted when it came to life again as Palatte.  The patio area has remnants of Tara's garden - plenty of trees and plants to enjoy.
