I love good waitresses, and The Farmhouse has the best I've ever seen. Our group of six had special orders...the waitresses even brought our babies food a full 10 minutes before ours, a thoughtful gesture indeed. Food is amazing, I guess you can't give a better compliment than that. Bring an extra artery or two, you'll need it :)
