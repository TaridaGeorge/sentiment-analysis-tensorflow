I hired Phoenix based Creative Environments to help me upgrade my backyard landscaping. They designed a beautiful landscape with space for a custom barbeque and firepit. Oscar, my designer, was great at listening to my needs and coming back with something that truly wow'd me. I love the work. I love that they show up on time and do what they say they'll do. I can't recommend them enough. I love my backyard now and get lots of positive comments about how great it looks and feels.
