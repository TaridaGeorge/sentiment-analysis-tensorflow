Fancy pants meets working class watering hole.  I've visited this spot a few times via friend recommendation on the food.  

Pork belly is amazing, shrimp pasta is surprisingly creamy and flavored with garlic and deliciousness.  Mussels are to die for!  

What really got me about CPH is the gathering of every day people just wanting to enjoy a drink.  If you're in the service industry this bar will be a second home for you!  In spite of it's romantic feel, candle lit tables and linen tablecloths; you will feel right at home with the friendliest bartenders in Old Town.  

Not pretentious but could be if it wanted to.
