Pretty laid back chill spot. Ipads an video games for customers in a lounge area overlooking a view of a litte lake. But i forgot to talk about the best part, the yogurt. Soooo many flavors and twice as many toppings. I went with the strawberry mixed with red velvet an new york cheesecake. Toss on some fresh strawberries an kiwi. Toss on some walnuts an almonds an your good to go. I'll definitely be back.
