The Staff was friendly, helpful,  and informative and the museum itself was clean.  We went yesterday and had a blast.  The food in the cafeteria was actually good and reasonably priced.  The only downside is that it is VERY EXPENSIVE.  Your admission fee doesn't cover an special exhibits or shows so be prepared to spend big bucks.
