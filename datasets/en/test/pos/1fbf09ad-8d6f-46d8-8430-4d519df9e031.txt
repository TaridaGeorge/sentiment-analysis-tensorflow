This is one of my very favorite stores in the Valley!  The first thing I always do, is make my way to the back to the grocery section.  They've got foods from all over the world (that you won't find at TJ's or AJ's) and delicacies that take me back to my travels.
Next, I do the wall decor.  I've gotten some really cool iron hangings for my living room.  
Next, the furniture!  I have been shopping for bedroom furniture for 2 months and I always make my way to Cost Plus World Market.  The prices are REALLY reasonable (and it's real wood!) and they have a delivery option.  
I call the style of this store "funky urban".  I prefer it over Pier 1.
