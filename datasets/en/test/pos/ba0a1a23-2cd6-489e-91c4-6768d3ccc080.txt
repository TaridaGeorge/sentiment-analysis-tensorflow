We went here last Wednesday and it was delicious as always. All day Wednesday is "Tiki Time" meaning, Happy Hour prices on apps and drinks. I had the luau pork sandwich which the menus calls "heaven on a bun". The meat is cooked perfect, the bun is soft with a little bit of sweetness and the coleslaw is a great compliment.
My husband had the steak tacos which he said had great flavor. The patio is awesome and has a fun urban feel. You can see the light rail go by while hearing the bells chiming from St Francis church next door. This is definitely a restaurant to put in your regular rotation!
