Stayed here twice, once on a visit and the next time when I moved to Scottsdale and was waiting to move into the condo. From the valet to the desk staff everyone was really nice and it seemed as if they loved their job. The room was spacious, clean and comfortable. When I ordered room service, it showed up sooner than they said and it was really good. I highly recommend staying here when in Scottsdale.
