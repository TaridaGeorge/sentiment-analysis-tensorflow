Often a go-to for us as it's right off of the light rail. Great for brunch and dinner. They have a great patio and awesome fries. The sangria is delicious, mildly sweet and generously poured. Monday nights is usually bumpin with their burger special. The tuna salad and the salmon burger ($14?!) are awesome and while I'm more of a vodka drinker, my love enjoys the wine of the month; get the punch card!
