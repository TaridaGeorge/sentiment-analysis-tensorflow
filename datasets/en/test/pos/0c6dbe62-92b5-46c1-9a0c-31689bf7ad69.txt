3 DOLLAR CAR BOMBS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! oh i wish i live in AZ right now.....

when we first got there and i saw the outside of the place i was like 'really..........?' don't get fooled by the apparence! step in and you will not regret!!!! 

we shared a carne adovada, lovely bit a salmon, cheese steak, and chicken tikka masala... oh they are ALL soooooo good!!! (my favorite would be the carne adovada and the chicken masala!!!!!)

the banoffee pie was a prefect ending to our meal.... & another car bomb! oh i wish i live in AZ again!!!!!!!!
