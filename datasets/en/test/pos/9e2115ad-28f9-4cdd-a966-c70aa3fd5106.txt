People who wine and dine at Mcdonald's get a bad rap. Why? Because people who don't dine at Mcdonald's aren't living and are therefore jealous. The truth is only about 20 percent of the population can full unlock the euphoria tunneled away in every bite. We are higher spirits of a different breed than the everyday jealous Mcdonald hater. "Why you hatin" was perhaps invented to suit the likes of these people. For me and my intricate complex neurology, I realize what Mcdonald is was and will always be. That is perfection. It's only because we share this trait in common that we understand eachother. 

Love you Mcdonalds,

One of your equals
