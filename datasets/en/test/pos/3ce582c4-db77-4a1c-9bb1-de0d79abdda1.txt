Amazing, amazing, amazing.
Everything was awesome and totally vegan. I even got my meat loving boyfriend to admit it was great and that is really saying something.
Does anyone know what they use for the beef substitute? Its some kind of mushroom based thing, but if anyone knows how to make something similar I will love you forever!
