I ate here three times in a week...

That's how much I love this place.  I get the regular gyro, and I cant tell you enough how delicious the food is here. 

It's a small little shop across the parking lot from Pure Fitness.  If you dont look for it, you can miss it.  

I havent tried other foods, but what i have eaten, has been amazing.  Im sure I will go here again this week and look forward to maybe something new.
