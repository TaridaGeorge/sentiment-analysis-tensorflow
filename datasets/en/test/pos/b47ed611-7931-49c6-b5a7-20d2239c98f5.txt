These guys are great! I was originally going to take my truck over to Danny's carousel for a wash and oil change because I live around the corner, but I've heard some shady things about that place so I decided against it. Ended up getting a wash at Lindstrom and found Hi-Tech on Yelp for an oil change. The service was outstanding, the guy who helped me didn't try to over sell me on a bunch of crap I don't need, and he got me in without an appointment because it wasn't too busy on a Thursday afternoon. Was in and out within 30 mins, not bad! I'll definitely be back for future changes.
