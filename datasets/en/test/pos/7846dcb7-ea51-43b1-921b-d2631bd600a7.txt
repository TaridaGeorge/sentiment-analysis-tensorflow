This is my favorite place for gelato because of its authenticity. The gelato is rich and creamy. Hazelnut is one of my favorites but it is not always available.
The fruit gelato is also delicious. The lemon and raspberry are incredibly refreshing for a hot  summer day. The vesuvio flavor is not to be missed.

The only criticism I have is that parking is difficult. The lot is shared with La Grande Orange and is often crowded.
