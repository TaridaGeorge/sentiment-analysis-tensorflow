I was wandering around downtown Scottsdale yesterday in desperate need of a manicure and felt so lucky that Bernadette was able to fit me in last minute. She really took her time and did a careful job on my nails. She's also incredibly sweet and fun to talk to.  

She has a small studio and it's just her so definitely call ahead to make an appointment or see if she can fit you in. 

Overall an extremely pleasant experience and would highly recommend!
