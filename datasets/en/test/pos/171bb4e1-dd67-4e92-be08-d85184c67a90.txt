BBQ is one of my favorites and Stacy's is one of the best that I have had in Phoenix.  I have driven by Stacy's many times and never would have thought to stop in until today when a friend suggested that we meet there for lunch.  I regret that I never stopped in sooner.   

This is a real BBQ shack!  Stacy the proprietor is a character and a great cook. I had the BBQ brisket and hotlinks along with homemade coleslaw.  The brisket was tasty and tender.  The hotlinks where char grilled and smothered in bbq sauce.   

If you are a BBQ fan Stacy's is a must!!!!
