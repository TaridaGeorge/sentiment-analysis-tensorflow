First time - I'll go back!
Price - actually, not that bad.  Where can you go in N. Scottsdale and find something for less than $10, specifically for lunch?
Portion - definitely decent!!!

I ordered the lunches online and there were substitutions, which they took no note of, but the gal was very sweet and brought the correct salad to my office.

Try going around the corner to Fox Sport's Grill, where you'll pay $14 for a salad and definitely less than 1/10 as good as Tossed...
