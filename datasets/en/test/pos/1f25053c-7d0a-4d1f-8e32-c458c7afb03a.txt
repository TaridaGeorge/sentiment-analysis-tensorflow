I cannot say enough great things about Inmans!!!  Jay and Jeff are always super helpful and patient with me.  I am a girl and I know nothing about cars.  I just want my car to work well and Inmans takes care of me every time.  They will pick you up and drop you off, which is heavensent amidst the whole inconvenient car trouble times in your life.  Their lobby is clean and spacious.  Their bathroom is girl friendly.  Yes, these are things I take into consideration with a mechanic!  Their prices may be a little higher than your greasy, dirty, scary joint on the corner....but I would pay a few more bucks for Inmans service any day!
