This is the closest TJ's to me. The people are always friendly as usual with allTrader Joes stores. I regularly go on Sunday nights super busy, I buy the pre-made salads for my weekday lunches. I am a vegetarian so my favorites are Greek, Shrimp and southwest Yummy!

Wine lovers go here for great deals on good wine, Some of my favorites I can only get here, organic Well Red, Zarafa Pinotage, the Sangiovese  for under 3 bucks. cant be em. 

Frozen veggies are a good deal and the meatless meatballs soo good with spaghetti squash and or just plain BBQ sauce. 

Also buy the hummus Eggplant or roasted red pepper.

Produce is a little pricy. so I buy elsewhere like Sprouts or Sunflower. 

Cant go wrong with free samples and wine tastings daily.
