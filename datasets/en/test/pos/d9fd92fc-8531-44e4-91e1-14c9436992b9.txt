We have been patronizing this place for about 10 years now and never had a bad experience! We go at least 3 times a month, so it's not luck at all.
Generous portions, consistent flavor and ingredients along with fast service are the reason why we keep going back.
Highly recommend the shrimp fried rice, war wonton soup and crab puffs.
