Great used bookstore to pick up magazines (lots of current issues), craft books (I'm always trying something new), books for the toddler and kids DVDs (there's a point where the library demands their Disney DVDs back and you have to buy your own to satiate the toddler's appetite).  My only desire is that they were a little closer but c'est la vie!
