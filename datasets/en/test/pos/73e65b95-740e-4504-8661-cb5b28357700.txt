Such a cute place with awesome food and service.  

I went here for lunch with my mom and it was a great experience.  We were warmly and enthusiastically greeted, and the boy working was more than happy to fully explain how the menu worked and any item on the menu.  
We played some cards while we waited, and every person working there seemed to be upbeat and happy.
Food was great and there was a TON of it.  So yummy.  I'll be ordering takeout soon I think.
