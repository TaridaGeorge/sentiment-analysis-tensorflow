Been out of town for the summer but seems like they have added a new addition of staffs. But the service was wonderful still. The food is great as always especially my favorite firecracker shrimp and my garlice noodles. To die for. You can actually make a meal out of this. And was the spicy Asian yummy as always. Thank you for staying in business as this area still needs restaurants like yours. Excellent job as always.
