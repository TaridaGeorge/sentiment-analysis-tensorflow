My best friend and I came here for dinner one night during the week. It was not too crowded. The cashier gave recommendations for pizzas and salads. They talked us into the combo for two which included a shared pizza and salad and two glasses of wine. It was the perfect portion and the pairing was perfect. 

They could easily get away with higher prices because the quality of food is that amazing. 

The location is perfect too because it is just outside the mall so you can  hit up the mall first then satisfy your hunger at Sauce afterward. I can't wait to go again.
