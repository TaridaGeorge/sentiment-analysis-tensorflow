This is one of my favorite cafes for lunch.  It is one of the few places that serves up homemade soups and creative entree salads daily.  Casual and totally reasonable prices.  The fresh bakes goodies are wonderful, as is the selection of ice tea made from high quality local tea company Revolution Tea.
