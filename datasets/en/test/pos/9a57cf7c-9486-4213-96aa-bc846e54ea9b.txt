This bar is great!  The people vary. There are ages 21-60 on the bar side and families an kids on the restaurant side.   

They have an internet jukebox though it's overpriced :(  and too many people play crap. TONS of rap!

Food is great and drinks are good! I love the wings there. The chicken strips are great too!  yummy!

Lots of cute guys and girls to look at! The atmosphere is pretty cool so people don't tend to get pissy if you talk to them! 

It's so fun to watch the UFC fights and its the best when Suns are in playoffs but they play all sporting events.
