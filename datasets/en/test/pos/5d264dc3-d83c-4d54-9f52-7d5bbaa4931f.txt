Well ended up at Little Saigon on Sat. night too and again great service and wonderful food. I am always affraid to try new things but I have trusted John's (the server) suggestions and loved them. I noticed going to this place it almost feels like going to visit with family the staff is so nice and even the people that go in there have been really nice. It was packed saturday when we went and there were so many different types of people and I still felt that warm welcoming feeling. I really like this place a lot and so does my family. I wanted to go agin tonight but I didn't want them to think I was stalking the place lol. So if you are ever in the area check this place out it is the bomb!
