This place just keeps getting better. This week , I finally ordered a non pho dish & it was AMAZING. I ordered from the vegetarian section of the menu, I forgot the name of the dish but it is the only one with WIDE noodles that is in the veggie section. OMG......this place rocks. The owners & staff are so nice too!!! Wish I lived closer.
