A favorite of ours when we're up around North Phoenix.  We love the dry-rubbed-wood-smoked-tender barbeque meats!  For my hubby and father-in-law, myself and my son, we always order the Hog Heaven.  It is really enough or all of us!  You get 2 choices of meats and 2 choices of pit ribs with 3 sides for $36 dollars !  We get a few extra order of corn bread. The meat on the ribs literally fall off the bones and the brisket is soooo tender!  They have a KIDS MEAL menu, but my son loves the baby back ribs with the sweet barbecue sauce.  It really is the best in the valley that we have tried so far.  Dillon's comes a close second, in my opinion.
