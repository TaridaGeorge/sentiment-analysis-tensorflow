If you're in the Internet marketing space like me, then Kelly Warner is the place to go.  It's amazing how much they know about the industry and how available they are.  I have my contact there on Skype and he hits me back quickly every single time I message him.  And this is not a paralegal either -- it is the actual attorney.  He is also available by personal cell for questions or concerns I have.  Honestly, this is the only law firm I have actually enjoyed dealing with.  Good people.  Killer lawyers.  And awesome service.
