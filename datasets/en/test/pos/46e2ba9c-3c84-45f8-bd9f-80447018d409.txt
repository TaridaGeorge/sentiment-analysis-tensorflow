I go here for lunch all of the time!  I LOVE the lemongrass tofu, the thai iced tea is delicious and I have heard that the shrimp is amazing.  I don't know, because I have never tried anything except for the tofu, it is delicious, i just can't break away. 

What really makes this place great for lunch is that it is cheap and quick. This place gets two thumbs up from me!
