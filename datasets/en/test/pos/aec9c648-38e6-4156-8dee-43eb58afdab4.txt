I've always passed this place for a couple years, and always told myself to give it a try sometime. So couple years later I finally tried it, and boy did I wish I tried this place earlier. I have become addicted to this place. I got atleast twice a week before I head off to school. Taylor Ham, egg and cheese on asiago cheese bagel that all I get and its perfect. Bagels have ton of flavor and terrific texture. Staff is very friendly.
