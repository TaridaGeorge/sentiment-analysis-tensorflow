Five stars for Cornish Pasty -- for being something a little different, for having tasty food AND for having about a dozen choices for us vegetarians. I LOVE that this place offers their pasties with Quorn (fake chicken). I've had both the Veggie Rosemary Chicken and the Veggie Tikka Masala with it and they are both awesome.
Yes, it's loud, sometimes it's dirty and sometimes the service is slow -- but I'll gladly put up with that for a taste of their pasties.
Also, Cornish Pasty is a great place to take out-of-towners -- they love it!
