Haus Murphy's has the best authentic german food in the valley! There is anything on the menu I wouldn't try.

My husband and I shared the Bauernplatte which is a combo plate for 2.  It is a variety of dinners on a huge platter.  DELICIOUS!!!

They have a great assortment of German beers for a very good price ($11 for a Liter... LITER!!!)

Prices are very reasonable.

We will defiantely be going back!
