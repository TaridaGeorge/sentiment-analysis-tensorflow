It gets a bit busy on the weekend evenings but that is primarily a testament to the fact that this place is really good. Good in-house brewed beer and good food. Can't ask for much more. Service is generally pretty good, but on occasion it can miss. When sitting at the bar I'm a huge fan of Kim. No matter how busy it is she always seems to be attentive and will eventually get you whatever you need. She's there when you feel like some of the others might not be paying attention to you. Kim is awesome!
