I absolutely love this place! Down Under Wines is a fantastic place and very unique.  Besides there unique menu selection, their wine selection is based on type, not brand, so you'll always find a favorite flavor or something new and tantalizing! I always have a great time there either by myself or with friends.  It's the best of both hemispheres :)
