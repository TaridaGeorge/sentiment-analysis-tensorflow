Dr. Adriana Holy is the best Dermatologist I have ever been to. I was diagnosed with Melanoma at age 28 and 31, frightening! Dr. Holy is thorough, professional, kind and caring. Many of the dermatologist I have gone to (before meeting Dr. Holy) were more concerned with selling you Botox or the latest facial rejuvenation fad. Dr. Holy cares about Skin Cancer and the only way to be sure is to biopsy a questionable mole.  So ugly scar for a mole that was questionable - too bad - I've had real scars from my melanoma surgeries, but I am alive today at 50. Please take off and biopsy any mole in question - You will be alive! If you want a Med Spa then go there.
