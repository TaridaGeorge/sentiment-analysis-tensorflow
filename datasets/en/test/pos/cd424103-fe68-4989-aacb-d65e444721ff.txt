Yes, outstanding BBQ but that was expected.   The big surprise was the gourmet hand.... We absolutely fell in love with the appetizer of stuffed peppers!  A beautifully roasted pepper stuffed with chicken, layered with cheese and topped with an elegant (yes, elegant) slightly smoky tomatoe sauce.... Go!  You will return.
