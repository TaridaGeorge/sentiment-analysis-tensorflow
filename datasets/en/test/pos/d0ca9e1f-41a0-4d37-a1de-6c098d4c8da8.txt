Thanks so much to Kelly @ Butter & Me for an amazing birthday cake! I am from out of state and found Butter & Me online as I was trying to find a bakery to order a cake for my mom. I can't thank them enough for being super responsive and accomodating. Not to mention the cake was delish! I took the business card and passed it along to my Aunt who lives in Scottsdale and she'll be using them in the future. You guys were amazing!! Can't thank you enough!
