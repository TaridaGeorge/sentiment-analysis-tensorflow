Yup...5 stars. It's not a fancy place..it's a hole in the wall, down-home type of breakfast and lunch place. First time there with my regular Sunday breakfast buddy, the coffee princess. We didn't dig the coffee, but everything else...WOW...Their walnut cinnamon roll won first prize at the state fair and was well deserving. Scrambled eggs with cheese and knock your socks off hot sauce?? yes..PLEASE! We'll be back.

Be sure to bring your glasses or contacts though. Much of the menu is written on sheets on the walls, nice touch, but if you've got a case of the morning groggy's, you might have trouble seeing them from afar.
