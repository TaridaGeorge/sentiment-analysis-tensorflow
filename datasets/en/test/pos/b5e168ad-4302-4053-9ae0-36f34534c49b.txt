The most FANTASTIC pizza I have ever had the opportunity to enjoy. I have tried three of their pies and I am currently on a mission to try all of them and still remain thin, it may be hard because every time I am there I stuff my face!

My favorite out of the three that I have tried (The Super Six, Get Meaty and the Chicago) has to be the super six with get meaty coming in second just because I need a little green on my pizza. 

Staff is friendly and quick and the place has a great clean homey vibe. The location is a little hard to find because they are hidden away but it is so worth looking for!
