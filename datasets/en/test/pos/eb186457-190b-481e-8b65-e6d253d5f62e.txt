Great restaurant/bar. Lots of their own brews. Great beer selection. They even had a cider for me! I'm not a huge fan of beer, but cider beer is great! Everyone at my table seemed to like the beers that they had. I came with party of 10-12 people and they were able to get us a table. We went on a Tuesday and they had happy hour until 6 p.m. They weren't offering any food specials. But, they had specials on pitchers of beer. 

I ordered the fish and chips. It was three huge pieces of Mahi and fries. Delicious, but too much for me to eat. The flatbread pizzas looked delicious. I definitely want to go back again and maybe try one of their flavored beers and a pizza. :)
