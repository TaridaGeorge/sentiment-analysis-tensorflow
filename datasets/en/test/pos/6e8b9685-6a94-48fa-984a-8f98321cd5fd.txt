I freakin love Costco! Since moving to this area over 2 years ago, I am very familiar with this location. My mom & I come here once every 2-3 months & stock up. They have an awesome meat selection! Love getting toilet paper & paper towels in bulk, as well as any cleaning supplies or personal hygiene items. Usually always get water bottles & a case of Dr. Pepper too. The alcohol is a bit cheaper as well so whenever we have a party or get-together we stop by Costco for the booze & sandwich trays/pizza. It's so hard not to spend a ton here though, yesterday we walked out with a $350 total! SOOO worth it though.
