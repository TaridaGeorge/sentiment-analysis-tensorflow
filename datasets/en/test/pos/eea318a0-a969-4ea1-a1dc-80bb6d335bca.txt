Zen.  Built into the Mountain, this resort is as unique as it gets.  Huge rooms with beautiful interiors.  This resort is twice removed from the noise and bustle of Scottsdale.  With mutiple pools on the property and winding layout, you will need to utilize the golf cart service provided.  Ask to be seated with a view in the restaurant at lunchtime, you wont regret it!  Cozy up to the firepit on a cool desert night in the bar area and learn to relax when you visit the Sanctuary on Camelback, its impossible not to!
