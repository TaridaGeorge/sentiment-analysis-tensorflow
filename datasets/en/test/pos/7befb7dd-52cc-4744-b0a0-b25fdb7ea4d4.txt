Definitely a 5 star restaurant!

The food, the service, the atmosphere - all great!

I've been eating at Bandera since they opened so when we had out of town guests, this was the first restaurant we thought of to bring our guests.

They did not disappoint! 

The grilled artichokes are wonderful! And if you're indecisive like me and can never decide what to order... don't worry, whatever you order will be great.

They don't accept reservations so head there early on weekends as they will get pretty busy.
