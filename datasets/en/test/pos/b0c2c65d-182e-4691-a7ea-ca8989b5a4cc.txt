I haven't washed my dogs here, but I buy our pet food here.  The owners and staff are super nice, and they have a frequent buyer program.  There are a handful of items they don't carry (like specialty Greyhound coats), but I haven't seen a store yet (except on-line) that does.  Don't be dismayed at the huge, fat cats (they self-feed from the bags).  They might hiss at your overexuberent dogs, but they don't scratch.
