I would say that Sprouts is one of the nicest grocery stores I have been in. When I say nice, I mean it's organized, clean and employees friendly people.
 Fifty percent of my shopping list is here, so I make the trip at least once a week. I would strongly suggest DOUBLE AD WEDNESDAY!!! Wonderful selection of Gluten Free products, organic produce and don't forget the beer and wine!
