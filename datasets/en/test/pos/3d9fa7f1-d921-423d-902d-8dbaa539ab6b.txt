Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels' the wise words of Kate Moss clearly this chick has not had a sprinkles chai tea cupcake. Well damn I too like to look good in a bikini however not a Friday goes by without me thinking about those sweet sweet chai cupcakes, only available this one day of the week . Perhaps it's the lack of availability that's got poor Kate thinking her bones look better than a chai cupcake. Please sprinkles do us all a factor and make all cupcakes ready to eat everyday!!! Or at least my chai!! I'm officially converted from Georgetown cupcakes red velvet!
