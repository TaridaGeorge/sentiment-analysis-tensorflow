I'm about to say something BIG! 
I have found the best pizza ever! Yep, that's right... 
*Mamma Spinato's "Signature" Fresh Spinach Pizza* 
(See Pic) 
I literally dream about this damn thing. It is heavy on the garlic so plan ahead. I can't even describe the flavor, but it is out of this world. I have only had the personal size, but I'm sure the bigger sizes are just as good if not better. 
I have come in here for lunch between meetings and sitting in the bar is a great spot to people watch.
This location also has a great private room for meetings, its actually quiet and they are hooking up the appropriate media. I WILL be booking meetings here just so I can have this pizza. 
Go try this pizza...TRUST ME!
