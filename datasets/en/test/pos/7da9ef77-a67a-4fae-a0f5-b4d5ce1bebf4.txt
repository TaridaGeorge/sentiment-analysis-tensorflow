The food was very good a 4 the service and wine were a 6 so I rate you a 5. I had prime rid med rare with extra fresh horseradish whoich is white folks soulfood. Great wine I think they have an award of recognition or some shennigans from the Spectator . BUT it was a graduation we had a grandmother doing a shot and the servers were fantastic
