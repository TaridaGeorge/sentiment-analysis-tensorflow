Two Words: HAPPY. HOUR.

Amazing cocktails are only $5 during Happy Hour - every day from 3-6pm. Arrive on the earlier end of Happy Hour to snag the best table before the crowds arrive. 

I love the atmosphere - trendy and classy, without pomp and circumstance. I have eaten there in jeans and a t-shirt, and also in a dress with heels (okay, I lied...I can't walk in heels..but you get the idea.). The staff is friendly and accommodating to special orders, and the Happy Hour also offers great deals on food. 

The menu is somewhat seasonal with some dishes staying consistent and some new additions every few months. Personally, I do wish they offered a few more vegetarian/vegan options, but it is still a great place for people of all dietary needs! 

Must Try: Fingerling Potatoes.
