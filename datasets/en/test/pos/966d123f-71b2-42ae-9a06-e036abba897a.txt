Very nice! I would say this is a boutique style Cuban/ Caribbean food restaurant. Something you'd find in a far more sophisticated city, like San Diego or even NYC. I really enjoyed the Drinks too, I would suggest the Babaloo Bul, it's an unsuspecting mix of sugar, red stripe and lime juice maybe, it's totally refreshing and was a surprise. I use to go to another place to get my Cuban Fix, but I have realized after all these years, that place wasn't so authentic. But this joint is! Good food, nice portions, definitely upscale but don't be afraid the food is down home and will make you feel good!  I'll go back for sure!
