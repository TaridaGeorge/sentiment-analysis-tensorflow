so good.

cocktails were strong. good wine list and i heard this from a wine snob so that says something.

it also made me a duck (i have had it several times, from the phoenician, biltmore, etc - never liked it, too greasy) convert.

the cheesecake, there is no words and i am a cheesecake snob, without the graham cracker crumb crust, i'd normally say no way. but, omg, literally, best cheesecake i have ever had.
