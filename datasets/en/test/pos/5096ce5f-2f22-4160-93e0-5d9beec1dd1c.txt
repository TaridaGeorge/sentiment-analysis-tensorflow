The new Lux is amazing! In addition to the aspects that haven't changed, like serving the best espresso in the Valley combined with one-of-a-kind baked goods and the best quiche I've ever had (in the mornings), Lux has a brand new space and now serves dinner, wine, bottled beer and some pretty amazing cocktails from scratch (my margarita was made with egg whites!).

The other thing that hasn't changed is the friendliness of the staff and the welcoming atmosphere.  Lux feels a lot like home to me, only the food is better than anything I've got in my fridge and the people give me something really interesting to get distracted by!
