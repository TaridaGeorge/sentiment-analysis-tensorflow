I am dropping in for a couple weeks of classes & love this place; clean, large studio, women's dressing room has free lockers with keys to lock your purse up while you're in class, free parking in structure next to building, nice retail space w/ funky tee shirts and all kinds of yoga stuff, pleasant & helpful staff.  I go mainly to Julie & Ryan's noontime Vinyasa classes, but there are many other classes to try.  Highly recommended!
