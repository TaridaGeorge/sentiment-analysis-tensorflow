I have been using Hi-tech Car Care for years.  I have a fleet of company trucks and they do professional work and back their workmanship up and only install parts that also back themselves up.  I love their maintenance program the best since they will help me out by dropping me off while they service my personal truck.   They have done so much work over the years for me from just a simple oil change to replacing a motor on one of my trucks (which I still use today).  The motor even came with a 100k mile warranty!  I especially like to use Hi-tech when I go out of town, they dropped me off at the airport while doing a 50k mile service on my personal truck and then picked me up days later.  I cant think of a better customer service auto service group.
