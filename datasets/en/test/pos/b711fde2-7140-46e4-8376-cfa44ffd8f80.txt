This place  is great! I had my car looked at by Midas because my car was shaking. They told me it was because my shocks and struts were bad. I was told by a friend that this would mostly likely not be the reason. I took my car here for a second opinion. They told me there was nothing wrong with my shocks or struts I just needed some tires. They were honest and helpful. What more can you ask for! I will take my car here form this point on.
