A chain of hot dog restaurants based in Buffalo, New York. Founded in 1927 by Greek immigrant Theodore Spiro Liaros. Leave it to a Greek to build a chain that yelps praise with their highest accolade.

I am lunching on Teds signature footlong, fries and a coke. 7.5  And as I'm standing there John Belushi comes in to my mind shouting "cheeborger, cheeborger, cheeborger no pepsi coke."

Anyway they served up a delicious dog and fries today. Plus I got to read Teds hometown, Buffalo N.Y. newspaper. The Buffalo Bills are 2nd in the AFC East 4 wins 2 losses .667 3-0 at home 1-2 on the road.

Ted's is a must if you enjoy a charcoal grilled hot dog.
