The PV is the ultimate dive bar. It should get some sort of national award. It has the most lewd and original bathroom graffiti in the world. There's holes in the walls and the ceiling. There's always something unexpected on the TV. The last time I was there I was watching Titanic with subtitles and drinking double shots of absinthe. The drinks are made so stiff that if you drink more than 20 dollars worth you'll be dead. Avoid the scene certain nights. That one guy who walks around squawking like a parrot will probably get on your nerves. Sometimes hardcore bands take over and play so loud your ears might start bleeding.
