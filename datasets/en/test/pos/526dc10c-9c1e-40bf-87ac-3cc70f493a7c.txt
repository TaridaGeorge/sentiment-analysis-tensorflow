After our 6-year-old cat had to be rushed to the vet with a urinary blockage earlier this year, we went online and did some research about the best type of cat foods. Wag N' Wash is one of the few places that carries organic, natural foods for dogs and cats. Our two cats eat nothing but Wellness Brand organic food now and they have never been happier and their fur has never felt so soft.

We recently got a labrador/shepherd puppy for our children and our first stop on the way home from the pound was at Wag N' Wash to get dogfood and treats.

With two cats and a dog, we're buying food every few weeks. The people at Wag N' Wash are among the nicest I've ever met and always happy to answer a question or take the time to make sure you have everything you need.
