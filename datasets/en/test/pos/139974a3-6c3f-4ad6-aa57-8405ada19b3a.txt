Love this place!  The chocolate croissants are to die for!  I've eaten there for breakfast twice and had the croque madam and the crepes.  Both were delicious.  It can get super busy inside and there are only so many places to sit so beware for that.  The service can be slow at times, but it's definitely worth it.  Will be back.
