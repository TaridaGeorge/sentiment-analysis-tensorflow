Just got back from picking up my snowboard from the repair shop in the mesa location and i gotta say what  a thurough job. The Shoppe guys were very professional and gave me a straight answere to what my board needed tune wise. I ended up waiting in store for the work to be done and had more excelent service. I was looking for a pov camera since all my friends have one and after talking to several different employees I ended up buying a Gopro and some accessories. Then when i went back to pick up my board from the shoppe I couldn't believe how good it came out it looked brand new. Good job Ski Pro you guys just earned a new life customer at least as long as i live in Az.
