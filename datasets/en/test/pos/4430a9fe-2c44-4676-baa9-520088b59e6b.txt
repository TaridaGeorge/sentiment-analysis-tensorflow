Love this place. My hubby and I used to go here every other Sat. The machines are clean and theres *plenty* of them. The staff is super nice. Go there enough and itll be your "Cheers" of laundromats.

Honestly, the only reason we stopped going here is because the machones at our complex were a bit cheaper and we didnt have to load our laundry into the car. Ive sense noticed a decline in our machines, so we may be going back to Eco soon!
