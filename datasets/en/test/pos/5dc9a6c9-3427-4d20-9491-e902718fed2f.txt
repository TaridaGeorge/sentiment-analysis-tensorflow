Went here today for lunch and it EXCEEDED my expectations! We had egg rolls and spring rolls to start and they were perfect! I ordered #22 and was totally blown away by it. Not only did the food taste wonderful, but the chefs have excellent presentation of their dishes. This is one of my top 3 restaurants now of all time.

The atmosphere is modern and sort of "zen-like" - they did a great job with colors, lighting, etc. Love the wall waterfall too!

I will go back here again and again and will be sure to take out-of-town guests here. Love it!
