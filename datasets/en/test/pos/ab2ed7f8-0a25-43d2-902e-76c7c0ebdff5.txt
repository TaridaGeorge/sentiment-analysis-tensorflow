Treehouse made my vegan birthday cake and I fell in love. Now I try to travel to their location every few weeks to try their goodies! Their cupcakes and moist, delicious and fresh! Their cookies and poptarts are to die for as well! I am in love with treehouse vegan goodies and crave them when my sweet tooth starts acting up! Also, many non-vegans ate my birthday cake and they loved it as well!
