Never a disappointment here! I will admit I haven't gone for some of the more "gourmet" flavors like anything with cheese or other savory ingredients. However, my summer favorites are a mix of any two fruity sorbets especially the melon or pineapple and the strawberry buttermilk when it's in the case. I recently went for a scoop of melon and a scoop of the lemon basil and it was the perfect treat after a miserably warm day. Some of my other favorites are the salted butter caramel and cinnamon. Don't forget the waffle cone with the surprise chocolate at the bottom! 

Only bummer is they don't use animal free gelatin. Oh well, I don't really need those delicious and pillow-y looking marshmallows anyway.
