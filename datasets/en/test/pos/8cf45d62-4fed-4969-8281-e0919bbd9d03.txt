My husband and I have been going to Fez for the last three years and it never disappoints us.  We love the happy hour and the chicken sliders.  The decor is modern and comfortable with two huge couches for groups of friend.  I highly recommend stopping by for drinks with friends or for a scrumptious dinner for two.
