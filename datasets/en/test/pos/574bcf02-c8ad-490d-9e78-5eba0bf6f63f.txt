Super cute little boutique nestled in the corner of Scottsdale Fashion Square. There are a lot of things to choose from, cute little blouses and dresses to unique jewelry and knick knacks. The service is also really great. I've been here a couple of times, each time, there are new items, which is great because chances are what you buy, not many others will have. The only thing is that I wished they had more things in size small, since the trend tends to run big/oversized with tops and dresses, I have trouble finding something I like that is actually available in my size. Or maybe things are just too cute that they go that fast here! It's also reasonably priced so two thumbs up =)
