if you are in Scottsdale & you dont have dinner at Posh you are missing out! Very creative chef's design your meal right in front of your eyes ( if you sit at the bar ). very memorable dinning experience, the owner JOSH HERBERT had a long talk with us & made us feel very welcome and at home. he explained how the menu works and what we should try! everything was beyond great, small portions but you try ALOT so you get full from a variety of creations verses eating alot of one thing. very romantic & great for celebratory dinners.
