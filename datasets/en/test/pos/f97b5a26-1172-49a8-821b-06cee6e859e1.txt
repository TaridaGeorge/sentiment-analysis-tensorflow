Quite simply, Beckett's Table gets it right. We had been looking forward to trying it after watching them work on the space for several months and finally had the chance to eat there on a busy Saturday night. Everything from the appetizer (grits and andouille sausage) to the entrees (short ribs and shepherd's pie) to the dessert (creme brulee) was excellent. Service is friendly and efficient and they have a nice wine selection. I really can't find anything that I dislike about Beckett's. It's simple, straightforward food at a good price and in a great space. We will be putting into our regular rotation in the neighborhood.
