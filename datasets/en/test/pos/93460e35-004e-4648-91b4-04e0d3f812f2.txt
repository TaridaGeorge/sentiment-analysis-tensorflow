I love this place. The service used to suck but their bigger space has really changed things. I LOVE the lentil fatoosh salad and the schwarma sandwich. SOOOO good. The tangy dressing in the salad is so amazing and the garlicy sauce on the sandwich is making my mouth water.  The chicken hummus is also awesome.
