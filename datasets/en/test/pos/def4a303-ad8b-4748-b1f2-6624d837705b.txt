Ants!  Ants!  Ants seemed to be everywhere!  I tried all the usual home remedies I could think of but for 3 days straight I would find a line of ants from the front door of my salon to a certain trash can located right under my tea station.  Not good, not good at all.  I called pretty late in the work world, around 7 pm but I was able to wrangle an appointment for the next morning.  The were able to squeeze me in around 10:30 and I haven't had a problem since.  They even gave me extra ant traps, no extra charge.  I will be using them again for all my spraying needs.  Thanks guys!
