Going to Cerreta's candy is more than just going to a candy store-- it's a whole experience-- filled with the wonders of factory belt chocolates racing in front of your eyes, tours being given over loudspeaker, and delightful chocolates wrapped in Arizona-themed boxes. 

I have to tell you that I felt like I was in an I love Lucy episode for the first few minutes (you, know, the one at the chocolate factory...). 

Eating the chocolates was just as good as the look of their origin promised. 

I urge everyone to visit and delight in this local landmark!
