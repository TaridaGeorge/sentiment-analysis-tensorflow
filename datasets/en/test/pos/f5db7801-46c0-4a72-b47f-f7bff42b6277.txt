An absolutely delightful French restaurant in the Old Town area of Scottsdale.  
Our YELP reservation got us an excellent table inside - while others were being seated outside on a rather warm summer evening.  Dinner was spot on - I had the steak; my wife had the fish option.  Desert was worth every calorie.  Definitely above-average dinning in a very competitive area.
