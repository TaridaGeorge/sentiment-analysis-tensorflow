YUM!

I was already a fan of the competitor MoJo, but after trying the red velvet cake flavor at Yogurtology I think I'm hooked. I know they change their flavors, but must they? Red velvet frozen yogurt with yogurt chips, chocolate chips, and fruit is DIVINE. 

Cute atmosphere, many flavors to choose from, and some unique and yummy-sounding toppings combined with a friendly and helpful staff.
