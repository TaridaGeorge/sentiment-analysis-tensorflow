I recently purchased custom cupcakes for my son's "bug-themed" birthday party from the Super Target bakery, and they were amazing! Not only were they delicious, but adorable as well (bees and ladybugs). The attention to detail was awesome, and I got so many compliments from my guests! To top it off, they were very afordable as well! I highly reccomend this bakery!
