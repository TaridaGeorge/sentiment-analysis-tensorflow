Recently moved to the area and needed an oil change. I'm pretty anal about my car especially since I'm paying a pretty penny for it. Figured the Acura dealer service would be the safest decision.

Immediately called the service desk and Dave picked up the phone. Got an appointment the next day and was treated very well.

The service center has TV and free WIFI not to mention a BEVY of yummy snacks (fruits, soda pop, coffee, cookies, chips)

I bought my computer and 1.5 hour flew by. My car was washed and vacuumed too!

I love my RDX and am glad my car will be in good hands here.
