The ice cream is unbelievable.  My wife can't get enough of the almond butter nut.  I have dabbled in a lot of different flavors, and have liked them all.  The Belgian Chocolate is a nice, rich chocolate flavor.  It does seem a little expensive, but the ice cream is worth it.  Plus, the green-belt path goes right next to it, so it is very walk/bike friendly.
