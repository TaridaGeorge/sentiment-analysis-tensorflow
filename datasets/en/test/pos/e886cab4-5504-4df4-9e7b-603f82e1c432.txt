hummm the smell going inside was already a prelude to the good dinner we were able to enjoy later. I came here to celebrate my mom2's birthday. We tried the thai hot pot and it was a good experience. We ordered portions for 2 persons and it is more than enough! 

Service is great, always smiley and ready to make you feel comfortable. A good place to return!
