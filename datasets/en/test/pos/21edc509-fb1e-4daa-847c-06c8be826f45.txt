Have lived here 7 years, moving back East in a month and just discovered Litchfield's (bar side). Friendly ladies behind the bar, nice drinks and delicious dinner right at the bar. The sweet corn soup is our favorite, along with the brown rice risotto -so savory with sweet potato and sweet corn and the steaks are delish. But the best part is Jay Soto - wonderful piano and smooth jazz artist plays Fri/Sat nites. Where can you find such world class delicious live smooth sounds but in Litchfield Park? How amazing and sorry we didn't discover this fact sooner. We've had two very enjoyable Friday evenings in a row here and will always remember this hidden gem and the fact we got to see a great artist in such a cozy venue.
