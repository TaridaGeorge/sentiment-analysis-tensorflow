Loooooooooooooooooooooooooooove Postino. I'm sure all East Valley peeps cheered with joy just like I did when I realized I wouldn't have to drive all the way to Arcadia or the downtown locations anymore! This Gilbert location has plenty of indoor and outdoor seating but my favorite spot to hang out in the restaurant is the couch. My friends and I will come here during our lunch break and have a lovely time here. Check out how many people that couch can hold:

Service is awesome, I even saw my dog trainer Jess servin' it up so I know they have a good crew there. 
Food is AMAZING-if you're into salads at all you HAVE to try the
----------------------------Raspberry Chicken 9.75------------------------------------
Organic chicken salad with pecans, apples, gorgonzola and mayo with raspberry vinaigrette over a bed of fresh greens

 -it's irresistible, just like the location. ;)
