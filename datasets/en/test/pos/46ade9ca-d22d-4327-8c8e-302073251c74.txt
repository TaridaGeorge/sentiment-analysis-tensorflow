I have not visited this restaurant in it's new location, but holy cannolis' their food is good!!  I have also purchased their food MANY times at the Phoenix Farmer's market.  I super highly recommend their salad with Italian dressing and Vegetable Lasagna with either the eggplant or zucchini.  This is no ordinary veggie lasagna!  I repeat: this is no ordinary veggie lasagna!  The veggies are sliced almost un-explainablly thin and taste as though they have been breaded even though they have not.  It's pure, delightful, Italian magic!  And don't even get me started on that red sauce.  I'm daydreaming about it right now.  Well, I gotta get out of my dreams and into my car and go order some ASAP.  Also:Eggplant Parmigiana YUM!
