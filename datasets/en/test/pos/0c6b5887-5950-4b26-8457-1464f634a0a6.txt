Vicky has been a real blessing for my skin. I originally went to her last winter for a Mani Pedi combo my girlfriends gave me for my birthday. I ended up getting the "Peel Deal" and my skin loves me for it. I can't tell you how much better I look thanks to her quick 30 minute sessions. She is always friendly, kind and very upbeat. You can't beat her pricing or her customer service.
