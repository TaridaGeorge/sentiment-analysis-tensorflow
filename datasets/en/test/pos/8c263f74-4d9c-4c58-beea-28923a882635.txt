I went here for lunch today and was really surprised at the reasonable prices $8-12 and the exceptional HEALTHY food.  I had the fish tacos which were really tasty and a small dessert.  Everything on the menu is under 475 calories.  They had hamburgers, ravioli, tacos, etc.  A lot of variety really.  They also had cute tasty desserts for under 250 calories i think?  Bottom line reasonably priced food that is healthy, cant go wrong.  A very swanky atmosphere too, made me feel important and all grown up :) he he.  They get a lot of old women and lawyers by the looks of the place.
