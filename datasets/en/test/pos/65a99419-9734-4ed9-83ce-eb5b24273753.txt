La Bocca has been one of my favorite restaurants for a while now. I can't get enough of their sangria, appetizers, or mint ice cream. Yum!

While I wouldn't say the Italian food is all that "authentic," it's certainly delicious. The wood-fired pizza certainly rivals its more expensive competitors. Although I admit I'll sometimes just order the appetizer sampler and goat cheese salad, (and a pitcher of sangria,) and I'll be set for the evening.  

The food is the main draw, but I have to say that the atmosphere is nice as well.  It's fairly trendy and the tables are candlelit--good for a date night or a classier alternative to a normal evening on Mill. 

I would definitely recommend La Bocca! Have fun, and don't forget to save room for the ice cream!
