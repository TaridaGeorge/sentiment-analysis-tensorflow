My favorite pasty has been, and always will be, the vegetarian chicken tikka masala. This is not to say that I don't enjoy the other pasties - because I do, very much. But I'll always love the Tikka. The filling tastes like it was made by a short and plump Indian woman, not the tattooed hipsters behind the bar. (I'm okay with that.)

The beer selection is great - including the brews on tap. Plus, $3 car bombs, always. $9-15 bucks later you're feeling like a champion, depending on your alcohol tolerance. 

If you show up with more than two people, plan on waiting a little for a table, or just sit at the bar. But you will enjoy yourself!
