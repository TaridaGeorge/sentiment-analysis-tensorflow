Saturday 11 AM crowd of 6 ppl

Swedish Potato Hash FTW!
We drove 40 min to try this place.
I was scared bc of the unique foods and the exterior looks,
but I had heard good things abt it.

Takes a while to make, so grab one of their games.

In our case, we brought our own.

My group played "Cards against humanity".
 We were ROFL and noisy while the food was being prepared.

Staff was nice, esp owner.
