Love the atmosphere.  Looks like an old house converted to an English Pub.  Fish an chips are excellent!  Overall, great feel, good food!  Worth the trip.  One other plus is the owners.  Don and Kori are two amazing people who actively get involved with their guest to ensure the best of experiences!
