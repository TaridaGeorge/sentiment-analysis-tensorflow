The owner of the studio, Nicole, is a good friend of mine. She runs one of the most elegant, beautiful and clean Bikram studios I have seen. Her passion and dedication for the practice transpire through her teaching, management and the studio. She really focuses on using yoga as a tool to transform her students' health, body and consciousness. I highly recommend you practice with her in her studio.
