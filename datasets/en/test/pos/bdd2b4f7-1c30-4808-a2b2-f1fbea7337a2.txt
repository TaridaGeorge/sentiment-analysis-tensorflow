I LOVE THIS PLACE! Short and sweet... I love the staff and their colorful personalities, I love the food and the people who prepare it. I recommend sitting at the sushi bar. You get a WAY better experience when you're right there in the heat of things. The staff is very engaging and entertaining as well. Try the soft shell crab.. I have never eaten anything there other than the sushi but I'm sure i will very soon.
