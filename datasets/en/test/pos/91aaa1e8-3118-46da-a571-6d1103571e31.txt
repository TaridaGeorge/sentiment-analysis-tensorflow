My usual tanning salon closed their doors with the promise to reopen in a new location. When they didn't I went to Sunchain. Cody was at the front and she was so helpful, professional, and informative. She alone blew Planet beach out of the water! I was so impressed with the service quality. And they have better pricing!
As a small business owner I'm very particular about customer service, and Cody is it!
