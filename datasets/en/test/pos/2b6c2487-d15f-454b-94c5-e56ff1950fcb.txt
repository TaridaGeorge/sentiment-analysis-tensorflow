Update: This store now tags their clothing differently.  Instead of a colored tag indicating when it came in, they now affix price tags indicating whether it's men's women's or children's.  No longer do you need to worry about being charged more for a t-shirt from the men's rack because you happen to be female.  Also, I found 5 cute women's Threadless tees on the Children's rack the other day, only $1.99 each, cha-ching!
