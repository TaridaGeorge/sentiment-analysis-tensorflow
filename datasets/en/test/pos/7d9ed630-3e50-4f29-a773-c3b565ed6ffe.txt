Today was my first day in lulu lemon with my boyfriend picking out yoga pants for christmas. Lately I have heard nothing but rave reviews about the products so I went in. The store is very easy to navigate, the help is extremely friendly, and the clothes are phenomenal.

I am not kidding when I say I put the yoga capris on and it felt like I was wearing nothing, they are light weight, easy to move in, and durable material. 

I normally would not under any circumstances pay money for clothes to sweat in, but lulu has all that is promised and more (my personal favorite was the Wunder Under) 

check it out, the Biltmore is pretty awesome as well!
