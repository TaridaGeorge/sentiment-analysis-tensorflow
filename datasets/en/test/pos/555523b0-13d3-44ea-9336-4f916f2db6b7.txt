Excellent brunch on the patio mid-week in a pleasant neighborhood.  Service was friendly and prompt.  Omelette and other choices were out of the ordinary so it wasn't the same old things.  Hint-- if you want an espresso drink, get one before you sit down for brunch at their cafe across the street.  Or go their afterwards and try one of the fine desserts too.
