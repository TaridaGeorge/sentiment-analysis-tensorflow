I had been wanting to try the Salt Cellar for a long time and finally had the chance last night. We dined at a corner table and had the most enjoyable experience possible. Our server, Tim was very knowledgeable of the entire menu and provided excellent service. We had escargot, mussels, turtle soup, lobster, halibut cheeks and the Snickers Cheesecake. The turtle soup might be the best thing that I have ever tasted in my life. I do not understand how this restaurant could receive negative reviews because my experience was perfect and I cannot wait to return.
