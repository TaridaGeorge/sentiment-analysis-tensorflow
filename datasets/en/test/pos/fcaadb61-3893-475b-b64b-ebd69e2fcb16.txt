The best massage I've ever had.  My boyfriend completely agreed.
The staff was nice and friendly.  The ambiance and facility is just what you're looking for - quiet, serene = Sanctuary.  
Damien was my sports/therapeutic therapist and he was the BEST!  I highly recommend him.  Similar to my boyfriend's therapist they asked what areas do you want to focus on and if we wanted massages solely in that area...most experiences we had they give you a full body massage and then an extra 5-10 mins in your requested area of focus.  Not these guys, they'll do whatever you wish.  This is my 2nd time here and I'm going to keep coming back.
