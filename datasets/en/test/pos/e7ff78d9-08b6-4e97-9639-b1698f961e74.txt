If you plan on doing anything with cakes or chocolate, you will want to know about this store.  

As stated earlier, they do have EVERYTHING.  A whole section of cookie cutters, decorating tips, rows of chocolate molds, cake pans, party supplies, and everything else.  

They have the best prices on disposable bags too- 100 for $13 something.

If I do not have a coupon to Michael's or Joann's, and know I will be heading to Phoenix, this is one place I stop by.  

One thing though is that their bathroom is not for the public.  They did make an exception for my toddler though.  

Plan on spending a lot of time just going up and down the aisles though.  It is not a "quick trip" store.
