I was born and raised in NY and this place is the ONLY place in AZ that does it right. After searching for 8 years, I finally found this place.  I promise you us New Yorkers know what we're talking about when it comes to bagels..and this place is the real deal.  And to Kristen B-  When every other review is a great score and you write a bad review because an owner was talking to an employee and there were crumbs on the floor you sound like an ignorant idiot. There are only 2 people working usually and everytime I have been there it has been PACKED so you probably got there during or right after a rush. Also, the owner goes out of his way to interact with EVERY customer, and im there on a weekly basis so I know what im talking about;.
