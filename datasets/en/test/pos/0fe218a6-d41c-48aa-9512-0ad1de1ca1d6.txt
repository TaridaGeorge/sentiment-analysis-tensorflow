My husband and I stayed here during a house hunting trip.  We were surprised how nice it is. It's very clean, friendly and helpful staff, and quiet. We'll be heading back again soon and plan to stay there before our things arrive. We could find somewhere closer to our home. But, this place is so nice we figure it's worth the extra 20 minutes drive.
