My new favorite place in Chandler. The food is excellent. The items they sell in the store are unique and delicious and the staff is incredibly friendly and knowledgeable.

Don't be fooled by the imported cheese and meat selections at your local supermarkets. Wedge & Bottle truly takes the time to choose the best of the best when it comes to their offerings. They will give you a back story all the way from the name of the farm and owner that their products come from, along with the reasons they decided to carry it. 

Icing on the cake? Wine and Cheese Pairing classes. Cider and Cheese Pairing. Monthly Wine Tasting. These aren't your Bevmo "wine tastings", where they try to sell you the flavor of the week. Everything at Wedge & Bottle represents a true love for the art of fine food and drink.
