Ray's Pizza is a little restaurant where you seat yourself and order at the counter. 

The man who I assume must be Ray speaks with a heavy Italian accent and is a little feisty.  If you aren't listening when he calls out your pizza order, he just may give it to someone else and make you wait while another order is cooked up for you. 

Kinda funny. 

But the pizza is worth the wait. It's delicious. You can order by the slice and they're huge. A slice of cheese pizza is only $2 and their specialty slices are a little more. 

You can also buy whole pizzas, pasta and cannolis. I will definitely be back.
