18 Salad choices.... need I say more?... Probably not.  But I'm going to.  If you work in this area and you want a wonderful salad I HIGHLY recommend coming to Taylor's Cafe.

I have met a couple of my work friends here on different lunch outings and I am never disappointed by the salad selection.  They ordered the Greek Salad and it looked amazing-- they confirmed that it tasted just as good as it looked.

I have ordered multiple items and have ALWAYS enjoyed them!  So glad I found this little gem!
