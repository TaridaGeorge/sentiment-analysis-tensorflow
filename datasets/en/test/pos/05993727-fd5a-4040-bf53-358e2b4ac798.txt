It's been 7 months since I made the move from PHX to NYC and I still think about D'lish.  It's a small joint and sometimes takes awhile if the line is long, but the awesome service & delicious food are well worth the wait.  Get addicted like me and order these:

- The California Club
- The Man Salad (sub blue cheese dressing w/ balsamic vinaigrette)
- The Breakfast Buzz (w/ almond milk) -- this is the only coffee/espresso related drink I've ever been able to enjoy.  I've never been a fan of coffee or anything that tastes like the stuff, but this drink defies all odds.  It's like drinking a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup.

Whenever I make it back to the desert... D'lish, you're my first stop.
