Pizza was amazing. The build your own pizza menu was great!

Waitress was very helpful and let me know that I actually ordered too much on my pizza and let me know that I should reduce my ingredients. Such honesty was greatly appreciated.

Go here 100%
Vibe is great. Not exactly CHEAP, but totally worth it.
