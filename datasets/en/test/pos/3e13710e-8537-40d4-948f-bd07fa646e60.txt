The two words I would use to describe the food at True Food Kitchen would be FRESH and FLAVORFUL! I probably will never be able to enjoy a vegetable from Safeway again after the amazing produce from True Food! 

I don't even especially like veggies and the crudite plate was amazing.  I could go on and on about every dish, dessert, and drink that we ordered.  The staff was incredibly accommodating and knowledgeable.  

The ambiance, service, and food make it a great place for a fun lunch with girl friends or a lunch meeting.
