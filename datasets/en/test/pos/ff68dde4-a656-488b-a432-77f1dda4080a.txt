I found out about Desert Dragon Pottery thru Groupon. Wow what a deal $15 for a wheel class. My 8 year old Daughter has been asking me if she could do this. So I bought 2 one for her and one for my son. Who backed out.  So my daughter got to do 2 classes. She ended making for little pots. they look amazing. 

You have to wait over 2 weeks to paint them. When we went back to paint. They were so helpful describing all the different glazes and techniques. She tried several different glazes and a high fire glaze. 

We are looking forward to going back and making Christmas gifts. They have several different classes, kids classes, and camps for the summer. Which I will take advantage of.
