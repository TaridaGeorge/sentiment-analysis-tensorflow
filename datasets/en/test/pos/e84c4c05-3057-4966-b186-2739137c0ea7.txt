On a recent trip to visit my son in Scottsdale, AZ, I decided to treat us both to massages following an active weekend of golf, hiking and tennis. With a choice of relaxation, therapuetic or deep tissue massage, I opted for the Relaxation version. Susie, the Therapist, was friendly, and provided a wonderful massage which I think was a hybrid of the relaxation and therapeutic types..No matter, she was sensitive, expert, and appreciative of my positive comments during and after the massage. My son reported his therapist also provided a "top 5" massage experience, similar to my observation (we are both veterans and fans of massage therapy). Highly recommend this business, and plan to return on my next trip out there.
