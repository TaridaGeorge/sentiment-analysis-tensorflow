This is another great little sports bar where you can feel very comfortable taking your kids. I always hesitate about "bar" restaurants, they are a risk for bad language and bad behavior, but NOT this place, they are awesome!

Menu is very diverse from Mexican to Italian, from wings (really good too) to a fantastic beef dip! The girls that wait on you are attentive, beautiful and very good at what they do.... Go and enjoy.....
