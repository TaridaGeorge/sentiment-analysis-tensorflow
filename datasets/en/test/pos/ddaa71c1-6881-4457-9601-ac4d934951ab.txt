Just plain and simple loved it. Came in this morning to get breakfast, first time I had been here for breakfast. Started off with a Mocha bowl and it was awesome! Might be back again this week and will need to add a shot of Jameson to it. As for breakfast I ordered the Demi-Breakfast: two eggs scrambled, pancake and flattened meatball. All I can say is very tasting the meatball with the eggs was a great flavor combo. Service = awesome. Food = awesome. Atmosphere = awesome. 

Will be back many times. Thank you Joe for having these great places to eat and thank you to your staff for taking care of all the customers the way they do.
