Very cool place.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the Knife House has a really great selection of high-quality knives.  Even though I didn't come here looking to buy new knives, I still really liked looking at what they had available.

I brought my set of Henckels here to have them sharpened and was really impressed.  It took less than an hour to get them sharpened and only cost $24 for eight knives.  Note that the prices are based on the kind of knife - chef's knives are $5, paring knives are $3, etc.  Now my knives are ridiculously sharp and cut through anything (including my fingers) like warm butter.  They also do knife repair in case your knives are screwed up and need some TLC.

I'm glad to have Phoenix Knife House around, because now I can get my yearly sharpening for my knives done locally and quickly :)
