I love this place.  My son loves to play at Jump & Shout.  

First of all, it's so cold in there, which is lovely for summer!  Secondly, a lot of the parents wore socks as well as their kids and went up into the tunnels with their children.  I loved that if you wanted to you could be an active participant, or you can sit anywhere and watch your kids, or you can sit in the cafe, which is in a separated a bit from the play area.  

I brought a book and read for a while, which was a lovely break.  I'm thinking about getting a monthly membership because it's such a great place to spend an hour or so a few times a week.  WONDERFUL!
