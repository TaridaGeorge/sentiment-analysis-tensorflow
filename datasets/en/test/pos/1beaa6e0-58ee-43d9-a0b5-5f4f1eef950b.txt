A little disclaimer before I start.  I used to work with one of the owners of this company before.  I worked at a furniture store in Scottsdale for a while and we recommended them to customers who wanted to get rid of the furniture they had.  We never received one complain about them and often I heard from customers how great they were.  

As to Matt (one of the owners) I can say he is by far one of the most honest individuals that I have ever met.  I have nothing but great things to say about him and I am sure that most people who have dealt with him feel the same way.
