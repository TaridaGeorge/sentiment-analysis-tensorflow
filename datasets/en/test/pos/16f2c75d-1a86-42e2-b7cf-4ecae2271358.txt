Dr. Gundermen is the man! He is the only Chiro I have ever been to that I enjoy 100%. You get a nice massage before the adjustment. You get asked questions. Get to ask questions too. Dr. Gundermen explains everything and tells you what's wrong.  Very friendly and affordable. They even give you free visits after going in so many times as well as for your birthday or referring people. These guys rule. As long as they are open and we are in QC I will be going to them.
