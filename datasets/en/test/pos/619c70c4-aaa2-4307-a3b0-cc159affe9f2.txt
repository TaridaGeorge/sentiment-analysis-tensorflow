I have been to Drybar a handful of times over the last few months and am totally hooked.  I have a very thick, wavy hair and to have someone else wash and style it is such a treat.  Each time I have been to Drybar, the salon is running on time and each stylist I have had has been as wonderful as the next.

Great atmosphere, comfortable, pampering, and to come out looking amazing each time - can't be beat.  Everyone deserves to treat themselves to this very reasonable $35 indulgence.
