If I could give 10 stars I would!  What can I say, I LOVE Netflix.  I'd love to meet the person who created this concept - I'm sure they're a millionare many times over. Smart, smart, smart!  Give folks a great product, great selection, and great service and you've got a winner!  

Love the selection and I have fun anticipating those new arrivals.  OK, confession time - I also happen to love the old shows like "Dallas" and "Dynasty."  Have had a fun time rewatching those shows from their initial episodes.  

Sorry that Blockbuster is closing so many stores, but hey, it was bound to happen!  Netflix rocks!
