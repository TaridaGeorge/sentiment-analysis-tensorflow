For me, Scott's Generations is the epitome of comfort food. Last week I felt really crummy, and the only think that made me feel better was a piping hot cup of matzoh ball soup and a crispy potato latke with applesauce. 

When I'm feeling right as rain, I indulge with their New Yorker sandwich: corned beef, pastrami and coleslaw on yummy rye bread .... It's amazing. 

Scott's even impressed my New York born-and-raised mother (while Chompie's does not).
