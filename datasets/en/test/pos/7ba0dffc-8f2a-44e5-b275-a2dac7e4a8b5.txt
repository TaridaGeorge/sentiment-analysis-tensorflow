Went here on a Sunday night with my dad. Walked in and thought "oh, it's just a sports bar." Almost turned around and left but the guy behind the bar (who turned out to be the co-owner) was so cool and friendly that we stayed. BOY AM I GLAD WE DID! It was a slow night with good college football on and all the patrons seemed to know each other, very Cheers like. And we were treated to some really REALLY delicious burgers and great beer! What a great night filled with good food and some fun new friends! I'll absolutely be back!
