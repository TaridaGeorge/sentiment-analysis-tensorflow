I'm basing the five stars on the chicken parm sub and the service.

The chicken parm had delicious fresh bread and flavorful marinara sauce. Not anything you would expect from a place like this. But they only time I've ever had a chicken parm sub that good was at Andreoli Italian Grocer, and that place is THE top rated Italian Deli in the city. P.S. try the garlic rolls too. 

They have a great lunch special, sliders (meatball, eggplant, and chicken parm) with a nice sized fresh salad for $5. 

The service was great, it is order at the counter, but the cashier (may have also been owner) was very friendly and you can tell he cares about his customers. I really hope this place does well, and if they keep it up, they will. 

I'll be back, and I'll try more things.
