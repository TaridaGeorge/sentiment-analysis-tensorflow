This place is amazing.  The ambiance is great and it has such a romantic feel in case you guys need to take your ladies out somewhere nice.  The hubby and I got one dish from each category and everything was delicious and so nicely presented.  The service was great with the server giving wonderful recommendations.  We had the Tako age, shiromi carpaccio which was by far my fave, and the soft shell crab sandwiches.  It's on the pricey side but its great quality tapas.
