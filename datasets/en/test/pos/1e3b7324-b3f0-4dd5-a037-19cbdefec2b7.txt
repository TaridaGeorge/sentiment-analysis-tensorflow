This Chinese food is the best I have had so far and I have tried many Chinese places the service is amazing as well their half size soup is the standard large in most Chinese restaurants the only thing I don't like is you have to add white pepper salt and chile oil to make the hot and sour soup spicy I ordered the general tso chicken and they where able to do it non battered which is a plus for me because I have the gastric bypass can't have alot of deep fry all waiters waitresses and bussers have a smile this is something I see no where anymore amazing serving sizes perfect for price very genorous
