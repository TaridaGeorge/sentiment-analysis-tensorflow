This is my second review of this restaurant. The first time I went when they opened, I wasn't impressed with the food selections and slow service thus my first bad review. But overtime, they really have IMPROVED-they vamped up the menu and the service is MUCH better. So kudos to them! My favorites are Arizona Rolls and Living Caesar Salad as well as their smoothies and coffee! I am happy to say I go there once or twice/week-their vegan selections are delicious! I'm also glad that it is conveniently located in my area.
