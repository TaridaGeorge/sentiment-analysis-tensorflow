Met a friend at LGO yesterday for coffee in the quiet betwixt and between hours, that is between the morning and lunch times rushes.

It was a lovely, peaceful, cozy environment- the perfect setting for a casual or business meeting, or just to have a comfortable place to sit and browse the web or perhaps to read a book.
