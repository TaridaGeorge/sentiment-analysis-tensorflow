While you all stand in the infinite line at the Old Town Farmers' Market for Simply Bread, I'll be looking for Breadsmith.  Not that there's anything wrong with Simply Bread.  I just detest lines, especially lines filled with stroller totin' moms that want to sample everything themselves as well as feed it to their kids.

If I'm lucky, I made it to the market before the Greek Olive Ciabatta is gone.  This ciabatta is FILLED with olives, and whole olives, not "chopped up so you can barely detect it's an olive" olive.  Unfortunately, most days I'm left with what's still available, maybe a rustic Italian or Freedom Bread.  But I'll take it, thank you!
