EVERYTHING about green is perfectly marvelous. I'm especially a huge fan of the vegan soft-serve desserts &milkshakes. The french fries are delicious, as well. Definitely better than anything you could find... Well, anywhere. They have quite an assortment of sandwiches, noodle dishes, etc. My bestie's favorite is the 'no-harm chicken parm.' Also, they have a lemonade/tes bar &a rack of common vegan groceries for purchasing. The amosphere is toooo cool &the employees, SUPER nice.
