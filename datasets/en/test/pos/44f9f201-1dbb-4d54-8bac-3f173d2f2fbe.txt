Ever eat at a Steak 'n Shake?  That's what Freddy's is: a Steak 'N Shake kind of burger and it's delicious! 

I liked the fries too: very thin, perfectly hot, not too much salt.

Nice people, the manager made it a point to get me my meal hot-off-the-grill, even though I came ahead of the "call" and again he met me while he was cleaning tables.  {See my review of "The Habit": their manager never greets customers, can't solve problems from behind a door, always hiding in his office.}  Freddy's Manager was OUTFRONT, ALL THE TIME, WORKING HARD!  

Great burger.  Next time I'll get the frozen custard.  I was too full from my triple cheese, CALIFORNIA STYLE-BABY!
