Great selection of clothing for those of us who are more difficult to fit.  Quality merchandise, a great in-house tailor, and the owner, Lynn, will likely be the one helping you - and she is great.  I can't imagine the hours she puts in to find the clothing that makes her clients the best-dressed in town, regardless of size.  Over the course of several years, I've bought things here that are unique and that you wouldn't find at a store for even "regular" sized people.  I'm one of the unfortunate dudes that's too big for a regular department store, but not big enough for a traditional Big & Tall, but I've always been rewarded by trips here.  Top notch.
