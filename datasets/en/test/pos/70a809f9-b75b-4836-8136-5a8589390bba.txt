Had the Hana Dog last night and I am so pleasantly surprised. The bun was delicious, the topppings were...top-notch. The tots and fries were a difficult decision though, I liked the tots and my girlfriend liked the fries. Both were delicious, just  a matter of taste. My friend Paulie ended up going for a second dog and fries because it was just so damn good. I will be hitting this place up a lot in the future :)
