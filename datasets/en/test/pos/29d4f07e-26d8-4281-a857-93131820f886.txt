AWESOME!  I have been waiting for this restaurant and it has opened right by my house!!!
The owner Bill is super nice and has greeted us every time we have gone there.  Food is great - especially the brisket, sausage, and ribs.  We like to share the Big Sampler for $32.00 is a DEAL!  Coleslaw is nice and sweet and crunchy.  Mac and Cheese is fair.  Fries are GREAT!
This place won't let you down!
