Intriguing and fun!  All I've experienced so far is the market and the food counter.

The market stocks a unique variety of foods,and has a pretty solid beer and wine selection.  Lots of local products... I noticed lots of local foods, and a good selection of Arizona beers, too (and not just the standard Four Peaks offering that you can find in most stores... good stuff from breweries in Sedona and Flagstaff, among others).

As for the food counter, it's absolutely worth a try.  The pulled pork sandwich is at the top of the menu for a reason.  It is fantastic!  The sauces on hand are very good too, and represent a nice variety... vinegar based Southern sauces, and your "standard" tomato based midwestern sauces too.

Definitely worth a visit.
