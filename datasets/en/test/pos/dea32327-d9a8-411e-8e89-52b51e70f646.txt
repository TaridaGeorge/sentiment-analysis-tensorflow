CHICKEN FRIED - CHICKEN FRIED - CHICKEN FRIED - CHICKEN FRIED - STEAK!!!!  WHITE GRAVY!! 

I was pleasantly surprised the first time I ordered this dish a few years back - didn't have a lot of hope that the gravy would be "right" - boy was I wrong!  I have not stopped going back!! A girlfriend and I go for lunch and we can split the portion - it is huge!  The dinner portion is off the charts!  Everything is right about this dish - the steak is so tender and the crust so crispy - and the gravy - well, Grandma would be envious!!!
