My wife and I have used Mile Auto Repair exclusively for several years now. They are honest, affordable, and we always provide us with the best customer service. It is very difficult to find a trustworthy mechanic, and we've had our share of shops in the past that have tried to overcharge us for parts or sell services we didn't need on our vehicles. Now that we have Mile Auto, all of those problems are a thing of the past. We highly recommend Mile Auto and have sent many of our closest friends there as well.
