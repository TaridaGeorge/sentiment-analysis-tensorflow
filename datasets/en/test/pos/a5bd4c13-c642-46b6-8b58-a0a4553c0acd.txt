Dr. Riley is very down to earth person who just happens to be really smart and have a medical degree.  I'm usually pretty freaked out by doctors, medical offices, etc. but I don't feel that way with Dr. Riley - he is very calm and a good listener.  

His office is small and you can usually get an appointment the same day or next.
