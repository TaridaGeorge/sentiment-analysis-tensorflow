Everything we wanted and more in an intimate Italian restaurant.  The service was prompt as we entered and were immediately seated.  My first surprise was that they did not serve wine - BYOW.  My wife ordered the special Cannoli served under a white cream sauce.  I chose a custom agli olio dish with a little extra zip.  

Our salad course was delicious.  The lettuce actually crunched as we ate it - by far the freshest we have had in any Italian restaurant.  Our pasta dishes were just as fresh and delicious.

We spent quite a bit of time with the owner Giuseppe talking about our upcoming trip to Italy and he proved to be a wealth of knowledge and advice.

Before leaving, he treated us to a very special traditional after dinner Limoncello - a perfect ending to a perfect meal.
