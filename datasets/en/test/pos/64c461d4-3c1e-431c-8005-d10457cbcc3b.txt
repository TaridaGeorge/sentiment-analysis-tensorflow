Revolver Records is hands down the best used vinyl record shop in Phoenix. Tracks N Wax is still good, but Revolver has them beat with the huge amounts of vinyl as well as their prices. They also have large amounts of new records as well. The staff is relatively well informed and their gradings for vinyl records are extremely fair. 

Revolver also host concerts, film viewings and more. 

Check Revolver out when in downtown Phoenix and especially on First Fridays!
