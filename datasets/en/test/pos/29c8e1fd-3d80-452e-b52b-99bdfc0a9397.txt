Come here.  Order the Chicken Shawarma WITH EXTRA GARLIC SAUCE and I garauntee you will not be disappointed.  The vegetarian sampler is also a great choice for starters (more than enough for three).

Whoever did their decorating had a rare talent for turning stomachs (they apparantly really like the SUNS purple and yellow uniforms), but this is completely counteracted upon by the great food and the warm local feel of the place in general.  Good stuff.
