This In-N-Out is almost always packed, which makes me a bit nervous. But hey, since that's a personal preference, I won't knock off a star.

As usual, this restaurant offers flawless casual fare, just like the other locations. Dear God. Their chocolate milkshakes have a perfect thick texture, and their food can always be customized. Whether you want three patties on one burger, lettuce as a bun or a milkshake with all three flavors, you can get it here.

My tried and tested favorite is the double-double Animal Style with no tomatoes. It has not steered me wrong yet.
