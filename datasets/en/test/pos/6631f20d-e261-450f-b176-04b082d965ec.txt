First off, I'm not a breakfast person. I always skip breakfast spots because it all tastes the same to me. That being said...this place is amazing!
I had no idea what to order, so I ordered the Nutella Crepe and the breakfast burrito crepe. The Nutella Crepe is mind blowing. The breakfast burrito is pretty good too, and I would definitely order it again. I'm pretty sure anything you order here is going be great, so check it out the first chance you get.
