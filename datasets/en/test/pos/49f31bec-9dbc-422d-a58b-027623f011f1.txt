Best BBQ in AZ (well its up there). I used to live down the street from here when I lived in AZ. Now when I visit my folks I sometimes make a trip to this place. I can't even begin to tell you my favorite dishes here because it changes every time. Their pulled pork is great. Their brisket is great. Their backed potatoes and side dishes are to die for. Typing this right now is making me crave this place as we speak. 

The building is great and the outdoor seating is even better. I can't say enough good things about this place. Its AWESOME!
