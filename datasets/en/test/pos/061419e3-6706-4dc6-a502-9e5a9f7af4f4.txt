I could play this course over and over again.  Very nice set up and everyone was very helpful.  I wish that I would have played this before Longbow, because I wouldn't have wasted my money at Longbow.  I have a OB Golf card and it gives me a discount at both courses, plus We-Ko-Pa.  I can't wait to come back and play both courses at We-Ko-Pa, and I will definitely play Eagle Mountain again.  Every hole looked great, greens were very fast and it was tough to keep an approach shot on the green. 

Great job on having water on every other hole, and cups on the golf cart.  Food cart......saw her at the beginning of the round and then on 17.  Not very good, but wouldn't change my opinion.  Do wish the BBQ was open when we made the turn, a hot dog would have been great.
