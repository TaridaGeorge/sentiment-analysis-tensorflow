I still need to make several more trips to this place because everything on the menu looks delicious. I have tried the frybread with the green chile. It is so good. The bread is perfect. The green chile is very good. I have also tasted the red off my husbands plate and that also very good. I recommend this to anyone who loves frybread done right. They also have soups. I need to try the albondigas but everytime I have went they did not have any. I did have the calavacita soup and it is very good, clean tasting and filling they will serve it with plain frybread pieces if you like. They have friendly service and it is very clean and simple. This is place is a hidden jewel. I highly recommend trying it. Oops almost forgot... they have the bomb salsa it is also delicious mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
