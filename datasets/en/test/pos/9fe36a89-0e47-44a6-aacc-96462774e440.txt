When the barrista poured my latte with a little leaf design in the foam, I was instantly in love.  I felt like I was back at Stumptown Coffee Roasters in my beloved Portland, OR.  The vanilla latte I ordered was smooth and delicious.  It was just the right temperature so I didn't have to blow on it for half an hour just to take a sip.  For coffee like this, you're gonna pay a little more, but frankly it's worth it.  Pass Starbucks quickly and head to Cartel in terminal 4.
