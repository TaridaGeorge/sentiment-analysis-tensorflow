Friends and I visited White Sage Espresso and received a warm welcome and were treated to a sampling of the food offerings. The  homemade pies and tarts were a nice change and were reasonably priced. The salad offerings and sandwich fillings were nice and bright in taste. I especially liked the edamame salad. 
The furnishings bring a homey and cozy feeling to the atmosphere and guests can enjoy the eclectic artworks. The artist is often found working on the premises serving customers. This is a great place to grab a cup of coffee, tea, or Italian soda and invites one to stay and relax. Plenty of parking.  This is a nice change from the usual Starbucks coffee shop.....as this place seems like you might be in a friend's home. I will be back! Good luck and good fortune to the innovative owners.
