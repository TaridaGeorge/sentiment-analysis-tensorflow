I'm giving Bertha's a 5 star rating simply because I have yet to find a better Turkey sandwich. Toasted bread, real turkey, avocado, thick crunchy bacon, and pickled onions...ooohhhhhhhhhh the pickled onions, the perfect hint of sweetness to finish off an epic sandwich. Everything always tastes fresh and light. It's fairly safe to say that they know what they're doing when it comes to tasty food. My favorites are the 
Roasted Turkey
Salami, Pesto, and Goat Cheese
Thai Chicken Wrap 
And for the mornings the Breakfast Wrap
