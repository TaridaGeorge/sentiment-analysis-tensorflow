Ahhh, the aroma of coffee and house-roasted bean. Iced coffee. Lattess. Pastries. Breakfast sandwiches. Yum. 

I wished this place was in the Bay Area. Seriously, there are amazing coffee places (Philz, Blue Bottle, Catahoula, Farleys), but the pastries and baked good there are lacking. Then there are great, awesome, wonderful bakeries (La Farine, Tartine), with meaty-oger coffee. 

This place is wonderful and derserves 5-stars because they have the AMAZING coffee with house-roasted beans AND AMAZING pastries and sweet treats. There is also other 'real' dinner type food and wine, but alas, I didn't have the time on my short trip to try those menu items. If I take another trip out to Phoenix, this will be one of my first stops.
