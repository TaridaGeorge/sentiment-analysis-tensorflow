Oh. My. God.

My lunch at Changs was so good that I am still losing my mind. Everything I ate was perfect. Things I ate included:

- Streamed Shrimp Dumplings

- Shanghai Cucumbers

- Shrimp Melon Salad

- Schezwan Shrimp

- Lemongrass Shrimp with Noodles

- Shrimp with Lobster Sauce

- Mango Iced Tea

Yes that is a lot of shrimp, and yes every single bite was damn good. Also, yes I am a giant fat ass who orders 7 things for lunch. So? It was THAT good.

All you freaks who hate chain restaurants and refuse to like PF Changs just because it's all corporate are really missing out. Missing out on great service, instant refills, perfectly cooked deliciously spiced food and a solid place to eat.
