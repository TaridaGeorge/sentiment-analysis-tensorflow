Freaking awesome.  I'm so coming here every Sunday night.  We decided to go here after dinner at Mastros last night.  It's around the corner from the restaurant and we've never been before -- I've only heard the lore.

I can't attest to the entertainment on different nights, but the Flamenco show was awesome.  I wanted to stay all night.  I was actually surprised it wasn't busier.  We had no problem getting a table.  There might have been 20 other people there?  Anyway, we're definitely coming back to this place.
