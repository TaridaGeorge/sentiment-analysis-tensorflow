Ok.  We love Sakana. There is not much to say, it is perfection.

Consistently good food and service!  We were able to order 5 different types of rolls, drinks (of the alcoholic nature) and it came out to just under $40! 

I love Sakana and it is worth waiting in line during the busy weekend evenings.
