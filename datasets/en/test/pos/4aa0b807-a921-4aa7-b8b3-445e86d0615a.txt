This is our home away from home! 
If you ever come near this area, you will not regret staying at the Rancho Sonora. 

It is a nice place to get together with a family and can accommodate a large group of people.

We love staying at their casita, a self standing house. Everything is super clean and tastefully decorated. We stayed twice at Casita-Ilsa. The Ilsa has a full kitchen with a eat-inn counter, TV room, a comfortable bed and large bath tub.

There are also affordable motel rooms which are very charming.
They also have jacuzzi and pool. 

My father in-law stays at RV park for winter. He loves the community.
I love going there to see him, thanks to the comfortable and welcoming environment they provide there.
