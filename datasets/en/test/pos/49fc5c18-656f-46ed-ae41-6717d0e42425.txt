Dr Allen has saved my suicidal rock eater too many times to count! 

As for my other 7 dogs, they always get top notch care here as well. 

Prices are slightly below average, but the service is greatly above average. 

Considering the fact that my sister is a vet and is closer to my home, yet I still choose to bring my dogs here should speak volumes as to the care they receive under Dr. Allen and staff's trusty watch.

Now if I could just get her to make house calls for my pot-bellied pig.
