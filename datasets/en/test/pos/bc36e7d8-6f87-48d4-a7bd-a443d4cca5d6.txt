We bought six trees from Elgins. We also had them plant these trees. We also warned them that it is a VERY hard dig since they had to blast to get our pool in. 

They came and they dug and dug and dug a bit more, they never complained or tried to charge us more for having to take much longer than they had anticipated. 

All of the trees survived well and so did a lot of our other plantings with advice from them on how to take care of and remedy any current worries.

Very well priced, mannered and knowledgeable too
