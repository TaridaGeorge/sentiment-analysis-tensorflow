I'm not one to write reviews but Iron Chef is awesome. I'm from the east coast, home of the best Chinese food in the country, and I have not been able to find anything that measures up to even the worst of places back home until I found Iron Chef. It is the real deal. Quality delicious food. I've tried a number of the menu items and have no complaints. The pu pu platter is amazing as well as the service, no frills Chinese take out to die for. I might be a little to excited but it is only because of the utter lack of good Chinese food in the region. My one complaint is that the soda fountain kind of sucks.
