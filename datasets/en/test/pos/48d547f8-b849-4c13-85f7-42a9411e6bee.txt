Simply the finest hotel/resort I've ever stayed in.  Even though it was my first time there... they gave us a complimentary upgrade to the Casita / house /condo things when I plugged in my Starwood number.   I usually stay at the cheap-end of the Sheraton brand places and occasionally a Westin... but this is a Starwood property, so if you are an Starwood loyal business traveler, they seem to hook you up if they have the space available. 

Service was exemplary, of course.   The bed was the most comfortable I've ever slept in.  My wife and I pretty much fell in love all over again while there that weekend.   We'll definitely be back. 

It's hot in August there though, I'll leave it at that.
