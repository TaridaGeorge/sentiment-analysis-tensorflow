I love this place! The patio is just perfect - high walls, comfy couches and tables, a huge fire pit, heaters and a gorgeous brick facade.  
The inside seating is gorgeous, too. Roaring fire, dark wood, brick, leather.  Sitting in The service is fantastic, too. As is the wine list and food.  It is so great to have a place like this in downtown Chandler - instead of Scottsdale. The ambience of old Chandler is cool, too. When we went last night, there was an art walk. 

I highly recommend V95. I also recommend reservations - every time I have been here, the place is hopping.
