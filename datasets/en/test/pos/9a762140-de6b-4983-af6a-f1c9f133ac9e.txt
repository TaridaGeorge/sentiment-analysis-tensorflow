During a previous trip with the family, one of my kids came down with a bad cold.  Base on my relative's recommendation I took my son to this facility.

Dr Cohen did a thorough examination to ensure the symptoms were not serious, prescribed some medicine and made some recommendations to ensure his coughing would not worsen.

I appreciate her thoroughness in putting my worry & stress at ease
