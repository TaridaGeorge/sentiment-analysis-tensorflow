I heart super target! I heart super target!

Once a week I have to make a trip down to THIS specific super target to pick up my large gala apples. They have some of the most fresh produce I have seen around. Their meat selection lacks, but produce is ah-maz-ing!

All their prices are fairly low too. They have everything you can imagine. My fat free redi whip for $1.99! My Sara Delightful bread for $3 bucks! I can't go to this place without dropping a decent load of money.

It's clean, it's awesome :) good stuff.
