Love this place. I've eaten in the restaurant up front once, but I usually eat and drink in the bar in the back. The bar in the back has really great happy hour and daily specials ($3 glasses of wine all day every day! Can't beat that). The food is delicious, homemade, and never disappointing. The service is exceptional. I highly recommend.
