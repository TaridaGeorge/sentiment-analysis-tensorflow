I have nothing but good to say. Fried cheese curds, yes please. Roasted brussel sprouts better than I make them. I love that they have small plate selections so you can try a few different things. I got the shrimp po boys - so good. I love that they did it on a biscuit, the bread is the one thing nowhere outside of New Orleans can do right, so kudos for putting a tastes twist on it. The shrimp were really good, you can tell they use quality ingredients. 
Topping off what makes this place great was the service, totally on the ball, friendly but not hovering. I will definitely go back.
