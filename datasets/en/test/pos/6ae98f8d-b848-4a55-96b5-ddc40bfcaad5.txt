Best one I have stayed at! Has nice courtyard and pool. Clean rooms. Pets accepted. Held room the night before so we could check in and get setup quickly.

EXTREMLY FRIENDLY STAFF that went out of their way to help us!! We were running late coming in from Las Vegas and the wonderful gentleman at the desk had a cab waiting for us at 5pm to take us to the FIesta Bowl 2011!!  

We had our 2 small dogs with us and Carol of Carol's Premier Pet Sitting (623) 826-6767 walked our dogs for us while we went to OU game on New Years Day. I RECOMMEND HER EVERYTIME!!
TOOK GREAT CARE OF OUR PUPPIES!!!
