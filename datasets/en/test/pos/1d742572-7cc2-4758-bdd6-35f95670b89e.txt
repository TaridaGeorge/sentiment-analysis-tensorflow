I mean, have you had that mango lemonade stuff?  Amazing.  So is the cottage cheese and hummus.  And so is everything else.  It's so bright and clean feeling.  The prices are great.  It was like a breath of fresh air.  Even the minimalist packaging is appealing.  It's sort of like IKEA with food because there is something appealing about the way everything is laid out that is eye-catching and soothing and simple.  I wish I lived closer so I could ride my bike there each evening to grab a take-away meal for dinner.  This place is literally Fresh and Easy.  I am in love.  Also they have Tecate.
