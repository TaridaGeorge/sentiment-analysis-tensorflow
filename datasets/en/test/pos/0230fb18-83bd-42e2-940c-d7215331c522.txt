Tried another one of their nummy sandwiches and the Sheridan maybe a favorite of mine.  If you are like me and love to drink a nice amber ale and eat some grub food, then you will love this place.  I only really go there during their all day Monday drink specials which is $2.50 for draft beers.  But they do have a wide selection of beers, not sure if they have a wide wine selection but they do have a list that I have never looked at and not sure about hard alcohol either.
