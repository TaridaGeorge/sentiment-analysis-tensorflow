Let me list the things I've tried at this place: Waffle dogs, the regular AND pecan caramel french toast, the Selena omlet wrap and sausage. Everything is amazing and you woud never guess it because of its location in its tiny nook. The service is very friendly and I didn't wait long for any of the food. Great breakfast choice if you live farther south =)
