This review is way overdue. And since I am not a regular Yelp reviewer, I am making an exception to this one....

I am in love with the quality and range of bruschetta they had at Postino. Figs, honey, almonds, pistachio, goat cheese, prisciutto and sooo much more!    Bite after bite felt like heaven on earth. Their creativity with the menu blew me away. Hip  ambiance. check. Originality. check. Scrumptiousness.  triple check.  

 I need to find a place like this in the Bay Area!
