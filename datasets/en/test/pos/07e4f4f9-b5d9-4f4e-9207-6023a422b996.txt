Okay, so as a person of Indian descent, I had to comment on Tandoori Times. It's damn good! I took my parents and 5 friends out there, we ordered basically one of everything and a ton of Kingfishers (best Indian beer ever) and spent less than $200. Lunch is not too shabby either, any one of their wraps hits the spot.... they're extra yummy because they use naans as the wrap.

My mother, who despises going to Indian restaurants, even liked it.
