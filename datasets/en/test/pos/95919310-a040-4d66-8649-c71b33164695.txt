I live no where near this place & have gone out of my way to eat there MANY times! I haven't been since it moved (bc I had no idea where they went) but it looks like it's bigger so that's great. I even made it a point to take an out of town friend here. I don't know about the new place but the old place was kind of a hole in the wall diner feel (in a good way). It can get really busy at lunch, so I don't recommend it for a lunch break from work. I did that once, and got in and out just fine, but it's a lot more fun without the time crunch. Everything is delicious, but the mini red velvet cupcake is always a must!
