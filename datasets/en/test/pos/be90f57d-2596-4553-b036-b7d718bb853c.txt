Great little family owned restaurant.  We are so excited that we don't have to drive to Mesa for good Korean food!  The woman who helped (possibly the owner?) us was very friendly and attentive. The food was excellent and comparable in price to other Korean restaurants.  They also have great green tea ice cream. :)
