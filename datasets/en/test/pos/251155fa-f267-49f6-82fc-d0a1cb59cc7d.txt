I really like this place. The people are very nice. I recently made the mistake of going somewhere else playing into the hype of being pampered in a "girly" setting. Paid way too much and hated it. I went the next day to have kisses fix the problem. I am now a loyal customer. They may be small and it may get crowed in there, but the work they do is great. They do try to "upsale" you but they are in a business to make money. And the services they offer is only a benefit to you. 

Thank you Kisses! See you in a couple of weeks!
