Frasher's recipe is simple - great food (St. Louis style) and an incredibly friendly staff. It's not the nicest place in the world (the booths could use some TLC) but it does have some charm.

The filet, smoked chicken, and ribs are all amazing. The side item choices you get with your dishes are also great. I would suggest the loaded baked potato and the corn. 

The desserts are also fantastic. As mentioned by others, the gooey cake is excellent, as well as their cheesecakes. 

My boyfriend and I can never seem to get out of there for under $70. Well worth it though! We plan on going back soon and trying the pizza, which always looks so good coming out of the kitchen to the other tables.

Frasher's is worth driving a bit south of Old Town Scottsdale and trying something off the beaten path.
