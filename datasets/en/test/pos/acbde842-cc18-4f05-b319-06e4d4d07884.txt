I kind of don't want to write this review because right now GROWop is my secret love affair. I love Kenny (the man behind the magic), when I ride my bike past the GROWop and see giant sunflowers staring at me, the fact that I was able to purchase several unique gifts there just yesterday, and that I got about 5 compliments on the dress that I purchased there the first time I wore it (which Kenny actually chose for me).

Love. True, true love. Local, community driven amazingness.

Stop in and get a vintage dress, a unique gift or just go and take in the beauty that is pretty much everything about the GROWop. Prices are reasonable and everything is one of a kind.
