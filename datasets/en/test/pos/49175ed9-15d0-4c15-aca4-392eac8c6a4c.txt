Great service from Dallas (our server) but most importantly, phenomenal eats.  This place has all the character and "casualness" that you want from your favorite burger joint, but with an elevated and surprising amount of craft in the food.  Truly delicious and thoughtful preparation -- an unreserved recommendation.
