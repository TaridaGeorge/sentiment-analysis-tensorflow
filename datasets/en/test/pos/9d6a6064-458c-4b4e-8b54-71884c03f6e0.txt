Had a very enjoyable dinner at Alessia's this past Saturday night. The service was first rate, and the owner (Jon?) was very charming and attentive to my date and I, as well as all of the other tables.
We had a very nice bottle of wine, the varietal was something I wouldn't dare try to pronounce let alone spell. But it came as a recommendation and didn't dissapoint.
For an appetizer we shared the caprese. Nice thick slices of vine ripened tomato...
Our dinners were the fresh fish, which was a very generous meaty portion of fresh cod, lightly dusted, and sautee'd to perfection, and the seafood mare over fettucini, which was also a more than ample portion and equally delicious.
Outstanding meals and service like this will keep us coming back....
