This is where to be on Monday or Tuesday nights after 8. The $20 Board & Bottle deal is unbeatable, and the vibe is cool and hip without being stuffy and overdone. It's a great place to take my young or yuppie clients for a nosh and drink, and they always have a wonderful time.

Their wine list seems to change quite frequently, and they always have a great selection. And they have a pretty good beer selection too, for those non-wine drinkers (I'm still questioning if those folks are human or not). 

My favorite bruchetta is......umm.... all of them. I love going with 3 or 4 girlfriends, because we can get one of each kind, and bathe in the deliciousness. 

Check it out, you won't regret it! Tip: Get there before 8 if you don't want to be waiting in line for half an hour!
