I learned of Danny when my boyfriend treated my new ride to a much needed spa day at Dannys. It takes a bit of time.. It's not a drive thru wash that you find at the local gas station... It's a hand job .. Yep that is right .. A nice wash.. A nice buff.. Vac.. & for a bit more upholstery stains out..& scratches from dummies who don't care about those of us who have nice cars.. Gone. Danny is a complete 10 to me and my Beemer.. But I can only 5star him!
