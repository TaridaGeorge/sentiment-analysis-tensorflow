in my experience, the urban outfitters in scottsdale has a better selection and is more clean/organized than the tempe counterpart. the staff is friendly and attentive without being bothersome. i've never had to wait around for someone to acknowledge that i'd like to try on clothes. definitely check it out if you're looking for a cute outfit or trendy accessories and don't forget to scope out the sale section in the back.
