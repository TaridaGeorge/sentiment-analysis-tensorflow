A very reliable local garage. Bill is all about great customer service, and goes the extra mile. He deflated my fears about "being taken" by other mechanics playing on my automotive ignorance. He's a truly good guy, knows his stuff, and will work to save me money if he can find it. I trust Bill, and 25th Street Automotive. Thanks, and we'll continue to bring our wheels into your shop.
