I love love LOVE their pizza
I love thin crust pizza

NYPD does awesome thin crust pizza

Love it.

Their lunch special gets you a small salad, a slice of pizza and a drink for $5
It's the perfect meal.

I usually only get their cheese and mushroom pizza, its simple and perfection.  

Their hot wings are pretty damn tasty too
