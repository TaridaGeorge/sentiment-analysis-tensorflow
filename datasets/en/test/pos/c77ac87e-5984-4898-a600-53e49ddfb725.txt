I have had to take my laptop several times into softque for simple problems.  Each time the staff has been so helpful, knowledgeable and fair.  I also appreciate their service, because I am in no way tech savvy and I have been to computer repair places that are filled with computer geeks that have no social skills and can't explain to the layman what is wrong with their computer. Softque team is the perfect combo between knowledge and service!
