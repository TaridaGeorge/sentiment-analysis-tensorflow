It's the same great food and same great waitstaff.  This was our spot post-race last year, and I wanted to come back to indulge in pizza, bellinis, and sweet potato fries after shuffling my feet for nearly 4.5 hours over 26 miles.

If I'm rating on pizza alone, it isn't close to the best, but for a local chain, it's up there.  Oregano's is just one of those great hangout spots.
