I wish I lived closer to The Deli. Ok, not really; actually, I wish The Deli lived closer to me. Nevertheless, whenever I return to The Deli -- like I did yesterday -- it seems like I've been gone too long. It is quite possibly THE BEST FOOD IN THE VALLEY. Seriously. I've never been disappointed here -- not even slightly let down. Nope, everything has been amazing.

I can recommend the hot Roast Beef sandwich, the Reuben, the Meatball sandwich, and the Sliders...and that's just from yesterday! If you haven't ventured out this way yet, hurry.
