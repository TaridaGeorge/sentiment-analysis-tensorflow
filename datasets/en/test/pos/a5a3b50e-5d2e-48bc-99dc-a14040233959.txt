Plain and simple: YUM.

Tried good ol fashioned lemon ice--perfect.
Tried sour patch kids flavored ice--delic.
Tried swirl flavored custard--best I've ever had.  Creamiest consistency of any custard or yogurt or ice cream.  Smooth and rich in flavor.  

Good place for kids--little tykes picnic tables and chairs on location.
