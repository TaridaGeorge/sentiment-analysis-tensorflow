Oh Jimmy, I heart you. I've been to this location twice, and both during the lunch rush. The line was to the door, but service is super quick. I was in and out in probably less than 10 minutes. My sandwich of choice is the #4 Turkey Tom (add cheese/no sprouts), or if I'm really hungry, the #12 Beach Club (no sprouts). The bread has a bit of a crunch, but still super soft. The meat, cheese & veggies are always fresh and delicious. Their own brand of chips are also really yum. I suggest the jalapeno and BBQ. My only gripe is that if you're ordering for more than yourself, you have to remember the order and pay attention because that's how they call it out when it's done. I'm more of a fan of the numbering system, such as "Number 12! Your order is ready!"
