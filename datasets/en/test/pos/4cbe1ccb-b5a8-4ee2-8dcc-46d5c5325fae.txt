I love Dr. Ben! I started working downtown a few years ago and needed to find a dentist that I could fit in on my lunch break or before work (30 minute cleanings). I met Dr. Ben at a bank standing in line and he was so friendly and invited me to try out his office! Since then I have seen his customer base grow twice the size. His office uses all of the latest dental software and equipment. Everything is clean and they keep UPDATED magazines in their lobby:) That's a big deal for me! Their office manager Robyn rocks at her job and it shows she takes pride in her job. I still make the drive downtown to his office even though I now work in Glendale. You guys rock!
