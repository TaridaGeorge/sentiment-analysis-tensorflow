After a few trips to Riga Tony's for lunch I am a fan... They have a great weekly lunch special each day for $6.95 each dish comes with a really good Antipasta salad with a really good dressing.  The ciabatta bread is always really fresh and hot great for dipping.. I highly recommend the baked rigatony with Italian sausage Wednesday and baked stuffed shells Thursday. I will be back for sure it's great good with great prices.
