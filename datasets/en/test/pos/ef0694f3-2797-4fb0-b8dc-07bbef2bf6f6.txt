I recently moved to the area and had two wheel barrow tires that had gone flat and come off the rim.  When I went to them to see if they could help they told me that they normally don't do wheelbarrow wheels but they would be happy to take a look at it.  With in no time, they had replaced both valve stems and aired up  both tires.  When I asked how much I owed them, they wouldn't take my money but said they were happy to help. 

I will definately go back anytime I need any tire work.  Thank you very much.
