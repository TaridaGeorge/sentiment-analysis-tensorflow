Love this family owned little restaurant.   The lamb and rice dishes are amazing and now they have so much better wines than they used to.    We make it a point to visit every time we are in the area and sit at our special table outside and pretend we are in a Mediterranean plaza...   (It actually over looks a car park but with all the smells of the cooking and a glass of wine, it can transport you!)
