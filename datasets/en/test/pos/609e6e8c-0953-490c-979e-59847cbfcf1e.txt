It was epic great.  I want to thank all the volunteers.  I am already signed up again for next year.

Of the thousands of details involved, the only "negative" was access to the lake.  Please add more gates to get into the lake.  There is only a small gate for thousands to get through in only a few minutes.  Most people had to clamber over a fence in suits and drop in.  When I jumped in I twisted my knee on a shallow boulder and had to deal with that the entire race.
