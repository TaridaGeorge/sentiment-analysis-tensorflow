Recently had dinner at the Culinary Dropout and was very impressed.  The ambiance just takes you to a different place and the menu is wonderful and varied.  I had the french onion soup and beef stroganoff.  Both very tasty although the onion soup was a little sweet for my palette.  We decided to follow up the meal with the carmel corn and wow, what a treat.  This is a fun restaurant and the food is good.  A great night out.
