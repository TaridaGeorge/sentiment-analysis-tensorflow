This place is amazing. Went there last night after an OChem lab with a friend.  We ate good.  Hummus, Pita Wrap, Couscous salad. 

The hummus was amazing, I have to admit it was my first hummus experience but it was great.  Everything was super fresh and light, which was great.

The pita wrap was amazing, again you could taste the freshness. Everything was cooked perfectly.

The service was great, food was fast, everything was perfect.
