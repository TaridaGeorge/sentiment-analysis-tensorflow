Crowded. Lots of Sun Devil hotties roaming around. Plenty of pool tables. Good drink specials. I don't care to try and objectively rate it compared to other pool halls because I'm sentimentally attached to this place, from my days as an ASU student. It's Mill Avenue on a Friday night during college surrounded by friends and beer. How could you possibly have a bad time? 

If you're at ASU, you will come here, you will have a good time, and the memories will be worth 5 stars.
