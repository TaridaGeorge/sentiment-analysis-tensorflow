Edit:  my review was for Houston's, now closed down.  This place is exquisite.  Mind you, this is the first time I've been here.  However, after a fiasco at trying to get a downstairs seat at Rokerij and then traversing a couple of other places, the only place that delivered was Houston's.  I will say, this is the only bar/restaurant that has merited a 30% tip from me.  Though they were out of the first bottle of wine we selected, they offered a better wine for the same price.  Sweet.  EXCELLENT service and very good food and wine.  That, on top of a really nice low-key ambiance accented by dim lighting, was what earned my rare five-star review of Houston's.
