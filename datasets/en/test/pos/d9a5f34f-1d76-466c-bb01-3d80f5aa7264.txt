Cupcake flavor salt water taffy. Gone before I step foot back in my house. I should buy 2 pounds next time.
My oldest child saves his pennies and nickels so that he will be able to pay me back for his watermelon taffy. We were once upset because it wasn't the sour watermelon and plain ol watermelon (sweet) We were so sad.
But we went back!
Ta-DA! We got him 1/2 pound. Happy child day 1. Day 2...well lets just say that an 8 year old should not eat that much taffy in 2 hours. ;)
I love this place and everytime we go back we buy enough for the free red bag. We have 6 now. I will try to make it a bakers dozen by the end of 2012.


(...so good)
