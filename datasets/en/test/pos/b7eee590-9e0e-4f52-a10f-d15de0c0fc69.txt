Great local yoga studio. Had flexible hours like early morning and late night to fit any schedule. Teachers are friendly and setting is relaxing. 

I would say the one thing that might make it a better is if it was required/enforced to be quiet once you enter the classroom. Many people like to relax and meditate before class which can be distracting with people talking to each other or on their cell phones...just a suggestion.
