I was lucky enough to have a well-connected friend invite me to a preview lunch at Seasons 52.  I was very impressed by the service, the quality of the food and the decor in the restaurant.  What really makes Seasons stand out though were the desserts.  Each dessert was so small, just a shot glass, but what a shot they were.  I had the Rocky Road and it was creamy, chocolately, and did not leave me clutching my stomach 10 minutes later from sugar overdose.
