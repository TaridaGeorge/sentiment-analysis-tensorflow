I had heard about the Heard Museum for a while, and I finally got a chance to visit. My husband who is a California Native was disappointed that his tribe was not represented, but the museum's focus is on Arizonan tribes. We were impressed, and we're considering going to the Scottsdale branch to compare the two locales. The food in the cafe is fantastic. The museum store is pretty good, too. My husband insisted on buying a rattle at the book store. Now he's rattling away at the bad drivers. Of course, I think witnessing a bad accident might have had something to do with that.
