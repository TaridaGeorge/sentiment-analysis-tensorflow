It was love at first bite. Great location, great urban hip vibe. And the food rocks. 
Ok, first things first the fries. Sweat potato is not usually my thing but these are fantastic with the Cinnamon & sugar. The garlic & rosemary are fantastic as well. 
Always ask about the specials cause there is something good cooking in the kitchen's. 
The FEZ burger is a great layered combination of meat, aoli, pear (yes pear) and BBQ. All very good. 
If you are headed in for lunch, get there before noon on a weekday, the place fills up quick. Sitting out side is great for 7 months of the year.
