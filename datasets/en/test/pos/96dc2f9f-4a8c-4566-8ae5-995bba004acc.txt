We chose Gabriel's when our Washer suddenly started clanking during the spin cycle:(
The office staff was very polite and worked with us to get an appointment scheduled the next day!
The owner, Jeff Gabriel showed up and identified the problem in about 1 minute.  When he found out the part would take 2 weeks to arrive, he called the office and found us a laundromat nearby!

THEN....when I mentioned my ice maker was not dispensing ice due to a stripped gear, he said "lets take a look" and had it fixed in under 5 minutes!!!

Very polite and professional...ON TIME...EASY scheduling and very fair price! I would highly recommend them for ANY small appliance repair!
