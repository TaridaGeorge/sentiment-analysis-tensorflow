Great place to relax or work in a great location. Coffee is delicious and the atmosphere is relaxed. My group met here for a meeting and it was the right atmosphere and much better then meeting in some stuffy meeting room.
Damien and Bri were great and very welcoming. 
Definitely will return on my next visit to Phoenix
