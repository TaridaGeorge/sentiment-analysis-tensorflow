So who wouldn't love a yummy piece of beef swimming in melted butter on a 500 degree plate?

C'mon it is so flippin delicious I don't know what to do with myself!!!!  

My fav is the filet, med or med-rare...depending on my mood. My bf likes- no scratch that - LOVES the cowboy rib-eye! He is your typical, hard to please Texan when it comes to beef and admitted it is "the best steak he has even had." So there you have it. Top grade meat and over-priced wine and you have a winner.

Give the creme brulee a try. I, myself am not a huge fan of creme brulee but Ruth's Chris makes one to crave.
