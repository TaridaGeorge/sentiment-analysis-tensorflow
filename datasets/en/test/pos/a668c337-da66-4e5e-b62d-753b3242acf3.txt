Ate there for lunch. Wow, was it good.

I took two friends there and they were just telling me bad experiences with burgers that they had. (They are very particular with their burgers.) They both agreed that the burgers they ordered and ate were the juiciest burgers they ever ate. From my perspective, they looked really delicious.

But I had the full rack of baby back ribs. Oh man. We were just wondering why their burgers came with knives, but my ribs didn't. Then I just pulled one off. Or should I say I kept it from falling off. Oh, that's why. Yeah, that tender. So good.

Loved the corn bread and the mini doughnuts they gave us for complimentary dessert.

Yep, Yelp came through again and brought me to a five star restaurant. Gotta love this.
