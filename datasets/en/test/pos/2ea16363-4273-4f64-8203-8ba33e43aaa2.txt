On my recent journey back home to Arizona, I ventured to Ra, on busy Mill Avenue in the heart of Tempe. 

We arrived just after happy hour, missing the great deals on sushi and sake. The first round of drinks was a sake bomber, made with high-end sake and a cold Chinese beer, which really hit the spot on a dry, hot Phoenix afternoon.

We sat  in the back patio, complete with a full bar, seating for diners and misters to fend off the brutal Arizona sun. We ordered a couple plates of sushi, which was flavorful and tasty.

Although our bill was pretty high  - $100 - this place is worth a visit if you are in the land of the Arizona State Sundevil.
