High tea at the Phoenician is awesome.  It's reasonably priced, and you'll have SO much food (I think like six kinds of sandwiches, two scones, and seven kinds of dessert!!). Try the darjeeling tea; it's very good.

The setting is wonderful, too--very relaxing, with gorgeous views of Phoenix.  While we were there (for a bachelorette party), there was lovely piano music in the background, which contributed to the elegant atmosphere.  Definitely a good place for a ladies' afternoon/bridal/baby shower.
