Mikado is my absolute hands down favorite sushi bar in Arizona.  It's not just the food, but the atmosphere... it's really laid back & you feel right at home.

My favorite of favorites...
Albacore Onion Sashimi with added crunchy garlic.  Super fresh albacore tuna wrapped around onion soaked in ponzu sauce & deep fried garlic cloves.  It has the most amazing flavor & very generous portions.

& if they have it, ask for Tuna Tataki.
It's ahi tuna perfection... we get it every single time.

I've never gone wrong here... but we tend to stick with the sushi.  Their lunch specials are awesome.  =)
