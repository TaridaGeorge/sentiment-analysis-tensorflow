Love Love LOVE this place.  I am slightly disapointed to know it is a chain restaurant (we don't have J. Alexander's in the midwest) but it doesn't matter because the food is amazing!  I have been there twice and have enjoyed everything I have ate from the spinach queso dip (not ordinary spin dip), steak kabobs, the AMAZING Mac & Cheese (one of the best I've ever had and I'm a huge Mac fan), and of course the carrot cake...yummmm.  My boyfriend had the ribs and said they are some of the best he's had.
The service is fine, nothing special, nothing bad though.
Ambiance is nice and similar to many steakhouse type places.
Food is amazing though and I will frequent this place often!
