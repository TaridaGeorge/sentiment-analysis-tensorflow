As  new transplant to Phoenix, I was so happy to find this place on groupon!  After the stress of flying from NYC 8 months pregnant and with our cat, having dinner here was like a dream.  Everything was delicious, portions were filling and it was just so relaxing.  We had the duck special and the salmon, along with snails and the goat cheese toast triangles- everything was made just right.   We had a great time!  Also, everyone was very nice.  This place would fit right in in Brooklyn or Paris!  Glad it is in Phoenix!
