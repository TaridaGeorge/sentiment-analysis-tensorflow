Sun Stop Liquor has the best selection in all of Tempe.  They have great prices and the customer service is fantastic. They always have amazing specials, and the specials always change.  Kegs?  They've got it all.  Chips, Pops, Juice, Champagne, Beer...anything you want, it's there. 

There is a sub shop inside that is also amazing.  Actually, best subs ever. What more can someone ask for besides getting their drinks and the cure to their hangovers all in one spot?  Heaven on earth if you ask me.
