Grimaldi's is one of my top pizza places in Scottsdale. Fresh ingredients, thin, crispy crust,  amazing flavor. It has a distinctness all it's own. When you are craving pizza you think "I want pizza" or "I want Grimaldi's pizza". It's just not like the others my friend. 
Decor is typical pizza joint restaurant-red and white checkered tablecloths, simple furniture for their tables and chairs, some black and white photos on the wall. Every time I've been here it's been crowded and typically service is attentive and friendly.
