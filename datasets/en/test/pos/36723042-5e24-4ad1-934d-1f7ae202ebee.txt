I go here quite often.  Yesterday a cashier noticed I was purchasing chicken breasts and she grabbed a small bag of ice from the freezer to put in my chicken bag because it was 100 degrees out and my car would have been an oven.  So thoughtful!  I love this Sprouts and the people who work there.  Also, they have a great selection of organic foods that I cannot get at Fry's.
