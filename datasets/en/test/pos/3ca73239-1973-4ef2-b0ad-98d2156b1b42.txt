I believe there may be a new Vietnam War brewing over which Valley stalwart serves up the best Vietnamese cuisine: Da Vang or Pho Thanh.  And after having sampled both on multiple occasions, I have decided that Da Vang is the winner.   

Though both places serve great food at reasonable prices Da Vang's food is just a little better - and the main reason is their Thit Nung (grilled pork).  While Pho Thanh serves a grilled ground pork patty, Da Vang serves thin slices - which is far superior.  This one item shifts the entire battle in their favor.   I urge you to try a Banh Mi Thit Nung at both and see for yourself which one is better.  

That said for atmosphere, I think Pho Thanh would be more inviting to the average person.


Totally recommended.
