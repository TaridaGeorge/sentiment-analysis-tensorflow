Cara is great. Being a guy, I'm not really into facials and pampering, but I do tend to break out far too frequently. Cara showed me that chemical peels can help clear up breakouts and even out the skin tone. I'm amazed by the changes and how effective even one treatment can be. She spent the time to find the peel that was most effective for me and didn't try to push a bunch of products on me- she was focused on the best outcome for me. 
Thanks cara!!
