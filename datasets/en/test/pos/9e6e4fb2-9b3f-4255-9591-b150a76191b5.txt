This gigantic 71 acre sports complex usually has a touney/practice going on for soccer, football, or lacrosse.  There are a lot of trails/paths to walk or jog on.  

I love taking my dog here for walks.  Dog must be on leash at all times.  There are a lot of paths and it is well lighted, quiet, and clean and not congested with runners, bikers and people.  The paths are empty because everyone is on the field playing sports.  There are plenty of dog potty bags on site to use.  There is also basketball courts and a playground, as well as an on site office and bathroom.  

Daily hours are: Sunrise to 10:30 pm.  Tons of parking available as well.
