Sakana has been a home away from home for years. Have attempted to find a close comparison and can't....even somehow in Maui or Kauai. They always take great care of you, it is a very relaxed atmosphere and the sushi is amazing! How Fresh Wasabi could be #1 in my zip code is beyond me. Best to order family style as everything comes when it is ready...they don't let anything sit. Thank you my Sakana family:)
