All these yelpers couldn't be wrong! This place is deeeeelish! Some many different options, it's hard to choose a pastry. Not sure if u could go wrong on any of them.... The beer selection is pretty decent. The secret beer is a hazelnut brown ale (rogue brewery). It's not really a secret it's just not on the menu, but it's amazing. Normally im not a fan of rogue, but whatever. We had the banoffee for dessert! They whipped the cream as we ordered, it was perfect. The service was ok, we seemed to have 3 ppl serving us. The female was def. less attentive, but the boys were on point.This place is absolutely worth trying but don't expect any thing fancy. If they changed anything it would lose it's charm. Nothing else like it in az.
