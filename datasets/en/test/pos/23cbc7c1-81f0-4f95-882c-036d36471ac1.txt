when i first moved to AJ i started going here...

I now live in Phoenix and STILL make the trek out there to see Dan Finney PAC.  He is attentive and open with his feedback.  He listens and i just have nothing bad to say.  I have had to see a couple of the others over the years, and have never had a bad experience...

another plus...  in and out, very quickly, not a long wait time!
