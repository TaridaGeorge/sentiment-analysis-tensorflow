I went to Cask 63 in the beginning on October.  It was awesome.  My wife had the fish special.  It was a bit pricey but well worth it.  I had the lamb chops that my friend told me about.  He was correct to recommend that dish.  It was awesome.  My Jack and Cokes were great (strong) and my wife had a flight of wine which she liked most of the wines.  Our server was awesome too.  We had several things in common.  My wife thought I was making a new friend.  All and all I have to say this place is very good.
