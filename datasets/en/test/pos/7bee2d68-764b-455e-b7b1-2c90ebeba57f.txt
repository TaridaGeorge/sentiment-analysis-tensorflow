Have eaten here many times and is one of our favorites in town. The food is spectacular and we look forward to it on a regular basis. I can't speak to all of the menu because I like the shrimp po-boy and red beans and rice so much it is all I ever get. I don't think I've had a better sandwich.

I did have a small service issue a couple months ago and the owner bent over backwards to make it right and resolved my issue completely.

Went back for lunch today and was better than ever.
