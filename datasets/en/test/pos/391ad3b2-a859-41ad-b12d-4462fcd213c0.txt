I can walk around this store for hours and hours, not needing a thing, but walk out with a shopping cart full of stuff I "needed!" I spend so much time there on each trip, my girlfriend and friends refuse to go with me....which is fine with me! I just purchased a few Cabernet Sauvignon grape vines and they are looking remarkable planted in my backyard. I'm thinking, in about 10 years I should have enough grapes to make a glass of wine...can't wait!!

As far as the service is concerned, after many years of shopping at Lowes and Home Depot I've found that you pretty much have to offer oral sex to get anyone to help you. I don't even bother looking for help anymore.
