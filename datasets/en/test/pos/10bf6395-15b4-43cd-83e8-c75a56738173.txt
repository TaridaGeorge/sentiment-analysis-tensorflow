Excellent food, reasonably priced & great service. 
We got the Garden Turkey burger (with a side of sweet potato fries) and the Balsamic Bleu Cheese burger. Both were excellent but the Bleu Cheese burger was outstanding!  The sweet potato fries were also very tasty - with a touch of cinnamon & sugar.  

We'd ABSOLUTELY return. The atmosphere was cool with good music playing so that's a bonus.
