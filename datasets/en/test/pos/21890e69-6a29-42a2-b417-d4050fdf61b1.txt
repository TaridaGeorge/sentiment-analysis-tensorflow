Very Nice Hotel, I got a chance to stay there when i miss my flight from sky harbor airport. Aloft  has a lot of color, neon lights, and a young hipster trendy vibe to the place.  The room was very modern and hygienic, with some walls paintings and doors.  However, the walls are fairly thin.  I really my whole night there and also break fast in the morning. Super class service. I liked it. Thanks a lot.
