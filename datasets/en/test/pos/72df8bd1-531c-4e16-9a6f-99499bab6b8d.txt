As of this posting, it seems Casa Fuma is CLOSED.  There have been no signs of life at the shop in several weeks, Cliff hasn't been heard from on FB, and when we looked in tonight, all the cigars in the humidor are - hold your breath - GONE!  

We enjoyed this place while it was open.  Hopefully someone will hear something soon and it will open again!
