I heard this place was really good so I drove 20 minutes from the hotel to get some food.  It wad getting late so I ordered for takeout.

Food was just coming out when I got there which was good timing.

The drive back was torturous as I had to smell the food the entire time back!  I have to admit that I was definitely speeding while sipping on the thai iced coffee.

The food was really good.  I have a few thai friends and know authentic thai food and this was right on the spot. 

My favorite is the ground chicken with mint leaves and chilis.  I got 2 out if 5 for the spiciness and it was perfect for my stomach.

I will definitely go here again to eat.  It was well worth the drive.

Now go get some!
