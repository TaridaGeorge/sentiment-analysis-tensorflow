Wow. Everytime I go back here the service is friendly and professional. Their selection is always of good variety. I love that they keep certain classic in the case while every different season they bring in specialties. Their drinks are pretty good as well. The only reason they did not get 5 stars is because when they get really busy, they are understaffed and you end up waiting sometimes quite a bit...oh well. It's worth it.
