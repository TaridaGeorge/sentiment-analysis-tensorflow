Beautiful building and a real Phoenix treasure. I've been going to their gift shop for years, even when it was still located at Dunlap/I-17. Lots of gifts and memorabilia from Ireland as well as the various countries of the UK. The main owner/organizer is very nice and seems to have dedicated his life to bringing the Irish history of Arizona to the people.
Went in today to have a gander at the tea selection and two older Irish gentleman were working. It was great to listen to some stories and some Irish language while looking around the shop. Only wish more people cared about this place so that it could grow a bit more.
