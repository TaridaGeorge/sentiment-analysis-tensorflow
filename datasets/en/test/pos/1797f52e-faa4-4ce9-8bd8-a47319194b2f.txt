I am from Chicago and this is definitely my favorite place to go for pizza here in Arizona!  I'm also a huge fan of sourdough, so it is pretty perfect for me!!!

My favorite is the thin sausage pizza.  So yummy!!!

Parking is a pain and the wait staff isn't the friendliest.  I came in yesterday with my two daughters pretty early in the evening.  Our waitress picked up my daughters plate before she was even finished, cleaned up the entire table while we were still sitting there, and even took all the napkins.  I needed the napkins to wipe their hands after eating pizza...why would you take brand new, clean napkins away when I have two small kids with me?
