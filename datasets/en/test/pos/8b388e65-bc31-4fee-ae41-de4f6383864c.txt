There are stores here at which I never shop (e.g. Tiffany, Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, Burberry, Louis Vuitton, Prada) and those which make up a lot of what's in my closet (e.g. Ann Taylor LOFT, H&M, Charming Charlie, Abercrombie & Fitch, lucy, Victoria's Secret, etc.). There's also Sephora, Sunglass Hut, and Coach. 

Some restaurants include The Yard House (yum!) and Grand Lux Cafe. The food court has a Paradise Bakery. 

Valet parking is available, and there's a parking garage as well. 

This is my favorite shopping spot in the Valley. You can very easily stay here and lose your entire day...as well as the contents of your wallet.
