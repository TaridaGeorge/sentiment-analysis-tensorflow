This place is unbelievable.  Great lunch spot and great deli.  I've been going here for 3 years, mostly because their sandwiches are so good (chicken cutlet, cheese steak, chicken pesto sandwich are awesome) but they started making pizza now which is equally good.  Friendly staff too.  Seriously, if you don't like this place, I don't want to be friends with you.
