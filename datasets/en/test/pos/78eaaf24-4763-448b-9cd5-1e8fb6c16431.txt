I have been craving Wild Thaiger for a year now (last time I was in town they were closed). The flavors are perfectly blended, the food is artistic, and the food choices are unlike that I've seen at two other Thai restaurants I've eaten at recently. Their Thai Iced Tea has to be some of the best I've tasted thus far. Its typically quiet which was perfect for girl's day out and chatting.
