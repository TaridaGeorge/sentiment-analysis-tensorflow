Bring out ye dead, bring out ye dead!  Many years ago, in my youth, I lived right across the street from Greenwood Memory.  Every Halloween in elementary school, during those same years of my childhood, my music teacher would show us an old film reel of a cartoon skeletons dancing around a cemetery set to Camille Saint-SaÃ«ns' "Danse Macabre;" I loved this, and I always thought that Greenwood Memory Lawn would be the perfect setting for such a ghastly event.

In all seriousness, I have friends and family members buried here, and when I did live across the street from it, I enjoyed strolling through the grounds.  If you don't have an issue with the thousands of corpses beneath your feet, this is actually an incredibly beautiful park with old growth trees set right in the middle of urban/industrial Phoenix
