The service was amazing, and worth every dollar that was paid.  I went there with my boyfriend for a nice, quiet, romantic vacation away from Los Angeles and we enjoyed ourselves so much!!

Our room was gorgeously decorated with a very comfortable bed, television and a bathroom equipped with a beautiful jacuzzi-styled tub and see-through shower.. and vanity area (for me!).

I would definitely stay there again, although we rarely saw anyone younger than 35- unless they were the children of these older folks... so we continously got asked "where are you from?"  lol.  Good times though!
