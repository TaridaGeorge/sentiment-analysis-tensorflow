I was taken aback by how good I thought this place was.

The server was SUPER nice and friendly.
The food was DEEEEEEEELISH

I *loved* all the different bbq sauces right there on the table.  Seriously, it was my favorite part.  Because I love sauce.  Lots of different kinds of sauces.  All over my tender meats.  Delicious.

The best part... how flippin' cheap it was!  We went during lunch time (which is 7 days a week), and I think my two meat meal with a side item and cornbread was like $7.99?

AWESOME!
I'll return I'm sure.
