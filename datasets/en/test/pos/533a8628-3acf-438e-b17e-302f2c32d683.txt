This is by far the best yogurt place I have ever been to! I am a yogurt snob and I am glad that I ran across this place. The first thing I notice is that the owners keep pride in making the place spotless! Secondly the workers are very friendly (couple cute ones) and always willing to give you a sample cup. I recommend trying a couple sample cups to see what you will like. The flavors are awesome and some are switched out every so often. Some yogurt places have a weird chemical taste to it. This place does not have that taste at all. The price is also by far one of the most competitive in yogurt industry. Yummy tummy!
