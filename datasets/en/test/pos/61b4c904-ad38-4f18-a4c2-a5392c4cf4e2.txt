We love going to Paradise Bakery and now we have one even closer to us in the Goodyear Centerpoint (Pebble Creek & McDowell).  

Their food is very good, plenty for your $$ and different items on their menu.  Staff is normally friendly and they have a fequently visitor card to earn points too!

This location has outdoor seating and free Wi-fi as well!
