Went to a ballgame here last night, and unfortunately the Diamondbacks lost to the Mets  :(  

We got there early and had a few drinks at the Tee Pee lounge just south of the ballpark (which saved us mega-bucks over the extortion level prices inside - $10 beers?).

The venue is fantastic, parking is a breeze, getting in and out of the stadium is effortless, the view from our dugout seats was spectacular, the building itself is an architectural wonder - this was one well planned ballpark.
