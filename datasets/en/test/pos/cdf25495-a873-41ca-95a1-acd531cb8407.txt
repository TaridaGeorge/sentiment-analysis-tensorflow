I really enjoyed this state of the art baseball stadium. The Rockies and the Diamondback owners were smart to collaborate on a shared facility, awesome job! There's a good mix of sun seats and shade seats. There's free self serve sun tan lotion in the outfield and the variety of food choices was excellent. Try the garlic knots with the marinara sauce or the Italian Sausage. Parking is efficient as there were easy outs onto the 101.

I just hope the Cubs use this stadium as a model to their new ballpark in Mesa.
