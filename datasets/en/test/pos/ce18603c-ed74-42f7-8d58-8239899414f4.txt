I am a sucker for fresh & local. Lux Coffeebar is certainly both. They roast their own coffee and bake their own goods, all of which are excellent. The staff are genuine and friendly, not salesy. They want you to have a good experience and come back. The art on the walls rotates frequently. They play good music, though at times it's a little loud for conversation if you're sitting inside. They have shaded outdoor seating with misters to help you stay cool during the summer heat. And they provide free wifi. This is an excellent spot. My favorite passtime: ordering a latte so I can watch the barrista pour me some art on top.
