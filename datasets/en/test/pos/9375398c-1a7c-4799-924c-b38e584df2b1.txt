I've been here several times for lunch and also for a b-day part of 8 or so and they accommodated us immediately. The food was soo yummy every time. I eat primarily vegan and dealing with food allergies and it was so easy to eat here. I love the fact they are vegetarian and not bombarded with soy! I will make a point to stop in here anytime I'm in the area. The vegan chocolate grenache cake was amazingly delicious! To the best of my knowledge should be GMO-FREE.
