My husband and I just finished our Margherita pizza!  I was craving some anchovies and black olives on top and they accommodated my request.  We ordered two of the dinner salads and they were the perfect size and flavor to go with the meal.  The pizza is authentic wood fire pizza and not perfectly round in shape which was another plus for us.  Absolutely perfect meal!!!
