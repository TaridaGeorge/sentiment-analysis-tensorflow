This is one of my favorite chain restaurants - and I don't like chain restaurants.  This is a fun place for a date - it has the potential to be quite romantic (just be sure that the person you're bringing along is worth the time, effort, and money).  All cynicism aside, cooking your own morsels of food, though time consuming, is a great way to get to know your date.  They have an extensive wine list.  You'll be spending a lot of time with your server as they prepare cheeses and desserts tableside, so be chatty and be polite.  Try the Coq au Vin cooking style which gives you a nice pot of Burgundy wine and spices in which to cook your food.  This place is a great destination.  Be prepared for a big night on the town!
