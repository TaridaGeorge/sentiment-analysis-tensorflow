I have Spinato's probably once a week. I live close by one of the locations. I've tried everything on the menu and I would give every dish 5 stars. The pizza, however, rises above the rest and is the best I have ever tried. The staff is very friendly and carry the attitude, or pride, that they own the restaurant. Never have I had a negative experience at Spinato's.
