Things have changed a bit since I started dining at The Coronado Cafe a few years ago and it is turning out to be for the good.  Everyone there is very friendly, the atmosphere is relaxed, the service is great and the food is excellent.  They are in the process of some menu changes and so far it is a plus.  If you have not tried it out you are missing something special.
