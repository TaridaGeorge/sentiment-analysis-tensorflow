Ohmygod, I just love this place. When you're out with friends Happy Hour at their Oyster Bar is perfect. It's a little crowded sometimes, but the prices are great! When you're having a sit down dinner, the setting is wonderful, dim lighting, great location. The food is amazing! Very fresh fish! My sister had a filet and said it was the best steak she has ever had. I've tried plenty from their menu here, my favorites so far are the Parmesan Lemon Crusted Sole, 
and the Australian Lobster Tails. The sides are all great, and they have a good selection of desserts. Probably one of my restaurants downtown.
