A friend and I decided to try this place after all the good reviews we read and it was awesome food. We started with the stuffed grape leaves which there were six of them and very tasty. Then we shared the gyros, chicken and beef kabob combination plate which serves two and came with a big plate of rice. All I can say is we were in heaven while eating this..everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly. We had a little rice and gyros leftover so the waitress packaged it up and filled the to go box with rice and extra sauce and pita..which came out to a full meal in itself. The place is a little small but filled up quickly and service was friendly and we never had to ask for anything. If your craving Greek food treat yourself to Eden's
