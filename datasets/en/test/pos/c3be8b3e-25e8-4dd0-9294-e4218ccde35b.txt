Okay so I've never golfed here, but I have toured the golf course in a cart that I'm sure was going 1mph and had a beer from a private party I wasn't invited to.  Does that count?

I was here the other day to pick some stuff up after we had a golf tournament and let me tell you, this place is awesome.  It's just out in the middle of nowhere and the course is beautiful.  There are wild bunnies-a-plenty that just dart here and there when you're driving by, lush green grass and the cutest little rocked filled streams.  The course has 36 holes and I'm sure if you actually play it, you'll love it. 

The staff is very friendly and helpful too and there is an on-site restaurant for you to have lunch at after your game.
