Great, old, elegant theatre.  I have such an appreciation and love for architecture, especially when the building has some character, age, grace, and beauty.  This is a prime example of that.  I saw Stomp! here some years back......and a few other shows., and they were all great..... the shows and, of course, the theatre.  Our seats have always been really good.
