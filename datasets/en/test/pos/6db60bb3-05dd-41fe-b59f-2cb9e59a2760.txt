GIGANTIC with TONS of stores! I was very overwhelmed at this two story MASSIVE complex of a mall!! I had such a hard time keep track of what direction I was headed, which floor I had explored already and what stores I was aiming for. Crazy BIG but everything you can imagine is here! It also has a large food court option with plenty of sit down restaurant options too! There's also a Harkins's theater, yogurtland, and much much more there, oh my gosh, I can't name all the stores! The list is too exhausting! But it's wonderful! Large parking lot to accommodate all the customers (which there are A LOT!) Fun place to come if you have the time to explore!!
