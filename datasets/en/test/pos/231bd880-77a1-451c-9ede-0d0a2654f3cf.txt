These reviews seem to be a mix of the Cafe and Coffee Bar, my review is specifically for the Coffee Bar.

The bar is in front of Nordstrom in the mail and is a rip-off of Starbucks, but a marked improvement. Starbucks coffee/espresso has an acidic and burnt flavor. Nordstrom's coffee is smooth and roasty. This is a popular place, the time from the entering the line and receiving your drink is usually 8-10 minutes.

If I'm in any sort of mood for coffee, I can't help but stop.
