We vacation in New Jersey and love Mister Softee. When we found out they had a franchise truck here in AZ we knew we had to book for our son's birthday. What a hit. They arrived a few minutes ahead of the scheduled time..that was a plus. He was friendly and had great product and customer service. Everyone from the youngest to the oldest enjoyed having a cold soft serve ice cream on a hot day. My son also received a Mister Softee shirt and replica truck bank that he absolutely loved.

I highly recommend Mister Softee to anyone that is throwing a childs birthday..heck I already told my husband that I don't want a gift for my birthday this year. I want a visit from Mister Softee.
