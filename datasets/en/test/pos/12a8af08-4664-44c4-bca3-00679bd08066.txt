It doesn't get much better than this. Friendly, personal attention from the owner immediately when you walk in, a welcoming, comfortable area to relax in, and an overall welcome addition to the myriad of independently-owned shops sprouting in this budding neighborhood of local activity. No longer must Phoenicians order overpriced e-cigarette products online and wait for delivery...they're now just down the street with affordable prices and extremely knowledgeable staff. Phoenix needs Butt Out.
