Probably the best sandwich shop in the area.  My favorite is the "SlawBeJo", with homemande roast beef, provolone cheese, cole slaw, russian dressing and mayo....and I don't even like cole slaw!...but it's so good with the roast beef!  Their sandwiches are unique in that none of the meats are your typical sliced meat..they are more like a "pulled" meat...so good!  

Clean place, friendly staff.

Expect a small wait, even if the place is empty...but it is soooo worth it!
