Hands Down my favorite Viet restaurant in the valley, The Bun bo Hue is the best! great lemongrass layers in the broth, the pork blood is a great authentic touch, gotta have it.  I also get the pho noodles in this one, instead of the thicker vermicelli thats traditional with Bun Bo Hue, but i like the wasy the thinner noodles pick up the soup!  Also try the Beef stew with egg noodle!  WOW  my fave comfort food at this place
