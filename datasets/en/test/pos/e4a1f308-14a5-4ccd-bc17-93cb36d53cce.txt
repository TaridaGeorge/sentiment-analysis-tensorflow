I have been going to Tuning Gr√ºppe for about 2 and a half years now.  Eric and the guys there are very friendly, knowledgeable, and also honest with the work that needs to be done.  They won't try to sell you a service/part if your car doesn't need it.  Not only have they worked on my VW Jetta, but my wife's Infiniti G20, my sister's Ford Fusion, and my mother-in-law's Olds. Alero.  I have also sent my friends there.  I would definitely recommend them to anyone that needs a good shop for their car(s).
