I haven't reviewed Lux yet, because so many of you have already got after it.  But the time has come and I must make my comment.

There isn't much to say.  Lux simply makes the best coffee in Phoenix.  I dare someone to challenge me on this fact.  It's a Saturday morning, and I have some work to do, but don't feel like staying home or heading into the office, you will find me sipping a great cup of joe and snipping some FREE WIFI!!

The only issue I have is this has become such a hot spot for everyone.  Why can't people keep secrets??????
