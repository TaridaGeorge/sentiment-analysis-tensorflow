Saw the deal in yelp! Wish i could buy more! 

My dad and I went in to eat on Sunday! We shared the Italian pizza!! The crust is the best I have ever had!! We also had the anti pasta salad! It had a great presentation! We also enjoyed that they had local beers!! We will be going back!

Totally outstanding food only set back was counter service, even though they brought the food out to our table.
