I really really dig this place.
I've only ever been for the Sunday brunch, on two occasions to be exact.

Both times I also got a bit drunk, because of the bottomless mimosas and bellinis.....

Both times I got the eggs benedict, and they were PERFECT
Loved the taste of the champagne hollandaise sauce.

So yeah, free booze, great food, seasonal menus, swank decor and super nice service = 5 stars!
