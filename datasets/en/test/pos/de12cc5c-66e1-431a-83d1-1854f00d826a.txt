Oh.My.God. Have I died and gone to grocery store heaven? I think so. Fancy Fry's, as I have renamed it, is 20 min from my house. I refuse to go to the Fry's near my house and now drive out of the way to go here. Wine bar, valet parking, samples all over the store. SAMPLES ALL OVER THE STORE! I want to run outside and yell it at everyone that walks by. And the dessert bar, Lord! If you hate grocery shopping like me, Fancy Fry's will make it a much more enjoyable experience.
