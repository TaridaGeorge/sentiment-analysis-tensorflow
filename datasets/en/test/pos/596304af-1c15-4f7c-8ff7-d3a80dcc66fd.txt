I think a common misconception about Trader Joe's is that it's a really expensive specialty grocery store, but that just isn't true.  They actually have really great prices and an awesome selection of organic, healthy and imported food items that you just can't find anywhere else.  
They have the best hummus and the flavors range from original to a blend of kalamata and black olives (my favorite). They have a good selection of Morningstar Farm products (for vegetarians) and they're cheaper here than you'll find at a grocery store.  They also have their own line of similar products in the frozen food aisle.  
Their wine selection is great and they have a little floral area that has beautiful and inexpensive arrangements.  Just try to get there during off-hours of the day or you'll be battling long lines. Trader Joe's is pretty small- and pretty popular!
