Delish!  The Toasted Coconut ice cream rocks!  Very creamy yet lots of texture in every bite with lots of toasted coconut throughout.   The dark chocolate was amazing!  Such a rich taste.  My family also had the icecream sandwiches, but they were sorry they got them. They felt like they were eating more cookie than ice cream.  So although they were very good, next time they will just get the pure icecream. Maybe a cookie on the side?  Such a cute place and the employees were very pleasant. Check it out!
