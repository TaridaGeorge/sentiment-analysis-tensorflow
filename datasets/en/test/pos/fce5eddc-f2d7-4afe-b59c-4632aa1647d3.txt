This is a great place to eat in the Biltmore area! I live really close, so we get there a lot...

I'm writing this review because I was there last night and had the special- a crispy duck breast with an arugula and cabbage salad and an orange vinaigrette.

It might have been the best salad I have ever had and would STRONGLY urge them to put that on their regular menu!

I usually get the Funghi (wild mushroom, goat cheese and truffle oil) pizza- but was glad I got the special!
