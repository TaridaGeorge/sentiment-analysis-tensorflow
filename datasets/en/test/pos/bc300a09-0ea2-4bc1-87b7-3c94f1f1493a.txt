Michele Pantera is an amazing seamstress! I have literally had her rebuild clothes for me. She's very accommodating and quick. She works out of her home (Deer Valley & Cave Creek Roads) and takes appointments between 10-5 Monday - Friday (Thursdays she'll go until 9 PM.) and she does one Saturday a month. BUT, if those times don't work for you, it's still worth a call because she'll do what she can to (in the words of Tim Gunn...) "make it work," if at all possible! 

I've used her for alterations, but I've seen custom designs, bridal and theater pieces she's been working on. 

Her prices are very reasonable and she offers a "stamp" for every $10 you spend and when you've racked up 10 stamps you get $20 of free services!
