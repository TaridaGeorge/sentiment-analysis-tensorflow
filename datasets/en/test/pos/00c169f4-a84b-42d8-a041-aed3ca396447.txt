I'm not a fan of buffets at all, but for Pink Pepper I always make an exception. The food is amazing and even worth the lunch price if you only get one plate!

Dinner is a little expensive but the food is still just as wonderful. The service is nice and the family always recognizes us. Big fan :} 

Give them your business!!
