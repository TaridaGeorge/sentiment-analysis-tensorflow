This really is a great grocery store for the rich and famous.  And since I am neither I frequent the Safeway up the road more often than not.  However, when I do come to AJ's I love checking out their bakery section.  They have some really talented pastry chefs here that always have some awesome creations on display.  The butchers are friendly too.  Check out their Kobe Burger patties, delicious!
