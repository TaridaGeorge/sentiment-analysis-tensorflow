This is our second visit to Picazzo's and we were very impressed this time around. The first visit our waitress forgot about us and I had to go in and ask the host for our bill. But the food was so good we had to come back for a second try. This time the food was still great and Nick did a great job waiting on us. I can't say anything bad about our visit as everything was perfect! We will definitely be back again
