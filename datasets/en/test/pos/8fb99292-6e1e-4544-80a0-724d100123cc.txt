4.5 stars! My awesome friend took me here and we ordered some scrumptious desserts!

French White Chocolate Bread Pudding 4/5
White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake  5/5

The ambiance is nice and if you order one of their whiskey drinks in comes in a fancy glass that rolls around in a circle. The bartender educated us and said its to add to the flavor. Awesome place! ;)
