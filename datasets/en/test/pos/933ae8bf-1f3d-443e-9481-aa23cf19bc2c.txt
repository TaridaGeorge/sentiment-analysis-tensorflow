I'm a huge fan. (except when I have to wait). The cornbread is to die for, I can literally eat a skillet as a meal! If you go, you must order it as a starter. The chicken is great but the filet has won my heart and I'm yet to meet one anywhere else to hold a candle. I also love the glazed carrots, but they never seem to have them anymore :(
