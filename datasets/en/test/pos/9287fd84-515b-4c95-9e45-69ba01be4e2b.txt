Drop and go.

I work nearby and we now have this down pat. I drive up... they take my car. Pay for the basics... and wave goodbye. Couple hours later I stop back with a tip for the crew out back. Rinse and Repeat. See ya in three weeks or after it rains. 

I even bring lunch to the manager every once in awhile to show my appreciation. Thanks guys!
