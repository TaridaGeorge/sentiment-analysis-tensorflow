I found this place purely by chance and it was a jewel of a find. Its tucked away and seems to only be known by the locals. Not very nice to keep a secret like this away from the rest of Phoenix. 
The wait staff wanted to know how I liked my meal and is there anything I believe would be better on the meal. They have wine and beer everything on the menu is healthy and did not taste processed or rushed. This place is also kid friendly inside and on the menu. 
They try to use local produce and cook seasonly but I'll never know because I've moved from Phoenix. This is a great place owned and run by great cooks and owners.
