Went to K O'Donnell's yesterday to watch college football and really enjoyed myself.  They have sound boxes so that you can hear your game and the bartenders are very attentive.  I had a salad which was very tasty.  

But the BEST thing about this place is that they have a free van that will pick you up from your house and take you back home when you are good and sauced.  This is a brilliant idea in a city where you have to drive 50 million miles to get anywhere and DUI checkpoints are every 10 feet.  BRILLIANT!
