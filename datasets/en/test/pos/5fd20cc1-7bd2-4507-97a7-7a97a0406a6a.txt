the new owner - Mike - is about as friendly a guy as you will find anywhere.  This is one of the major reasons for shopping with locally-owned owner-operated businesses - smart friendly people who care about service.

several people commented on the 'friendly place to sit and smoke and relax', and Mike listened and cut down the size of the cash register area in order to add more chairs and enlarge the customer lounge in front by the window.  one guy wrote that he can find better prices other places, but you will not find friendlier and more knowledgeable people to deal with anywhere.  Support your local businesses people.  It's not always about the price, consider the value too.
And the prices at Ford & Haig on the best cigarette tobacco you can find is still the best price I've found
