Great place to eat, I love the jalapeno hummus and the chipolte chicken lavosh pizza. The atmosphere is alive, great energy and has a fresh new look with a friendly staff. I think this is the largest Pita Jungle that I have seen it's defiantly the nicest location. Lots of seating inside and out. Can't wait for the weather to get warmer so we can enjoy the patio area. The best part of having this great new place is that its only 1 block away from where I live, perfect walking distance. 
The only thing I did not like about this place was that it closes way to early 10 pm and on First Friday it should stay open to at least 12 or 1am. Hope they adjust those hours soon, so Check it out.... =o)
