This is a great local establishment and rising landmark.  First off, the atmosphere is unmatchable for a refurbished 19th century house-turned bar.  Dim lit antique chandeliers, wood flooring, and Victorian-style wallpaper, make a perfect atmosphere for indulging in ice-cold draft craft brews or a great glass of wine.  And if you're looking for a satisfying bite, try the renown grilled cheese & tomato soup (some come from the suburbs just for this).  Great daily happy hour specials (pasta night is the best).  This is not the place for you if you're out for a rambunctious night out with a large group, but if your looking for a chill and inspiring atmosphere, and conversation with a few friends over some great drinks...this is perfect.
