We absolutely love Trustworthy Air. There is a reason for their name! Our AC unit went out during a storm, and after having two companies come out, we were told it had to be completely replaced. Mind you, my husband was out of work and it was NOT something we could afford. Our friends referred us to Trustworthy & they came out, evaluated the problem, and fixed it within a few hours, all for about $300. We had been getting the 'this is an old AC unit and you need a special part to.fix it, one that we don't carry anymore. We suggest replacing it' line.  We are so thankful for their honesty, hard work, and expedition in this process.
