I had the autumn spring rolls & the five spice pho. I LOVED it! I was so full I felt like my stomach would burst and I still wanted more it was so good. I've had "vegetarian" pho at another restaurant that the broth was bland and it was so overloaded with veggies it was distracting. They kept it simple with a sweet yet savory broth, veg meat (which was actually really good to my surprise), and even a vegan fish sauce. The owner (husband) was SO nice and even told me how to assemble my soup (which I already knew since I've had traditional pho many many times). The best thing is that everything on the menu is vegan (except for #31, which has egg noodles). I'm excited to go back and try some of the chef specials, they sound fantastic!
