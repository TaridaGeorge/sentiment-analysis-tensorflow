My mom is a total regular here.  This may be her 2nd home even.  So when I came to visit her, we had to go.  I had only done "hot yoga" one time before.  The teacher was wonderful - Christine.  The room was hot, I was sweaty, and I think I got lucky because the heater was new and still finding it's way to perfect so I didn't feel like I was going to faint!  I had run 12 miles two days before and afterwards my muscles were very relaxed.  The studio has a very nice vibe, welcoming and warm.  There are showers for after.  If you have been thinking of trying Bikram, check it out!
