The Orpheum Theater is a must-see part of Phoenix's culture.  It was built in the 1920's and there is always some fun event going on within its walls.  They have theater, dance and other productions, but they're also going to be hosting Arizona's first ever opera in December 2007 put on by the new Phoenix Metropolitan Opera.  Pretty fun, huh?
