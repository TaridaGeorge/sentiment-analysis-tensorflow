I've been going here for years and it never gets stale. It's almost perfect; I don't know where to begin.

* It has a DJ that's not too in-your-face (look up above the doors to the bathrooms)
* It's a melting pot: you see old people here and young people. Straight and gay. Uber-trendy and Brooks Brothers. Dates, friends, families.
* The drinks are stiff.
* The food is great.
* It's as good at midnight as it is at 11 AM.
* Great outdoor seating.

Seriously, what else do they need?
