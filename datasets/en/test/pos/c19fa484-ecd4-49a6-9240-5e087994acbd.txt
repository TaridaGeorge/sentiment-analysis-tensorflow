Unless my own family is making the food, it doesnt get better then this in Phx for hawaiian bbq. i was so happy to discover the opening of the mesa location. with uncommon but tasty items such as portuguese sausage, manapua (with the sweet pork), spam musubi, malasadas and saimin... the range of menu items is extraordinary!
Each item is top notch, I have indulged in the katsu, teri chicken, lau lau, kalua pig, mac salad, spam musubi, manapua, malasadas... and this is only visiting the location twice. 
My first time at L&L was in HI when growing up, then it franchised to Portland when i was in college, now that it is in Mesa, it might become the most frequented comfort food joint in town for me. 
I will be introducing many to it, by claiming it as "legit Hawaiian food"
