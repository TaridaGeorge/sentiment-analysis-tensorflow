I've been to Bevmo once and vowed never to go back - same prices as the grocery store, just bigger.  So I really really thought I would dislike Total Wine.

BUT... I like wine, and I like booze, and I really like to pay the least amount possible for my wine and my booze.  Total Wine's prices are cheap, especially in the liquor section.  Blows away the grocery store.  Prices are comparable to Costco, but a much bigger selection.  I bought a bottle of Ciroc vodka for 24 bucks or something ridiculus.

BONUS - I stopped in Saturday after the gym and got to try 5 or 6 different wines.  And I'm a sucker so I paid for two bottles outside my normal price range.  Its really win-win for everybody.

WooHoo is right.
