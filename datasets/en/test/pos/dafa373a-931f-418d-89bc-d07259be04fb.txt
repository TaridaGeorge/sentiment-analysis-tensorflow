East Valley Children's Center is just wonderful!  Our doctor, Dr. Neil Aaron is incredibly caring, funny and terrific with the kids! The truth is that all of the doctors at EVCC are absolutely fantastic, and we feel blessed to have them as our childrens' physicians.
The staff is also wonderful, and so incredibly helpful and caring.  There is also very little wait time and I am able to get an appointment pretty quickly when one of our children are sick.  The prices have always also been very reasonable. 
I can't say enough good things about this place--- I guess the only thing left is to send a big thank you to the doctors and staff for being such a blessing to our family!
