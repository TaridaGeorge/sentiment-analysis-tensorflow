All bfast burritos are great.  Wish the salsa was more flavorful/spicy.

Love that they have sundried tomato wraps.

Hummus plate for $5 is an absolute steal.  So big & good (homemade hummus, broccoli, tomatoes, carrots, etc.).

SUPER friendly & fast service, both inside and drive thru.  Love the decor/colors, vibe.

Espresso could be better, it was a little bitter.

I want to try everything on the menu.  It all sounds so great.
