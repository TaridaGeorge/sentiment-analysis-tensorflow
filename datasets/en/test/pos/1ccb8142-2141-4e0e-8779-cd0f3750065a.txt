We were in Phoenix for a wedding. We were treated to Friday night dinner for Pizza and salad and then on Saturday night they did the catering for the event. Let me start off by saying carbs are a treat. The pizza was warm and delish. The garlic knots were the bomb! Saturday night dinner was baked zitti, eggplant parm, chicken parm meatballs and salad. Everything was so good. The chicken was so tender you could cut it with a fork. The eggplant tasted like it was made with care and love. The meatball well don't get me started. I am back in San Diego still thinking about this place. They did a wonderful job getting people served with smiles all around. I was so impressed.  Maybe they will want to move to San Diego.....
