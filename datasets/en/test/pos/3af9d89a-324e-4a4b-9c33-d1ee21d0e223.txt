The friendly efficiency of the service at this little joint always amazes me. Outside seating offers a great view to watch Zen 32 patrons barely dodge incoming traffic from, indoor seating is probably great if you're alone and enjoying the WiFi. 

The coffee is coffee shop coffee. Not award winning but not terrible. They manage to make mochas and chai lattes that don't immediately send people into insulin shock if you like those drinks, which is worth any stars off from weird indoor seating layouts.
