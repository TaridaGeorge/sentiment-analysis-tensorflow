This place is always fun and the drinks are pretty good. If you love singing along then this is your place. The pianos are always going, and for the right price, you can always request a song. I think the fact that it's in the basement is awesome; I mean 4 places to go out at, all stacked on four floors. You don't find that in Phoenix anywhere to my knowledge.

If you're going on a weekend night (Thurs-Sat) be prepared to get here early. It fills up fast, despite the cover, and finding tables is difficult regardless of your party size. There are bars at the entrance, and another on the far side (lowest level) next to the stage. Plenty of servers around to help.

Just come prepared to have a good time, some cash for cover, and early if you want to get a table.
