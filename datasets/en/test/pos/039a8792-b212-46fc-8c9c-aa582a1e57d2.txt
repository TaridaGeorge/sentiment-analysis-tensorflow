Quite simply a perfect spot to grab a drink- anytime.   We stopped in to grab some mimosas mid-morning while in town on vacation. The bartender was very friendly and accommodating.  

We didn't grab food this go 'round- but I know that it is very good if I had to compare it to the NoRTH in Austin.  

The atmosphere is very inviting with open windows and (extra *) PURSE HOOKS!  :)
