Great customer service! 
This is where I usually buy my undergarments. I bought a bra and after a few times wearing it one of the straps broke. 
I took it back to the store. I didn't have the receipt, so I was assuming they would not be able to take it back. The gal that helped me said it would be no problem at all and gave me store credit. She was so nice and never even questioned the situation. 
They provide complimentary fittings and the dressing rooms are beautiful. 

PS. Ladies, try the new Incredible Bra. It really is incredible!
