Best fish joint in town. Worth every penny. Here is what I ate tonight:

Kettle One Martini Shaken on the Rocks - Great start

Sashimi Platter - BEST ahi tuna in the Valley, great poke, amazing marlin

Shrimp Cocktail - Perfect HUGE shrimp

Shrimp and Crab Chopped Salad - One of the best salads I've had in a while. Tons of shrimp and crab with blue cheese, walnuts, avocado

Onion Rings with Blue Cheese Fondue Sauce - Holy shit

Sole with lemon sauce  - yum

Crab Stuffed Shrimp - REALLY garlicky but still very good

Saut√©ed Spinach - perfect

Ice Cream Sundae with hot fudge - hells to the yeah

Cinnamon Apple Crisp with Ice Cream - Slice of heaven

Brandy-Cinnamon Bread Pudding - good

I ate ALL this and still want to go back for more. I've never had a bad meal here. 5 stars every single time.
