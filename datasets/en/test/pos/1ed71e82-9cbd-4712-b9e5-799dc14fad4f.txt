My roommate lost his key, so I had to get him a new one since he's currently out of town. I went to the Melrose District to get him a spare key since this location is the closest to my new humble abode. 
I was very impressed on how fast he made the key. At $1.95, it took less than a minute. Now that's fast! You cannot miss this place, and it is very easy to spot. Look for the pink sign on the side of the road.
