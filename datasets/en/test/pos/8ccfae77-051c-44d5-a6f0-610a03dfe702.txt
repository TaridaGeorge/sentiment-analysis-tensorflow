Thank you Kristen for coming out same day and saving me!  I slept wrong on vacation (truth is I did not take my pillow and paid for it) so my neck was killing me and she came out to loosen me up so I can sleep.  She advised me on how to stretch to keep it loose and was great.  She has both a table or chair massage options that she brings in her ride to MY HOME...what else can I say it is a great service.
