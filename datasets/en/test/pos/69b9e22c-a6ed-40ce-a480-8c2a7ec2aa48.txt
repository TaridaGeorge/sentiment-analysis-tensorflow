Holy delicousness! I was SO in the mood for a good sandwich....which we all know is few and far between. Everything about this place screamed great sandwich shop. But the best part...the toasted sesame roll. I don't care what kind of sandwich you order off their menu, just get it on that roll. I am so excited for my next sandwich craving so I can go back!
