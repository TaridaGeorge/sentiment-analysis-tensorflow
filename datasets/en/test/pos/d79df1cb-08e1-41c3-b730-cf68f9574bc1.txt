this place, which is part of the w hotel, is officially my favorite sushi place. first, i love this restaurant's restroom; never seen such interesting, modern men's room anywhere else. excellent food, great ambiance - expectedly saw several couples on their date dinners. awesome sushi. 

edamame, various plates of sashimi, bunch of rolls. all excellent food.
never expected such good sushi in the desert (scottsdale, az)
