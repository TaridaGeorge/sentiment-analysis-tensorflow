Had lunch here today, and what a beautiful little restaurant it is.

Fettuccine Alfredo was perfection, the salad and bread were top notch, the service was impeccable, and the atmosphere cozy. My friend had the Halibut (I think it was a special) and it looked amazing.

I will definitely be back for dinner soon.

L'amore is located at 32nd and Lincoln, on the South West corner.
