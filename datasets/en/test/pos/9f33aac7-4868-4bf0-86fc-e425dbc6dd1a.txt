awesome wait staff, delicious food and really strange atmosphere. you'll feel like you stepped into a different world with the moose antler lamps and cowhide maps on the windows... but maybe that's the point! our waitress was very sweet and gave us some great suggestions like the duck which my husband ended up ordering. it was juicy and savory! I orded the heirloom tomato salad--very small so don't expect it to fill you up but it was definitely flavorful! I saw a previous reviewer mention the green chile mac & cheese so I couldn't resist. It was by far the best thing I had all night! We will be going back to try all the other recommendations
