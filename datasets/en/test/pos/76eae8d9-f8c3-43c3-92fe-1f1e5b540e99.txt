Wow, people either love or hate this place. I'm a lover. I look for the best in things. Positive outlook. All that... If you go when they're super busy, which they often are, service isn't going to be the best you've ever had. But it's always been good. I went last week for a late lunch and the server and the Chef sat down at my table with me to discuss vegan options. It probably was the best service I've ever had. Three menu options you should try: the guac. Just try it. They queso fundido is probably my favorite menu item at any restaurant. I dream about it. And their jack-based sangria. Mmmmm. On busy nights be prepared to wait for a table. For a long time.
