I love Tottie's!!  I even came to the restaurant for my prom "date" night.  I have been to this restaurant several times for special occasions or birthday parties.  My favorite drink there is the Thai iced tea, but their regular iced tea is also extraordinary.  This is by far my favorite restaurant.  The owner is very warm and sincere.  She even comes by the tables when she isn't cooking to greet her customers.  The food sometimes is a bit pricey, but the food is worth it.  It is authentic food, not overly processed soggy asian food you get at some other places.  If you are wanting to go to have REAL food, with quality service and a nice atmosphere, go to Tottie's.  :)
