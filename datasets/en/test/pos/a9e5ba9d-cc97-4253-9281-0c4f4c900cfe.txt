This is the place... If you know sushi, you will love Shiro. If you don't, you will love Shiro.

If you remember Ayako from the AZ Biltmore, then you will know why the sushi here is so good. Three reasons, fresh, fresh and fresh...

I will elaborate. The fish is certainly among the freshest and best grade I've encountered anywhere. But, also, the vegetables used are always perfectly fresh and crisp. This is not very common in most sushi restaurants.

My only drawback is that Shiro is tucked in a strange location in a corner of a strip mall. However, the decor is beautiful and modern.

Say hello to Hiro when you visit...
