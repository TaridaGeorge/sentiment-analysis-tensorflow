Even more options at Jolta - no one in town is offer this much fresh, homemade GF indulgence.  They even have a couple vegan ones, and Jewel - i love the new pumpkin bread!  keep it up.  I recommend to GF patients, though we have to watch the sugar too... i get addicted too easy some days I eat two:)
