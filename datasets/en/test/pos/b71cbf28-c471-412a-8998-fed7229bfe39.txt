The food is so amazing-. We have been 5 times now. It is a true spluge(caloric)- Fried chicken really isnt as easy to make as people think and they have it down to a perfection. The collard greens are as authenic as you can get. I love the waffles as well as the thick syrup.  My kids are young and I still have to cut their food for them, so I want to request a boneless chicken breast, just so I can get  to my food sooner!  Actually I bet alot of people would like a piece of boneless chicken, not me I love the legs and thighs. There are lots of people who wont eat meat off the bone (Weirdo's). Anyhow try this gem.
