First visit tonight.  Was reassured when I saw how packed the place was. A little tucked away place with the most awesome sushi ever!  My family has decided they didn't want to go to any other sushi restaurant but this one. Sushi was fabulous!  My ears perked up when I heard the sushi chefs speaking to each other in Japanese!  I haven't heard that since my childhood in Japan!  Explains why the sushi was so good- it is authentic. Going back tomorrow per family's request!
