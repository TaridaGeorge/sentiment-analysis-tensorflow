It was my son's 3rd birthday party and we decided to keep it simple and order 4 sub sandwich trays from Subway down the street. Best decision we could have made. They made it so easy for us and did a fantastic job! Quite a few people at the party mentioned how good the sandwiches were and couldn;'t believe they were from Subway (don't know why). They gave us a ton of veggies on the side and even more condiments. Everything was ready right on time, food was fresh and made as we had ordered it. We will definitely use them for our next party.
