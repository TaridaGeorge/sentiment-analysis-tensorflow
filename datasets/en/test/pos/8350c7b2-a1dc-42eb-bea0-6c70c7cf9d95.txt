The linguine and white clam sauce is really, really, really yummy as is the chicken marsala. 

The pizza is amazing!!! Much better than the other pizza joint that has had a lot of hype and a 2 hour wait.

The wait can be long here but we are usually early eaters so have no problems.. The staff is awesome and very friendly.
