My family and I stayed at the Kierland Villas which is just next door to the course.  Accommodation was great but having the golf course within walking distance was even better.

We just came back from the trip.  Middle of July in AZ is not for the faint of hearts.  Everyday was 100+ degrees and playing golf was challenging.  BUT, I would LOVE to come back and stay at the Villas and play the course again.

Condition despite the heat was excellent.  Staff were super friendly and helpful.  30 min interval between tee offs were unheard of.  $55 green  fee (for resort guests) was an absolute steal.

Thank you Kierland for a wonderful time.
