"Best Coffee I have ever had." This was the remark from a friend whom I took to Cartel for the first time today.

The place has attitude and is willing to call a customer out. Something I would love to do more than I can. If you want Caramel, or Vanilla, or a Milk Shake, or a Burrito, or Cotton Candy you need to go somewhere else. This is a Coffee shop.

They roast their own beans so they are fresh and tasty.
