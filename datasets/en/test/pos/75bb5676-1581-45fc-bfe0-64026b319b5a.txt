Their rum bar has now been open a while and flights are available.  I was never a rum aficionado - too many rum n cokes when I was too young to care about such things - and have now discovered a whole new world.

The food has become nothing short of spectacular.  

The ambiance - from the inside I can pretend I'm in the West Village circa 1975 by Greenwich and Horatio.  Doesn't get any better than that.
