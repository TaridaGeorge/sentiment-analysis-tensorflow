Was just chatting with Eli and he said I should write a review on this place...Well, he pretty much said it all...I will add a few things:  You need to use the spa while you are there!  Make an appt. for a massage...and if there is time, get a facial (if available)...this is such a huge treat!!!  Male or female, just do it!!!
Also, if you golf, and I do upon a rare occasion, PLAY on their course...it is not to difficult and not too easy either...when you make your reservations for the hotel, have them make golf reservations at the same time (especially if you are there during their "season").
HIGHLY...HIGHLY recommend this hotel!!!
