Once again, Modern Steak never fails, or even comes short of greatness. Went here for a birthday lunch with a group and had an excellent time. We all ordered the pink diamond which is a delicious champagne drink with some acai and fruit juice, so you don't feel guilty. I was getting my vitamins that morning. They brought out fresh hot bread with this herb butter that melted over. It was gone in a blink of an eye. I ordered the turkey burger which was very filling and delicious. For dessert they brought out this chocolate cake that had layers and layers of good stuff. I have no idea what it was. It tasted salty, crunchy, moist, and above all full of chocolate. Thanks again Modern Steak.
