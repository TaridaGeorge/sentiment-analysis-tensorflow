This was my first desert hike. We did the Gateway Loop. Rated a "moderate" level trail we had a nice walk with awesome city and desert/mountain views throughout, though the heat and elevation of the trial did test us at times. Nothing a quick break and drink couldn't repair.              

    We also went in a counterclockwise direction. 

   This area has many well marked trails for all experience levels. Take a lot of water with you, and don't wait until 10:00am to start on a 90 plus degree day! 

  Great experience!!
