Shauna gives the best haircuts and highlights I've ever had.  I'm pretty low maintenance with my hair, but I always go to Shauna for my one haircut a year. 

It's been a while since I've color treated my hair and I'm ready for a change.  I've made an appointment and I know all I'm going to have to say is "make me look like I just got back from the beach."  Perfect every time.
