Yes.

It just does not get any better for people watching.

The heavy woman with the tight Cardinals t-shirt and shorts that crept into the moist and dark gap of her legs. Each step seemed labored. The noise of her sweaty thighs grinding and slipping on each other sounded like a child eating pudding.

The slutty looking girl with a low-riding blouse that barely covered the rims of her areolae - each as pink as a kitten's nose.

The gruff looking guy that probably had a necklace made of ears in Vietnam. 

This place is fantastic for the variety of the trainwrecks that shop the aisles.

And the prices aren't so bad either.
