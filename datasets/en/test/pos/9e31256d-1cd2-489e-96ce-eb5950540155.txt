Personalized service without a hard sales pitch.  Both Jonas and Anthony are very professional, and have a wealth of knowledge that they openly share.  They helped me select a bike that is perfect for me, and offer free tune-ups/servicing for the life of the bike. They even delivered the bike to my house - EXCELLENT SERVICE!
