I took my new puppy to Ingleside and they got her set up on the puppy package. It was a resonable price for all three rounds of her shots and a full year's supply of heartworm meds. Everyone there is very informative and friendly. My puppy was soaking up the attention and compliments from everyone! 
I've had a bazillion questions every time I've gone in, as this is the first puppy I've owned myself. The vet and vet assistants all helped me during this new learning experience. 
I thoroughly enjoyed the new building, and so did the pup. It's state of the art, and inviting. I love all the beautiful photos on the walls with animal's info and if they were adopted, etc.
