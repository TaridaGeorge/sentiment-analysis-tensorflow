Gilbert  Ortega has one of the most amazing displays of native american art, the first time I went with a friend of mine the Ceo Robin came out personally and walked us around the store we were guided through some native american history and culture. 

They have some amazing pottery and dazziling silver jewelry to fit every budget from $10.00 to $10,000 or more...

Hey they even let you put jewelry on Layaway and make payments then they will ship it to you. I have found that the best time and the only time that they have sales is during the peak of summer...

If you can handle the heat ( and it ain't easy) then check it out then I have gotten some great buys at that time

Ask for Nellie she is very friendly and helpful
