This place was great. We went in after seeing the reviews. It was a little.confusing at first with order your meal from the cashier with a paper menu. We ordered the hummus, flatiron steak, picnic salad and the zebra brownie. The steak was cook right at what I ordered, medium rare. My wife's salad was fresh and the zebra brownie was delicious. I intend to go there again and try them for lunch.
