Such a cool place!  Really, Kazimierz has it all.  

First of all, there is the fantastic fun of finding it.  Lead by twinkling lights, you'll be met by an imposing brown door, above which reads, "The Truth Is Inside." 

Once inside your eyes will need to adjust to the palpable darkness.  It almost feels as though you've stumbled into something secret, a kind of portal to some Moroccan speakeasy of the past.  The general atmosphere is quiet, yet energetic, and live music- on the night we went a DJ, adds to the general vibe of "coolness."

Besides the superb atmosphere, the wine list is nothing short of incredible.  It goes on for pages and pages, traversing the globe several times over.  An easy place to let your mind get tiffany-twisted, because there's surely plenty of time and money to be spent at Kazimierz.
