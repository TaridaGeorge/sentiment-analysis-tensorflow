Essence remains a wonderful bakery and wonderful spot for breakfasts, brunches and lunches. 

Catchphrase cliche but totally applicable, brief summary of Essence's essence: A gem of a place.

Bonus round: Their macroons are omfg! 

Statement from my review 2-years ago still stands:
"This is how breadstuffs and cookies should taste; there's just a perfect balance of sweetness, creaminess, saltiness and flavor in eat morsel that gets placed out for sale at this bakery and it is such a refreshing, needed, and welcomed change from corporate bakeries which push hypersweet everythings on people these days."
