If this place were only closer to downtown, I would be there every weekend.  The biscuits and gravy are amazing and simply the best.  The chef is awesome and the service is wonderful.  They do a great job turning over tables and the size of the place keeps it from experiencing a Matt's-like backup outside.  Kudos to you guys at Breakfast Joynt for running such a tight ship.  I'm always impressed by great service from everyone.  We'll be back, without a doubt.
