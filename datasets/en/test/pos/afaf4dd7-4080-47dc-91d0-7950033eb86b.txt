As Manhattan sashimi snobs, we were surprised to find this restaurant in Scottsdale.  While not up to top NYC standards, it was definitely reliable for an enjoyable and solid Sushi and sashimi meal.  The rolls were top quality utilizing local fresh ingredients.  The ankimo was excellent.  Staff was kind.
