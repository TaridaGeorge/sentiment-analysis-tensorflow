I was moving out of my apartment and needed my carpet cleaned ASAP and done well. It was a cream colored carpet and it looked more like chocolate! I called them up and was very impressed by the level of customer service. When I spoke to Mike, he was very friendly and polite. They did a wonderful job! It looked just as good as when I moved in! I highly recommend them! You won't be sorry!
