I absolutely love visiting the JW Marriott when I come for a vacation from Calgary.  I have stayed in both the hotel and the timeshares, and always go home relaxed.  Even if I am not staying on the property, my family and I will often visit a restaurant or the spa.

The spa is absolutely fabulous!  On my last visit, I dropped off my bags at my house, and went straight to the spa for a pedicure.  It was expensive, but worth every penny.  It lasted for a month!!!  I can't wait to go back - it was a great way to start my trip in total relaxation.
