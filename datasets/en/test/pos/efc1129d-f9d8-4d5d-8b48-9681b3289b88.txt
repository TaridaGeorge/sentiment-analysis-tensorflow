5 stars all the way! Probably best chicken fingers in town! Get the box deal with toast, fries, chicken fingers, delicious! Many different sauces to choose from! Also, when you bring a new customer (friend) with you, you and your friend get an extra chicken for free! :) Chicken is always super juicy and steaming hot on the inside, I don't know how the owner does it, but it's amazing, every time! The only thing that sucks are their inconsistent, and always changing, hours of operation, so make sure you call, or check online first before you head out.
