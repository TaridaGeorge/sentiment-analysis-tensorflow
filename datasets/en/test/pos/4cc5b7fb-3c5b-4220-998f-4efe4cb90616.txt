I am a huge fan of this place.  Normally this place is packed, but its worth the wait.  The wine selection is great and the bruschetta is by far my most favorite thing on the food menu.  I am salivating just thinking about the bruschetta -- all different varieties for different pallettes.  mmm...  The paninis look delicious, too, but I haven't tried them yet b/c I always end up with the delicious bruschetta.  I normally have a hard time pairing it down to just four choices of bruschetta.  The vibe of this place is loungy and comfortable, which is nice.  And on a nice day, the doors/windows are open, so there is a very airy feeling to the place.  My only complaint is how small the tables are and how squooshed together everyone is.  But, if you are with a good crowd, you won't even notice.
