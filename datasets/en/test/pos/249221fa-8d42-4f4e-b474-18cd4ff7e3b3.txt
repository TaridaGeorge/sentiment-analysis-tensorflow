Great place, great food, I would still like to see them get a full time hostess as it gets a little confusing at times up front.  You can always tell who has never been here before as their look of confusion when they walk in and see a crowd.  By the time they realize they were supposed to write their name on the piece of paper they have been cut in line by 10 regulars that know the process, usually doesn't make them happy.  I have seen people walk out due to this.

Anyways, once you know the system of signing in, the wait is worth it, just a great place to bring the family.
