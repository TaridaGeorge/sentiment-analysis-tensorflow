Great restaurant.
The ambience was awesome.  Think Rat Pack 1960's with modern appointments (flat screen near the bar, etc.).  I took my wife for her birthday.  I fully recommend the oysters rockefeller...best I have ever had!  The filets are good, very tender.  Triple creme brulee for dessert was wonderful.  Staff was incredibly professional.  You will get what you pay for.  Expect about $200 for a complete meal with a cocktail.

Great time.  I shall return.
