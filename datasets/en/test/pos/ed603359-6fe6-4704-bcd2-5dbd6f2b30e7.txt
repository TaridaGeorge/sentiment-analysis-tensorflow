I've been going to Gold Bar for years -  it was the first coffee shop my sister-in-law Jena took me to when I moved here 10 years ago. The service is always great - this is truly the Cheers of coffee shops. 

Andrew is always there in the mornings with a smile, ready to help. The eclectic decor makes it feel really cozy, and the fact that outlets adorn the walls and there's free wifi make this one of my favorite places to work.

Oh, and get the chai, it's insane!
