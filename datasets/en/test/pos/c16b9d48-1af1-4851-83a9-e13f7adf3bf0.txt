I haven't had the best of luck with tailors...being only 5'2, I ALWAYS need to get my pants hemmed, but somehow they always end up too short or the stitching comes out! I was a little nervous about getting my first pair of True Religions hemmed, but after picking them up today I see that I had nothing to worry about!

Valentina was super friendly and did an awesome job. She even did a reattached hem for my jeans at a very reasonable price, and in a timely manner. I'll definitely be going to her for any future alterations, especially when I need to get my bridesmaid's dress fitted in a few months!
