All I can say is WOW!!! This is hands-down the best barbecue place I have eaten at EVER!!! The Ribs are ginormous and juicy, and when Dave pulls the Ribs out of the smoker, they smell just like someone is roasting marshmallows and burnt them. So this IS a place you need to go to. So get off the computer and drive there RIGHT NOW!!!!
