Everyone has a favorite pizza joint. 

Grimaldi's isn't really a joint it's a bit more upscale, nice atmosphere and this location in Chandler is awesome to eat at on the patio (when it isn't 115 degrees outside). The pizza is thin crust, full-flavored and it's easy to scarf an entire pie without even realizing it.

If you have outta towners looking for a good place to go for authentic pizza and good service, Patsy Grilmaldi's is the place to go. Hand's down.
