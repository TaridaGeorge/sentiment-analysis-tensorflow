If mastication is your thing than this place is "Absolute Foodgasm!"

The last time I had BBQ Rib-Tips this good, I was in Charleston, SC, in a place called Sticky Fingers, and the year was 1995! I've been looking for a place in Phoenix for the past 16 years & I'm happy to say I finally have found it! 

You do not pay for the ambiance of a five star restaurant in this joint. This place is an absolute whole in the wall, down & dirty, & smells like a smokehouse shack! So if you want to impress someone on a first date, it's probably not the place to dine (there is Take-Out!) Definitely not a place to take clients you want to impress either! (Did I mention Take-Out?) 

But if you want to have BBQ that is finger licking good, than Stacy's Smokehouse is your kinda joint!
