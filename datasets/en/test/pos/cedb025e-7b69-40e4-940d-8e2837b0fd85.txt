I crave Zen-Zen Yogurt, especially a spicy meal at Pei Wei. I'm glad they always have AT LEAST one sugar free option. They also offer several fresh berries, when in season, on the toppings as well as several nut toppings, e.g. walnuts, almonds, peanuts, etc..The place is always very clean and the staff is very friendly. There is plenty of seating. Great place to get take out as well.
