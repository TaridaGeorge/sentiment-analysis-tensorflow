Stumbled upon Yupha's last month. I got there just as lunch service was ending. But they still served me. I got the lunch special red curry chicken. It was phenomenal. It's one of my favorite Thai dishes and this one has a particularly good lip smacking red curry flavor. The soup was good too. I haven't been back yet but the dinner menu looked inviting. From my experience, this place has excellent Thai food. I highly recommend you try it.
