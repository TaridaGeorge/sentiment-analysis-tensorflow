My first trip to Munch A Mania was a great one.  The owners were super friendly and polite, and I was surprised that there were quite a few people in the store, considering it's in a strip mall.

My bagel with cream cheese, bacon and tomato was a delicious combination that I never would have thought of myself.  The bagel sandwich and a 16oz soda was less than $5... cheaper than McDonald's or Chompie's for sure.  (Also, they have Barq's Red Cream Soda!)

Because it's on the north side of University Drive, it's easy to stop by if you're one of the many people who commute to ASU/Downtown Tempe from the 101.  Quick service, delicious food, and friendly people.
