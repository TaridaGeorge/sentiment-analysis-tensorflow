I was in charge of our company holiday party.  We like to go to local venues and support the community.  Our party was on a Wednesday which is also 50% off wine bottles - great special.  I had pre-ordered tapas - Catalunya pumpkin, Puerto Rican Plantain, Havana flatbread, Cuban style shrimp, Mushroom stuffed piquillo peppers, Beef Colombian Quesadilla - great choices! 

We ordered off the menu and were blown away with the presentations by Executive Chef Randy and his team.  We couldn't pass up the delicious desserts - pumpkin flan, chocolate five ways and warm cinnamon donut holes w/warm ganache.  Free valet parking is wonderful especially being downtown Phoenix.  Everyone treated us warmly.  We will be back as a group and indivdually.
