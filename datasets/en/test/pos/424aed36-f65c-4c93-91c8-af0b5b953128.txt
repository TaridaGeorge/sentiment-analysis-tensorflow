If you like sports bars/ restaurants you'll love this place. During spring training lots of Giants fans hang out here and the food is great. There is lots of different types of draft beer and the service is excellent. My wife and I went there a couple of days ago and at this time of year there isn't a lot of activity in that area of town. Even at this time of year the food is great.
