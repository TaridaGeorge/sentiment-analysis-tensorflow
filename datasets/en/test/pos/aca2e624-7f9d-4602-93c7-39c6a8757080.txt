the absolute best Chinese food I've had outside of the two coasts (east or west, take your choice)! Had the sampler platter (pu pu to those initiated) everything was perfectly cooked. From the veggie eggroll or spring roll if you prefer, to the chicken stick, to the crab ragoon. Clean and appetizing presentation along with great flavors equals best Chinese food in town!!! No joke, and for the record I don't work there or know anyone who does, just had to rave about the best Chinese I've had in years.
