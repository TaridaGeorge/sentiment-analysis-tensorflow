Amazing food and service.  Stacy was our server and the best server I've had in a long time (I travel and eat out quite a lot). She guided us through the menu and was extremenly knowledgeable and friendly. To be honest, I had low expectations for a BBQ place but Stacy wowed us. I ordered the prime rib and baby back ribs for myself since I couldn't decide. It was the best decision I made.  The special sauce was delicious and Stacy gave a little bit of their original and spicy sauce. Everyone at the table was extremenly happy with dinner. We will definitely go there again if we come back to Phoenix!
