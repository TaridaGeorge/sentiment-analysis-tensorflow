Our first visit to Swensen's was great. We came for banana splits. Great choice of ice cream flavors & toppings made for tough decisions. We were down in the area from the Prescott  area which has seen even Baskin Robbins close down. Server was attentive & helpful. Plan on going back next time we are down in the valley.
