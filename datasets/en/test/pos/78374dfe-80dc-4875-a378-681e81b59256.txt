Stayed here for a weekend to attend a football game at the nearby Cardinals Stadium.  Hotel staff was very friendly and were over-the-top helpful with any questions we had about the area.

The rooms were spacious and clean.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in the sports complex area of Glendale.
