Just found my favorite spa in the valley! Had a scrub and facial with Ranee yesterday and it was heaven! I literally fell asleep for a little bit while the mask was on. This facial was the best I've ever had and I cannot recommend Ranee enough! Serious pampering and my skin feels awesome. The products they use at the spa are great- I usually prefer Aveda products but these were really nice. I did not leave feeling gooey at all. I can't wait to go back and thankfully their prices are reasonable, so I can return sooner rather than later!
