You must try two things: the potato cream cheese bread bowl, and the chicken pesto sandwich.  And your child will LOVE their grilled cheese.  (I may or may not have ordered it myself a few times!)
Great drinks too. This is a perfect place to eat in the mall...it's away from the food court and noise.
