Best green chile tamales I've ever had (though I have not eaten too many tamales)!  And only $1.30 each!  I revisited the bakery to buy a 1/2 dozen more!  Tamales I've eaten in the past have been dry and flavorless- these are the total opposite- moist and packed w/ pork and masa.  Flavorings were just right for me- not spicy but still flavorful.

I also tried 3 different empanadas- queso, guava & mango- all delicious and $.65 each. Flaky crust with oozy filling.  

Like another Yelper said, they could have totally charged more- it was pretty empty & quiet when I stopped in here (middle of a weekend afternoon) so they may be busier at other times.  The lady behind the counter was very patient with me, as I asked her what everything was and pondered over what to purchase.
