If there's one place I miss in Arizona it's definitely Liberty Market. Part of the burgeoning Downtown Gilbert restaurant scene, Liberty Market is a fresh and relaxing restaurant with a delicious and diverse menu. Though I tend to order the same items (the Far East salad and the zebra brownies), everything I've ever eaten there was delicious. The staff is always friendly as well. Can't wait to go back when I visit AZ in December.
