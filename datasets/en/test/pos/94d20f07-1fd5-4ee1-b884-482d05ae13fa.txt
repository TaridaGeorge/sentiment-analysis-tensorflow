As Debbie W said... "I wish I lived closer".  I tried the Hatch Burger, this spicy treat was perfect and smothered in cheese and hatch chili sauce. But the one thing that really made my night was the Chipotle Raspberry wings.  I thought I was in heaven eating them.  By the time the Hatch Burger arrived I was full so the burger didn't get the full attention it deserved.  I tried a taste of hubby's beer and well it was also very good, I just can't remember the name of it.  I have to say if I lived closer we would be there at least once a week for burgers.  Much better then where I usually end up.  

Excellent job tonight!  You guys rocked it out of the park and I really enjoyed it.
