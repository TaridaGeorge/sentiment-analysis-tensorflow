My favorite place to go when the weather becomes a tick cooler than the seventh circle of hell.  Best French onion soup on the planet, and a most fantastic variety of beer (plus good cocktails, if that's what the doctor calls for).  

The best part has already been mentioned -- that there is a huge variety of people come here and everything goes.  There is nothing you could show up in that would raise eyebrows, as evidenced by Greg P.'s most amusing nut hugger shorts and vomit story.  Love!
