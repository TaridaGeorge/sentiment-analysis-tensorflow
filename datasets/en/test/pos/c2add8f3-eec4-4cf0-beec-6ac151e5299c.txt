This hidden gem is the best place to eat on Mill Ave. Seriously good BBQ! Staff really explains each item well and gets you excited about what you are going to eat. They are super friendly too. 

The Brisket is soooo amazing it melts in your mouth. I get the Moist Brisket, side of coleslaw, bun, and the spicy bbq. I put it all on together on the bun... and for those few minutes I'm in heaven. Seriously try it....Sooo good. 

I'm hooked. I've eaten there pretty much everyday since they opened. Cheers!
