Just found out about this spot and went there on a date on Friday and had a great time. Atmosphere was cool, sorta hip type place. Food was great and service was outstanding (I don't typically use the word outstanding). We got the edamame, buddha spring roll, veggie pho, and salmon entree and it was all great. I think all of that was under $40 too..will be back.
