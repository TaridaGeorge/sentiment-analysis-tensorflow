I don't know why I haven't reviewed this place yet.  This is one of the best places in the Scottsdale/Tempe area to go for a filling, delicious, healthy meal.  I love, love, love their soups.  Their sandwiches and "burgers" are pretty tasty too.  The only thing I could ask for is that they start offering at least one gluten free bread option, like Chompies's gluten free rolls (so far the best gluten free bread option I have had), so that individuals with gluten sensitivity can enjoy their sandwiches and burgers.
