First timers to this park on an early Sunday morning. Me, my bf, and our 2 old English bulldogs had a great experience. 

You can choose between the active or passive dog park. We choose active but also decided to keep our dogs on leash being our first time and all. 

We were immediately greeted by a woman and her 2 boxers, very friendly. We walked the perimeter of the park to get our dogs use to being around other dogs and talked to several people along the way. 

We did have a small incident when a dog snapped at our dog but no harm, no foul. 

Looking forward to bringing the dogs here again!
