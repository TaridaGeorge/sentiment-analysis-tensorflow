Love this place. I make it there on Fridays for happy hour and the bar area is almost full by 5pm. Always something great to watch on their many TV's. Food is outstanding, for as long as I can remember I have not had a bad plate of anything. Wings are superb, nachos are best around! Friendly staff and the new management that is out on the floor greeting customers and checking on things. Highly recommended if in the area.
