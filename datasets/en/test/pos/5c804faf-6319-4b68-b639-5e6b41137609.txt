i've been buying birthday cakes here since i was about eight years old and this was the only authentic taiwanese bakery in town.  i live in chandler and would only get to go to the bakery if we went to temple on sundays or if it was my birthday and i was picking up my cake.  but it really brings back memories of home and makes my birthday that much more special.  i love the traditional fresh fruit cake the best, though the cappuccino, hazelnut, mango, and tiramisu cakes were also very good.  i don't know who else makes their cakes as light and fluffy and beautiful in the valley.  wish they'd move to the east valley so i could get my fix of their steamed buns and bread!  asahi, thanks for being so great!
