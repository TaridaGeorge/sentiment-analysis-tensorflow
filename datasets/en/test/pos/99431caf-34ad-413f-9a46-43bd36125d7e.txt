Karri, was an amazing person with a wonderful heart. She took her time explained the laser hair removal process and what needs to be done. She is not only detailed but, very careful with sensitive skin. Karri is wonderful with her profession and affordable. You defiantly get wonderful results as well the confidence you need once the procedure is done. I live in LA and went to Arizona for a few weeks and I know once I buy my flight ticket my appointment with her will be the next thing i do! Again, I highly recommend you check out all her services and you will not be disappointed! 
PS..make sure you go in with lots of energy this woman will knock you off your feet! Lots of laughs and lots of fun!
