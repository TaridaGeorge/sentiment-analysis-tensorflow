I thought I was in a bad dream last night, my sitter was late like I missed the first part kinda late. I was steaming mad grrrr when I got to the Box office it was already closed of course, because who would actually be that late for a show! After peeping thru the doors we were directed to the head honcho, he politely gave us our tickets and instead of us interrupting the people already seated he decided to put us in some empty balcony seats on the lower level. It was great! I never made it upstairs and mind you I was late but from what I saw and the staff being so helpful when I thought the night was totally ruined they get 5 star's from me!
