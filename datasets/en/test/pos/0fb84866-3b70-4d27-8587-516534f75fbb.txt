Loved it!

This is a terrific alternative to the "look alike" restaurants in Scottsdale.

It is not fancy, meaning there are no white table cloths and the like, but the food is so good and light (and very well portioned)!

The service is friendly and good.  I had to grab my own drinks and silverware, but the table was cleared immediately when I finished.

And the price is right on!
