One of my regular restaurants. The menu has changed a bit, and I miss some favorites such as a the lobster ravioli. The lobster bisque I have to order each time. Some of the fall items such as the squash soups are missing. They have revised the menu into courses. They used to have a 4-5 course tasting menu created by the chef. We normally go on a weekdays, and allows the staff a little flexibility. I've had the chef create his own tasting menu and it's always been top rate 5 starts. He asked if we had any unpreferred foods. We've told him, not at all, he has full creativity. Don't knock the escargot until you try, their kitchen can make magic.
