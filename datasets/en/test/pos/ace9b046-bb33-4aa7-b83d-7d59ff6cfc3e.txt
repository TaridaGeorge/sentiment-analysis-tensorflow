This place is great. Went in for breakfast and we enjoyed an omelet and southwest biscuits and gravy. Both were awesome. Service was fast and very friendly. 

Not quite a "hole in the wall" but it is small and very mom & pop, which I happen to prefer. It was clean and we sat on a the patio. 

Excited to find it and go back to try some other items.
