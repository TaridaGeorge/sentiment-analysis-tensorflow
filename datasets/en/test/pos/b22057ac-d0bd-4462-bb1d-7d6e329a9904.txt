First off I am in love with the decor of Modern steak. It is hip and feels like something you would find at a swanky Las Vegas hotel. I went there for lunch and I had the Jumbo Shrimp Louie with hearts of palm, tomato and avocado ($16.00). It was great, the shrimp were really huge and everything in the salad was fresh and was just phenomenal. My friend had the twin sliders and said they were great as well. 

I have been always impressed with the restaurants and quality of food that FOX Restaurant Concepts put's out. I have NEVER had an issue with service, and the quality of food they put out!
