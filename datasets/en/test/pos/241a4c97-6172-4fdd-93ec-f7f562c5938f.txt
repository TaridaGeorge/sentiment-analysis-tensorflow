Really great prices and it moves quickly. I have brought in my pets for years. Very compassionate when I brought my senior pets a few years ago. 
Another vet quoted me over $200 for a regular cat neuter was $43 with pain medication. Quite the savings!!!

The staff at the front can be a bit abrupt in person and on the phone but i think they're on overload on certain days. There are no specific appointments for vaccinations, etc- just certain days -it's first come/first serve. 

I have recommended this clinic to others and they've been very satisfied.
