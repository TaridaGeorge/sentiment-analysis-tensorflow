Great to finally have a high end NIke store in town. This store is smaller than Niketown locations in other cities but they pack a lot into the two-story space. Most of the square footage is allocated to golf, tennis, and running but the basketball, training, and Nike sportswear sections provide ample variety. 

The store carries a majority of the current hot/limited releases and an abundance of color ways of the most popular running, basketball, and training shoes. 

The clothing selection is great at well and I saw lots of t-shirts, shorts, jackets, etc. that I haven't seen elsewhere. 

I'll definitely be a regular at this store.
