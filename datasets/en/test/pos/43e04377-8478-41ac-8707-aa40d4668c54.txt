I love that the Arizona Humane Society has an offsite location here. They have two main shelter locations and then Petique. Petique has great gifts to give for pet lovers and amazing animals up for adoption. Normally a few dogs, cats and sometimes a rabbit or smaller critter available. 

The bonus is that Biltmore is a pet friendly mall, so you will see the adoptable dogs taking their walks around the mall. 

If you adopt from there, you get a 10% off any purchases going forward. It is tax free and helps other animals in need. A nice selection of collars and gifts. I do wish they offered more cat items though. 

Stick to PetSmart like retailer thought for your pet food, this is more of a boutique for gifts etc.

Friendly staff and volunteers make this store a wonderful experience. Be sure to check it out!
