Good choice for an afternoon snack, just had the frozen custard, it hit the spot, and was just what we needed to pick us up.  Prices were reasonable and no one came make a Sunday the wrong way, right?

Not crowded, clean, good service.  Looking at the food coming out, might have to come back and try a burger!
