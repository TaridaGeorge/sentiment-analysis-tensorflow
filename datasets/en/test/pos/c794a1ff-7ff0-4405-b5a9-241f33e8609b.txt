Best Mexican food in Chandler - hands down.  I'm a religious bean/cheese/rice burrito eater and El Sol does not let me down.  Their tortillas are excellent, and their salsa is amaaaazing.  The service is great and the staff is so so friendly and always remembers our work lunch group (as we go about once a week).  DEFINITELY recommended....  Rivals Carolina's in my mind for best Mexican in the city as far as their burritos are concerned!
