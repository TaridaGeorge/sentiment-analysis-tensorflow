Chompie's is pretty awesome. They have a great menu with mile high sandwiches! Everything I've eaten from there has been great and the service has always been awesome as well. I love all of the pastries that they have, I had been looking for some decent cannoli's in Tempe for a while when I stumbled across this place. Definitely a great place to go for a sandwich or breakfast.
