These are by far the best brownies ever! My husband doesn't like sweets but when we had a box of them in the house he would wake up in the middle of the night and start snacking on the brownies. 

We've tried every single type of brownies from them and they are all great! We are never disappointed and this year I'm even sending out boxes for Christmas presents to friends and family.
