I like hot dogs. A lot. And these folks make them healthy-ish, from local ingridients, and even offer gluten free options! 

I was so impressed with them, and love the fact that it's a mobile business. Hoesntly, if you're a fan or meat on a stick, you need to try it. It just may have pushed Costco out as the Valley's best hot dog vendor!
