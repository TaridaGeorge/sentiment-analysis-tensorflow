Had some killer sushi for lunch at Stingray today!

The Crunchy Spicy Tuna Sushi is totally different than any where I have experienced it.  A well seasoned really combined tuna mixture sits atop a crispy rice rectangular tasty amazing thing!  You must order this...very special.

The Spyder Roll was super fresh and a nice big portion.

Shrimp Tempera Roll was delicious as well.

The atmosphere was fun and the service was speedy and friendly.  There were so many choices that sounded fabulous on the menu and we look forward to going there and experiencing many more items!
