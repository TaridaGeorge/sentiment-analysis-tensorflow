This place is my "old stand by," and somehow I end up here 1-2 times a week. I have tried maybe half of the menu by now, and I always gravitate to the Hummus Plate Salad.  It is so delicious. Vegetarian friendly, though I am a meat lover, and full of roasted veggies, hummus, perfect balsamic vinagrette and nine grain bread. Heaven on a plate :) And for under $10!!
