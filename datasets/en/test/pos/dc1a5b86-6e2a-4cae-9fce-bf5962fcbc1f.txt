The Heard Museum is amazing.  

I've only been here once, during one of their free attendance days.    Although there are some kid-oriented exhibits, teens and adults will get the most out of this museum.

The Kachina exhibit is wonderful.  All of the art is breath-taking.  The Indian school exhibit is heart-breaking.

I highly recommend going to this museum at least once, especially if you live in AZ.
