Here is the deal.... Sun Chinese does have chinese food. The real appeal of this place is that they serve on a separate menu to those of us who know anything about Chinese infused Korean dishes. You won't get the menu unless you ask. If you do brave to ask, I would recommend the sweet and sour pork (korean style). I would also highly recommend the soy bean noodle (aka. JaJangMyun). If you like a super spicy dish on a cold day go for the spicy seafood soup (JamBong). 

I can't say anything about their primary menu cause most of the asians and those like myself who grew up in Asia who go to the place ask for the Korean menu. They are the only place in AZ that serve korean chinese food and for that they get 5 stars and a huge thank you.
