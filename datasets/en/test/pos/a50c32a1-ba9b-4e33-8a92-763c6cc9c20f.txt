I was born near Chicago, moved away by three and have never been back.  So as an adult I have missed out on all the great cusine known from this midwest mecca of a city.  This place makes me feel like I'm taking a journey away from the valley and right into a neighborhood restaurant in Chicago.  I love the pizza here as well as the down to earth relaxing atmosphere.  Servers have always been great to me.  I don't know how anyone could say anything bad about this place.  Until I take a vacation to the windy city, I'll have to come here to get my fill.
