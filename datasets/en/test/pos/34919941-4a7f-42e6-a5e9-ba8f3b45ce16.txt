This is by far my most favorite Chinese restaurant in the valley! I have been going here for the past 5+ years and still never a disappointment! All the employees are very friendly (also know me by name and order) and the food is GREAT!!! I am always referring my co-workers and friends to eat here.

They are re-opening in their new location tomorrow and I can not be happier! I will most definitely stay a loyal customer!
