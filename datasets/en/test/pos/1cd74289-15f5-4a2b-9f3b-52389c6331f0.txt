We recently attended a birthday party at My Gym and we were blown away!  Our son is two (almost three) and the birthday party was for a five year old.  Knowing the difference in motor skill development and attention span, I was worried he would be a nightmare - but he did very well thanks to the very patient, kid friendly and professional staff hosting the birthday celebration.

It was a great event for all the kids involved, everyone had a blast and we just really thought it was extremely well done.
