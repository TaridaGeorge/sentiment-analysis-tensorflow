I love this place! We go here about once a paycheck! We bring our kids sometimes and even the mother-in-law a couple of times. This is a great place to meet your friends and hang out. Everything on the menu that I have tried has been great! The Stromboli and the salads are my favs! I've never had to wait to be seated. And the wait staff has always been more than pleasant.
