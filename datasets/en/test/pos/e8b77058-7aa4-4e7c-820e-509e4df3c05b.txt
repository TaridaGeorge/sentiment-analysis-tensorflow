This place is worth the wait! [and I'm not a fan of asianesque food]

I recently went with a friend for lunch and we waited 20 minutes for a table but once seated we were promptly served the lunch soup. I ordered the chili garlic with brown rice. Per usual, I ordered it 'hot, extra hot'. They delivered, my food was spicy and delicious. My friend sneak a bit from plate and almost threw up, he couldn't take the hotness. As we were leaving he said he was 'breaking a sweat' as his mouth simmered down from my chili garlic.  The food and service were great if you don't mind the wait.
