Perfect hotel in every way for our team's hockey tournament weekend.  Everything was geared towards our stay including providing an early breakfast at 5:00 AM (which was included in the charge) for our early game and acknowledging we have hockey boys, the hotel allocated a special space where the boys could play knee hockey .   Pool and jacuzzi.    Clean new rooms.    Restaurant and bar.   Superior service.  Gym was great for a small gym.   A can do attitude.  Highly recommend.  As a team, we want to take this hotel with us wherever we go.
