First, I love that Bombay is walking distance from our house!  

Great wine list of 40 bottles and all at $6 a glass or $20 a bottle.   I can't wait to work my way through the list.  Martinis, Cosmos also available.  Fresh lime juice for the margaritas were outstanding.  I could drink them everyday with a great tequila.  Wink to Mike!  I'll keep my fingers crossed.  

We had the Chickpea Ceviche, Beef Tikka, Lamp Chops, Rice pudding (yum).  We enjoyed all of the sauces.  I love the Chai Tea.  I used to drive thru Coffee Bean now I stop by Bombay Spice and get one to go for half the price!  And it taste better.  

The quality is outstanding and healthy, the price is right and the staff is warm and friendly.  Thanks for being our new neighbor Bombay Spice!
