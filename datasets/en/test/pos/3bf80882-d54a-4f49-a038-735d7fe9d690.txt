Large Beef Burrito with homemade Tortilla was great.  Tacos were filled with fresh Beef, Cheese, Onions, Lettuce & Tomatoes served w/ a side of Beans AND Rice. We all had soft drinks and the bill was under $20!  Friendly service and the bathrooms are clean.  PS Margarita's are a $1.00 OFF on Friday's.
