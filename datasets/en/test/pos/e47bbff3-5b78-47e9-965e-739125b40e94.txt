Over the years Blue 32 has been in Gilbert I haven't found a single thing to complain about. The food is outstanding - every single time. The staff is friendly, wonderful, welcoming and accomodating. It seems the turnover is very low as the same faces have been serving for a long time. 

Everything on the menu is awesome. Literally - I have tried everything. 

And, best of all - it is superbly clean.
