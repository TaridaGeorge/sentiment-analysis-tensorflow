This place is unique and has a super cool vibe. the owner is from Cornwall, England, accent and all, and seems like a real nice guy, working the ovens with the rest of the employees.
the place is long and thin, and pretty small. if you sit at the bar that looks right into the kitchen, do not sit in front of the oven- every time they open the doors you get a blast of hot air.
they used to do $3 Irish Car Bombs all the time, but not sure if they still do. a great little date place if you want someplace unique to share an intimate drink. 
the pasties are huge and totally filling, though. so if you plan on doing anything after, be wary of eating the whole thing.
