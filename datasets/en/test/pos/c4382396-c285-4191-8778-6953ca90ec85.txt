Aiello's is awesome and is a great date restaurant.

Very low key, relaxing environment with really good Italian food.

I've been to Aiello's a hand full of times and would say that my favorite menu items are the lasagna, chicken parm, and the spaghetti with meatballs. Aiello's has the best meatballs I've ever had. 

Also, Joe the owner is very friendly and really makes you feel at home.

Aiello's has a decent wine list and has very reasonable prices.

Awesome food, very friendly service, and reasonable prices, gives Aiello's five stars.
