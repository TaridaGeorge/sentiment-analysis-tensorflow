I mention this place and most people don't know where it is BUT it is one of the best kept secrets for great cheese steaks that I know of. GO and find it on S. Priest Dr. just about a block north of Warner and just east off the I-10. My wife is from Philly and she proclaims this joint to be the best of all. Bernadette can talk for 30 min. about Philly cheese steaks like Gino's in Philly and how this place is very close to Gino's as in "GOOD". 
I don't each much beef but I definitely like this place and especially the fried onions and the sweet potato fries. And you can get it in chicken.
And best of all, they 'splain it to me so I know how to order. GREAT PEOPLE!
Fer cryin' out loud, TRY IT!
You will like it!
