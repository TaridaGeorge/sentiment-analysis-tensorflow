A few of us tried The Coffee Shop this weekend for the first time. It was probably the best breakfast I have had in a long time.

I had an omelet that had bacon on it. Because of the bacon, I was fully expecting it to be on the greasier side. Not at all. Perfection! The bacon was crisp, meaty, and not greasy. The egg was done perfectly. This came with diced potatoes, seasoned with something, and not greasy at all. 

What sealed the deal was the best blueberry scone I've ever had. I saw it in the case and tried to resist. However, after breakfast as I was sipping my coffee, it called to me. This thing was not too dry and loaded with blueberries. 

I would highly recommend checking this place out.
