Chelsea's Kitchen probably has the best french dip sandwich in the world.  I can't seem to get it out of my mind!  The decor, the food, and the service is a welcome addition for Phoenix.  The indoor/outdoor patio is charming, and when I was there, the place was packed!  The parking lots fills up quickly, so if you go, be one of the first in line, or prepare to settle down for a wait.
