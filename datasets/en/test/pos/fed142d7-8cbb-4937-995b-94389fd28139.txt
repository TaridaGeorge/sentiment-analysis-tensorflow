If I could, I would give a 6th star!! I've been meaning to try this place for months and finally went! The waitress was veryy helpful in my decisions to choose the top 3 items on the menu. The french toast (for sure!), huevos rancheros and the biscuits and gravy. It was everything I hoped for and more and if you're a breakfast person like I am then you'll love it too!
