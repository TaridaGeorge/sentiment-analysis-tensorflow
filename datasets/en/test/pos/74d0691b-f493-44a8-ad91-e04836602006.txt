This is the best Thai food in the East Valley. The food is amazing and  consistent. The Owner is a wonderful Thai woman named Rich who is also the cook. She always comes out of the kitchen, if it is not too busy' to make sure you enjoyed your meal. 
If you have not had a chance to visit Palee's Crown you are missing out on authentic thai food.
