This place is awesome. Great food, tons of vegetarian options, usually very good service. It is small, so be prepared to possibly wait for a seat or choose to sit at the bar for faster service. They also have great Irish car bombs here. 

Don't pass up the dessert pasties either...the apple one is yummy!
