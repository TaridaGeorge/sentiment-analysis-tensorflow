This past Friday was mine and J's first trip (Saw The Avengers) to The Glendale West Wind Drive-In.  Though we still have a bitter taste in our mouths due to Scottsdale 6 closing (THANKS SRPMIC...grrrr), this location serves as a decent replacement.  

Paved lots. 
Kids playground. 
Newer bathrooms. (Newer than what was a The Six)
Still $6.50 for a double feature. 
You can still bring your own food and drinks.  

Though it's a slight drive for us, J and I will definitely be bringing Baby C. here when we want to enjoy a movie night.  


Long Live Nostalgia and a Piece of Americana.
