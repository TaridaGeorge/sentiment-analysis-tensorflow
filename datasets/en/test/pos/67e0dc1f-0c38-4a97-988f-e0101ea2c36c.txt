The best Green pork chile stew in town!  The pork is tender and succulent, the dish is spicy, but not too spicy...and there is no better around.  The corn bread is fantastic as well!  I simply adore the chocolate chip cookies!  I love both these items and even though I've been here multiple times I haven't tried anything else because of my love affair with these items!  The atmosphere is charming and really comfortable.  If Aaron the owner is there he is really nice and friendly.  Get there soon!
