Einstein has the whole bagel thing down pat!  Crusty crust with a soft and chewy inside.  They toast so well and their varieties of Schmears are awesome!  I love having odd combos, like the Garlic bagel with Almond Honey Schmear.  

This location was clean and very busy on a Sunday morning.    The staff was very friendly and helpful.   Even though it was busy we were in and out with their "Hate to Wait" bucket.  13 bagels with 2 tubs of schmear for $15 --Not bad!
