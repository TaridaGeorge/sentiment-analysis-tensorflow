Great food. 
Fantastic service. 
Lovely atmosphere. 

Dinner was absolutely Delicious. 
I wasn't sure if I liked some of the sauces that came on the entree & the waitress had me taste everything before I made my final choice. It was a busy night & she apologized for our food not being up faster, without me even complaining about it, & gave us 20% of our bill! 

The atmosphere was casual & relaxed. The staff is so friendly & welcoming, you just can't help but feel comfortable & happy to be there! 

They have a return customer in me :)
