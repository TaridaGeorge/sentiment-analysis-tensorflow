I've had every carrier you can think of (except, of course, Cricket).  The customer service at T-Mobile is awesome!  I *had* to have the RAZR two years ago.  Ugh.  It was the worst phone ever.  Wasn't T-Mobile's fault, just Motorola.  Anyway, visited the store twice and had to get replacement phones.  Each time, they exchanged the phone for free.
Even now when I have troubles, I go in and everyone is friendly and helpful.  
I'm still with them for another couple years (I keep needing new phones!) and wouldn't change providers for anything right now.
