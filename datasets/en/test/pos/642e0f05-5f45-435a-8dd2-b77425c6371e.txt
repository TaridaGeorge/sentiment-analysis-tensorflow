The best bagel in the city.  Nothing compares.  It's kind of hidden depending on which way you are coming from.  But once found, the bagel man does not disappoint. All bagels are freshly made the day of.  Go in early enough and the bagels are still piping hot.  Not much of a selection, but in this establishment its clearly quality over quantity.  Aside from the delicious bagels and bagel sandwiches, there are also a simple selection of cookies, coffe cake, and cinnamon rolls.   I have only had the coffee cake because the cinnamon roll rack is always emptied by the time I get there.  If that gives you an idea of how delicious they are.  Anyways, highly suggest this be your new bagel place.
