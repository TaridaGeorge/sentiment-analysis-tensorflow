Very interesting.

Since I wrote my first review in March, remodeling began.  And ended.

I had a couple 2 and 3 star visits in the late Spring and early summer.  I don't think it had anything to do with the remodel, just apathetic employees.  

Now the remodel is complete.  The new store is beautiful.

In the last two weeks, my last two visits were completely 5 star.  They have all sorts of cool new services, like the Benefit bar, where they do great eyebrow shaping, for a very reasonable price.  Other cheap thrills like this abound.

Excellent customer service.  Really great shopping experience.  Maybe there was a turnover in staff.  A revitalization training.  

No matter, check this store out, if you haven't been for a while.
