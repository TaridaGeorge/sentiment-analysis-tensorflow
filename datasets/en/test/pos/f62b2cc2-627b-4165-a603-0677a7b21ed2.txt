I've had nothing but good experiences in this Verizon store. Contrary to the first review, it's never taken me very long to be helped when I've come to the store. I rarely go in to any verizon store, as most problems can be solved online or over the phone with verizon customer service. 

I think the longest wait I've ever had in this, or any, Verizon store was 15 minutes. I've been treated well and had nothing but positive experiences with Verizon. I tend to research EVERYTHING i buy, so I usually don't have big issues with phones, but I feel confident the the reps at this store are more than capable of politely helping me when I need help.
