I'm a regular at Bagel Nosh. They learned my name right away and miss me when I don't come in for awhile. They even know what and how I like my bagel! They have the yummiest Mocha Glacier- i'm totally addicted! It's not bitter at all - it's sweet and a lot better than Sbx! They are always busy in the mornings but they keep the line moving - so it's never a problem. You know if cops eat there...it's good and they are there EVERY morning!! The girls are so nice... Now I'm craving a bagel and Mocha Glacier - thanks!
