What can I say about Yogurtland? I'm in love!! They have so many great selections, even though I'm pretty boring and I either get some kind of chocolate/coffee/reeses cup blend or vanilla and m&ms. Very reasonably priced, a good snack costs me less than $2! I also love how they'll let you know which ones are low calorie, etc.
