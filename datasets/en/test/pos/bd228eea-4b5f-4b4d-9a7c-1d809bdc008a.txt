The owner is always very friendly. The space is designed very well and has a nice "California feel." I would definitely recommend coming here instead of La Grande Orange for coffee if you are in the area. The baristas are much better trained and they are always very helpful. Also, you can always get your drink very quickly at Carmel's, which makes this the go to place for business people. Definitely worth a try!!!
