I will drive out of my way to go to this location anytime. There are 3 other locations at equal distance or closer and i would much rather go to this one. The staff is always very friendly and helpful. The store is very clean and keeps a nice appearance. There are a lot of families shopping at this location. Great selection, great prices (I think Frys prices are the most competitive among the larger chains in town).
