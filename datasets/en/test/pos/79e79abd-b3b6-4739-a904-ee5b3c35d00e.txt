The pho was awesome and full of flavor. The waiters bent over backwards accommodating me and my 2 little crumb snatchers who were joining me for lunch. Super awesome experience. Definitely the real deal when everyone around you doesn't have English as their first language.  Drove all the way from East Mesa just to try their Pho. I will be back.
