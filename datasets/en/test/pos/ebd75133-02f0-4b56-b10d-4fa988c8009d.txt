Go here for Brunch! Lunch and dinner are fine, but the breakfast menu and the E61 coffee bar cannot be beat.

My usual order is a bowl of cafe au lait, and a veggie scramble.  The breakfast potatoes are so good.

It can get crowded, but if you're in a small group (2) you can usually skip the line and sit at the bar which is full service.
