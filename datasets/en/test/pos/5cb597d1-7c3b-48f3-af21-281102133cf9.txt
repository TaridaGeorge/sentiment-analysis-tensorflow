I love what Marriott does...camelback was great.  Bed was comfy, room was huge, amenities are great.  Did not do the entire spa thing, so cannot comment on that...would love to be able to stay here again.  Liked the little adobe style of the rooms and the campus / grounds type arrangements.  After reading the reviews I understand why I did not feel comfortable with the pool as the night I went out to use it I also encountered some dude with a tripod and no one else but a guy floating in the lanes.   They were probably sneak ins too.  Needless to say I did not feel comfortable swimming.
