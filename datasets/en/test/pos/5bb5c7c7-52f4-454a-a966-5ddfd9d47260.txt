I'm a big fan of Summit Cleaners. They're not perfect, but they are by far much less expensive than any traditional cleaner I've found in the Phoenix area.

It's more like the cleaners I'm accustomed to from the Midwest. Run by Asians and moderately priced. My dress shirts come out very good and they only cost $1.35 each. Dry Cleaning has various pricing, but it's far less than Prestige, Delia's or any of the other big names. 

The clothes are typically done in two days and the place could use some organization, but I'll put up with both for the prices they charge.
