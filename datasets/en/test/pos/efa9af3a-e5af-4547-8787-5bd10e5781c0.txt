So, sadly I have had to take my little guy 2 times now to Dr. Brooks for stitches.  What can I say?  He's a boy, and plays hard.  The first time was on his forehead (visible to all) and they did such a good job (a year later now) you can't even see where he split it open.  We took care of it, per their suggestions, but still they did such a great job.  The second time was on the chin and I am hoping it heals up a nicely too, but at least it's not very easy to notice.  Anyway, good staff, friendly and Dr. Brooks is just an awesome guy.  a little over $400 bucks for urgent care and stitches seems a bit high and it sucks to pay out of pocket when you are self employed, but oh well!!!!
