WOW!  This hotel just opened, and I have watched it be built from the ground up!  It's beautiful!  This hotel is located smack dab downtown in the heart of phoenix at 3rd Street and Van Buren, across the street from the Arizona Center.

I waltzed through the lobby, and it was geourgous. Staff greeted me immediately, and they have a tremendous amount of seating.  I would hope to stay here one day, as I can only imagine what the rooms look like after seeing the lobby!
