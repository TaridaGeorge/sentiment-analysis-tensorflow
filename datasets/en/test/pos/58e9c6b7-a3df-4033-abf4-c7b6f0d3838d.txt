L dragged me to try yoga at Urban Yoga this week.  We took Urban Flow on Monday and Urban Zen on Wednesday.  LOVED IT!  This is my first experience to try yoga outside of LA Fitness.  It is top notch here.  Urban Flow was hard but it push me to go a little more, but since it was my first class with them.  The instructor came by quite a bit to modify the moves for me.  L and I was sore so we came back on Wed for the Urban Zen, it was a nice change from the Flow class.  I love you can read the description and sign up for class online.  YEAH, YEAH, and a HELL YEAH for this place!!!
