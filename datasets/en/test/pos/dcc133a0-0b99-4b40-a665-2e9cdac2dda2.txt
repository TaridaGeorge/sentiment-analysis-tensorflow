What can i say this place is fantastic! I can't wait to come back. So nice, designed so 60's ,very modern, beautiful!     Complimentary  valet parking! wonderful menu all sorts of great looking meals.   I got the mahi mahi sandwich with sweet potato fries.  My friends had a Burger and french dip along with Salad. Also an appetizer that was so large even 3 of us couldn't finish it.  We all had Tea and they made sure it was full throughout the lunch.   This place looks like it could be a lot of fun in the evening as well.    No wonder everyone has all good things to say about The Vig.   I cannot wait to come back.
