Came to Bobby Q. from word of mouth. Went to Phoenix for Spring Training. Went there on Sunday and got the Family fest (1/2 lb ribs, 1/2 lbs pull pork, 1/2 lb brisket, 1/2 chicken plus 2 sides) for $28.00. This is the best BBQ that i have tasted. The brisket can be cut with a fork and melts in your mouth. The chicken is not dry but moist (even the chicken breast). The one thing i do want to try is a 22-hour smoked prime rib....until next spring training, i will have to wait. Also, mention yelp and get 10% off your bill!!!
