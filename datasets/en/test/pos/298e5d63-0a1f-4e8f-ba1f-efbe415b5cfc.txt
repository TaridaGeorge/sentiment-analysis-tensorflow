I'm kicking myself a little for taking so long to find Frances!  The namesake, Frances is the owners grandmother which I think it an adorable little fact.

Many reviewers have commented on the regularly high prices at Frances- I walked out a happy woman with many deals.  I purchased one silver peace necklace, a pair of Free People jeans, a locally made skirt, and a listography book for under sixty dollars.  I was lucky and must have came at the right time, but that just means that there is a right time- which is often the case with awesomeness.

I enjoyed the variety and uniqueness of items available, as well as the shop owner who was kind and helpful.  Frances is an awesome local business that I can proudly support.  

Located right across the street from the Camelback/Central Ave. light rail stop!
