I love going to this Harkins theater, there usually aren't a bunch of loud teenagers here and most people in this area actually show respect while at the movies and aren't on their cell phone texting the entire time. My boyfriend and I always come here and we're here about once or twice a week catching the new flicks! The popcorn is always fresh, the snacks are great and the staff is super friendly!
