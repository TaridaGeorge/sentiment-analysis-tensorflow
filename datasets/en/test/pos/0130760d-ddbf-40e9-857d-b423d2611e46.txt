We went there for lunch on a Wednesday.  The lunch menu is fabulous. The service was great.  The pizza was delicious.  My husband had the pizza on the lunch menu and it was a good size.  The crust was thin and the mozzerella was fresh. Just delicious!! I had the Honey Hot wings and they were pretty good.  The wings weren't saturated with sauce so that was nice and it had a nice bite to it. The total bill for 3 people for lunch was $25.00 before tip.  We will be going back!!
