My rescue Jagger is a Lab mix, and was scared of his own tail when I got him. After just the first few classes I noticed a big difference. Leah gave me lots of good tips to help him at home and when we go out. He is a brand new dog now I can walk right up to people without him trying to bolt. He really knows his commands now. Our training class has helped Jagger and I so much! Thank you Leah!
