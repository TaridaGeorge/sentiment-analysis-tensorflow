I love their Delux burgers and the sweet potato fries.  I often stop by after church on Sunday and get an order for my hubby and me to go.  It's kind of become a ritual for us.  Be sure to ask for the aioli sauce for the fries.  It's so good and spicy.  The waiters are friendly too; especially Chris who always seems to take my order.
