Everything you can possibly order is good here. I love the egg breakfasts, my fianc√© loves the pancakes.  The bread is amazing, if you're into the high-gluten flour types of bread. Which I am :) I pre-ordered dinner rolls for Thanksgiving and they were a huge hit.

I like to just sit here and read, work on the computer, and enjoy my time spent here and get a bunch of refills on coffee or iced tea. The iced tea is really good and comes in different flavors.

If you like Paradise more, you don't have good taste in food, and you like foods that actually DO taste pre-made. Sorry...
