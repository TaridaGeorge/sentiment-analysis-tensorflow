I was referred to RnR Fingers from a buddy of mine and had to try their chicken. The Chicken, Texas Toast and waffle fries were amazing. I don't mind spending extra if I know that I'm getting good food.

The owner (think his name was Al) was very polite and thanked me for my patronage. The place has a nice charm to it and wish the Owners nothing but the most success. 

I urge all Yelpers to support local businesses and try out RnR Fingers. They truly appreciate your business and have some amazing food.
