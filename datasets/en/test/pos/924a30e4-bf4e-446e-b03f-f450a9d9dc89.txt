There needs to be a grip-load more places like this one around the valley, where they make you feel like whatever dogfood they deliver to you on your plate, you're gonna gladly pay the fee with a toothy smile on your face and say 'thank-you good sir', and 'yes, i will kindly see a dessert menu'!

Why this kind of restaurant/vibe hasn't been exploited ad infinitum here in the valley is pretty taxing on the brain.  

It would be silly for me to review and report my dinners here ... I INSIST you browse the menu and try to explain 'why' you wouldn't visit here for a semi-formal event.  http://www.houseoftricks.com/New%20Dinner%20Menu%203-12-08.pdf
