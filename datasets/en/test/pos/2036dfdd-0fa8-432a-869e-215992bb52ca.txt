I simply love this place! I find myself coming here at least twice a week for lunch and sometimes go back for dinner when I have to brag to my friends and family what I ate for lunch.

5 stars for price, cleanliness, fast and efficient service, and delicious food.

There's no other place in cenpho that you can pay less than 10.00 for lunch for TWO people! 

The Banh mi is irrestible and filled enough with meat and veggies to be a solid steal for $2.25 

The Pho-is PHO-licous!!!! Yes it leaves Da Vang, Maxim and 43 Express in the dust.
 Another steal at just $4.50

The #59 Broken Rice Special is divine-especially if you want to get a little taste of everything for only $6.95

Great place for a great price!
