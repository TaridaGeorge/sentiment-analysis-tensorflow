I have a Ford Econoline Van that has crazy air conditioning issues.  I have had it taken in to another mechanic on a couple of different times, with different solutions being applied, and nothing really worked.  When I called John, told him my problem, told me, "Bring your van down and we'll take care of it".  John not only fixed the problem of my ac, but drove me to and from work while he had my van.  This is truly a rare helping hand.  Thx again John
