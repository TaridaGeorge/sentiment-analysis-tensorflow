The remodeled store is super.  Won't find fresher veggies or a better selection of meat.  

They have it all, if you can't find it here....you probably don't need it.  Great ethnic selection as well.

Very attentive to service and friendly staff.  Covered parking, valet, car wash so your vehicle is happy too!
