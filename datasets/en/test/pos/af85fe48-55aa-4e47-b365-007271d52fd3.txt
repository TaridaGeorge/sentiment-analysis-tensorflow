My parents brought me and my siblings here as kids and never had a problem. We always got friendly service. I liked it there so much I chose them when my son was born and will choose them for my new baby in September. We have doctor Magalnick and he is wonderful, yes my son has seen other doctors there just as I did, but thats only if our doctor is unavailable for an appointment outside of well checks, and all were friendly, all well checks are seen by reg. doctor. Sometime the wait is long but what doctors office isn't. I and my family have always had great experience here, and I would defiantly recommend it to anyone.
