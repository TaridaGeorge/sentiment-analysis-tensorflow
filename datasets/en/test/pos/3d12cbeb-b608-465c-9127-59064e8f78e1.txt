I love this place because it has strong iced coffee, they call it "toddy". Man this stuff is better then all the energy drinks. They also have FREE HIGH SPEED WIRELESS!!! No kidding, unlike that other place, no sign-ups, nothing, just go and and open and go. The berista's are good, and the drinks are real good. Great looking college women all day long. The drive through is great and 24 hours on the weekends. 
This is a great independent coffee shop. 
I also have held a few business meeting in there, no problem, no one messes with ya, no one clamoring you to buy drinks. 
I recommend this place to all my friends.
