I have only stopped in this little gem a few times, but each time has been a great experience.  I usually order a hot orange rooibos tea and a brown butter scone.  The space is small and cute, they have a fair selection of breakfast and lunch items, coffee/espresso and tea, fresh squeezed orange juice, and the staff and owner are always very friendly and helpful.  Me gusta!
