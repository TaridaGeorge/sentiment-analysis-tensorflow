First of all - very clean nail salon without any overpowering smell. I am a hair stylist by trade and so I am VERY particular about sanitation in salons. This place seemed to follow all the rules to protect their guests. Secondly, the space is large and airy. I felt very comfortable and relaxed in their massage spa chairs. The nail techs are all very pleasant and do a very thorough job. My tech, Wendy, was great. She not only did a terrific job with the services, she also turned me on to a great Vietnamese Restaurant!
