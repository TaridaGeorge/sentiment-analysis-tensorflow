As a vegetarian with a husband who is meat lover, going out for barbecue can be complicated.  Joe's is perfect for us - my husband loves their bbq and I love their sides.  My personal favorites are the side salad with tomatoes and bbq ranch dressing, cheesy jalapeno potatoes and sweet corn.  They also have excellent mac & cheese, cornbread and lemonade.  My husband always gets the Jumbo Sandwich with mac & cheese.  

Joe's also has THE BEST Birthday deal - $10 to spend on anything on the menu.  This is only valid on your Birthday and you have to present your ID.
