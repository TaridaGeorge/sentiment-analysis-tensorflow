Lot s of Chick-fil-a stores around and all have the same food which is very good. BUT this one on Stapley has got to be judged by the perfect service and their great people. Even when the place is packed, you will be eating within 5 minutes and they will even bring it to your table. When you are ready to leave, they ask if they can take your take tray for you and are always cleaning and getting ready for the next customer. AND they will come around and ask if they can refill your drink for you.
IT DON'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS.
My assessment--chicken is chicken but the PEOPLE MAKE THE DIFFERENCE HERE! Ted Christy is the owner!
South of hwy. 60 on Stapley at Inverness. I moved into an office right behind them and love the location.
