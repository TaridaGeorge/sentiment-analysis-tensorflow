First, Bob is a great guy.  A great, solid mechanic and a super trouble shooter.  I trust him completely!  I always leave paying less than I expected, and am always happy with his work.

Secondly, if you like people who are 'friends of the animals', than THIS is your guy.  He's a gentle soul wrapped in an auto mechanic!
