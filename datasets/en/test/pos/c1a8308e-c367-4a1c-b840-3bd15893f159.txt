I was in town for a conference meeting and yelped my heart out to find a really great breakfast place...and behold my yelper friends you have delivered once again!!

I was a little confused and didn't know how to order my Sunday breakfast, first we had to find seating, from there get in line, order and then apparently you go pick up your own food inside when they call your name!  Whew!

We both ordered the Commuter Sandwich, I ordered w/ bacon and avocado and my hubby ordered it w/ ham and avocado.  Holy cow!!  This is the best english muffin sandwich I've ever eaten!  Sorry Mickey D's!  The bacon was salty and crispy, the egg was fluffy and the avocados were just ripe enough!!  

I wish I lived in Phoenix!!
