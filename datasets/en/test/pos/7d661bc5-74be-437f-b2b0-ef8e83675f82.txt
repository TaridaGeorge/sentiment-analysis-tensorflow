Our family recently took a trip to Phoenix and stayed at the Desert Ridge Resort. This resort was one of the most beautiful Marriott's we have ever stayed at, and was full of great surprises. My son loved the lazy river, my husband loved the great restaurants on site (Roy's)and golfing, and I was very impressed by the Nickelodeon Activity Zone--a fun offering that allowed my son to eat dinner with a great counselor and some other guests at the resort, while we enjoyed a night out. 

With four different pool options every level of swimmer was happy!! For us the biggest highlight was probably the Lazy River and Waterslide. The hotel had inner tubes and sunscreen so it very easy to enjoy!
