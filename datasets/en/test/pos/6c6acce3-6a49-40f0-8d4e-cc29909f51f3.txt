I have now eaten at this place over a dozen times, and it's still five stars to me. Never ordered anything I didn't love. Amazing they can do that from their tiny little kitchen. I'm currently having an affair with their Greek pasty--in both vegetarian and non-vegetarian forms, it's amazing. Their tzatziki sauce is out of this world--and I don't usually like yogurt-based sauces. In fact, I can't think of a yogurt sauce I do like! Other tzatzikis fall flat in comparison. This one is great! We love the Italian, Cajun, Oggie, Greek, steak... oh, and do NOT forget the sticky toffee pudding for dessert! OM NOM NOM.
