Passed by here a gazzilion times, but finally had to go there yesterday and was pleasantly surprised! There is so much antique looking furniture in there, and even an old street car, the waiting room was obviously some kind of show room before but the subterannean dining was nice and cool for Phoenix. My Chicken Parmigean was great and the pricing was very reasonable I should try going for Dinner next time. 
Very unlike the other huge chain restraunts in Phoenix, the old spaghetti factory packs a punch for the days gone by.
