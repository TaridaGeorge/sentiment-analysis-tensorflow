I don't know how we even came across this complex.  Luck I guess.  

Did anybody say it yet? well I'm not gonna look through all of the reviews and I'm too lazy to CTRL+F.  But the water boiled beef is the SHIT! I couldn't decide between the chicken or beef, so the waitress let me do a combo. SWEEET.

Chinese broccoli, dan dan noodles, too many goodies to name!
