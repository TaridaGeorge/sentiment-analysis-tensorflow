I love this place.  I never have a bad anything here.  I know there are other locations, but this one is by far the best.  Everyone is so friendly and the food is amazing every single time.  I go about once a month on average and the entire staff greets me like I was just there yesterday.  You cannot beat the price anywhere else and they have my favorite saki.
