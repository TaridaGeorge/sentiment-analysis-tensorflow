This is one of my favorite restaurants in the area.  Went for an anniversary and the general manager personally set up a tasting menu.  It was the best service I have ever received, and the food was outstanding as always.  The duck and the beef tenderloin are excellent.  Don't forget the coconut sorbet and maybe a mai tai.  Highly recommend.
