Postino's is a great date restaurant. Especially on Mondays and Tuesdays when they have their $20 bruschetta and bottle of wine special. You can choose any bottle of wine off of their fairly long list of wines and get a delicious board of bruschetta for only $20. Major win. The proscuitto and fig is my absolute favorite, followed by the artichoke, brie and apple, and salmon and capers. The restaurant has a great interior and patio with a huge wall glass garage door that opens up to connect the interior to the exterior when the weather is nice. If you join their mailing list, you get a free bruschetta board on your birthday and the restaurant's birthday. I also love their sea salt caramel sunday - it's the most delicious dessert ever. You have to try this place. It's just great.
