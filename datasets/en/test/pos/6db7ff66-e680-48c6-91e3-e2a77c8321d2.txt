I remember going to the old version of this Target when I was a kid.  They have since knocked it down along with Service Merchandise and built a colossal mega Target.  Very cool place.  Guess what's inside it? Starbucks.. heh.. That alone makes it better than most Targets.

Cool people, helpful staff, so this place is rockin for what you need.
