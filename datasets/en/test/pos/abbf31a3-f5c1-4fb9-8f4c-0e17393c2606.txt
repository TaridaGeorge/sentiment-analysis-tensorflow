Great menu....great food....great prices...great SUSHI!
I went for happy hour after 8 pm i was expecting more choices from the happy hour menu but it's all good the rolls were amazing...I'm glad I finally found a great place for sushi thats cheap and close to my house! woo hoo! The inside of the restaurant is very clean with tasteful decor... great place for a date or as a group
