Never had a root canal and afraid of what could happen?  Afraid you will be in pain for weeks afterwards?  Never fear the Dr's here will do everything in their power to do the root canal with as little pain as possible.  I took pain meds once after the surgery and that was because I had a headache and it wasn't from the root canal.  Great staff and great doctors who are committed to your well being.
