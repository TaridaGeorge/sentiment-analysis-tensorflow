AMAZING food and I'm a vegetarian!  Their pizza, appetizers, and sandwiches are great.  Good brews too!

My only complaint is that it is REALLY loud and pretty pricey.  

I tried to go there for a late lunch (around 2 or 3pm) with a friend one day and they wouldn't let her in since she wasn't 21.  I thought that turning away business at that time of day was kind of strange.
