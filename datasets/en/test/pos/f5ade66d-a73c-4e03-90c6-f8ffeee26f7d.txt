This is by far the best place in Phoenix for an afternoon with family and friends for sandwiches. Sit outside on a beautiful fall or spring afternoon and sometimes you can catch some live music.
They also have a nice wine bar with a good selection by the bottle or glass. The Duck offers spices, cookbooks, and unique gifts for last minute shopping.
I have been coming to the Duck for over 20 years and highly recommend it. Watch out for the weekly lunch rush though. It gets extremely busy and problematic if you have somewhere to be.
