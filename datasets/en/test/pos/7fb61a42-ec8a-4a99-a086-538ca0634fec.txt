This Thai restaurant is excellent!  The quality of their ingredients is first rate. You can order dishes on a 1-5 scale of heat, which should please everyone. The restaurant decor is beautiful, and the staff efficient and friendly. Their prices are also very good,and, they offer brown rice, which is most appreciated...we have eaten many times and never be disappointed.
