I have been to two events where these guys provided the catering, and both were amazing. The food, and there was lots of variety of food was fresh, great combination of flavors. A variety of vegetables, nuts, grapes all served ob a variety of breads. 

One could grab handfuls of pistachios, cahsews, red peppers, olives and more. This is NOT your celery sticks and carrot sticks with a dip dish in the middle. Far far from it. 

If you want your guest to come away with a "Wow, they sure had great food at that event"... hire these guys NOW!
