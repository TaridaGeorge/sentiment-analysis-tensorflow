Best self service frozen yogurt I have had in the valley!  I end up going at least once a week.  The flavors change out sometimes even as often as daily which is great because there is always something you like and something new to try.  Plus you can't beat having some probiotics in your yogurt, haven't seen that from any of the others yet.  Would recommend this place to all who love frozen yogurt!  Plus they have a great rewards program.
