GREAT! Had their food in the Whole Foods truck lunch. Honestly never had Filipino food before. I got a sort of lentil mix over rice. It blew me away! So great, and so many unique flavors. Also, their chili sauce is amazing. 
Another pleasant surprise was that they had Mexican coke with real sugar, nice!
Service was very friendly, only wish they'd open a shop near me!
