I don't know where to start with Oregano's. I'm used to receiving good service, but this place went above and beyond to make me feel important, even when the place is packed on a Friday night. Moving my order up the queue so it would be done sooner, accompanying me to the area where the pick-up was (I was a newcomer), and then being almost the friendliest servers I've ever dealt with (seriously). That isn't even mentioning the pizza, which was by far the best I've had since moving here and is a close second to Brooklyn Pizza in New York. We tried Rossati's a couple of weeks before, and Oregano's blew them away. Amazing pizza, great service, and a price that is comparable to any pizza joint in town.
