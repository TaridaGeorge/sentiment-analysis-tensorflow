Very good and reasonably priced! I love that Greek salad is an option instead of fries for the same price. I went with my parents for a late lunch and we all enjoyed our meals. I ordered the chicken pita and it was huge. 

I ordered a falafel, which was good, but I really love the yogurt cucumber sauce. 

If I ever visit my parents in Arizona again, I will definitely ask to go back!
