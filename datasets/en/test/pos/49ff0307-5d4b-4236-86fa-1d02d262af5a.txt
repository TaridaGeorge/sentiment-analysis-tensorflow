Scottsdale stadium is the best park in the Cactus League, and as a Cubs fan, I wish that we would have a 7 game series vs these wankers for the right to use this stadium.  

Its proximity to the best day-drinking spots anywhere in the Valley is the primary reason to come to this particular stadium, because, well, who wants to see the Giants anyway?

The second best reason is that they import Bay Area-comforts like Anchor Steam, Pale Ale, and Northern Cali junk food.  

The grass berm in the outfield is short, but if you can snag a spot, its fantastic for sightlines.
