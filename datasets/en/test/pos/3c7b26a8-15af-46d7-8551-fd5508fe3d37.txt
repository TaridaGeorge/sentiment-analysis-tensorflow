Woke up recently, went into my home office & poof! No electricity!  Thought it was a breaker, wasn't.  So I called Scott over at Micor, he sent a technician out right away, and after following all the possible problems, found a short and ground problem outside, which was causing half the house to shut down.  Got it fixed right up.  Great response, great service, very reasonable rates!  Thanks Scott!
