I typically don't write reviews, but we had such a great experience with Justin and Elite that I had to post a review.  We have three boys under five years old, so as you can imagine, the floors and carpets take a beating.  Honestly we had stains that I didn't think would ever come out.  Justin came out, was friendly, and removed EVERY stain.  We have since had Justin over again to clean after the kids ruined the floors again.  I have recommended Elite to numerous clients.  Thank you for doing such a great job!
