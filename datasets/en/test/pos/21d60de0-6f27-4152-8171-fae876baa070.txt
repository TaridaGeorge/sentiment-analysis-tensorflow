This place is on my short list of things and places I miss most about Scottsdale since moving to PA.  We used to eat here all the time.  In fact my wife and I had dinner here the night before having our first child.  Pasquale (the owner) told her that Olive Oil would help induce labor and he wasn't lying!  The menu doesn't change from lunch to dinner and its also a BYOB, but that's OK because Pasquale and his staff make you feel right at home.  Indoors or on the small patio out front the food isn't fancy, but it doesn't have to be.  Good Italian about food, family and fun. 

Insider's tip!  Still hungry, ask for a little more (its often on the house).
