I have been a regular for about about 4 or 5  years now.  Lux is a home away from home. Ambiance, art & a great cup of coffee. Go with friends or go alone its still awesome. The staff is great, i.e. Sammy, Ron DMC, Sara, Lindsay, Jeff, & the list goes on ( sorry morning people I don't know your names :x ). No fancy review, just go in & get a coffee & a pastry, you'll never regret it.
