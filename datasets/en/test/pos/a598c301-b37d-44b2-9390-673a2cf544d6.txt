I can't recall a group business dinner anywhere that was better - 50 People - $8,000.00 and very good service and food.  If you have an event coming up ask for the Library, Wine Cellar or the Board Room  (and you have to visit) - we had too many people to use these rooms but our guests were treated like friends by Lon's and the food incredible - little touches of greatness that clients told us about weeks after the event was concluded.  I am in Scottsdale again in January and plan to make a dinner reservation this week. Thanks everyone at Lons!
