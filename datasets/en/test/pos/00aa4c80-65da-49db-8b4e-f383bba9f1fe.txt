This is a fabulous park for a quick but good hike.  There are a lot of people there, but I like that because I feel a little safer when I want to hike alone.  To me, feeling safe is very important.  I agree going early is a good idea though, you don't want to be plowed over by people too much :)  I'm going to go again and try a different trail.  Oh, and my pups also give it 5 stars.
