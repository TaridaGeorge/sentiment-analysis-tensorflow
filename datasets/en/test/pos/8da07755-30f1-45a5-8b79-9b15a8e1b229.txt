Wow, another gem in Scottsdale!  The food does take a while to arrive, but that is only because you are getting the freshest and best of what you could have ordered.  The atmosphere was great when I visited, a large group of people dining in the middle, laughing, and having fun, just what you'd expect from an Italian place, right?  The place smells devine, too.   So then there's the food...amazing!  Their breads are awesome, the sandwiches are nothing short of amazing.  You'll be back within a couple of days, if you can even hold out that long.
