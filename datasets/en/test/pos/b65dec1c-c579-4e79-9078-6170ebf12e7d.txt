This facility is really amazing. It's clean, gives each animal ample space to move about, symphony music is piped in over the speakers (soothing to animals), and adoption fees are reasonable. They keep excellent medical records on each animal that comes through their system. 
I'm big on adoption. It is so, so important to me that families who want to consider having a pet should give the Humane Society a try before going anywhere else. Sure, puppies are cute for a few months, but they need training. Adult dogs have already been housebroken, many know tricks and words, and they appreciate and love you that much more, remembering where they came from and knowing your home will be their best ever.
