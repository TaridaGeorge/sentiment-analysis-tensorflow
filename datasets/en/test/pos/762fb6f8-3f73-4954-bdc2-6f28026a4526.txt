Tomato, Mozzarella, Basil sandwiches = crack sandwiches!!  I work near PB and go often.  If you are looking for a huge menu with a large seating area, don't be surprised to find a few items and the Market Fresh Sandwich of the day on the menu and outdoor seating.  That's what makes this place so great, the food is fab and there's nothing else like this place in Phoenix....or perhaps the whole world!
