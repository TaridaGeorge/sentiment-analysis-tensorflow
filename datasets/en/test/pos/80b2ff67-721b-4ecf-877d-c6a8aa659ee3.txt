I am going to say that we were impressed by this place. Of course i have been too many CPK"s in AZ and CA. I found nothing wrong with this one at all. We had a 10 min wait. Not bad for a Saturday night. We wanted a large booth and we got one. Our waitress checked on us many times so that was really good of her. She bought us water and lemon with a straw. Something i love!    We had the Peach and Gorgonzola cheese salad with Salmon. OMG fantastic! Then a Wild mushroom Pizza. So very good. We had a great meal and great service. Making for a great Saturday night.
