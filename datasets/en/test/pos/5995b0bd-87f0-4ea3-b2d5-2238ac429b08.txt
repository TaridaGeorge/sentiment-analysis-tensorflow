I love this farmers market.  Sure it is smaller then some of the other markets but everyone is very friendly and they are ever growing.  It is the best one in the SE valley for sure.  Thanks to vendors such as Desert Root Farms, One Mill Farms, and Rhiba Farms (wheat grass specialists) it is a must for my eating and juicing needs.

Thank you to the operators of GFM, Jessa and Dan, for a great job in keeping it friendly and to a high standard.
