My husband had requested BBQ ribs for our anniversary dinner so I searched yelp and found Bobby Qs. We live in Goodyear so it was a bit of a drive but worth every mile. The cornbread was warm and fresh, we had the Whole hog platter and have enough leftover for at least one more meal. The baby back ribs were melt-in-your-mouth good, the pulled pork and brisket to die for, the grilled corn sweet and buttery.  It is now our new favorite BBQ restaurant. Laura, the manager, was friendly and very warm.
