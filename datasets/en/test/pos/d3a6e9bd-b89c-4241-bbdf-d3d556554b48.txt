I had a fantastic experience here. I have been searching for some quailty Mexican food since moving here recently, and hadn't had too much luck (besides Gallo Blanco). Black Chile has incredible food. Some of their dishes seemed very unique, and I will branch out next time for sure! I had the Chicken Enchiladas, and it proved to be a great choice. The entire dish, from the superb presentation, to the tasty rice and beans, to the incredible main dish with the sauce, was perfect. they have a great Happy Hour too, I will be returning.
