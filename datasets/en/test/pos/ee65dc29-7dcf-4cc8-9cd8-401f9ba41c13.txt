This spa is amazing!!!! The staff was very friendly and the services I received were outstanding.  You can add on services to your treatments that are all great such as a hair dew treatment, hot salt back scrub, aroma therapy and many more. There signature massage is a Blissage75 (a 75 min mass for $150) and their facial would be a Triple oxygen facial which is also 75 min long.  All the technicians are trained well and are very professional.   In the lounges you have fairytale brownies, crackers, cheeses, cucumbers, lemon/cucumber water.
