All About Books and Comics is simply the best for comics. The staff are extremely helpful. When I needed two back issues of a series, they got it for me. Bam, done. The staff make you feel at home but don't invade your personal space. They never act pretentious toward their customers (which is the WORST at comic book stores). Their overall comic-stock is impressive, and they don't try to be anything other than a comic book store. That's what I want from a comic book store, which is why that makes them the best.
