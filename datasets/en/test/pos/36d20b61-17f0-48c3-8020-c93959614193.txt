This is my absolute favorite breakfast restaurant. It's always crazy on the weekends, but hey, with a place this good how could you expect it NOT to be crazy? They also allow you to make reservations; it's your own fault if you're waiting an hour! Food is always great, and that's why I keep coming back even 8 years later.
