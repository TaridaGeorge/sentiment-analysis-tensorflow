I usually go to this location or the one off of 7th in North PHX.  Both locations always have what I'm looking for---seems like they're always stocked well (or I'm the only one buying these particular supplements! lol).

Service is great---the guys that work there can answer any question--even after all my research online, I still quiz and ask a million questions sometimes- they're on their game. I feel comfortable purchasing from these locations.

Extra plus for the large real estate both stores have--never too crowded, and its a supplement queen's dream to stay and peruse the shelves looking for a new antioxidant blend to try....:)

AND, you accrue points! (If you've read any of my reviews, you know points, miles, etc is something I completely appreciate!!! :))
