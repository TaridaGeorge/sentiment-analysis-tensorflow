My niece just got a job here so my family decided to go check it out and WOW, we were impressed! We tried the antipasti appetizer and it was so delicious! Goat cheese wrapped in prosciutto, salami, manchego and bread. Pesto, olive tepanade and mustard to dip. So good. Then we shared a few pizzas. Brussel prout and proscuitto, a margherita and pulled pork and serrano pepper. They were all fabulous!! Our service (Gwen) was great  and we really loved this place. Everyone seemed to genuinely enjoy working here which made for a nice overall experience,
