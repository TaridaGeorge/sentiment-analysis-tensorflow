If you were to look up "Dive Bar" in the dictionary (ok, Wikipedia for you cyber geeks).. The Coach House would pop up as the prime example:
...A beacon of light amongst the carnage of Scottsdale Foo-Foo
... An Oasis amongst the desert sands of Arizona
....Great drink prices
...great tunes 
...and the full spectrum of females (from the young hipsters to the wanna be cougars..and that's just the bar tenders!!!). 
... And the icing on the cake are the HD TVs.
