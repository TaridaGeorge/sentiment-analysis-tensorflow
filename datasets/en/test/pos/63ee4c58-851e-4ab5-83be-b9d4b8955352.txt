Expensive but I LOVE it!

Look, I am a Marriott rewards member, and while the rooms are expensive they are really nice, the 17th floor was awesome (by the way it goes from 12 to 14....like 14 isn't really 13 at that point). The breakfast had fresh fruit, and not the cheap melon stuff, the actual strawberry, raspberry and pineapple. I am a loyal rewards member and have yet to stay in a bad hotel!
