I just had a wonderful experience at this Target.  They say it's the attitude of employees that make a good company and they're right!  The girl that rung me up at the checkout stand was genuinely kind, sweet, interested in the fun I had this weekend, and well, just great!  She was such a wonderful woman that I didn't even notice at first that she hardly had any use of the right side of her body.  Knowing that this Target was willing to hire a disabled person is a big plus for me, and what a wonderful person they got!  Two thumbs up for this great shopping experience!
