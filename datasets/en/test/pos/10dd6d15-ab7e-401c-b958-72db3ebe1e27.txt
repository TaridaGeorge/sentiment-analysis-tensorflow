mmmmmmm

Food:  Pizza, cheese sticks, garlic knots, chicken parm... it is all so very, very tasty.  I purposely order too much so that I can enjoy the leftovers the next day.

Service:  The service is good.  Sometimes they get a bit busy and the server doesn't come by for a while.  Since the restuarant is very open you can see that it is because they are working with other customers and not off goofing.  Usually someone else will come by and see if you need anything when the wait staff gets over-occupied.

Convenience:  This location is in a shopping area with tons of ample parking so it makes it very easy to get in and out of without hassle.
