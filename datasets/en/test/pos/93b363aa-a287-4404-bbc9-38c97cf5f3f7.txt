This is my favorite Postino's!  They have a really awesome and unique set up.  The inside opens up into the outside patio.  It stays really cool outside even when it's 100 degrees outside.  They play fun music at a good volume level.  The greens salad was really really good!  Also a really good selection of bruschetta.  There is a fire place for when it's cold too.
