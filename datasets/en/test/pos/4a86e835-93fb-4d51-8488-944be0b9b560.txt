A small family owned and run Italian resturant.  Great food, service and wines.  The menu is varied with daily specials.  The chef is Dad & daughter, Mother is the Maitre' D, daughter and brother servers.  Have been going there since it opened and have never been the least bit disapointed.  Must call for reservations.  Come and get spoiled. Best in the valley! For me best in country!
