This is the perfect date restaurant.  Make a reservation, sit outside under the misters and take in the great atmosphere.  I was lucky enough to indulge in the restaurant week menu.  Arugula salad, squash soup, asian meatballs on risotto with long beans and finished with lemon meringue and tasted my date's creme brulee.  Exquisite food.
