I have died and gone to shopaholic heaven. Walking through here I was salivating. They have everything you could ever dream of and the decor is fabulous. Its chic and upper class and I don't imagine a ton of high school kids venture here to hang out. If you are a poor college student like myself its a total tease but its always fun to look. We went right before they closed (which was probably a blessing) so we didn't get to venture into very many stores but we WILL be back.
