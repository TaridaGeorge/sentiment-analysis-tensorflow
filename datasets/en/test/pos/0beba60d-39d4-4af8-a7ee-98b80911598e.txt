I'm a banana kind of girl.  Everyone who knows me, knows this.  I love the concept of this store.  Especially the petites section.  The drive to Chadler can be a bit daunting if you have to do it often, which I do.., so it's nice to have another option.  I also wait for coupons or sales before I make my trip, that way, I am getting great deals.  My last visit, I was able to save over 80 dollars!  Cha-ching.  And I got some great pieces to add to my collection.  Sometimes I have a hard time finding what I want, or maybe am hesitant to spend the money, but all in all, I always leave with a piece that I love.  

Current favorite-small black purse
Current wish list-leather jacket...  (I'm waiting for a sale or a coupon!)
