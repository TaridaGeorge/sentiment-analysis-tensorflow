We had my daughter's 8th birthday here today. What a great experience! We chose to go with the 4:30 to 7 time slot because of the special "cosmic skate" type session. Most of the girls attending had never skated before. When I booked the party I also reserved the skate mates - they are like walkers on wheels to help new skaters. The staff was excellent, especially our party host. I spent the same amount of money I would have at Chuck E Cheese and everyone - including adults - had a way better time. I will be doing this again for years to come!
