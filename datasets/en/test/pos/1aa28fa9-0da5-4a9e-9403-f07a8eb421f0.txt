I was referred here by a co-worker that raved how Proformance uses my company's insurance. I go to the Gold's Gym next door but never knew what this place was about. I went in, scheduled an appt, was shown the facility and was explained how the process works with my insurance. 

My appt was a few days ago and I had an hour massage with Heather. She was extremely friendly and asked if I had any problems areas I'd like her to work on. My massage was great...I am still itching to go back for my next massage. I made sure to tip Heather but other than that, there was no out of money costs. 

If you have insurance that covers chiropractic services and massage therapy, it is definitely worth checking this place out!
