This is my favorite Thai restaurant EVER!!!  It's family owned, and the staff are sooo nice!  The portions and prices are great!  They never have trouble making curries just the way we like them! Their yellow curry is so delicious that it brings a smile to my face just thinking about it, and their Osha Golden Pockets are like little yummy pockets of happiness that have yet to be replicated by any other Thai restaurant I've ever been too.  The Pad-thai has the perfect balance of sweet and savory,and the Chicken Satay is so juicy!  They also make a great cup of Thai iced tea :) I wish I still lived in the area!
