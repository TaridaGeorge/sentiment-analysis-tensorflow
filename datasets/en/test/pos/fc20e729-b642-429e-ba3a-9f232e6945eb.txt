I have been a frequent client of Ganem over the years. I have had the pleasure of buying new items, pre-owned items and getting my watches cleaned and repaired there. ALWAYS stellar service.

I was reminded of just how good they are when I dropped in last week and asked them to fit a new titanium mesh bracelet to a dive watch I had with me. I knew it was sturdy and required special tools to size it for me ... go to the experts. 

They fell all over me and brought out my watch - good to go. No charge.
A special thanks to Brittany for all she did to make my experience at Ganem simply over the top. In my opinion, no better jeweler in ALL of Phoenix. Check them out.
