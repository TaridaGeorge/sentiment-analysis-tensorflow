I agree with everything Nicole N. so beautifully stated. My son just completed the 2s class and will be starting the 3s class in the fall. Besides the fact that he loves school and talks about his friends and teachers all the time, I was surprised by how much support I felt as a "first time mom". The school provides ongoing parent education, and the experienced teachers are always available to answer questions and offer advice. I also chose this school because it is open and welcoming to ALL, and they embrace diversity and lead by example.
