My friends and I are currently devouring our 8oz. cups of gelato. The girl at the counter (we didn't catch her name, but she rocked!) quickly greeted us and helped us with the gelato experience. She willingly gave us samples of everything(!) and she offered up tasty combinations of flavors. I ended up with the strawberry & cheesecake, Jon S. got straw/cheesecake/pb, and James got mango and fruit. They make it fresh everyday and you can definitely taste the quality and freshness of it. 

We're not sure how we're going to finish all of this gelato but it sure is yum!
