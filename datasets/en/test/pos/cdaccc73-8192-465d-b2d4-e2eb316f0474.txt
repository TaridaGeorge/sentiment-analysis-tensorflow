What better way to spend a lazy summer day or night than seeing a great independent film at classy Camelview! Located next to Fashion Square Camelview usually plays four independent films at a time, most which you can't find anywhere else. The theater is pretty small  and dated, but it has an art deco design and I wouldn't want them to redo it. There is a really relaxed and intelligent vibe at Camelview, and an added bonus almost nobody under sixteen! 

Some great films I have seen here:
Brokeback
Garden State
Napoleon Dynamite
Super Size Me
Little Miss Sunshine
