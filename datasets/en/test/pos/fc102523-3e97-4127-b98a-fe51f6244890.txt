I live right next door to Retro Redux.  I love this place!  Everyone who works there is so damn friendly!  I chat for a fairly long time while making purchases.  In fact, it's on my agenda for tomorrow.  I've been collecting little things here and there for when I buy a condo downtown before the light rail shoots up property values.  
Last time, I got the most awesome hanging lamp.  Also, a couple orange vases and a vintage ashtray.  When my sister comes to visit from the OC (there's no flavor there!) she always wants to go to Redux!
