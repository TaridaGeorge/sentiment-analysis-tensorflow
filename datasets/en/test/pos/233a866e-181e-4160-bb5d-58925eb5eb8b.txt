Wonderful Pizza.  Sclafani's provided pizza for the Desert Canyon Health Screenings last week and it was a wonderful introduction to this new local business.  Thanks so much Sclafani's for contributing to our volunteer event.  The pizza was amazing and I'm looking forward to ordering for my family in the future!!
