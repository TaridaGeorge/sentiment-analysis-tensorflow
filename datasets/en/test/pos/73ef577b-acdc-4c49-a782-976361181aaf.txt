Just signed up for 2 week option. Went to my first "hot yoga" class today at Sumits. I use to do regular yoga at Lifetime. I really never felt I was getting any benefits (weight loss, muscle tone etc...)  from regular yoga. During this "hot yoga" workout I was really sweating! I hope that means I was getting a good workout. Anyways....I did enjoy it. The 80 minutes flew by!

About the facility. The staff were amazing. Jodie taught the class and was so sweet, and made the workout stress-free. The place was clean and had a an upbeat atmosphere. I loved the music they played.
