A secretly very cool place. We stumbled upon this place on the way home, we were hungry and it looked open. When we went in the door, we were in awe. It looks twice as big inside and has an intriguing atmosphere. The service was fast, friendly, and  efficient. Pricing was surprisingly decent seeing as the restaurant was pretty fancy and the food was amazing. We had crepes for dinner and dessert, both were mind blowing. I will be dining here again! (And soon.)
