I love the Living Room!!  An unexpected and welcomed surprise in Chandler.  The atmosphere and vibe is perfect.  Happy hour prices from 11:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. are some of the best out there.  If you go, you must try the Red Sangria..........  Once a month they have a girls night out for signature drinks and bruschetta - make a reservation!  Where else can you get 3 drinks and apps for $20?

My only complaint is that the music can be a little on the loud side.  I have asked them to turn it down a smidge and they happily did so.
