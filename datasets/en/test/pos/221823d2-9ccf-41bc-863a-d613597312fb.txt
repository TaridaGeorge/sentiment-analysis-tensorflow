i am afraid that my first "review" did not adequately express my affinity for zoyo and its manager, michael.  it is by far my favorite yogurt place in the valley.  my only problem with it is that it's in ahwatukee, and i live in glendale.  PLEASE open a zoyo in the west valley.  we like yogurt, too.  :)
