Great food, great chefs, great dinner experience!  I went for my birthday, and was treated to a nice chef's choice of some very interesting culinary experiences.  Our chef Leo was very fast, very polite, and very knowledgeable about the food.  They made me feel more like a guest and less like a foreigner.  To top it off, Leo did an awesome fruit carved rickshaw and served it to me with ice cream to make my night special.  Ill definitely go back again!
