I'm not the first to review, but I'm the first male to review.  That's gotta count for something, right?

I'm super into Lush.  When my fiance comes home with product from here, I get jealous to an obscene degree.  Most often, she has to hide her purchases from me because if I find a bar of delicious smelling body soap or a tube of facial cleanser, it will be gone within a week.  Book it.  I probably use four times the necessary amount each time and, if it weren't for the travel and expense, I would singlehandedly keep their business afloat.  

I've even made it a point to visit their San Francisco location while on vacation.  My obsession reaches unhealthy extremes.

Some guys are into sports, some guys are into guns.  I'm into Lush.  Just don't tell anyone, okay?
