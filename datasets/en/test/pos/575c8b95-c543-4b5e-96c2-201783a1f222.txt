I don't know what else to add from all the other positive reviews.  This place is the shining star of Tempe bars, being a old house hidden off of Ash St.  And then they get points for being in the Jimmy Eat World song as the place to meet on a Tuesday night.  Great atmosphere with a decent beer selection, and the food is actually really good!  This is definitely my favorite bar in Tempe!
