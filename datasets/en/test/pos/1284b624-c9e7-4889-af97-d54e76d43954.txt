What can I say about Slice of Sicily? It's amazing, that's what I can say. Anytime you find a pizza joint that also serves real Italian dinners, and the owners actually operate the place, you are in for great food! They are capable of making a truly mean New York style pie. I typically like sausage on my pizza, but their seasoned hamburger has replaced it as my topping of choice.
Suffice to say, I have forsaken pizza chains due to the superb quality of the food at Slice of Sicily.
