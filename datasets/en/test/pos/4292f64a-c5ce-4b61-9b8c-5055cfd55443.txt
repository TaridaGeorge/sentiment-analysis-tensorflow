Awesome place to grab a glass wine with friends!

Who can pass up a great $5 wine by the glass deal?  Plus the wine list is amazing.  I wanted to try everything.  I noticed this new catch a couple weeks ago but finally stopped for lunch.  It was so hard to decide what to eat for lunch.  The food selection is amazing.  I finally decided on the Prosciutto and Brie with a cup of Butternut Squash soup.  I love all the different types of bruchetta they have to offer.  The staff was very helpful with the wine selections.  I have found my new wine place and I can't wait to go back to try more of their delicious food!
