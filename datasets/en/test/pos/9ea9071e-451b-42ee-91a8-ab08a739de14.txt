At the end of the day, you just want someone to take care of you.  OUR someone is the Gen'l Mgr, Michael Colleluori and bartender, Jared....we receive such great service and its the one place that we can go and KNOW that our food will arrive, hot and delicious.  Cajun style, bone-in Rib Eye, is what I'm talking about!!  Perfectly cooked (thanks, chef!) along with some lyonnaise potatoes and salad.  Topped off with heavenly cheesecake and now I just need someone to drive me home!  (which reminds me!  Shout out to the valet!!)  Thanks again for a great evening!
