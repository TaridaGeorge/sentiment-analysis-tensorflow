What I really like about Urban Cookies is that it is different, it isn't like your typical bakery. It is "Urban", "Whimsy", and "Hip". It's perfectly located in Central Phoenix...far away from the cookie cutter chain places along the edges of the burbs!

There are a few items to chose from, which is perfect for anyone who has trouble deciding. Very friendly and helpful service too! 

I like that their cookies aren't TOO SWEET. They look homemade and chunky...{{hello, do i hear cookies calling my name...???}}....natural and made with love!

As for the cupcakes...they are sooooo GOOD & delicious!!! Not too sweet. They are moist and buttery. (I think they call them "ollie cakes"??) They are $1.99 each and worth it! Probably the BEST cupcakes I have ever had.

ONE WORD: YUM!
