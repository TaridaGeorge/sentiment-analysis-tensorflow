Went into the store looking for a specific item that was on clearance online.  

The store was a bit of a mess- end of the season sales.  But the staff was unbelievably friendly.  

I was only able to find 1 of the items that I needed and when I asked for help the staff was happy to assist me.  Even with the store about to close (I was the only customer left) the staff members helped me, chatted with me, and found exactly the item I was looking for. 

 They even gave me a list of stores that has the item in stock in case I needed more.  

I will definetly shop at this store again.
