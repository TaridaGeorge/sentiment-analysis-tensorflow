Coming from Chicago, it's hard to find good pizza..until Spinato's came to town! Been there about 10 times now and it's consistently YUMMY! The sauce has a slight sweetness to it, and the pizza...fuhgettaboutit!! Good service, they always get the order right.  Just ask for the pizza to be crispy as the dough could be a little mushy if you don't ask for it be crispy.  Must have!!
