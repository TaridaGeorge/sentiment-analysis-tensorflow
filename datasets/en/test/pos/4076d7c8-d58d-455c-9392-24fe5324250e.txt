My wife and I went here for lunch on Thursday.  We started with the antipasto salad which was delicious with three kinds of olives, pepperoni and salami, pickeled peppers and many other goodies.  The whole things was very fresh.  We had a large special pizza hand tossed which was also very good.  The crust was just right and had a very good flavor.  Needless to say we took home over half of it and enjoyed it over the next two days.  This is a very good local pizza place.
Next time we want to try the deep dish pizza.
