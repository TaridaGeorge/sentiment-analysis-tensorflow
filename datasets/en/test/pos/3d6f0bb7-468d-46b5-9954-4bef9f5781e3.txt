I am a huge fan of Urban Outfitters clothing in general. They sometimes have questionable business practices and can be quite culturally insensitive, but purely based on clothing, I love them.

With regard to this location, I felt compelled to write about their great customer service. Every time I have gone in here, I have felt very welcomed and supported in my purchases and returns. And I am not an easy customer. I shop online a lot and am always returning/exchanging items. But they are always so helpful and nice, I just love them. This is very unlike the Scottsdale Urban Outfitters experience where it seems like they want nothing to do with you and are too cool for school. This location, though, 5 stars for service. Thanks, guys!!
