My most favorite Thai restaurant!!!

I've tried many of their dishes and my favorite is their Pad See Ew with tofu (and no egg), and their Pad Thai (with no egg). Their curries are also really good too! The dining area is tiny, cozy, a great place to take someone on a date. My Mum and I like to go here when we have bad days and eat our feelings away hehe. Thai House is wayyyy out of our way and there are at least 4 other (substandard) Thai restaurants within 10 minutes of our house, but we are always wiling to go the extra mile to eat here!

They usually have really good specials too. This place is worth the drive.
