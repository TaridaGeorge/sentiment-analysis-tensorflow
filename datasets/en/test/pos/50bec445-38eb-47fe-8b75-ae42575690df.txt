Sunrise Trail is really fabulous.  Not too crowded...not too out of the way.  The trail to hike is Lost Dog Trail or the the one near it.  It is beautiful, steep and a great workout.   The trail on 136th is like walking in a huge wash for miles and miles and then you hit the boulders and the rocks that you must scale...it gets difficult...I don't suggest that one.

I bring my dog Biggins...I pick up his poo...a lot of people don't and that part was disappointing...so if you bring your pup bring a bag and be willing to carry it back down ...please:)
