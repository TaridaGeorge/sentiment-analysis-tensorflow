LOVE this place.  

The prices are in line with Petsmart, but Petsmart doesn't give you your 11th bag free. Wag N Wash does. 

I love the variety of both natural food and paraphenalia.  Need a leash or collar? Check here, they have a great variety.  I think I am going back to get a new collar for my sweet boy. He doesn't need one, but he'd sure look cute in some of the designs available.

Plus you can wash your dog onsite and not have to deal with clean up and smelly towels.  Or water all over your bathroom after a tub escape and subsequent shake. 

Come on, dog lovers in South Scottsdale, let's make sure this wonderful place lasts!!! Shop local.
