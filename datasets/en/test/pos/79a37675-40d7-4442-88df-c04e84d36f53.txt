I really dig this place.  What a treat!  Everytime I go here, its just so much fun.

The theme of this place is straight out of the 1950's.  I like that.  They have a full menu of breakfast, lunch and dinner. The staff even dresses like it was the 1950's too!

They have table, booth and bar seating here.  I usually drop in for breakfast, but have eaten lunch and dinner here as well.  I'm sure eating here is probably not the best thing for me, but theres something fun about getting good food that I cannot pass up.  I think its a very unique place!
