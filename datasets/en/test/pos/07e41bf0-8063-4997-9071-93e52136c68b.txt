A friend suggested this place for lunch the other day and since I had never heard of it I said sure.  We walked in and he walked us over to the bar and we sat ourselves there.  We were warmly greeted by a smiling asian lady, and given menus.  We both decided on the Cha-shu (ramen soup with BBQ Pork)  I told her that I was allergic to Sesame, and she was very responsive to my needs and immedeatly told the cooks about my allergy.  Great food...great service and she even gave me a to-go cup for my iced tea....what service....I will be going back here a lot in the future.
