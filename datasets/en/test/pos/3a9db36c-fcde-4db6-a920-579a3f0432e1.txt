Breakfast at noon = AWESOME!!!

EVEN MORE AWESOME?  Front flipping row parking, ha!!!  

Had the Daybreaker - egg white omelet with roasted turkey breast, topped w/ tomato-avocado salsa!  Absolutely fantastically wonderfully DELICIOUS!!!  It was light & flavorful & quite a bit of turkey, good turkey, not the pressed processed stuff claiming to be turkey :-)

Love their ice tea, mmm mmmm mm!!!
