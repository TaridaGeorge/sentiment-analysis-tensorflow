Prior to moving to the area Vanessa was the first one I contacted  to ensure she  would be available to visit my two fur babies.  I travel quite a bit for both business and  pleasure and I NEVER have to worry about Dog care.  She is always accommodating with my hectic (last min) schedule and  quite honestly, when I come home from a long trip, I really think  my babies are more sad they wont  be getting a visit from  Vanessa than they are excited to see me!
If your looking for outstanding animal care I promise you will NOT be dissapointed.
