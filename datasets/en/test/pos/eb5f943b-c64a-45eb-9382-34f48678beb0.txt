Ok, so THE BEST BBQ in AZ is actually my buddy Kenny P's.  In restaurant form, the best is Lucille's.  I've had Haps, I've had Honey Bears, I've had Tom's, but the best is Lucille's.  Order the "cut with a spoon tender" Tri-Tip, add some of their spicy sauce to the mop sauce it comes with.  The best.

I've torn myself away from the Tri-Tip a couple times.  The pulled pork sandwich was great, the meatloaf was massive and excellent . . . but nothing touches the Tri-Tip

Appetizers . . . I love the deep fried pickle wedges, and the crab cakes with the jalapeno tarter sauce were great too.  

Not the cheapest place to eat, but Lucille's is one place where you truly still get more than you pay for
