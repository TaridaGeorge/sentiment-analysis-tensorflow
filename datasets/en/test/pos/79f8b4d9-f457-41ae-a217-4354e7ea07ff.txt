They had Kool Aid! i was so happy to see it :)

The chicken and waffles were really good... my girlfriend and I went straight there from the airport, before going to our hotel, and it was completely worth it... 

yeah, waiting outside in 100 degree heat isn't ideal, but for 10 minutes you can deal with it... especially when they had someone outside giving out water

If you're ever in Phoenix like us, or live out there, definitely stop in!!!
