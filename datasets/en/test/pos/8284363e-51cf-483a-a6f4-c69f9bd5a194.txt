In one word: Yum!  My husband and I just ate here because we were bored with our usual places.  OMG this place blew us away.  The portions sizes were larger than expected. He loved the cafe burger and mixed green salad.  I had the veggie wrap with mac and cheese and loved that!  We will definitely go again and bring our friends!
