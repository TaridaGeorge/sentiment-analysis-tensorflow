I have used Todd on at least a dozen occasions. I am a property investor and I buy multiple homes. I need Todd for EVERY house I do and he is ALWAYS there for me. He even got me into my own car once. At the drop of a hat, he is there for me. His knowledge is excellent, his demeanor is fantastic and his service and workmanship is excellent. I would NEVER use another locksmith unless he was dead or out of town. In which case I would probably ask him to come home. :) Use this guy. Hes great.
