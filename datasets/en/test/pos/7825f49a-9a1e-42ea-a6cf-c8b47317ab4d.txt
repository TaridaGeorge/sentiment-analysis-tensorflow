I put my body through hell and back.. some months Ill low carb others Ill eat WAY to much of everything.. the American yoyo diet I suppose. On the eve of my low carb madness I come to Europa to pick up a few goodies.

The cheese and cherry coffee cake is the BEST Ive ever tasted! Moist flaky crust covered in cheese and canned cherries.. sheer delight and a real middle finger to the low carb diet! 

I feel so good and bad all at the same time.
