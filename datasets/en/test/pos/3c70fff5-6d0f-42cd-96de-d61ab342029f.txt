Heng Hong is the best tailor in the country. Period.  Great quality work, fair prices and quick turnaround. All done with a smile on his face and a unforgettable laugh. Parking is in back of what seems like a residential alley, so off Camelback go left (north) on 75th & take the first right (which is the alley). Landmark from Camelback road is Don & Charlie's restaurant.
