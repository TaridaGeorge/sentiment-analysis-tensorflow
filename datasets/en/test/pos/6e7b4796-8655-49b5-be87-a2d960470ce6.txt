I LOVE THIS PLACE! It's so nice to be able to eat here whenever it's chilly outside. Actually, allow me to be honest, I probably would eat here everyday but I settle for 1-2 times a week.

I get my Pho with extra meatballs and no onions and they make it perfect for me each time!!! The folks are awesome and no matter how busy it is everything come out SUPER fast! You know a girl loves to eat in a timely manner with my hectic schedule!

The Springrolls, the crab puffs the chicken fried rice all amazing too! For a good time time and warm feeling after a FANTASTIC meal this is the best come winter or AZ summer time:)
