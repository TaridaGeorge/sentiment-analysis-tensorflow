After a horrible experience at a different appliance store, I went to Sears and they made it all better for me.  My new fridge will be delivered in two days (the other appliance store failed to get me one in the promised week and told me it would take 3 more).  Also, the Sears Sales Associate was amazingly persistent when the computer system wasn't cooperative and really went the extra mile to get me the fridge I wanted.  They have once again earned my loyalty.  Another employee (possibly a floor manager?) was also very helpful and friendly.
