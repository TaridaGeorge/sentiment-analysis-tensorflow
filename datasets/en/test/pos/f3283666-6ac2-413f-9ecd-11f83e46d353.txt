The root beer that they make is should be considered CRACK! I go there just for the root beer. Everything in this place is good they have a few floor managers whom walk around asking you if your food is ok. If its not they will take it back and then something else is back to you in 10 mins. 

And its right next to a comic book store to boot. Its a good area to go and eat. I would visit again and again.
