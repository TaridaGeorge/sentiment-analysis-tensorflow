I thought the idea of chicken and waffels was kind of werid, that's mainly why I wanted to go. But this place was awesome! There waffels are really good, they have a great flavor. The chicken is really good as well, I also had their cheese grits. I really recommend everything I had and think you should stop by if you get the chance.
