I'm giving Don & Charlies 5 stars because it is an all around solid steakhouse. Everything I've tried here has been really good, from the shrimp cocktail, to their salads, and of course their big, juicy, tender steaks. But it isn't just good food, management,  servers, and even their valet guys understand what good service is. The owner/managing partner I  met was super sweet, and seemed very down to earth, in fact this whole restaurant is very cool and unpretentious. The prices are not low, but well worth a splurge. Well done Don & Charlies!
