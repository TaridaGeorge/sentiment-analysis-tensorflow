Solid old school Barbershop.  I've been to several barbershops on this side of town trying to find a good one.  I think I've finally found my new barber.  

Solid ambience, skilled and friendly barbers (who aren't afraid to strike up a conversation with you!), and a convenient location.  

Tip: I went in the morning (before 10am), and the hustle and bustle of Kierland hadn't started yet.
