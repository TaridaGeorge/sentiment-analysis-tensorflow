Did a Tuesday night special, bottle of house wine and bruschetta.  Amazing!  The bruschetta was fantastic!  So good we ordered another round!  I had every kind without meat, and being a foodie, some of the best I've ever had!  The pairing of such unique ingredients will bring me back again.  If you don't finish your bottle of wine, just re-cork and take with you!  Awesomeness at the beginning of the week.  Perfection.
It was packed when we arrived at 9pm, be prepared to wait.  The only downfall is parking.  If you do not valet, it's a bit of a walk, no biggie in the winter, but DO NOT park on the street.  The cops will ticket and/or tow.  Boooo.
