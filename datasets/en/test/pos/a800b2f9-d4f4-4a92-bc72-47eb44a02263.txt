Just bought a new home and wanted to get something special for the mortgage company that serviced my loan.  I saw reviews on Yelp and decided on Topit due to it's reviews and location.  I received a friendly greeting from the owner as I arrived at the clean and inviting shop.  I picked a dozen cupcakes, with a mix of flavors including cotton candy and malted milk.  My loan officer called to thank me for the treat.   He and his team eagerly devoured the dozen cupcakes shortly after I dropped them off.  He confessed he normally doesn't eat sweets but fell in love with the all chocolate cupcakes.   When I finally move I know where to go to get a great treat!
