Broadway In Arizona love this place so affordable with tickets starting at $25 :) and they have student rush for 50% off and free parking! You can also take light rail and get off veteran way and walk here :) also buy your tickets at the box office for -$7 in fees :) I'm seeing Le mis right now and then planning on seeing war horse, Adams family, and beauty and the beast as well this season :)
