Ah, delightful Tea Time!

This small local shop seems to have a knack for knowing what it takes to keep customers in a very specialized business.  Their tea selection is quite good, and more than anything else, the service behind the counter is outstanding.  That's what I appreciate most about the place!  Every time I've gone, I've gotten suggestions from people who clearly know what they're talking about.  It's pretty cool!

They also make an effort to bring people in with some creative events, and while I've never been to any, they sound pretty cool too.

If you're a fan of loose leaf tea, try this place out rather than going to a certain shopping mall chain (which isn't that bad... Tea Time is just better).
