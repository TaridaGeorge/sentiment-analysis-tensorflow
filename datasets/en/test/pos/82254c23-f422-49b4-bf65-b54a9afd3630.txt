The Pig is very helpful, knowledgable and has a broader selection of brands of bikes, parts, tires, accessories, etc. than other stores within 8-10 miles.  It's a big shop and has a very local feel.  They are informed and able to answer performance questions.  If they're busy, go grab a coffee at Lux next door.  There's hope if your question or  needs warrant a veteran's expertise.  Amidst the stocked walls, you can always find experts/techs who ride and share their honesty, freely.  Buy your bike here.  They know their product(s).
