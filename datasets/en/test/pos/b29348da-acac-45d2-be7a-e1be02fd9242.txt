Only sad part of lunch was that it wasn't the full dinner experience.  We found this place on Yelp while in town for a conference and got to have a deliciously awesome lunch for under $30 for 2.  

We had a roasted veggie crostini and shrimp+polenta.  Both were perfection. Again, only issue here was that we wanted to sit there for the rest of our vacation and eat everything Chef Chris makes.  Nonstop.

The space is truly special, as if you are eating in your friends rustic house while they are cooking you up a culinary masterpiece.  The lunch was unforgettable, and we'll have to make it back for hours of evening eating.
