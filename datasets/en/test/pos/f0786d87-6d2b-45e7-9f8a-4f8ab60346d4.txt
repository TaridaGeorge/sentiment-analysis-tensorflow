Take this from someone who has never liked donuts. Nope, not even as a child. Nope, not even Krispy Kremes. 
These are AMAZING!!!
I could come here every weekend. So cheap (75 cents each) and so delicious! I got the chocolate sprinkle donut and it was just perfect. The frosting with silky smooth and the dough was like a pillow. I had to check them out to see if they lived up to the hype and they did! My husband tried the original glazed donut and he loved it as well!
I want to try more of their donuts, and also their smoothies! Their breakfast sandwiches don't look half bad, either. They even have a drive-thru! Staff were very nice and helpful. I will definitely be back.
