I ordered about a week in advance for a special dozen cupcakes. They are super helpful and patient while trying to decide exactly what you want.  I ordered 6 of the coconut and 6 of the Reeces( you can only get peanut butter ones certain days) and they were both a hit! They decorated them with footballs and skateboards and everyone absolutely raved about the cupcakes! Def worth checking this place out and they are reasonably priced. This will be my go to spot for future special occasions!
