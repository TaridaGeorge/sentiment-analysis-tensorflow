I have been getting facials from Mary at Skin Bliss for years! She does excellent work and really cares about what she is doing for her clients. Some skin spas cut corners by purchasing less expensive and inferior skin care products, but Mary uses the best and it shows in the treatments! I also enjoy going to her spa because it is relaxing and you get complete one on one attention. No sitting around in a waiting room looking at magazines with 10 other ladies. Try her out!
