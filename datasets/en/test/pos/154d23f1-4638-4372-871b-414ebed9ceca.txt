We come here for our dental needs and love it!!  It's pretty modern, TV in every room and the service is great.  Dr. Sam is awesome and so are the assistants and hygienists!  I'm being vague here because I've had very little sleep and it's late.  Forgive me!!

My recent experience I had to get a crown and it was cool that it gets done in the office.  I could even watch the machine that was sawing away to make it fit in my mouth!  Sawing is inaccurate.  The machine used pressurized water.  How cool is that?!
