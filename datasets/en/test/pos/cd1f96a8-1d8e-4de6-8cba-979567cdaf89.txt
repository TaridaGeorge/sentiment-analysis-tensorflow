FnB, I am in love with you!! From your small, intimate yet eclectic setting to your amazing menu featuring Arizona grown foods and wines, how my heart will long until my next visit!!
Stopped in with my fellow Yelper Andrea and we were so pleased with everything, especially the service we got from Pavle and the rest of the staff. We ordered the rock shrimp(delish with a slight zing), fried green tomatoes(hello, my mouth is bursting with joy!), the grilled lamb with artichokes and potatoes(warm, tender, amazing!) and succulent chocolate bread pudding and lemon cake for dessert.( we were in heaven at that point!). I recommend this amazing place and can`t wait to return for more heavenly goodness!!
