This place is great.  The food actually smells like; wait for it, food.  I had some strawberries here on the middle of June that took me back to childhood.  Red, blood red inside that green plastic basket with plastic sheet over the top being held down by a rubber band.  They were delicious.  AND they actually had juice in them.  Not the creepy Driscoll brand that is sweet with no juice.  

On an econimic note, he's usually 5 to 15% less expensive than the chain supermarkets.  He buys locally and organically when he can, and he's a good guy.  His name is Frank I believe.  If you don't remember what real food looks/smells/tastes like, come here.  It'll be neat.
