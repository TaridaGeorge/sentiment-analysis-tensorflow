So my boyfriend had been talking about this place and finally took me, and I was a bit iffy because I am quite picky about any asian food, for I've had some bad experiences...
I did have pho from another Vietnamese restaurant and it was ok, pretty much flavorless, but I tried it from here and I totally fell in love. I'd be the happiest if I could eat here everyday...
They also have the best egg rolls i've ever had in my life..
not to mention the customer service is great!

This is the cleanest and just yummiest(if that was a word) Pho place ever.
