Ray's is the closest you're going to get to real NYC slices in PHX. I lived in NYC for 10 years and got addicted to large, foldable, just-sloppy-enough slices. Though I usually neglected the Ray's chains of questionable origin and quality in Manhattan in favor of other joints I liked better, finding Ray's in North Phoenix was an epiphany. If you're a New Yorker looking for a taste of home Ray's in North Phx will take you there.
