I've been wanting to try Wildflower Bread Company for awhile now, but since there's not one near my house, it's just never happened. But, I'm impressed - it's delicious! 

You walk up to the counter and place your order... sandwiches, soups, and pastries. I had a half sandwich and soup and it was great. The cheddar broccoli soup and big chunks of broccoli in it... a welcome change from many other chains' soups. 

The employees were exceptionally cheerful and quick to get customers' orders together. My only complaint is there there isn't one closer to my house!
