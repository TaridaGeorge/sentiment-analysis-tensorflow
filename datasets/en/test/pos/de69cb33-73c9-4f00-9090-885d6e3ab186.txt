I had initially checked this place out a couple of months ago.  Once again we found ourselves needing some quick, delicious breakfast and decided to try this place out again.  As before it was absolutely delicious.  The one thing that surprised me this time around however was the little play area toward the back of the restaurant.  This is very impressive to me as it gave us some much needed peace prior to getting our food.  Thank you Bertha's Cafe for not only being so accommodating, but also for having such wonderful food.
