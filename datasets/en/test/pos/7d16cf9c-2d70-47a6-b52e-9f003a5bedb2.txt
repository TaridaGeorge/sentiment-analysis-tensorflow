Always my 'go to' wine bar to hang with my girls.. :-) AND I am in love with the Sangria Sundays there.. We go early to secure our choice table.. under a mister.. in the patio section of where WE want to be.. looking swag! Gettin our Sangria on.. and our bruschetta.. We know the whole thing by heart.. NOW the last time we were there.. We did send a salad back.. NO question from the cutie serving it. He took it.. and said he was sorry.. brought a little extra bruschetta.. and BAM. NOW looka there.. I kept the 5star on the yelp! Actually, it would be hard for Postino to lose that with me, because I have been coming here since I moved to the PHX and no other wine bar compares. I heart all things Postino.. 

MY only wish.. Sangrias all week!
