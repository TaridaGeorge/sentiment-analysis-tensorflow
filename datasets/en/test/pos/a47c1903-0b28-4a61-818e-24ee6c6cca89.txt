I regularly visit the North Scottsdale/Airpark area for business.  I've always stopped at the Starbucks down the street. Never again, Jolta Java is everything a coffee house should be.  Awesome interior design, seriously good coffee (I drink premium coffee all over the country/world, I'm picky) and awesome service.  The breakfast/lunch menus are great (I tried egg bagel sandwich, excellent).

I'll never go to another No. Scottsdale coffee spot if I have a choice.
