This was my favorite breakfast place in Phoenix.  Often when I have breakfast out I end up feeling over sated and a little greasy: from the eggs and potatoes or the extra rich pancakes.  I didn't feel that way at all after eating at Scramble.  I had an excellent veggie scramble  with good sourdough toast.  The coffee was a strong, dark roast that I enjoyed, though a little too strong for me to love it.  There's free WiFi and a cheerful atmosphere.  It's casual dining (order at the counter, food brought to your table).  I wish there was a Scramble close to my home in California.  If there were, I'd go there often.
