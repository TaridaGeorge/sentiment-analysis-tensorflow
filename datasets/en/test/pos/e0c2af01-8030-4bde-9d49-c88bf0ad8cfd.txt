Many thanks to Liz and the team at Party People for their help through this process.  I live in San Diego and have been planning a party here in Phoenix.  I picked up the rental items today and am so happy with the superior customer service and products.  This shop is by far the best party rental shop I have ever dealt with and would recommend them to anyone in the area.  And oh boy, the store is full of wonderful party supplies.  Even fun just to walk through for party ideas.
