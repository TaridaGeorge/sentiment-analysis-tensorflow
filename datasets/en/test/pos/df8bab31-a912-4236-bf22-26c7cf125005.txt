The only negative that can be said about this place is that the seating area is small.  If you can't find a seat inside there is some seating outside but in the summer time it might be a little hot.  

Other then that its the best pizza by the slice place I've had in Phoenix.  The service is always fast and friendly, and the taste is the best.  One time I even tried their take and bake option and that was better then anything I've ever made myself.  Never tried anything but the pizza, but I'm guessing its good as well.  No need to try anything besides the pizza though since its the best in town.
