The decor encourages groups to mingle.  They can reserve part of the room for your happy hour.  Great selection of drinks, and good happy hour prices.  The management is very friendly and accomidating.  The decor is modern and comfortable.  Overall, a great place to meet hip 20 to 40 somethings after work.  My only wish?  I wish they'd coordinate to have one of the tasty food carts rolling around Phoenix to set up shop in the extra parking across the street-yum!
