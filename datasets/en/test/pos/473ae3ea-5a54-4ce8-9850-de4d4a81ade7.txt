Just say NO to Tammy Coe... 

Ok.. I thought that Tammy Coe had good cupcakes... That has all changed now....Today I'm driving along Scottsdale Road and out the corner of my eye... I see the word... "CUPCAKE"... a U turn later I've got a red velvet cupcake in my mouth.. Sorry Tammy... Sprinkles cupcakes blow yours away... These are unlike any cupcake I ever had... as if the cake was baked by the Hindu Goddess Annapurna and the icing was made from unicorn tears. 

As one would imagine, its pricey to have a goddess create food that could inspire a symphony... (4 for 14.00)... but in the grand scheme of things... its a small price to pay to eat food baked with the spirit of holiness! 

Kids... start saving your pennies... they are worth every cent!
