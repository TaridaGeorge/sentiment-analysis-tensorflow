If you haven't been here recently, they've expanded the dining space significantly, creating more of a dining experience (though I prefer to sit at the bar).

The food is consistently terrific--i've never been disappointed. I tried the oven chips for the first time and I'll be ordering those again. They have a good beer selection. The desserts are tasty and unique. 

For first time visitors, I'd recommend The Oggie and a pint of the Hazelnut Brown from Oregon. Try the oven chips, or save room for dessert and order the Shirley Temple pudding. Fantastic!
