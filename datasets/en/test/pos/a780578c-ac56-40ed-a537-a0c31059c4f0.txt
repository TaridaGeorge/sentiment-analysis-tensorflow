I referred Palmer's to my close friend who was in a pinch and needed a water heater so he can shower!  I met the owner TJ at a networking event earlier this month and having contractor contacts for referrals has been great for me.  He took great care of my friend and had his water heater replaced right away.  They also are contractors that can remodel your home but I like that they will even do smaller jobs so you have one contact for all your contractor needs.  Since the customer service was so great for my friend I have decided to hire them to install a gas line at my home so I can purchase a gas stove instead of using my electric....keep an eye out on my next review to see how that turns out.
