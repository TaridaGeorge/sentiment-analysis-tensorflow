The East Valley gets a bad rap sometimes, but tucked away in a quiet little strip mall is one of my favorite gift spots in the Valley. Mesa's Elaine Todd is a boutique made for gifters! Nothing they sell is ordinary, so you're bound to get something unique and fun. From books and decorations to little trinkets, Elaine Todd is the best place in Mesa for escaping the everyday with a little creativity and whimsy in each item!
