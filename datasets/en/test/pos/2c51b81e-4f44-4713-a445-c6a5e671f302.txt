I like this Jamba Juice. It's the closest to my work (although still 4 miles away). The employees are always friendly and know how to interpret my order of "blueberry, pomegranate something or another, you know?". It is always prepared quickly as well and I'm in and out in a snap! My friend didn't like it too much when I got him one but then again he lives off of energy drinks so his taste buds are probably no longer attuned to the flavor of "healthy".
