This place is incredible.  Really great service, delicious food and drinks, and the manager even came by to thank us for coming in.  The fries were amazing, the chicken and waffles was amazing, the beers were amazing, the pretzels were amazing ... the only thing that wasn't so amazing was the check at the end of the night, but I'd say it was worth every penny.
