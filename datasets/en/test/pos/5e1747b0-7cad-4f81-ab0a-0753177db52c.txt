I bring my daughters to this library at least twice a week.  My kids love it there.

The facility is always clean and organized.  They have even gone through a recent remodel.  The place looks wide open now.  It doesn't look like a typical library.

The librarians have always treated us nicely.  There's even a guy there that tells us a joke every time we visit.  That dude is awesome!

Sunset Library is everything a library should be.
