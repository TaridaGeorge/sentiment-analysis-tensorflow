I travel extensively and Yelp is my savior. I followed the reviews and they were correct about Wally's. The food is above average and the service is great. I visited Wally's twice in one day...lunch and dinner (UPDATE - 3 times in 2 days NEW UPDATE - 4 times in 3 days).  If you're a guest at the Hyatt, it's a great alternative to the Lobby Bar. I brought a weeks worth of workout clothing with good intentions, but WALLY'S HAPPENED! Every visit was on point. The staff has great attention to detail and they are personable. Ignore the one-time visitors poor reviews. They had a bad day, and their review DEFINITELY does not reflect the quality of Wally's.
