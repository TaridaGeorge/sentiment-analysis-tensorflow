I called Macias Landscaping because I got a letter from the town of Tempe saying they were going to fine me because of my palm trees being overgrown. They were able to come out the day after I called them and was even able to come particularly early because of my work schedule. The palm trees look great and I really appreciated the quick response and fast service. I would definitely recommend Macias to anyone needing their palms trimmed.
