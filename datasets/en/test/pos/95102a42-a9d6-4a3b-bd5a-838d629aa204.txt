Costco is a magical place. You can prepare for armagedan, buy a hotdog, or get a case of red vines, all in one place. Some sad uninformed people think Costco and Sam's Club are the same, but for the initiated, we know that is like saying Disneyland, and the State Fair are the same. Yikes.

You really cannot go wrong with Costco. I love buying everything here, because their customer service is so strong. If something goes wrong with a product, you simply return it. Done. Have you tried that at BestBuy? Holy shit, it's easier to escape Alcatraz then deal with those blue shirted nimrods.

Costco also has some cool online exclusives, where you can buy patio furnature, food, you name it. Check it out, and enjoy.
