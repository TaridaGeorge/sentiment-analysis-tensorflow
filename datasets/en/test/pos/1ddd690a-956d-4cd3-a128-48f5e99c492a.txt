I don't know what to say.......I have only been here for lunch and I can't stop thinking about it!  I have passed this Cafe numerous times over the years and never thought to stop in.  I'm glad I did!  The staff is amazing and the food is 5 star!!  What also makes this place great is the price.  You get SOOOO much food for a steal.

I hear the happy hour is great too, hope to try it in the very near future!
