I had the berry salad with candied pecans, brie, and prickly pear dressing. My husband had stuffed peppers and frybread and turned it into a taco by sticking the peppers into the frybread and folding it in half. The food was amazing. We both had iced tea, which had a fruity flavor to it. I think I would try the prickly pear lemonade next time. My husband says that the frybread and stuffed peppers were very good. My salad was excellent. Prices were museum prices, a little more than what you would pay somewhere else, but the flavor is so fabulous, it's worth it.
