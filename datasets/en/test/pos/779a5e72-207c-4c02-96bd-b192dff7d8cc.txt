I can't believe I waited this long to write a review. I have been to the Cornish a dozen times and love it more with each experience. You can go for just a beer, car bomb, or their tasty pasty. A a cold Rogue and switch it up between the Greek (w/chicken) or the Carne Adovada. 

Trust me once you have it you will always crave it. I went to Germany for 7 months and all my friends would tell me I just had or about to have a pasty. Well this is the one place I missed from home. 

Thanks for having multiple locations! Maybe one is Scottsdale is to come?!! 

PS their staff rocks!
