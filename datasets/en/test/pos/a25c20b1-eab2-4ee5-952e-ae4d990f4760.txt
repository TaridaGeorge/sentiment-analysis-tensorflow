Dude...a happy hour that is TRULY happy!!!  

This joint is relatively swank for all the deals it has.  Nice decor, good bar, FRESH seafood (seriously...this is some good quality).  Starting at 4:00 p.m., they have $5 martinis AND $0.75 oysters.  YUM!

On top of that, they offer discounts on other appetizers such as the bread and cheese plate, a GIANT crab cake, a salads, and shrimp dishes.  All are tasty.

For all the Zoners out there (yeah, I said it), you have to check out this place.  You will have a great time! 

NOTE - beware of dirty old men.  They'll hit on your friends!
