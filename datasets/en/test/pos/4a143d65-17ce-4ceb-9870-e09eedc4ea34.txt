I was at yogurtology and found out that they have "doggie yogurt" there  from time to time.  What fun was it to walk up last night to watch a couple of ladies feeding their dogs out of small cups at a table on the walkway out front.  Did it seem out of place, not at all.  Another thing I like about this store and this center.

Call about the "doggie yogurt" if you want some.  They don't always have it.
