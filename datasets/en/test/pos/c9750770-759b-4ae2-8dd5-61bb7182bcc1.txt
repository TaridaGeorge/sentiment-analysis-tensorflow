Stayed here for the RocknRoll marathon like 80% of the guests and absolutely enjoyed my stay.

the hallways to the rooms were the only slightly blah decor, all other things such as the bedrooms, bathroom, lobby, restaurant and pools were great!

Amenities included:
1. pet fish (that someone else fed)
2. complimentary granola for the race day
3. smores for our firepit (next to the pool)
4. nice wait-staff that was pleasant and chatted us up
5. super fast towel replenishment service (4 girls use up a lot of towels)
6. great cabanas -we never had a problem snagging one or two of them
7. happy hour, decent food, delicious alcohol...
8. cool lobby area with lots of places to looooounge at
9. dog friendly
10. heated pools

love it!  I will stay here again for sure..
