My wife and I ate at this place while visiting family. We saw it had great reviews and the locals liked it too so we tried it. It was definitely worth all the hype. It was delicious and seemed authentic since it was owned and run by a Polish family. When you ask customers there what's good, they say everything so it's sure to be great and it was!!! We tried the "My Big Fat Polish Sausage Sandwich" and one of their soup of the days which had spinach, carrots, and potatoes with a hard boiled egg. It was delicious.
