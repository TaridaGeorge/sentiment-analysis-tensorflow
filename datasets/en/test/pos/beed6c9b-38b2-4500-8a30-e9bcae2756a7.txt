We've been to Grassroots several times (both with and without kids) and LOVE IT!  Chris does a great job making each guest feel special and right at home.  We've enjoyed "Dad's grocery bag" (the cheese/meat platter), the smoked salmon is perfection, the ribs fall off the bone, the short rib is decadent.  I loved my grapefruit martini.  

There are 2 must trys!  1- the loaded baked potato (after 5 only) and 2- the simple and delicious banana split with yummy sugared nuts.  We almost always share one.  

Overall I really hope this little brew/wine house continues its success because it is seriously yummy and a great addition to our neighborhood eats.
