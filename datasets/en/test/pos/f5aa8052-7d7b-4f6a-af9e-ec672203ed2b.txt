By far, our favorite gem of a restaurant in central Phoenix!  My wife and I are able to share the BELT sandwich.  Portion sizes are more than generous here. 

Great menu, fun environment and fun servers who clearly are there because they want to be.  Compare to some restaurants where it feels like the service is being performed by slaves.  : )

Postinos, YOU ROCK!  Keep it up!!
