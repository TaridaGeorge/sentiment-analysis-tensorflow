One of the first sushi spots in that area and it should be the first on your list when you're craving some Japaness goodness.

We had the soft crab roll, volcano, icsh roll, and some white tail and octopus sashimi... BUT...WE WANTED MORE! Ugh unfortunately, my stupid tummy didn't have room for more, but there's always next time!
