My wife and my kids have all taken lessons for salsa, hip hop, and jazz from Regina.. They are some of the most friendly peeps I have had the pleasure of working with. They have a genuine passion for dance, great staff, attentive, and have enjoyment of dance as a first priority, If you are shopping for dance for your kids.. I highly reccomend EDC
