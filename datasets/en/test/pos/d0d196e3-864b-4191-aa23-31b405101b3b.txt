Best Jewish Deli in Scottsdale!  Wonderful family-owned restaurant.  They have great dinners available, in addition to a HUGE menu.  They're also great with special orders.  I like the hot dog, "charred" (aka: grilled).  They even do grilled onions at no extra charge.  They have a TON of meat in their sandwiches without it being too much meat.  Good coleslaw, great fries.  Dessert selection is good.  They even make breakfast.  its like a small version of Scott's Generations in Phoenix (which is great), but it's owned and run by the sweetest brother and sister team you could ever meet.
