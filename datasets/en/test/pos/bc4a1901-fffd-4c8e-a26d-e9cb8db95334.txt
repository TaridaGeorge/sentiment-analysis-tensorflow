I am a regular here. Great consistent food and wonderful friendly service. Incredible New Mexico style cuisine in the heart of Arizona. I have tried pretty much every dish on the menu at least once. My favorite would be the Green Chile Carne Adovada. I also highly recommend the Smoked Pork Tamale! Some of the best salsa I have had anywhere. Bold, smoked, fire roasted flavor. The Posole' is also insanely good. In my eyes this place can do no wrong. Yes, I have tried Los Dos Molinos, (which I feel is really good and different) yet if I had to recommend one I still feel this place does New Mexico cuisine much better. Go here now!
