The food, the ambiance, the service, it was all amazing.  I think everything was awesome because I was with awesome people.  The view outside is also gorgeous.  

We were here during restaurant week and had their 3 course meal.  I got the duck ravioli, the filet minon, and the creme brule for dessert.  I sampled their lobster bisque and I wish I had gotten that instead of the duck ravioli.  My filet minon was cooked well done because I am currently pregnant and it was still surprisingly tender.  The creme brule was delightful as well.
