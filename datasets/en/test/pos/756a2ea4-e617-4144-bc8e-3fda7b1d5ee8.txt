Coming from the Midwest, I'd never really experienced the desert until we hiked the short waterfall trail here. It's amazing just how large the cacti are. We visited the park after a Royals spring training game in Surprise on the recommendation of the Royals website and a friend who lives in the area. I'm really glad we made the short drive over to the park.

Maricopa County should be proud of the way this park is being run. The gate attendant was very friendly and the park was very clean.

The waterfall trail was a pretty simple hike of .9 miles out and back. While it doesn't sound like there is a waterfall except after heavy rains, the trail was still nice with plenty of scenery. The air force jets that flew over while we were there also added to our enjoyment.

Overall, we really enjoyed hiking here.
