Awesome staff. Sat at the counter and watched tons of great looking food go by. I went for the "Lil ol Country Girl" which is an egg, bacon, sausage, and biscuit and gravy. The kitchen claims proudly "I come from a family where gravy is considered a beverage." And they delivered the best gravy I've ever passed by my lips. We will definitely be back.
