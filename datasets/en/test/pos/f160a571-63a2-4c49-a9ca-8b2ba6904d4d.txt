I was so blown away by my recent meal here and could safely say it was the best Korean BBQ I've had. We came using a Buy With Me certificate and ordered a combo that had three kinds of meats (spicy pork, beef, and chicken) for $30. That and an order of gyoza easily fed three of us and could have fed four people. The atmosphere was very comfortable with friendly service. I kept groaning in pleasure every time I ate the spicy pork. I even resorted to pulling burnt bits off the grill plan with my chopsticks, it was so good. At the end, we tried the coconut boba frappe which was delicious. I never had boba before and the coconut one was just right. Do yourself a favor and try this little spot!
