It's been about a year since I visited here, but I have a bone to pick with them. 

Ever since I tried their Hot Night sushi on a trip out here to visit with friends, I have been addicted to fusion sushi.  I've been out here in Philadelphia trying like crazy to find a roll that tops it.  It's been over a year, and I can't.  This place is the best and I hope to return someday.  Great service too.
