Just a quick update... Bertha's was unable to renew their lease and will be shut down for a month or two while they move to a new location. I think they are supposed to relocate by the end of June somewhere near Indian School and 32nd St, so just make sure to call before "popping in" (I heard a new cafe may be going in at Bertha's current location).
