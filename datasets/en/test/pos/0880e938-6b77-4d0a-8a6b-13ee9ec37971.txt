I love Blue 32!  It is a great place to watch any game!  The Nachos are to DIE for!  I have also had some type of buffalo wing pizza.  I have only been there after 10pm when so i do not know how there full menu is but for a late night snack and some beers.  Plus they have Guinness on tap!! ENOUGH SAID!!  ;)
