Great ice cream, super cute store, extremely CLEAN! The ice cream is good, service is always great, and the location is fun (although a little out of the way). The prices are reasonable. I would rather support a locally owned business and pay more than McDonald's prices and less than Cold Stone prices. If you haven't been, and plan on visiting in the Summer, bring suits for the kids. There is a nice little splash area right next to a big playground. Karen's Kreamery is located in a big park/sports facility. There is also a medium sized skate park. We usually make it a fun outing out it. My family loves this place!! Support local businesses!!!
