This is by far the best coffee place ever for a couple reasons: 1) they roast their own coffee beans, 2) they play the best music, 3) it is very trendy and appreciate that,   3) the coffee is very good!, and 4) they have free WIFI.  I highly recommend this place. If you come here, you will never want to go to a Starbucks again.
