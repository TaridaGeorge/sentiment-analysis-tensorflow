Ah see, Yelp works - I thought this was a Mexican grocery until I ran across these reviews... Paldo - doesn't that sound Spanish, anyway maybe not....

Went over to investigate the 'food corner' -  all the slots were occupied when I arrived, so, while keeping an eye out for an open seat, I  had to spend a few minutes appearing very intrigued by two jars labeled in Korean... 

Glad I waited; bit of kimchi, bit of little salty fish for small plates (banchan) along with the spicy pork  - deep flavor and generous serving - left very content...
