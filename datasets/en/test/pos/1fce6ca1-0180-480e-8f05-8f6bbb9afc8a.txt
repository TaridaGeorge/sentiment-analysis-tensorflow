Darn this place.  I wasn't a big fan at first.  Their drinks are good but they serve iced drinks in paper cups, which I find annoying.  But the kid likes their smoothies and the fact that they give her a lollipop and a whipped cream dollop on her straw.  So we go.  THEN ONE DAY.... wait for it.......... we order the Green Apple Smoothie.  Wow.  Wow.  Green Apple, Caramel and, if you really want to go over the top, whipped cream.  Now, all of their smoothies are super sweet treats.  But the Green Apple thing is different and wonderful.
