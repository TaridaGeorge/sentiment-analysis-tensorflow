Authentic.  This place is authentic.  They do what they do really well, and their customer base knows it and appreciates it.  Come here for an enormous selection of handcrafted rootbeers, creme sodas, and more.  Pair those with traditional American lunch items like burgers, dogs, fries, rings, etc.  Simple enough.  Good tasting, reasonably priced.

Tucked behind a Church's fried chicken.  Service was friendly.  Too bad cheese curds were termporarily out of stock!
