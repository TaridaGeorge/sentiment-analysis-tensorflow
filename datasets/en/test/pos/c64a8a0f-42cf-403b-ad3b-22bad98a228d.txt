My wife and I have been going here for a couple of years. It is always a pleasant outing. The food is always good and the service is great. We almost always get one of their sandwiches which comes with chips and a pickle. Their tomato soup is maybe the best I have ever had. Only had it once as it is available on certain days. If you luck out when it is on the menu by all means get a bowl. Highly recommended.
