What a great experience we had on our FIRST time here.  The service and food were outstanding!  Could not be happier.

My husband gets his hair cut next door, at V's, so I met him there for Happy Hour and sat outside.  We were seated immediately.  Our server was very cheery and helpful.  The place is very clean.  Great Atmosphere.  
Now, if only my husband could get his hair cut EVERY WEEK, so that we can stop in at RA, life would be perfect!
