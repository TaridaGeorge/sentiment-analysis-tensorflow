NOCA stands for North Of CamelbAck, i love this place, went with a few friends.  The foods are such a delight, Chris the Chef actually trained years in San Francisoco before coming to the valley, their duck is crips and sweet, and to top it off, their Scallops...omg it is sweet and delicious, it melts in your mouth (not a taste of dry or fishyness).  Definitely a must.  They also have a private dinning area for small parties.  I would suggest calling for the menu before going, because their menu changes daily, it enables them to serve up the freshest dishes.
