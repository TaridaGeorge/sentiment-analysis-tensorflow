This family-owned business rocks!  The food is wonderful, prices are AMAZING and they blow the doors of any burger joint in the state.  

Everyone knows Lucky Boy still rocks...a Phoenix classic that's still around not because it's trendy and swank...it's because they serve quality day after day (and work their butts off doing it).

I recommend the Lucky Boy original...comes with fries for like $3.99.

And, if you happen to see sketchy people around, do the whole neighborhood a favor and call phoenix pd non-emergency number (602-426-1231).  

Anytime I mention where I live to anyone who's lived in Phoenix 30-50 years or so, they always say "oh, that's near Lucky Boys.  Damn good burgers."
