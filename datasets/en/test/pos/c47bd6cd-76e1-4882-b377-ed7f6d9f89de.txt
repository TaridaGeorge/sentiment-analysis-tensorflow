I've been going here regularly for about 12 years.  Always amazed me that YC's was able to stay open when everything else around them was closed for several years.  The great food is what kept people coming back.  It seems like the prices have gone up and at the same time the bowls have gotten smaller, but you can still pack as much as you want into the bowl and still not be able to eat all of it.
