Going to Chase or BOB, as it is in all of our hearts, is always a fun time even if the DBacks aren't as good as they used to be. Sorry, just my opinion! Chase is pretty awesome stadium. There is the retractable roof, swimming pool, TGIF's, and tons of awesome places to grab a bite to eat. The stadium has a really nice open feel, and there aren't to many awful seats. There are also a lot of fun areas to hang out besides your seats and the downtown area outside the stadium is really nice as well. We definitely get to enjoy the benefits of this newer stadium so go check it out!
