What more can I say about how damn delicious Angel Sweet is that hasn't already been said - the ratings speak for themselves, along with the Best Of's hanging on their walls.  Finally made it there after a friend had been raving about the place and have been a regular since.  

You just have to try as many flavors as you can and mix/match, too many to name.  A recent favorite of mine was peppermint & dark dark chocolate, mmmm..  I've introduced several other people to AS and we're all big fans now.  The daytime dude is friendly and helpful.  Smooth & silky, best gelato I've had...well...ever!
