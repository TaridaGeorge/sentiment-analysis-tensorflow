Shauna is incredibly supportive and encouraging. She has such a bright and shining personality you want to do your best for, because she is always gives you her best. She is also incredibly committed to making sure that you are getting the most out of your experience, and will be there for you to learn from, seek advice from at any time. She is one of the most well rounded trainers with all her knowledge about diet and nutrition, massage therapy and exercise. I would recommend her to anyone that wants to get in shape, have a great time, and feel extraordinarily cared for.
