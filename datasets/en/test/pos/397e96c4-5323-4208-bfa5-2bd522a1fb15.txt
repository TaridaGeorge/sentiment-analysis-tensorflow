Ambiance is amazing....very Zen, without being too Zen-y.  The massage rooms are bliss, iPods with playlists to be chosen by the client, something gorgeous to look at (flowers on the floor) and scented (or un-scented) oils that are so beautifully fragrant.  The staff is exceptionally kind.  Lockers area is complete - could leave for office right after a treatment.  Good for solo spa-goer....areas set up for solitude and the atmosphere encourages quiet.  Divine.
