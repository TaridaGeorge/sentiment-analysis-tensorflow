Film Bar is awesome!!!!!!!! They show a wide variety of movies ranging from classic films to new independent movies. I've heard from several friends of wonderful documentaries that they have shown there. They also show some cult classics. If you get a punch card, after you see 4 movies the 5th is free! If you go on Monday the films are discounted. They also have a glorious happy hour as well, and don't forget to ask them about their film bar fly program. 
It's cozy and comfy (both in the lounge and in the theater), with a nice Moraccan feel. My friend brought me on a Saturday night and it was pumping. On Saturday they host a world music night. The creation of legendary local deejay, DJentrification. You definitely need to check this place out.
