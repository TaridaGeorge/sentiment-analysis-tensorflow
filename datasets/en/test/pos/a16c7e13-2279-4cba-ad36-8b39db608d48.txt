Happy hour! Happy hour! Happy hour!  Maybe I'm bias because I live within walking distance of Hula's but it's definitely one of my favorite Phoenix spots.  The happy hour specials here are great and the drinks are creative.  The service is always good and so is the atmosphere.  Whether hot or cold, outdoor seating is always perfect with heaters and a fire pit.  The weekend brunch is also great.  I loved the french toast.  Short of five stars only because the fish cakes seem to be hit or miss.  The first time I tried them, I fell in love.  However, each time since then they have tasted different.  New chef or recipe?
