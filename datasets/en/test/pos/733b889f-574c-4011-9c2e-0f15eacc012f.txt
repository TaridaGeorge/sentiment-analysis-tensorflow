This place is AMAZING!  I always take my family and friends here when they visit.  The shaved ice is really soft and fluffy and is even better with cream.  There are somewhere around 50 flavors to try, so you won't ever get bored.  They have a drive thru that's open pretty late so you can come here for a midnight snack whenever you want.  The staff is friendly and courteous and they all seem to be happy to work there.
