Imagine a small grocery store.

Now split the grocery store in half...
- Remove groceries from one half so that you have an empty half.
- Add tables and chairs to the empty half.

Essentially, you now have 1/2 a grocery store and 1/2 a restaurant -- which is what Haji-Baba is.

From the restaurant, I recommend shawarma plate, gyros, and any of the kabobs.

The food is cooked fresh, noticeably healthy, in large portion, and is remarkably low-priced.

Following your meal, I suggest you purchase an almond Baklava from the market. The almond Baklava (especially when heated for about 15 seconds in the microwave) is fantastic!

Also, the staff has always been great.

Meals are generally less than $10.

Fantastic value! Please, do not change a thing!
