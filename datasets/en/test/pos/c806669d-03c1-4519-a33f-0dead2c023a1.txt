I had lunch here with a large group of friends on their patio on a weekday around noon.  I am pretty sure we just beat the rush since it started to fill up quickly.  We were lucky we got a good spot.  Their patio dining is very comfortable with cuushioned wicker couches if you enjoy that type of seating.  They have a very modern look.  The inside of the restaurant is very beautiful also with vaulted ceilings and a feeling of openess to their modern look.

The sushi was delicious and fresh tasting.  I recommend trying one of their rolls wrapped in cucumber with raw fish-very refreshing.

I will definitely be going back here and I would like to try their other locations in the east valley as well.
