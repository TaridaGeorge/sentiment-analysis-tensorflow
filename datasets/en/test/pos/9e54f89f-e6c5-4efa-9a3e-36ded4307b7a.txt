Man, I love this place. 

I usually end up with #23, I don't know how to say it in Vietnamese, but it's damn good. My wife usually gets a #22, which is apparently a very, very, authentic dish. I am told you can only get it in certain areas of Vietnam, it is also delicious. 

Spring rolls, best anywhere, I have yet to find a better spring roll from the 20-or-so other Pho places I've been to.

#47 for those of you who like Steak and rice dishes.
