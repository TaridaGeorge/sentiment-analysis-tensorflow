OMG!  Yummy stuff! Best 
Froyo I have had in years!  Brand new, clean and fun! The creaminess of this frozen yogurt really caught me off guard!  I planned to just sit and wait while my daughter and hubs ate.  Gotta tell ya, that lasted all of one bite!  I was hooked!  This little spot is, well, spotless!  You could probably eat off the floor it's so nice looking.

The people were very nice, everything was easy and at 39 cents an ounce, it's not a bad deal either!  Will be back for sure!
