I guess I have to review Defalco's Italian Grocery now that Brian S has posted a pic of me loving up on a package of polenta...

Brian and I rolled across the street from D'Lish and grabbed a few things at Defalco's.  I had a half steak sandwich (a grinder if you've lived north of New Haven, CT) and I'm fairly certain it was the best steak sandwich I've had since moving to Phoenix.

Defalco's is the kind of place I really miss from the Boston area.  Down to earth guys, a variety of good Italian deli meats, salads, cheeses, a nice selection of Italian grocery items, and great sandwiches.

If only it were closer to my house I would probably be here at least once a week.
