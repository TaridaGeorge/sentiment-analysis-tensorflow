Let me put it to you this way: Subway is next door. Spend maybe 4 or 5 more bucks at Scratch, wait 15 more minutes, and you have freshly prepared, healthy, well-thought entree's, sandwiches, salads, etc... Depending on your taste and how quickly you need to leave, the choice is clear in my world (no offense to Subway).

For the price, location and especially, the food, it's a great little-tucked away-secret. If you have ever used your name and the word "foodie" in the same sentence and don't  make an effort to stop by, you may be missing out.

This is really a quaint little lunch place or even dinner but remember you're there for the food. Service is not over the top, nor bad either. Sit back, relax, and enjoy. I did.
