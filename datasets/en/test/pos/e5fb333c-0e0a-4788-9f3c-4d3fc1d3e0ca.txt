This place was a lot of fun - relaxed atmosphere, great food, and great wine.  We ordered the wine of the month for March, which was a Neprica, and immediately afterward had to look up where we could buy it back home.

I had the meat rustico, which I would definitely order again.  This was one of my favorite meals while we were visiting Scottsdale.
