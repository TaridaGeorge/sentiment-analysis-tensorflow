This is my favorite place to see live theater and comedy. I end up here pretty much every weekend. Things I love about Space 55:

- Great location. I love fun things to do that are downtown and in walking distance from bars, nightlife, my house...etc.

- They have a really unique variety of entertainment. Some of it is pretty random but it is almost always very good. Even when it's bad it's good.

- Unpretentious theater is awesome

- Improv comedy every Friday night. The Galapagos show at 10:30 PM is always awesome

- The Phoenix Neutrino Project rocks. Come see it. (Full disclosure - I am part of this)

- They do not kick me out when I get drunk and knock a picture frame off the wall and break it (although I didn't touch it I swear!)
