I recently had a problem with a small amount of smoke coming out from under my hood. I needed my car fixed fast and after talking to a few people I took my car to Tempe Auto Repair. 

They were unable to fix my problem, but they were honest about it and gave me a suggestion on where to go. They didn't charge me a dime for the work they did trying to fix the issues, plus i wound up with a free oil change. 

So while they didn't fix my car, they will definitely be high on my list of people to bring it to next time there is a problem.
