Great CPA! I just moved from California to Arizona, bought a home here,  and had to report my interest on  a few investments. I met with Thomas to secure the necessary paperwork , tax tips for filing this year,  and get an estimate for services. A week later,  my taxes were done(had to wait for my 1099s to arrive), Overall,  Thomas Holly made a seamless move for me and in my case, was even a little cheaper than the estimate.
