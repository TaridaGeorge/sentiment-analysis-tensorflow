On two occasions I had to make emergency appointments for zoe, my Italian Greyhound, they always accommodated getting her in and making sure that after we went home to call and do a follow up.   Dr. McComb is very thorough with exams and presents different options for treatment.  I recommend this clinic to all my friends who have furry friends.
