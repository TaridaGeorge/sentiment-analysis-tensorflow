Freakin awesome...from the juicer to the food....it is now a weekly thing btw myself and my friend...We are addicted.....Their OJ is freshly squeezed, service awesome and the food to die for...Its worth it....Pricey but you get what you pay for.....Although their coffee could be better....but its pretty close to perfection soooooo.
