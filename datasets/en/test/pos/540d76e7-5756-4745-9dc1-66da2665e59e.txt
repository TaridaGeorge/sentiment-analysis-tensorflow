I am giving them 5 stars today (not because of the food - which was very good) but for the excellent service we received.  I was truly amazed and how friendly and helpful they were (even with out stubborn 3 yr old)

The food was excellent - 4 star worthy, not 5 star because I have had better pasta.  My wife got a salad that looked great and my kid got the macaroni and cheese (which I snuck a bite of - and it was amazing)

Good food, better service = 5 stars in my book.  Keep it up!
