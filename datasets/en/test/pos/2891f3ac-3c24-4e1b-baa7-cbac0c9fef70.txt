Stayed here after getting a terrific deal on Expedia.  Saved over 250.00 per night as the room we booked was normally over 500.00 a night.  Loved this place, probably the best resort I've stayed at in Scottsdale so far.  Our room was a terrace suite over looking the pool and Camelback Mountain.  Had two terraces on each side of the room and the views were beautiful.  This time of the year all of the citrus trees were blooming so this fragrance of lemon/orange filled the air!  If you go here during the summer months when the temperature in AZ reach well over 110 degrees you can save even more on the rooms.. This is a perfect romantic getaway destination and you won't be disappointed!
