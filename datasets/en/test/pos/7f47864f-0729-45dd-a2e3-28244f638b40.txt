My wife and I are from Lancaster, PA and one thing we missed from there was Rita's! We actually loved it some much that we tried to open one out here years ago but they were only opening chain stores on the east coast at that time!

She freaked out yesterday when we drove past your store and found out we now have one here! She then went there last night and got us both some. It as as good or better than we remembered! We look forward to being a long time customer!

Yummy!
