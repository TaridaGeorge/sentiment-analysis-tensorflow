Top notch restaurant. It was the only place open on Thanksgiving day but it turned out to be the best italiano resterant I have ever been to. Walking in the place looked like a palace. Beautifully decorated and authentic food and service. My favourite is the Rockefeller oyster, I was amazed by how fresh the seafood is.
