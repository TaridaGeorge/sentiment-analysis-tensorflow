Awesome experience here at Brunch today. This place was recommended by a friend, and lived up to all expectations. We had the eggs benedict with crab cakes and hollandaise; and the el matador- wow! The food was exceptionally good. I really liked the decor inside too- especially the cassette tapes on the wall leading to the lavatories. No negatives here!
