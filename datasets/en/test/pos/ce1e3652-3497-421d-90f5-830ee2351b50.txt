Okay, I know I wrote a review about my trip to Italy and how I compared the pizza.  Well, now its time to compare the Italian dessert.

Again, my wife and I were in Italy for our honeymoon and had lots of Gelato!  Of course, the Gelato in Italy is just superb, and best of all it is abundant and inexpensive.  The smallest size will cost you $1 Euro, or $1.35 US, but as far as taste and texture, Angel Sweet's Gelato definitely compares.

It is the best Gelato your going to get, even better than other shops in town.  When you can compare the taste and texture to its Italian counterpart, that is really telling you something.  Go see for yourself, and if you've never experienced Gelato before than your in for a treat!

I recommend the hazelnut, and Panna Cotta!
