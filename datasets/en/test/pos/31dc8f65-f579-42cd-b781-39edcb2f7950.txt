This organic feast is enough to tempt the senses.  Eugenia serves up some tasty treats good for the mind, body and soul.  The wonderful atmosphere along with the great location are a plus.  I would definitely recommend her homemade soups and the Greek platter.  Her spanakopita is some of the best I have ever had.  It is a not cheap, but very very worth it.  If you are looking for quality this is your place!  Also check out her freshly baked pastries and sweets.  They are out of this world.  Great place for a healthy business lunch or a first date!
