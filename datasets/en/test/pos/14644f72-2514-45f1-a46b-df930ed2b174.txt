We have eaten here only for lunches on Fridays or Saturdays, and the food is great. 
The newly remodeled Buffet is better than before. More food offerings including a grill.
I have yet to come across anything among the plentyful variety  that was not well prepared and served at the proper temperature. 
The staff is cheerful and helpful. 
Easily worth the 40 minute drive from Chandler. 
Prices are discounted if you have a casino players club card which is free.
