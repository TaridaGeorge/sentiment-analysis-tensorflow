Dear Clarendon,

Where have you been all my life? I miss you already and here's why:

the sheets-what is the thread count...1000?
the big flat screen TV that provided me with plenty of mind rotting TV to watch while i lounged in my GIANT comfortably bed
your roof... oh baby, your roof is to die for. i've traveled the world and nothing beats the AZ desert sunset!!
and finally, the beautiful friendly people who you employ. seriously, is a qualification that you have to be a charming doll to work here or what? analisa is adorable and had me laughing my face off...LOVED her! 

my only complaint is i can't spend more time here... my visits to PHX are few & far between. 

love loves
