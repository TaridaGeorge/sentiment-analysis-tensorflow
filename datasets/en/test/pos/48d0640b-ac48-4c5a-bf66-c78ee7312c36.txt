I have been a member here for approximately 8 months now. I have not been disappointed. When I noticed some of the benches near the free weights getting worn out, they replaced them before I even complained. 

Overall I am happy here and was a former Fitness Factory member. This gym actually fixes or replaces equipment. You get what you pay for. Go and pay $20 a month and you will have broken equipment for longer period of time and more shady people working out there.

Tip: In summer, park on ground level underneath parking garage, to avoid a hot car upon returning. All other gyms, your car bakes in the sun.

Highly recommended.
