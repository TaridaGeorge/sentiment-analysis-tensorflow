I can hardly think of a better place to start a weekend than with a breakfast  at Liberty Market. Take a good friend and split an American Standard with meatballs, or just go with a "small" item on the breakfast menu (it won't be that small!) Wash it down with some OJ, a delicious mocha, or just some water. Break out the laptop if you're too busy to really relax, cuz they have free wifi! Still hungry? Pick something from their pastry case (I HIGHLY recommend their grilled, or regular, bread pudding.)
