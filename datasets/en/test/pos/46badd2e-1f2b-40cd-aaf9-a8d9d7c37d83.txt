Love. This. Place.

Like a mini-break when you walk inside - you could be anywhere in the world, not just Japan or China, but Morocco, the South Pacific, Madagascar....

Really helpful staff, they let you smell all the many, many tins of teas.  The shop is bright and gorgeous.  You can't not buy something.  They even carry proper matcha making tools which are hard to find.  They'll make a cup or a blend for you to go too.  I could use a cup of iced Blook Orange Rooibos right now!
