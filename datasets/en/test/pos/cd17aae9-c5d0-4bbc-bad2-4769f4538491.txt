Renting from Sixt was a great experience. I had never heard of Sixt until I was looking for a rental car for a few days in Phoenix. If you ever have rented a car in Phoenix you know it can be very expensive. Normally I go with National because I can choose by own car but this time I went with Sixt because they were over $120.00 cheaper for the same class of car. At first I thought that this was too good to be true but my co-worker told me that Sixt was huge in Europe and that I should be ok. He was more than right. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly and the car was almost brand new. I will make sure I rent from Sixt again whenever I travel.
