I was a little surprised I must say to see that Joes for some here got such low scores. Yes  I  guess the flies and the noise can be a bit bothersome, but for me it is all about the food and that is awesome! I absolutely love love the onion rings there. It is hard to find really good onion rings these days. I had family recently come in and we had so much food on the table I was afraid someone was going to start oinking  at us. Fried zucchinni is also probably the very best I have ever had and the fries !awesome! How do they get them so crispy? Fontina burger is AMAZing! I will definitely keep going there!
