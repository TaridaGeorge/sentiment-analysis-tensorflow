once per 'season' (yes I know phoenix doesn't have seasons, just hot and less hot, yet i love it) they have a super art walk.  There are street performers, free food, radio stations.  Most galleries have wine to sample.  Makes for a good time. Not to mention some amazing artwork.  I have been known to window shop on a somewhat crooked walk home from the bars, its even better when you get to go in!
