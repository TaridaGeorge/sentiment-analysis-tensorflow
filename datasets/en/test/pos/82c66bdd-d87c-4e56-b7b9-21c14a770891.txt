Oh Joe's Real BBQ!  I have driven from Old Town to Gilbert just to get the stuffed baker form Joe's Real BBQ -- many times.  

Next time I'm going to order something other than the pulled pork topped gigantic baked potato with butter, sour cream, loads of cheese and chives...maybe, it's just so perfectly delicious and HUGE.  

If you go at the right times there isn't a line at all, but try going right at lunch or supper time and expect to wait a while.  It'll be worth it, but it'll be a big of a line.
