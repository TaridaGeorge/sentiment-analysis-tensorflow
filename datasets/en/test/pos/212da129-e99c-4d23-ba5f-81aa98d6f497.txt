Popped in on a Saturday night to be treated to a ridiculously nice waitress and delicious Mexican food! The service was super friendly, our food came out quickly, and we ate every bite (and a couple bowls of chips - fantastic salsa, and a bit spicy).

I had an enchilada and rice and both were bomb. Again, just the right amount of spicy. The chimichangas are huge and delicious as well.

Overall, we had great service, yummy food, and didn't spend a lot. Definitely would like to try a margarita next time, though!
