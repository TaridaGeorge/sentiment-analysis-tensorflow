Went to Rokerij last night with my out of town son and daughter in law. Had been to Richardsons on a few occasions several years ago.  We were seated at a cozy corner table downstairs. Ordered from the Richardsons side of the menu. Had the ceviche as appetizer and margaritas. Were excellent. For dinner, I ordered stuffed pork chop, corn and garlic chile potatoes. Others had enchides and stuffed chicken. All agreed that the meals were great. Service was quite good, portions were large (we each took some food home) and priced were OK for the quality. All in all, a fine meal.
