I'm an RN and had lived in the Valley for 4 years, doctor-hopping due to lack of attention, concern, too busy, unavailability, etc.  Then we found Dr Lakin.  His office is in a convenient location, the staff is friendly and very professional, and they remember your name!  Almost unheard of these days.  The doc gives plenty of time to talk to you, listens to your issues, and treats you like he really cares about your health.  He is also very computer savvy and responds to his patient's questions by email if desired, which is great for my family, since we don't always have to wait for a phone call.  I would recommend Dr Lakin to anyone who likes a small, 'personal attention' type of internal medicine practice, as opposed to a 'large factory' doctors office.
