If you love all things furry, cutesy, quirky, creepy and fun this is definitely THE place.

I really wanna live in here and fulfill all of my childhood Candyland fantasies: Rendevous with a kooky rock man, be-friend the two-headed baby doll dragon, and eat multiple pieces of the multi-tiered pastel cakes and glittery mushrooms!

This is one of the most unique stores Phoenix has to offer, and of course it has the BEST location- right next to Bikini Lounge! 

Another beautiful/fantastic thing is that Beatrice Moore the "Grand Dame" is the owner/shopkeeper crafter of the joint! 

pom poms and pipe cleaners galore, you will definitely find a one of a kind super kooky kraft to cherish here or if you are in the market one of Moore's amazing paintings.

If you don't like this place, a big BOO to you. You're probably no fun, like, at all.
