Most important, Scooter Friendly! The owner used to have a Vespa back in the old country!  This is not a fancy place but clean, and the whole family works there. They are really nice. Pizza is NY / NJ style. Chicken Parm is great. Prices even better. Don't go here for white tablecloth meal. Go there for a great slice or Italian sandwich on good toasted bread. They have very very inexpensive lunch specials.
