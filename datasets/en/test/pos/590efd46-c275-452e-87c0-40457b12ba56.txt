The only thing disappointing about this place is that the amazing sandwiches are no longer available for dinner.  The pasta and pizza (especially the truffled pizza) keep me going back for dinner, though.  I like sitting on the patio on Friday night and watching all the people line up for cheap drinks at the club next door. Reverse happy hour provides a great opportunity to try some of the beers and wines offered by the glass too.

I usually skip dessert when I go out, but I love the gooey cookies made to order in a personal size skillet. Nothing beats a hot, half-baked chocolate chip cookie with a scoop of ice cream on top.

Thanks La Bocca for consistent good food, good values, and good service!
