When I saw the $20 for $10 deal at Rays I jumped on it.  Ordered the breaded chicken w/ spaghetti dinner.  My buddy ordered the sausage hero sub.  I was amazed when they told us we needed to order something else to use the entire $20 deal.  We choose the cheese garlic bread.  The food was great and the service was good. Could not have asked for more!
