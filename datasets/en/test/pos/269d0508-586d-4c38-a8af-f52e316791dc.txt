This place is a hidden gem. Have been passing it for years and finally went a couple of times and was very very pleased. It's extremely clean, the service is mom and pop very friendly, and the food is tasty. 

I've tried the hot and sour soup which is tremendous, kung pao chicken which is fantastic, crab puffs which are great, and the create your own stir fry is fun and you can make it as healthy or fattening as you want.
