I just love this place. My husband and I go to this location every friday. The staff is awsome and the food to die for. You would think as much we go there we schould know everyones names, but sorry to say I  dont. However the lady manager there is the absolute best. We enjoy every visit. Thanks for making our "date night" soooo much fun.
