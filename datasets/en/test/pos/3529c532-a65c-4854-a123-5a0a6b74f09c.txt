This is the place that took my tart fro-yo virginity, and despite my falling head over heels for it, I never wrote a review because I couldn't remember the stupid name of the place. I paid attention today.

Well, if you've been to one of these self-serve yogurt places, you've been to them all. This place is nothing incredibly delicious or horrifyingly atrocious compared to the others. I like it as it's next to my ghetto nail salon. 

Four stars under normal circumstances, but today they get the coveted fifth because they have PUMPKIN!!! And oh...em... gee... it was delicious, complex and spicy like a silky cold pumpkin pie. Throw a little graham cracker crumbs on top and you're gold.
