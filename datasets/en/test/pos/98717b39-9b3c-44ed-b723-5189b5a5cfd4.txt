after a rather disappointing meal at el hefe, we headed for dessert over at the gelato spot. always a bright spot, the smell of coffee and gelato wafting away our sadness. 

i had the p-butter and cheese cake and it was so yummy. i could just eat gelato for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. and the staff here is always so pleasant and helpful. how many buckets of free samples must they give out a day? awesome place.
