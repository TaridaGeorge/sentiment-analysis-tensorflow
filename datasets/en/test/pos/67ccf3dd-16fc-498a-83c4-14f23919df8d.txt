Enjoyed a wonderful meal here with my family and friends.  The restaurant itself is very small and is a sublet of the C-FU Gourmet it looks like.  The food was expertly served and presentation was a great as the taste and quality!  This is definitely a repeat for me!

Minor complaint: wife got the chicken teriyaki and noted it was cold.  I had the teriyaki ribs and they were served hot.  Hopefully next time we go back the chicken will be served properly: HOT.

Desert was nice too, great selection of items.  The Red Bean ice cream is amazing.

ENJOY!
