Bruce is awsome!  When I had a blue screen (yes blue:-( ) . One call & Bruce was on the case.  He backed up my memory & then he did what he needed to get me up & running again.  Nothing lost on my computer!  
I also used him to unlock my computer from a program.  He did this online from his home and I was at mine. :) 10 minutes and fixed! 
I highly recommend Computer Troubleshooters for all your computer needs.
