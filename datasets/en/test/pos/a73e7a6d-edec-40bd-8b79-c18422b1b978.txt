Our group of 4 adults went on the morning of Mar 14.  This is a spectatular display of desert garden items.  It is extremely well laid out and has items that will appeal to many tastes.  The volunteer staff are fantastic and their love of what they offer is apparent.  The entrance fees are somewhat high but you get value.  There are many places to rest, water is available throughout, toilet facilities are adequate.  There is a great gift shop.  Parking is very well managed.  We were here 20 years ago and were even more impressed this time.  No one should miss this attraction.
