Finally got to try the bread pudding  here and it was unbelievable. Not as unbelievable as Charlestons but is definitely making the list for "Best Bread puddings" (see list). 

Also tried the tuna sammich with avocado as I wanted something simple. That tomato herb bread that they use is extraordinary! The sammich was great just like everything else I have had here.
