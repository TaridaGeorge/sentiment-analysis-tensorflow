I've probably approached "pest" status with the guys at Rage due to the unending stream of questions I had while assembling a bike. Everyone at the shop was extremely helpful with mechanical questions, and were even good at giving aesthetic advice. 

Whenever I wanted to learn how to assemble/disassemble a part, they were more than willing to give me a quick tutorial.

When it came to ordering a part they were kind enough to offer multiple price/quality options and the shipping time was unusually fast.

From this point forward, no matter what type of bike I'm working on I'll be a dedicated customer.
