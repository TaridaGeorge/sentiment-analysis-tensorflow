Very friendly staff and ready to help with a smile.  They have a better quantity of things on hand and the prices are a lot better than Sports Authority. Sad thing is that they are getting rid of the bowling section and will be closing it out.  My hubby and I just started bowling together and for the price or rental of shoes it is better to buy your own and then to make sure they have your size of bowling ball is to get your own also.  Will be shopping more at Dicks for our sports needs for bikes, camping, and weights.
