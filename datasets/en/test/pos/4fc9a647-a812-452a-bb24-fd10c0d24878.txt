I received a box of brownies while recovering from a liver transplant and have been a loyal fan since. I gave them as gifts to all my nurses and will continue to buy as gifts for special occasions. All the flavors are great and don't agree with the other reviews about being dry. Can't wait to order some again!

Edited to add: I just bought a Groupon and just placed a new order. Well, stupid me messed up during the order and I approved it without the Groupon applied. I called customer service and they were GREAT! They applied my Groupon and emailed me a new invoice. THANK YOU for great brownies and great customer service!
