Cool cigar shop. Must check out. So many choices. Owner helped with selection of cigars. Husband and I went in on a Sun (yes open on Sun). Very friendly & informative. Great place to go whether you know what you like or not! Tucked back into plaza, hard to spot. Next door to nail salon, could drop the chick and hang and puff away..
