Incredibly impressed with Volvo of Tempe's service department! They reply to email and phone calls very quickly. I brought my car here after getting an insanely high estimate from another dealership in the Valley. I made an appt. on a Friday afternoon, had my car in first thing Saturday morning, and got a call it was ready within 2 hours. Unheard of with the dealership I've used in the past. BEST OF ALL...the did the needed repairs for 48% LESS than the other dealership quoted. Thanks Brian & Judd!
