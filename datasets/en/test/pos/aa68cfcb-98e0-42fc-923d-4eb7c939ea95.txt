This is the best coffee & tea shop in town. The espresso stands on its own, but you must try the honey shot. You will dream about it! 

The iced teas are great and they have a great variety, which is hard to come by these days. 

What I love is that they are always experimenting with different drinks and turning coffee & tea not into a beverage, but a liquid art.

Overall, this is a great place if you love coffee and/or tea and the  owner and barista's will make you feel at home.
