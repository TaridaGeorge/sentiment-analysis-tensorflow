While I was in Scottsdale I had a lunch meeting at Olive and Ivy.  The food was excellent as was the service and atmosphere.  I had the hummus appetizer and the salmon Cesar salad the first day.  It was so good that I came back a second time and had the wedge salad.  

If you are in the area give this place a try.  You won't be disappointed!
