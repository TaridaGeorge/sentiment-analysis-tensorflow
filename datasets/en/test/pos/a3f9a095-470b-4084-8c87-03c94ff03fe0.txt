Gorgeous end to a trip in AZ. We started the evening out watching the sunset on the Edge with a great waitress, Amber. She also assisted us in getting a great seat in the restaurant where we proceeded just after sunset. Cameron greeted us with a friendly smile and lovely dinner suggestions. I got the Bacon Wrapped Filet... Amazing! The best meal of the bunch was Korean BBQ. It was out of this world!
