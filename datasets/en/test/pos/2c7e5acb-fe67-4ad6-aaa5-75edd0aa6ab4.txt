I LOVE Total Wine. It's like BevMo but better. It is closer to my house than any grocery store, so if I'm buying drink, I go here. The prices are phenomenal, the customer service is amazing, and the selection is ridiculously large. I would definitely consider myself to be a regular here. I don't know if that's a good thing exactly, but whatever.

If I could give Total Wine 10 stars, I would without second-guessing it.
