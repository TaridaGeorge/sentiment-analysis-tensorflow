This place is phenomenal. I had my first visit around Halloween and have been back weekly ever since. I'm a huge fan of Kim Chee and these folks have nailed it. The coffees and teas they have next door are extremely good as well. I usually will take some back to the office after lunch. 

Living in NYC, I used to love to hit St Mark's and enjoy some good ramen. I figured I had lost that opportunity upon moving here, but thanks to Republic, I"m back in business. Keep up the good food, I'll see you guys next week!
