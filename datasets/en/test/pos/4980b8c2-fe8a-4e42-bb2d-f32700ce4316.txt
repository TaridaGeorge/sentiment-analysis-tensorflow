My son just had his first dental appointment here and I would recommend anyone with little ones to come here. Of course they have toys in the waiting area, but they also had movies for the kids to choose from, stickers and toys to give away after the cleaning.  I thought my son would kick and scream but he surprisingly opened his mouth and watched a movie while the hygienist  brushed, flossed, and polished away.
