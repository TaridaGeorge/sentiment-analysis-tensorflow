One of the best happy hours!

the look- Its kinda stark?, Im not sure if I want to use that but I will, when you walk in, seems dark. I always wander over to the bar and enjoy the open area and large windows.its always freezing in there bring a hoodie.

Tender of the bar- not bad but not fun and talkative either, so depending on your mood, could make or break you visit. Lots of brews on tap to choose from including Rouge dead guy ale.

Food- all of the food here is incredible, however the meatballs are out of this world ! dont leave without trying them.. don't you do it!! plus they are only 3 bucks on happy hour.

break it down Jess- simply great, wish it was closer to home.
