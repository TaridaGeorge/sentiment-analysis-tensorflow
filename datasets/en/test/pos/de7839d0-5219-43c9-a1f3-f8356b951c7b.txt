Only left with one pair today, man I must be slackin'.  The store was very neat and tidy today, with associates keeping things in order. Well stocked with different sizes and tons of stuff on sale. Two registers open, the line moved quickly. I cannot recall the last time I bought a pair of shoes somewhere else, it seems I always go to DSW!
