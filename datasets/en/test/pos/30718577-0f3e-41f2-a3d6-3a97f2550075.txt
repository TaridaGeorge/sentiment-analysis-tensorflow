This place is AWESOME.  I am personally not gay but have good friends who are and we always have a good time here.  The drinks are cheap and strong and the bartenders/staff are always so welcoming and nice.  If you wanna go dancing-this place has a great little area with awesome DJ's playing the best of the top 20's and more.
I've been going here with my friends for the past 2 years or so and always have a great time.
