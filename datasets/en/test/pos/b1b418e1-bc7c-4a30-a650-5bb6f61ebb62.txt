Fuego Bistro has awesome Latin food. Everyone talks about the Mojidos and they are great but my favorite was the Angus New York Grilled Steak. It was a little bit pricey at $26 but I had a 50% off coupon that I just bought yesterday at phoenix.org. Don't remember exactly where the coupon is but I found it on the first page of Google when I searched for "Phoenix.org, Fuego Bistro Discount card".

I highly recommend the bistro. Don't skimp on the appetizers, they are awesome!
