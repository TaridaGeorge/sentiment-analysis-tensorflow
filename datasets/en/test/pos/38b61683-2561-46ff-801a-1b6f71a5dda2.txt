2 things we don't have in California...Waffle House and Mellow Mushroom. When I'm in Phoenix, I go to both. When I'm in Atlanta, I go to both.

I guess I could branch out and order something different but with food, I like to be predictable. Spinach salad and a mushroom & olive calzone. That's all I ever get. What if I don't like the new thing I order? Best stick with what I love.

The service is always great and everyone in this place is super friendly. 

I do have one suggestion for MelMush....GO WEST YOUNG MAN!
