PF Changs has gone downhill. Pei Wei is great for "fastish" chinese but for real sit down dining. Eddie Chan's has all chinese food locations beat! Food is consistently phenomenal, portions are perfect, flavoring is far from too little or too much..just right. Unfortunately it's pretty far out there if you live anywhere other than N Scottsdale..but it's worth the trip for a taste. I live in Glendale and will drive for a craving.
