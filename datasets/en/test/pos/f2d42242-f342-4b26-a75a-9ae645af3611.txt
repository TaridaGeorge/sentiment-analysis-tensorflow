I could eat here every day! The food is always exceptional. The owners are another big reason to come back often. They remember exactly what I like and are always so pleasant. It's the type of place you can go to order a Jordanian coffee and the owner will make one for himself as well to join you and have a nice conversation while you wait for your food. If you want the real deal and to support a great group of people make this your go to place!
