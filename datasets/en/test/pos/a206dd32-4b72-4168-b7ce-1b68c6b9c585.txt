for a deli it gets five stars
 I was greeted as I walked in every employee i encountered was polite and smilig. they were busy and the noise was pretty high. I ws concerned about the portions being outrageous but they were perfect
and you get a chocolate dipped strawberry with yur meal! I also had a very good dessert beautifully created. But remember this is like a fast food deli its not like an mastro kitchen for dinner but for a deli its clean, organized. 
they have a place to charge cel phones and get wifi. the drink bar is hiding ehind the big ipod charging station. 
My sandwhich ws perfect, warm all the way through and no mustard just like I asked. I got the baked ham sandwhich. Delicious! and nice views out the windowfor people watching.
 One is coming to desert ridge market place soon!
