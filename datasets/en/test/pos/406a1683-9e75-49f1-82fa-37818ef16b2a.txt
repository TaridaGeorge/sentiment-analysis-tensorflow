This location feels like the perfect spot for a TJs.  It just fits the area, we have been to the one at Arrowhead and it feels a little out of place up there.  But at Camelback and 20th its just the right fit.  I always like to buy one new thing when doing a large grocery shop and am always pleased!  
Here are a few of our Favs: 
Peanut Butter Cream Cheese
Fresh Motz Cheese Balls 
Chocolate Jo Jos
Garlic Herb Pizza Dough

These are just to name a few.  Trader Joes knows how to do a unique, fun, healthy market.
