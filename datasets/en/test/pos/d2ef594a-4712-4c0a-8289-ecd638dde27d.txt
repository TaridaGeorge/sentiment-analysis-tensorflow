I love this hotel. I stayed two nights while in Phoenix for the first time. I experienced zero problems while I stayed. The rooms are large and the beds were VERY comfy! I didn't experience the pool, but it looked nice. Lots of shopping & restaurants in walking distance, too. I love this hotel, and if I am ever back in PHX I will come back to this hotel again! ALSO - FREE WIFI!
