My apologies for taking so long to update my review! 3.5 stars - pshaw!

Probably my favorite neighborhood stop for a cocktail! GREAT drinks -- just tell Chris, the bartender/host, what type of drink you like and he'll hook you up with some sort of fantastic concoction! 

The service is outstanding. Always striving to ensure we're having a great time and willing to go above and beyond to meet our needs. Even "opening" the kitchen after it had closed for us to get some late night eats!

And there's happy hour, now!!
