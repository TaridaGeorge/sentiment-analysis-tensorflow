Pizza is unique, the pretzels are ridiculously good. The thing I value the most is the staff though, they work together and are all extremely friendly / personable. Aaron is the front of the house manager and he greets everyone with a smile and is extremely  friendly. I love the bar I must admit. Jenna and Till are out of this world, always on top if it when they are busy and chatting it up with their guests. Happy hour is half off almost all alcohol, and the seasonal beers on tap are excellent.
