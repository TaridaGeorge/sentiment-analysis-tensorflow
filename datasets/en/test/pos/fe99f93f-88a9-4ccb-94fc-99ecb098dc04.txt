The pork ribs are fantastic.  Very fair price, super fair quantity.  The puylled pork sandwich was massive, and good.  The service was friendly and excellent.  We complimented our server and also let her manager know how much we appreciated her service and how great the food was.  The green chile appetizer is to be in heaven...try it.  Can't wait to go back and try the beer ribs.
