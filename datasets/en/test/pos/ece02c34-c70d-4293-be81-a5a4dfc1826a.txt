This pizza is AMAZING.  Definitely one of the top 3 pizzas I've ever had.  New York-style.  We had two pizzas between the two of us (hey, we wanted to try it out!), both "white" pizzas.  One was arugala with some other veggies and the other had sausage and carmelized onions.  OMG it was delicious.  And it doesn't hurt that there's a wine bar next door, in case you have to wait for a table at the pizza place :-).
