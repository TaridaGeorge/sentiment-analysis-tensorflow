Wow, a legitimate independent...film...bar. 

It's everything you're looking for in Phoenix: It's different.

Their house wines are wonderful, the beer list features better than average offerings, and the prices are reasonable. They're continuing to improve: Adding more beers to the tap, releasing exclusive content, hosting cool screenings/fetes.

I will leave you with this: 

On Thursdays they have throw back movies like The Goonies, and
they've also had screenings/events for:  Gainsbourg (Vie héroïque) and A Trip to the Moon (Le Voyage Dans La Lune) and the Sigur Ros experimental film.

Yes.
