I celebrated my parent's anniversary here with some family friends and we had an incredible time. The food, service, and ambience was really phenomenal, and we'll definitely be back to celebrate more occasions.

i recommend the lobster and crab stuffed shrimp and sam's mashed potatoes! you won't be disappointed. and if you're feeling adventurous, the oysters are a great selection!
