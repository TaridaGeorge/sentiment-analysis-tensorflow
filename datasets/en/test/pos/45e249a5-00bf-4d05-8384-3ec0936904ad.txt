I stopped in for some dinner and a little blackjack on the way to catch a red eye at the airport. Had an excellent (an incredibly affordable) dinner at Cholla Prime Steakhouse and Lounge and had a blast playing blackjack. The service was outstanding and the dealers were excellent. The next time i'm in town, I'll be back for sure. Only 10 minutes from the airport, it's the perfect last stop out of town.
