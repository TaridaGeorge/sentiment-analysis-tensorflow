We saw the sign out front that read "Under New Management."  I was a bit concerned because the last and only other time I was there, I got great food, service, & value.  As soon as I saw the same gentleman behind the counter (Brandon), I knew it was all good.  Brandon is incredibly friendly & accommodating.  He remembered me & my family from our only other visit a couple of months ago.  We had awesome, made-to-order burgers, fries, & drinks for $5 each!  We found the secret little patio out back and enjoyed our wonderful lunch. This is the kind of place that makes you want to forget about all the big burger chains & support the small local guys.  Good stuff!!
