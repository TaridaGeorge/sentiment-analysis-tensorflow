Gilbert is cool.  Yeah, that's right, I said it.  Gilbert is the coolest town in the valley and this is one of the places that makes it so darn cool.  The atmosphere here is perfect for hanging out and relaxing with a hot cup of coffee or, better still, a cup of cowboy cocoa.  Be sure to also check out the restaurant next door, Joe's Farm Grill.  Another amazingly cool place to hang out and enjoy great comfort food in a friendly setting.
