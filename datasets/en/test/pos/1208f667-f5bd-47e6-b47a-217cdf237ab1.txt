Still lovin the Pasty. Thought it would be worth noting that I brought my British husband here four, yes FOUR, times when he was in town. One of those times we had four more Brits in tow and they all loved it. "It" includes the food, the atmosphere, the beer selection, the giant booth outside that accommodated 8 of us and the great service we recieved. This restaurant manages to be the trifecta of perfect, as it's good for friends, good for low key dates and good for parents too.
