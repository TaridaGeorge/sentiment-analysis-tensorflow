No question about it, this is hands down the best Chinese buffet in the state of Arizona. When we visit family in the area, we always have dinner here two or three times. The selection is excellent, everythng is hot and delicious, and the service is great. 

If you go here during the winter, expect crowds of snowbirds, but we have never had to wait more than a few minutes.
