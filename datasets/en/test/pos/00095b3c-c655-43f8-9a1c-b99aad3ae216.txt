My husband and I went to the Golden Corral on Power Rd in Mesa.  We thought the food was excellent for the price.  The service is hard to bet and the staff is very friendly.  They have many dishes to choose from so you will have no problem finding  special dishes that  you like.  Serveral deserts to choose from including ice cream, soft or hard.  If you don't mind getting up and getting your own food I am sure you will enjoy the resturant on Power Rd in Mesa.
