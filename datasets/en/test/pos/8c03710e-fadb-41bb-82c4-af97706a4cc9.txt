Hands down one of my favorite places to eat in the valley.  My personal favorites are the BBQ Bacon & Bleu Burger, Portobella Sandwich, Pulled Pork Sandwich, sweet potato fries with pineapple serrano sauce, and the garlic fries.  My sister loves the Chicken Pesto Sandwich and my mom loves the shakes.  My son loves the kids meals and the atmosphere, and really likes a side of the beans that come with the breakfast meal, which aren't on the menu, but you can usually get if they don't run out.  It can get very crowded here, especially on weekends near meal time, so have someone in your party grab a seat before you get in line if you can.
