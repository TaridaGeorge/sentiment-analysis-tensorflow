Unless you are a bag-a-zillion-aire you will not want to do ALL your grocery shopping here....However, I am a serious foodie and entertaining diva AND I love to treat myself to lots of things so of course I love AJ's.  I could spend hours in here just looking at all the possibilities......So go ahead and if you love food and like to eat and also always be the one with the stuff people rave about at a party....put a visit to Aj's on your short list.....
