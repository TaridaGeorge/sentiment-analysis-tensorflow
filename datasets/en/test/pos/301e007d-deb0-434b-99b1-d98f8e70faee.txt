Wow, I can't say enough about Dr. Kwan. As many are frustrated with Commercial Medicine and knowing that it has us addicted to these drugs that are prescribed and stabilizing us and not curing us of anything, Look no further for true help from Dr. Kwan. I have referred a few people to Dr. Kwan and they have been thoroughly impressed with her skill of listening and caring and truly wanting to help them. My girlfriend has been suffering with lung problems and no doctor in 10 years as much as Dr. Kwan in just the first 6 months of her services. If I have a problem or hear anyone who is having health problems I would be telling them it is definitely worth it to see Dr. Kwan.
