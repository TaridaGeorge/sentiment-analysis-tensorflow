Outstanding place for a hearty breakfast .We come here almost every Sunday ,nice and early .
I usually get the Denver omelet ,ham ,peppers,onion and jack cheese .

The cheese Blintzes with strawberries and the Spinach crepes are two of my favorite items on the menu.( when i indulge in Carbs) . 
My son loves the chocolate chip Belgian waffle.( the gluten free waffle is pretty darn good too ) 
Decent coffee ,plenty of choices on the menu and very good service keep us coming back .
