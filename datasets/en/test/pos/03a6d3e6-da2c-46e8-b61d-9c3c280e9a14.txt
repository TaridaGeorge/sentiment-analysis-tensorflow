It's the perfect place to spend the weekend when the city is hitting 110 degrees.  A totally relaxing and beautiful day on the river.  Plus, the scenery is incredible!  My friends and I were lucky enough to see three different groups of wild horses in addition to countless fish and birds.

Compared to my experiences on the Guadalupe River in Texas, the Salt River (at least on Father's Day) is totally tame.  Sure there were a few drunk and high folks, but everyone behaved themselves.  The water was amazingly clean in my opinion.  And anyone freaking out about pee in the river needs to stop being high maintenance.
