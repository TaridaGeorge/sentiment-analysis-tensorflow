I loved everything about this gym initially, except for the televisions connected to the cardio equipment. Great classes, great facilities, and nice people. My issue with the televisions is that you can't get closed captioning on all of them...or so I thought. I complained to the front desk about a couple of tvs that were out of service and he called over Clint the maintenance guy. Clint was so helpful. He works there three days a week and said I should grab him in case I see anything that needs fixing. He thanked me for bringing it to his attention. When I told him my issue with the closed captioning, he actually showed me how to add it to the tvs myself and then offered to add it to any tv I wanted. Now I just wish they had more locations in Phoenix.
