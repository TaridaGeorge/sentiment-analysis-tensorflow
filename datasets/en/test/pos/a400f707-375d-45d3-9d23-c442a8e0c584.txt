Love it!

We did Take-Out via phone (they don't have online ordering yet) and it was ready in 7-10 minutes, just enough time to drive over there.

You can create your own burgers with any number of topping - they even have different Cheeses and Buns to choose from. The Spicy Chipotle Mayo is to die for!

Expect to pay around $7 for a burger and fries. Compared to Five Guys - their portion for fries are very small. But do I REALLY need a large bagful of fries? Probably not, so it's fine. Smashburger's burger pattys actually seem much bigger to me compared to Five Guys. So it evens itself out.

If you want a great burger - go to Smashburger.
