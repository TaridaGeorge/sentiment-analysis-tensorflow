On a visit to Scottsdale, AZ I trusted yelp to search for a savory ice cream parlor. Yelp has not let me down! 

Upon reading all the reviews on yelp and how great sweet republic was, my family and I decided to try it. The Toffee Bonafi was a party in my mouth, literally! The combination of vanilla, toffee brittle, and salted caramel was a great way to end my night. My daughter got the strawberry sherbet and the taste was bursting with strawberry flavor. You can tell that it was made from scratch and no where near compares to any store bought strawberry ice cream.

I wish they had this ice cream stop in California! If you are in the Scottsdale area, I would highly recommend stopping by for a cool sweet dessert!
