I don't wash my truck here. The coffee is great. Employees very friendly and get you in and out in a blink of an eye. (Danny's Family Gourmet Market) 

The car wash is WAY overpriced for what you get. I have to agree with Chuck S. on that one. If you want a great car wash at an unbelievable value. Message me and I will YELP you the details.
