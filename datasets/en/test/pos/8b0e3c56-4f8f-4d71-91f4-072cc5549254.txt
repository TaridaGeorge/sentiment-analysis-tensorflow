Barney's is my favorite department store, hands down in The Valley. They carry all the best men's designers that I can't find elsewhere and can easily drop a paycheck or two in one visit because their selection is incredible. If they don't have it in your size or in stock, ask for them to ship it to you from New York. Krista in men's is the best!!
