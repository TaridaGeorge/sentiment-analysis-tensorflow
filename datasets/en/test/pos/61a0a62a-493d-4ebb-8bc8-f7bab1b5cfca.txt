DEFINITELY GO HERE! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! This place is fantastic. If you are a cuisine adventure seeker or just want some yummy food give this place a try. The food is original and tasty. Don't miss out on the "puf puf"'s or they may be called "poof poofs". Just like a homemade donut with a crispy outside. My husband and I intend to go back every week until we try everything on the menu.
