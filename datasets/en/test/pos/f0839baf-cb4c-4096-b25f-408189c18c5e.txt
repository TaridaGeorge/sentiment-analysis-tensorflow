I love there cheap vietnamese ice coffee and grilled pork sandwich's. I usually like to stop here before a hike to get my caffeine fix and lunch on the go. 

I like to drink a little ice coffee first and then let the ice melt and then add a little water to make it last. The sandwich's are great for hikes because they preserved nicely with the fresh french bread crispy crust to seal in the juicey meat and pickled vegatables. 

Awe, I wish they still had one in Sac town. I guess I will have to find a closer alternative.
