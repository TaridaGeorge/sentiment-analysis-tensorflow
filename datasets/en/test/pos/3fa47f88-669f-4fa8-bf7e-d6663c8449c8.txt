This place is awesome!!! I have been here a few times with friends or my daughter and her teen friends :-) The last time I went with a group of teenagers and friends.  The bill was well over $100, and the manager said dinner was on them! They wouldn't take my credit card! So awesome, since this was a birthday dinner; what an awesome surprise! And their food is great! Awesome management & staff - great place! Oh & nice clothing downstairs :-)
