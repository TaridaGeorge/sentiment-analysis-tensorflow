I just have two words... Pho Phriday

The boys from the office and I have been coming here for a couple years now... every Phriday... we get a diet Pepsi and the chicken pho with extra noodles (add $1). 

If they didn't have Scottsdale rent, the pho might be a dollar or two less, but gall-dangit I can get good pho in Scottsdale and I don't give a shank about the price!!!

I don't even need a menu any more. You might want to try something else, but if you need a pho phix - and you know who you are - stop in, seat yourself, and get into some love... 

"I'll take the pho, extra noodles, diet pepsi." 

Snap.

PS have a pressed coffee if you feel sassy.
