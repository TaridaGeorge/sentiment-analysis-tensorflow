the gelato spot is awesome!!!!!! more than gelato is served here.....they also have sorbet........some of the best sorbet that i have ever tasted in my life!  

i had a groupon as we were visiting from illinois.....i loved the banana sorbet.  very unique and flavorful....my husband loved the tiramisu gelato...can't wait to return during our next visit to az...
