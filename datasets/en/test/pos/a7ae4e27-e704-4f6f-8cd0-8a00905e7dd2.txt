Wow! January 28, 2011, we had dinner at Kai. The only negative I have to say is it's a long way from anywhere. We started out getting to the restaurant a few minutes early where we were able to watch & listen to a duo (bass & electric guitar,) player that were just incredible. The guitar player was playing SRV not missing a lick. Onto the culinary experience. Apps, dinner & fresh drip coffee,  plus my wife KJ had a nice glass of wine.
Feliciano our waiter was tremendous and handled us with integrity & care that a five star restaurant must do to = 5 stars. . The assistants were around when we needed anything and the close was handled with a handwritten note and two boxes of chocolates. 
I will return to Kai each time  I visit  the Scottsdale/Phoenix area.
