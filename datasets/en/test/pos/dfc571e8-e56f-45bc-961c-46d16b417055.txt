I passed this place a few days ago and it looked like it was already open. I stopped in tonight for the first time and was told that they just opened yesterday. This is a nice location with a patio. I like what this plaza did with the traffic flow too.

This Smashburger did not disappoint because I got Smashed tonight. I had a regular smashburger with grilled onions, jalapenos, tomatoes, lettuce, sweet relish and mustard on an egg bun. The burger was juicy and perfectly cooked, what more could you want.
