I was referred to Sally's for an Andis model beard trimmer. From what I know, this is one of the few stores that sell's these high-end barber style trimmers. I actually returned a model for a wider blade with no hassle. I found the workers to be really easy going and understandable. I'm not sure about their other products but if you're familiar with the Andis brand and their high-end products, this is the place to go.
