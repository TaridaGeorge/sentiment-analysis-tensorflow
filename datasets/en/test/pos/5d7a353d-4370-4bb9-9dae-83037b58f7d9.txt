OPA! Five stars for this Greek Eatery! 

I never knew I liked Greek food until I tried My Big Fat Greek Restaurant. I was brought her once by a friend, and after sampling her Tryopita I was in LOVE! Tryopita is a baked pita with three kinds of Greek cheese in side. The tyropita as well as most of the Greek items comes with tasty steamed  vegetables, citrus race, and Greek spiced potatoes. Another great thing about this Mediterranean spot is they offer some American choices as well. So don't be afraid to give it a try! Also My Big Fat Greek Restaurant is open for lunch offering some steals on lunch pitas that come with Greek salads. If it's cool enough eat on their beautiful patio covered in little lights that are grapes!
