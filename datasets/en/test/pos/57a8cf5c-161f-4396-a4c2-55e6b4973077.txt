Always busy when it's lunch or dinner time!  It's worth it for their delicious burgers.

It's always the same at In-N-Out, juicy patties, fresh veggies and full fat cheese.  I usually order the Grilled Cheese, since you get all the juicy meat flavor without the meat.

Otherwise it's a double-double animal style with No Pickles and 2 sides of spread.
