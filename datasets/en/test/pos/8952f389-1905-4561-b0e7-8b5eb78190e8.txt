I love this health club!  I wish I lived closer as it's the nicest Village in AZ. There are so many great machines that can work just about anything and so much room so you aren't waiting to use a particular machine or elliptical.  It feels like "home" being there and everyone is so friendly.  Just like being around people you care about every single day.
