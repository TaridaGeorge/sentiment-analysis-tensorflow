The thin-crust pizza at Frasher's is an acquired taste.  From what I know, the ingredients are all imported from a pizza chain in St. Louis called Imo's.  The cheese is not mozzarella, and has a texture of Velveeta.  But this is not a bad thing.  Sure, it sticks to the back of your teeth, but man, is it good.

In addition to the great pizza, Frasher's offers amazing toasted raviolis, which are also a St. Louis delicacy.

The ambiance is pleasant, offering both a formal dining area and a lounge, replete with leather couches and chairs.

If I could convince the misses to go to Frasher's every night, I would be a happy, and slightly larger, man.
