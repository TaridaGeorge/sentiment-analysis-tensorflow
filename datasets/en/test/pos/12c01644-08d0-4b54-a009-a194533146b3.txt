This place has everything- movie theater, Target, Barnes n' Noble, Dave and Busters and tons of places to eat and drink.  If I have one complaint it's that I think all the restaraunts should be closer to one another- and all the late night businesses should be together.  It's weird walking from one place to the other at night and all the little stores are closed.  Doesn't make sense to me.
