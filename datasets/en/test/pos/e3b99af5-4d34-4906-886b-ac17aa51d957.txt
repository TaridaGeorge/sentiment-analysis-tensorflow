If you've ever been to any of the Mastro's family of restaurants you know what I mean when I say Dominick's is like Ocean Club and City Hall had a baby. The original owners of Mastro's took the best of the local dining legacies, added some Italian dishes to the menu (yay!) and opened Dominicks. 

Simply pulling up to valet and walking the red carpet leading into the restaurant is like food foreplay! It's all good lovin' from there!! It's all-star dining with 5 star prices but worth every dime. 

Enjoy!
