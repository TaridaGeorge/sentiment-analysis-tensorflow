I think this place is now called "dragonfly teas." But whatever the name, this place is exceptional. Everyone is so nice (even to children) and the tea selection is great. The tea is as good (if not better) than Teavana, but half to a quarter of the price. Be sure to try Lemon Love Affair...  Its Orgasmic!
