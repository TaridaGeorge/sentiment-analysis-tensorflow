LOOOOOOVE Valley Ho!  Love the vibe - the mid-century modern decor, large rooms, spacious bathrooms and balconies with loungers!  I even loved the provided bath products (and I almost never use the stuff the hotel provides).  I loved them so much I bought some fromt he spa to take home!  We had the best service too - from valet to front desk to pool staff - everyone was just superb!  I would absolutely return and recommend this place to friends and family!  

Location is great too - walkable to great shops and restaurants!
