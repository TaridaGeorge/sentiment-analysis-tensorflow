Lesco is the cheapest place to get awesome glasses. $29 includes your frames and lenses. That is crazy! They will also put new lenses into any pair of frames you bring in. I just bought 4 new pair and had new lenses put into 3 old pair.  The total cost for 7 pairs of glasses was $188. Seriously!

I admit that 7 pairs of glasses might be excessive, but at these prices, there is no reason not to have a different pair for every day of the week.
