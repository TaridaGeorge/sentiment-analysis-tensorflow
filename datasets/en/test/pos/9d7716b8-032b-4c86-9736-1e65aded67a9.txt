I don't understand why this place has 3 stars. It was like a club at 11am. So if youre looking for a quiet lunch spot, move along. 

THe music was loud, the crowd was pretty good looking and the drinks and food were great. Bottomless mimosas, and bloodies (with bacon in them!!) and good down home southern style breakfast and burgers. 

I also have to hand it to our waitress Mandi. She was really helpful, super nice and hilarious to boot! 

check it out.
