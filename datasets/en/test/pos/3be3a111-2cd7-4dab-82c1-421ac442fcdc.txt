Perfectly refreshing.  I had some coupons I had to burn, and it was a sunny winter afternoon in the 70s.  And by chance I was in downtown Chandler.  So off we went to Paletas Betty, a trendy looking ice cream store, all white inside, very clean.  The place looks simple, and yet pleasant.  Of course after my 2 kindergarteners were done with their paletas, um, maybe the place wasn't as clean anymore.  Sorry Betty :(.  The flavors are so fresh you can't really give this place a bad review.  I had a limon paleta, which was as sour as a lemon picked off the tree.  But I love it, that's what I wanted.  My kids and husband enjoyed other flavors.  And the good news?  I have 2 more coupons, yipee!
