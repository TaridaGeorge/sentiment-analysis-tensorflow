How in the world did we wait 10 years living in Phoenix before eating at Tarbell's? Doh! Magnificent! Not sure where to start - but we all enjoyed the appetizers, entrees, sides, cocktails and deserts. My wife had trouble deciding what to have - a good sign. Highly recommended - just choose what you like.
