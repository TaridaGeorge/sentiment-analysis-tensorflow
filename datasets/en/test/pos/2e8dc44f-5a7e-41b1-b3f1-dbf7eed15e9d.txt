Spent most of the day here on a photo shoot and toured the course while planning a golf tournament for September. 

The course is really nicely laid out, the holes are very deceptive and some have really deep bunkers. 

Most of the hole are carved out around water. 

The staff are helpful and friendly.  Service for the meeting room, and lunch was FANTASTIC!!! food was great. 

Bernards has a good selection of food for decent prices.
