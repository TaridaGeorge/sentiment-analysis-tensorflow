Never disappoints.. Today I had a work lunch and ordered the appetizer #2 Goi Cuon.. (Grilled pork, shrimp, and vegetable spring rolls) a Vietnamese iced coffee, and for my entree I can haz #39 Com Dac Biet So 2 (grilled pork tenderloin and beef with fried vegetable rice) instead of the eggroll I asked for a fried egg.. It was all amazing. And the selection of condiments such as hoisin, sriracha, and chili paste can make it even more flavorful.
