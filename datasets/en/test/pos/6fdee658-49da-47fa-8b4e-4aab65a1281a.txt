I've been here twice now since living here a month, and I love it. The owner treats you as if you're his favorite customer from way back when. He told me proudly about the photo of his nephew graduating from the Air Force Academy as I ordered lunch, and offered me a refill of lemonade for the road when I was heading out the door. The middle of this story consists of me inhaling a falafel pita (with homemade hot sauce and pickles inside) which was better than most falafel I ate while recently in the Middle East (but not quite as good as Amsterdam Falafel in Adams Morgan...ooooh DC I miss you!!). If you want a twist on that irresistible lemonade, ask for a Terminator.
