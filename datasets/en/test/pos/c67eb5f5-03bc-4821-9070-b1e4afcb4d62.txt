I moved to the valley about a year and a half ago, and first tried Tott's when they were still at the old location.  What a great find it was, I tend to stick to the stir fry crispy beef, but have had quite a few other items.  This is just one of those places that does everything to near perfection.  Tott's will set the bar so high others will just fall short.
