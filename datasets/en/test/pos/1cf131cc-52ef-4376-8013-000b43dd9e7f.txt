OMGS you guys. This is a little diamond in the rough. Nice and cheap, with a modest, but DELICIOUS, menu. I share the combo platter with my BF and then usually get the chicken, which is so moist and tender and slathered in creme...

And it comes with a little cup 'o chicken soup which is yum-sauce.

Papusas.  Need I say more?
