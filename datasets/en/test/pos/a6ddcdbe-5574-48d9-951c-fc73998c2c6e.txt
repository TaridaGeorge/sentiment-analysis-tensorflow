We decided to check this place out after seeing an ad in the paper awhile back.  Looking for something quick and simple we got ground beef and made burgers on the grill. They were fabulous and I am not a big fan of burgers so that is really saying something! We also picked up some coleslaw, beans and macaroni salad and ended up with a great family dinner for under $15.00.  Butchers are also very friendly.
