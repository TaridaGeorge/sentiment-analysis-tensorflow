Tried Fuego on a local Groupon today. When the menus came out printed on aluminum, I knew we were in for a treat. Any place that has the guts to print a menu on metal knows what's good!

The highlight of our meal was the chef's special tostadas. Small fried tortillas with a guacamole spread, the perfect balance of veggies and cheese, and topped with a chipotle aioli.

We had the scallops de jalapeno, and the ropa vieja. Both excellent meals.

As they call it, a Latin-Southwest fusion, Fuego executes this perfectly.
