I live in the neighborhood, and so I have had the good fortune of having Vincents Market Bistro in my backyard. Without exageration I have probably eaten here at least 50 times over the years and have NEVER had a disappointing meal. 

From the egg-in-a-hole for breakfast to the lovely Coq au vin , lamb shank, or Beef Bourguignon for lunch or dinner the menu is always rich.
