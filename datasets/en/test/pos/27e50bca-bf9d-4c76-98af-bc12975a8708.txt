We walked into Michael's yesterday to get some last minute Halloween stuff. One of the employees was doing face painting. We were planning on going to Peoria's Halloween Bash that night so we figured we'd get our 5 year old daughters face painted to match her costume. She did a great job on the face paint and best of all it was free. 

Things like this keep me coming back to businesses. I really think it's cool they give back like that. 

And by the way, My daughter took "Most Original" in the costume contest. If you're reading this face painting employee, THANKS! You made my daughters day!
