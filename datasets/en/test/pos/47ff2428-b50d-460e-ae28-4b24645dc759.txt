I had NO idea there were THAT many varieties of cactus!

This is a great place to go during the day, when you are awaiting for your red eye flight back to the East Coast, you won't see anything like it east of I-95!

Tips:

1. Try to go as early as you can, before the full desert sun comes out. 

2. Bring water, a hat or an umbrella (parasol)..it gets hot (see #1)
 
3. Admission is $18, and an AAA discount is available.

4. Bring a camera!
