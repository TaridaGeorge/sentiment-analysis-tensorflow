One of my "you must try this" restaurant recommendations for any vegetarian/gluten-free or generally open-minded eaters. My girlfriend and I either eat here or get carry out from here on a regular basis.

Our favorites include the thai peanut & drunken mushroom bowls, the jerk tofu salad, and the "chicken" wings. Everything is good here though, and I mean everything - I haven't ordered something I haven't liked, although some dishes I do enjoy more than others.
