I visited Pizzeria Bianco last spring after my boyfriend and I checked out the Titanic exhibit at the Arizona Science Center. It was just around the corner. We got here at about 3:30 on a Friday and there were already more than a dozen people ahead of us in line. We waited for them to open, take our names and then we headed next door for drinks and appetizers. What a fun experience. We chatted up with the couple that had been ahead of us in line and enjoyed a beautiful evening in the garden area. 

We each got a pizza and they were both delicious. Everything tasted so fresh. The crust was cooked to perfection. We sat right next to the oven and it was so cool watching Chris make everything. We will definitely be back and bring friends next time.
