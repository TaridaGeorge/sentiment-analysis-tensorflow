While searching online for a yoga studio to practice in while visiting Mesa from out of town from NYC, I found the bungalow.  It was a real treat meeting teachers Carrie and Robin.  They were very professional, and lead great classes.  I enjoyed meeting the other members in the classes and found the studio to be a lovely, warm, and beautiful place to enjoy yoga.  The classes were small and comfortable, with music in the background during class, and lead at a comfortable pace.  Having a nice patio to relax with a tea or coffee after class is also a plus!
