As a new parent I can't imagine anything worse than having  a sick baby and not being able to get in to see a Dr. I never need to worry about this with EVCC. My daughter suffered from chronic ear infections and with very little notice EVCC always saw us the same day, and in many cases within a few hours of calling. Dr. Curran is caring, professional and most importantly passionate about pediatrics. From time to time we see other practitioners in the office and ALL of them have been excellent. The office is clean and the front office staff is extremely friendly.
