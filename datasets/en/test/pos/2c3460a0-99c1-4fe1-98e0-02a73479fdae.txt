Completely incredible. We had the burrata salad, the original chopped salad and the chicken over risotto. All were masterfully made with perfect, fresh ingredients. The place is not overly fussy, but the food is clearly made my someone with a great deal of skill. It was inventive but not too far out there. And it was so well crafted, but not over worked.  A difficult balance to strike, in my opinion. Our very memorable and charismatic waiter was Gary. And despite his big personality, he knew exactly when we needed him and exactly when we wanted to be left alone with our perfect food. Exceptional experience overall.
