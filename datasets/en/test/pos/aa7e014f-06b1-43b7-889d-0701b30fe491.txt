The cookie Jar is a small family owned cafe in downtown Casa Grande. My wife and I have been eating there for roughly 5 years. We were bummed when they stopped serving dinner a few years ago but understood because we were usually the only people in the restaurant for dinner. They still serve breakfast and lunch though. We have had several things on the menu and two things stand out. The Cuban sandwich is the best you can find in Arizona! The steak quesadilla is excellent also. We have always had good service.
