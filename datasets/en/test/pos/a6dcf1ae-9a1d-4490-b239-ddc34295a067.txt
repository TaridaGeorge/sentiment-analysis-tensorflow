Easily my favorite Pho restaurant in town.  This is a guilt free place to eat.  There are so many light, fresh, low fat, low everything but good stuff dishes here, you can't go wrong.

The selection is good... you can get different BBQ meats, shrimp or meatballs in different combinations over noodles in at least 3 different styles of soups.  They also have dishes that are not soups served over rice or different kinds of noodles.

In addition to the soups and entrees, there is a full selection of appetizers.  My favorite are the spring rolls.... fresh crispy veggies and greens with all the sauces and extras. YUM!

They also have Boba drinks.  I thought Boba was Japanese. I guess it is Vietnamese as well.

The price can't be beat.  An entree is around $5.
