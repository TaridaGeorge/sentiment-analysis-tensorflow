I am not a professional gardener and I don't have a green thumb. I gave fallen out of planter boxes, seriously hurt myself, been carted off in an ambulance and have no idea why I continue to dig the dirt in my front and back yards...but I do. Its an addiction of mine and if you can recommend 'help' I would appreciate it, but until then, I have a fully charged cell phone, 911 and Baker Nursery.

I really don't want to drive very far to get my planting needs, yet I have driven even farther and gone to great lengths to try to replace my relationship with Baker Nursery and I always come back - simply, they have the best plants in the city, the plants and shrubs are priced fairly, the staff is friendly and knowledgeable and they don't mind my questions.
