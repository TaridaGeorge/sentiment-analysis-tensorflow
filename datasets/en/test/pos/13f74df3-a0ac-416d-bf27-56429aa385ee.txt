This is still a 5 star store.  They have everything I need and then some.  But I searched and searched for the Sweet Republic Ice Cream and, sadly, I did not see any.  Maybe they were all out.....I hope that was the case because I loved that I could go to Whole Foods and get my Sweet Republic without going all the way to their store.  I also noticed that they now have local beers from San Tan Brewery.  I even found a pamphlet that tells what they offer in the store that is locally grown or made.  I love it!
