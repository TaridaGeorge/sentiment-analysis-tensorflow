Stumbled upon Bonfire Grill and Bar while walking around Old Town Scottsdale looking for a place to eat lunch.  To our surpise we found a gem.  This place was awesome!!!  Our waitress was great also!!!  I loved the look and the feel of the place, and it seems like it would be a great place to hangout during the evening hours. I ended up ordering the BBQ Chicken Flatbread which was new to the menu. It was very tasty and hit the spot.  I hope to be back when I visit the Scottsdale area again.  Definetly Recommend!!!
