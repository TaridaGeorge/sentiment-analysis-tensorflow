Big Ol Santa Hats off to Lindsey/Yelp and the Tanzy Team!

This was one of the most spectacular events of 2012. We were greeted with a champagne flute and immediately escorted to a beautiful table with appetizers to welcome us. 
Our server Jill was very knowledgeable about every dish and recommended great wine pairings for every course (there were a lot, and I wasn't driving)!

Let me make you jealous with a few of my favorites: pan seared calamari with delicious artichoke hearts, scallops,  house made mozzarella, beef capriccio and the 
antipasto plate. 

The evening was wonderful and the staff was awesome. I will definitely be back to Tanzy to sample more of their delicious offerings when I use my Ipics tickets that we were given that evening.
