I felt compelled to write a review for this particular Subway location. The food is the same as expected but the employees are the exception. I always forget to write down the names of the gentlemen that work there but they are the reason I go back again and again. 

My daughter loves Subway already but these guys will make whatever crazy sandwich she wants that day where other locations will only create to the already set sandwich menu. They smile and laugh each time but are always willing to make it to order for her.

If you like Subway and think outside the sandwich box, I am sure these gentleman can keep up. Well done.
