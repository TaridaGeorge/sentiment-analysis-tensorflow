The boyfriend took me here, raving about how great it is. I took him to Pizzeria Bianco for his bday and I was not super impressed. But then we came here and I was blown away! I love the pizza with the pulled pork, it is SO delicious. I get it every time we return! The happy hour is great with great prices on beer and wine. We actually took my mom and her boyfriend here when they were in town visiting and they loved it! We ordered a bottle of chardonay (and a beer for Eric) and had a great time out on the patio. I have never sat inside, and I never want to! Part of the reason I love this place is being able to sit outside and enjoy the weather and mill ave.
