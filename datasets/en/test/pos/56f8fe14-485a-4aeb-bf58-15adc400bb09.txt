MAMMA MIA!!! Delicioso.. Found this gem pizza place when I just travel and cruising down chandler blvd. It does looks like a high end pizza place from the front but OMG! the food experience is totally beyond my expectation. If you love pizza so much, you definitely should come here. They made the pizza and pasta from scratch and it cooks to perfection. You can smell the charcoal from the edge of your pizza. And the customer service is so impressive!. I went there for Mother's Day and the waiter gave us Italy Connoli (the crispy crust pastry filled with cream and chocolate drip) cause we waited for our food due to the very crowded restaurant!.. Whoever served me - waiter in pink shirt - you got me hooked to this place! I definitely come swing by here again..
