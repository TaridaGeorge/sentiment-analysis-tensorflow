We just bought our new flat screen from Fry's.  The sales guy, Matt, spent about two hours with us.  He answered every question you could imagine.  He educated us and helped us make a great decision.  Maybe this should be a review for Matt, not Fry's.  But, truly, you never know when your are getting a line of crap or not.  After we bought our TV and went home, we validated everything he told us.  We price matched, no one came close.  And, they kept helping us well after the store had closed.  We had fun with the purchase instead of stressing about it.  Just an overall great experience.  My mom was there within the month and had just as good of service and was happy with her purchase.

We will be going to Fry's next time we need anything and hopefully, we will have the same experience.
