I have been a long time frequenter of this amazing coffee house. I don't pretend to be a coffee snob but I am an addict and this place makes the best lattes and coffee of any place I've ever been. The pastries are unreal and baked in house with love. 

They recently opened their new addition and restaurant and I have to say that they have made a true iconic mark in downtown Phoenix. The menu is limited right now but everything we were served was great. Of course they still maintain their coffee house vibe and have sacrificed nothing in that area with the renovation. 

This place is a must visit in Phoenix!
