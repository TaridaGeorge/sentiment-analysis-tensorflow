Great independent bookstore. Huge selection... I like that they have used and sale books mixed in with the new books in each section, so you don't have to look in multiple places. Lots of seating, plus it's connected to Wildflower Cafe, so you can always pop over there for a coffee or lunch. 

Nice collection of small gifts, journals, moleskines, etc, as well.
