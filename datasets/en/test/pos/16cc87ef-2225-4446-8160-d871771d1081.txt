Hands down my favorite pizza place in AZ!  If you are a pepperoni pizza person you HAVE to try Grimald's pepperoni and ricotta pizza, it's amazing!  I visit both locations in Scottsdale, the one in Old Town and the one in D.C. Ranch.  Old Town gets really busy around dinner time on the weekends and D.C Ranch is a little easier to get seated on the weekend.  Both are really good.
