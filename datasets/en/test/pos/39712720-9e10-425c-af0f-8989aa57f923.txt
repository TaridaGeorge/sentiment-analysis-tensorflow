Best hotel I have ever stayed at, and I stay at a lot of hotels. Good price, totally happy and friendly staff, free food and drinks and renovated rooms. 5+ stars!

I have asked the staff if they receive special training in customer service, because it is evident in all of their dealings with their customers.

They have also received the JD Power and Associates Customer service award 6 years in a row....

Thats how good this hotel is...
