My boyfriend and I came in to pick up my frames but apparently; they were not available...Andrea helped us out and I chose a new style of frames. She was very professional and funny! And I'll tell you together my boy and I are very picky on customer service, but she did an amazing job! He even picked out frames himself and didn't even need them. GREAT STAFF & Selection to choose from! :)
