Cant say much that hasnt been said already.  Matts serves some delicious breakfast.  Yes its small.  Yes theres a wait.  Yes its worth it!  Bring a newspaper or a book, sign your name in and chill out.  At least now they have added a few benches to relax on.  Once inside anything you order will be fresh and delicious.  From amazing waffles, to the freshest fruit, to the tastiest bacon.  If Im in the mood for a bomb breakfast and have some time to kill Matts is at the top of the list.
