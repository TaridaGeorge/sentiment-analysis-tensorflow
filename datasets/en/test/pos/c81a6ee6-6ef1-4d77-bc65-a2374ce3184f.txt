Expensive.  That about sums it up.  You will not find Cheetos here.  A whole grocery store of the finest foods and household items money can by.  It's like a boutique Trader Joes.  The best produce, meats, teas, jams, honey, chips, and on and on that you will find in the Valley.  It also has an excellent deli, prepared meals, a sushi bar, cakes and candies...  good stuff.  But like I said, pricey.
