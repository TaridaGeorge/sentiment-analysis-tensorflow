This is the best shuttle service I have ever used!

A group of my friends and I rode the Dougie while traveling around the Greater Phoenix Area.  We were down for the Fiesta Bowl and needed rides to various parties and the Bowl Game itself.  Doug was always right on time, very accommodating and a fun guy to be around.

If you are in Phoenix/Scottsdale/Glendale and need to  move a big group of people fast-while keeping them happy during the ride, you too should Ride the Dougie

I know now how to Dougie...hopefully this review will teach others.
