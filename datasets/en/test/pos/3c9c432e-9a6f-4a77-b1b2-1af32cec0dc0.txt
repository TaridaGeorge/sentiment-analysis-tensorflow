David is the MAN! He is awesome, professional, and did a fabulous job. What else would you want in a painter? I had David refurbish/paint an old Vintage dresser. He helped me select a white linen paint and his expertise went a long way! The dresser came out looking retro, clean, and fresh. It was exactly what I wanted. He is also very reasonably priced. All the other quotes I received were over $300 more than what David charged. He is also cool to chat with and is trustworthy. Pretty much as good as it gets!
