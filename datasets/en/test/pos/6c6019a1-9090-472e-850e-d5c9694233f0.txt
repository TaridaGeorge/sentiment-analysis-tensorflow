It can be kind of frustrating when random quirkiness wins a bar loads of attention, but in RnR's case it sort of deserves it. The place is well-designed, well-staffed and well-stocked. The atmosphere is calm yet eclectic, and the whole experience feels complete. That may seem like an odd statement but it's not rare to wander into a restaurant and feel that there is a certain element missing. RnR is not one of those places.

The service was above average, the waitress was knowledgeable about the menu & made a solid effort to ask if we needed more drinks or anything else.
