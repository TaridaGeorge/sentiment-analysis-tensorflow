What a fantastic record store.  It's a great place for anyone who likes indie music and wants to discover new bands.  Listen to a bunch of artists and talk to the knowledgeable staff.  Well priced, and very cool atmosphere.
My best experience there was a free acoustic concert by the format out back.  They played an hour long set for a small crowd completely for free.  Then they signed posters and gave them away.  Afterwards I stuck around and shopped around for some music. When the band was done signing stuff they came into the store and started looking for records and talking to all of the patrons.  What a great place.  Make sure to check it out when you are in the valley.
