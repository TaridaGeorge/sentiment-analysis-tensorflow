Best place to eat in the Central Corridor.  Great food, servers with lots of personality, a fabulous Sunday Brunch (with carafes of bloody marys or screwdrivers at $3, mimosa carafes for $6).  My honey and I had our first date here and have been back at least once a week ever since (going on 3 years now).   We love Switch!
