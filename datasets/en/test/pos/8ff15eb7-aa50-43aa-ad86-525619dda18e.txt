I came in here after looking at a number of Valley shops to purchase a new S&W M&P 15-22 for myself and my daughter to take to the range.  The price I paid was almost exactly the same as I could find online, and without shipping I saved a bundle.  

The staff here are knowledgeable, patient and don't have that attitude you find so commonly at most gun shops.  It's a pleasure patronizing an establishment such as this and it's now my go-to shop in Phoenix for all my firearms needs.
