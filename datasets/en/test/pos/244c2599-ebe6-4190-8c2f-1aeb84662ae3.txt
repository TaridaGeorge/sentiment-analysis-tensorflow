The best sushi I have tasted in AZ, and I have tried my fair of sushi here.... a very big selection of sushi rolls, some favorites are climax roll, guilty pleasure and first love, love the screaming fever albacore salad. I have to say sushi in AZ is pricey everywhere so its standard there. 2 people usually runs about $60-$80 .... but its worth it, its delicious and very fresh!!!!
