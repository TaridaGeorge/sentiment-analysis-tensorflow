Sure, this place might already have Christmas songs mixed in with their regular songs (even though it was only November 3rd) but it's still the best Ann Taylor I've ever been to. 

It's in the Arizona Mills Mall, which is an outlet mall, but this isn't an Ann Taylor outlet, per se.  As in, they also carry the newer collections on top of the discounted shoes and clothing. 

What struck me about the place was not the clothing or selection but the service.  I wish I lived closer to Arizona just so every time I went shopping Judith could help me.

This is a clean, bright store, and the service is amazing.  If you live in the area, go here.  Besides, you're sure to find some bargains.
