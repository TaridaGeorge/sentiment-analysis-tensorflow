The decor inside made me think if Fez opened up an ice cream shop it would look like this. I'm not too big on sweets but I find myself craving their ice cream a lot. Sweet Republic also offers free wifi and board games so you can hang out and enjoy your ice cream. I just moved into the neighborhood and I can see myself becoming a regular here.
