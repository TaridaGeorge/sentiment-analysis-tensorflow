Such great people join here. Their staff is always friendly and accommodating.  Food isn't bad either! HOMEMADE pizza!  Awesome place to play Bingo too! I hope the membership considers helping the outside patio be cooler. In the heat of summer, the misters just don't do the trick. :(  Thanks for allowing this Mick in on occasions. :)
