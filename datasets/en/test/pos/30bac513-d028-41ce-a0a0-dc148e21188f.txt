Best bar food EVER.  I don't live in Scottsdale but I would come back just to eat there.

My friend, a Scottsdale local, took me and my sisters to RnR before our journey to Sedona.  There were other restaurants nearby but we were in the mood for tapas size munchies and some drinks.  RnR was the perfect place.

We ordered the ahi tacos, which was wrapped in jicama, instead of tortilla.  So delicious!  We also had fries and sliders which just melted in our mouth.  For drinks, we recommend the prickly pear and bitter mango margaritas.  So yummy and refreshing for a warm day.

Would fly to AZ and tolerate TSA just to eat there again.
