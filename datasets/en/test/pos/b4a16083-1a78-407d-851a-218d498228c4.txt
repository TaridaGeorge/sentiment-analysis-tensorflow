Discovered this oldest barber shop near ASU (Arizona State University) in Tempe AZ from one of the local event. The old school style haircut for man only. It's not a salon, but it's definitely a place if you want to get nice haircut and some dirty joke while watching sports or news on two giant big screen TV. 

This is the oldest barbershop since 1962. They only open from Tuesday to Saturday. This is s small place without fancy decoration. They have many numbered haircut photos on their wall so you just tell them the number they will do the rest. 

They don't have any web site or advertisement, so you can only find their coupon at http://www.smartlocalshoppers.com/store/view/promotions/1069/ to save some money!

They seem to take cash only. They have the oldest cashier register machine I have ever seem though.
