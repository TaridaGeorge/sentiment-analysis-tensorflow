Oh how I love great Italian...let me count the ways. Great pasta, super satisfying calamari, nice selection of California wines and imports (by the glass). The ambiance is refined, relaxed and modern. I simply cannot wait to return here - especially after the no smoking law goes into effect at the bar. Friendly staff, great service, delicious food. In the 'burbs and worth it.
