I ate here in January while at a work-conference in downtown Phoenix.  The meal and overall experience was perfect.  CIBO feels like a home, and I think it actually is a converted home.   

The staff is extremely nice, with a bit of hippie-quirky, which we enjoyed.  You could tell that they were passionate about food, fresh ingredients, and health.  The food was great (i had salad and a pizza), and the portion sizes were very large.  I would estimate 2 pizzas and 1 salad for 3 people next time.  I will definitely be back there whenever I'm in Phoenix.
