I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this cute, boutique!  We were killing time a few weeks ago and just happened to wander into Charming Charlies aka a jewelry fanatics heaven.

First, it's visually pleasing.  Each section is color coded which is FANTASTIC.  I headed straight for the purple section.  For costume jewelry, you really can't beat the prices, and the customer service was wonderful as well.

My best find, though--three pairs of heels for $15 total.  And I'm not talking cheap, Payless heels.  These are beauties and I got compliments galore when I wore them on a recent trip to Vegas.

I'll be back soon to be charmed, Charlie. :)
