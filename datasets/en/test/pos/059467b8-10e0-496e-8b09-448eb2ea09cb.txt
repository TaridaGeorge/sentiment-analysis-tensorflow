German beer on tap, delicious brats (even vegan brats!) and an atmosphere that is ridiculously laid back you can't do better for an evening with friends! Btw drunken date cake, as good as or better than pizziokie... You decide.  Finally, bonus points for those who recognize who/what the logo is based on.
