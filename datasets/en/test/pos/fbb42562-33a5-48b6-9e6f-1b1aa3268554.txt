Took our 16 1/2 month old son for his first haircut.  We had a wonderful experience with Miss Becky!  His hair is super super cute!  Not your typical, standard cut but a more versatile cool boy cut!  He watched baby Einstein while sitting in the driver seat and didn't even notice he was getting his haircut.  His head jerking periodically didn't even phase Miss Becky.  She cut his hair with the love and care as if she were his own grandma.  My parents were there videotaping the whole event.  Can't wait to be regulars at this family friendly salon. Oh yeah-  and the price was actually what u should pay for a kids cut!
