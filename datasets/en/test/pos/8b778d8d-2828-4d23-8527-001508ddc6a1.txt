I must say that this place has never disappointed me. They're always upfront about what the problem is and have offered me very good advice. We have taken a number of cars there, and my dad has as well. 

Whenever we have something go wrong--we take it to firestone. It's almost always the best price, and the best service. The technicians are knowledgeable. They also seem genuinely concerned about helping you.

I expressed grief about the dealer I bought my car from which had done faulty repairs and they were completely apologetic, though, it was not their fault, and didn't even charge me for the diagnostic on my car. 

I've also experienced a lot of sexist comments from other technicians at other shops; however, I have never had that problem with firestone. They are always cordial and helpful. A+
