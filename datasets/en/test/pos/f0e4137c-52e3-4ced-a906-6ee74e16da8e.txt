Being a lovely day out, we had to sit on the patio. It was perfect. 

I started off with the Onion Tarte, which was much more delicious than I was expecting, and I had high expectations going into it. It had so much character without the onion playing an overbearing role. The bacon complimented it perfectly, then again I'm a sucker for bacon. I highly recommend the dish. The filet mignon was cooked to perfection, as always. The Four Berries Tarte was perfect, it wasn't overly sweet and left me with the most satisfying smile.
