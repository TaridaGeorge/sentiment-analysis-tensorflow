Everytime I go to Phoenix I make it a point to tackle Camelback.   I have gone on both trails but prefer the Summit trail.  Takes me about 45 minutes to climb and about an hour to come down.   The reward is to sit up on top of that huge rock with a great panoramic of Phoenix.  The people are friendly and the vibe between hikers is noticeable.   Tons of Scottsdale eye candy to help motivate you.  Bring more water then you think you will need and no opened toe shoes.   You do need to be in moderate shape at least.
