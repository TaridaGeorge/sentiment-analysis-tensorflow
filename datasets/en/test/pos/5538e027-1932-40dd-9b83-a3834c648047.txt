What can I say about Four Peaks that hasn't been said before?  Great beer...wonderful food...fun crowd...cool building...and very reasonable prices.

Some of my fav food items are the Spinach Artichoke Dip, the Garden Burger (prob one of the best I've had), the Beer Bread Sandwiches, the Pizzas and def the Spanakopita.

Being a girly girl (& not much of a beer fan) I really like their Hefeweizen & Peach beer and my boyfriend always go for the Kiltlifter.

The only complaint I have about this place is that I've been here countless times and I can't recall ever getting good service.
