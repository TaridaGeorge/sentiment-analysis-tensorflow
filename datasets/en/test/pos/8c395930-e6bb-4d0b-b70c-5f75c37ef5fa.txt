If you have over 30 flavors, it is probably smart to have endless samples! So if you have a hard time making up your mind (like I do) this is the place to sample. :-)The staff is always smiling and friendly. Very knowledgeable about the product they are selling. Don't want gelato? Get sorbet instead. Mix and match flavors. The Rum Raisin, Carmello,coconut,  and some new flavor of the month are always my top picks. The flavors are always changing, and there are still quite a few I have not tried (yet). Bring some friends, and leave behind your guilt. This gelato is MUCH healthier than dairy queen or coldstone creamery's desserts.
