If you're Fresh2Def you need to stop by the only hip sneaker store in the Valley (that's right i said sneakers, this place doesn't roll with shoes). Highpoint which is owned by Adrian Wilson (safety for the Arizona Cardinals) is the only place in the VALLEY you can get new Air Force 1's ,Creative resolutions, custom Adidas, and of course your ICE Cream's/   Not only does it have the illiest sneakers in the area but they do rock some Billionaires Boys Club clothing which is not available anywhere.  A little expensive but if you want to be Flashy & Fly no other place to start then Highpoint.
