I'm a big, big fan of Wildflower. They are fast, fresh and delicious.

They have scrumptious bread, fresh salads and the soups are to die for. The BLT is my favorite,  thick bacon and "always fresh" avacado.

The Lobster Bisqe is the real deal with large chunks of meat in it. It's so good I eat it for breakfast. 

This particular location has a great patio when the weather allows and the pandora stations they play only slightly suck. Indoors each booth has power outlets and people are always busy working away. How cool is that. 

Yea it's corporate and a chain but lower your nose, it rocks. 

The ice tea is amazing, I always buy a bag to brew at home. Delicious!
