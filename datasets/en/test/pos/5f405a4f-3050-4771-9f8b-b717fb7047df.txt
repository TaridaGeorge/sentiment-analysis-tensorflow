Sens is one of my favorite places downtown. The drinks are exotic and the food is never disappointing. The staff is also friendly and very helpful. 

One of my most recent visits went like this... 

Waiter (wish I would have gotten his name) told up the specials. We ended up ordering sizzling shrimp, chicken lollipops, short ribs, and one other thing I can't remember. I also had a lychee saketini (yum). All of the food was absolutely delicious. Also, the music that they were playing practically matched my current playlist. The acoustic version of "Heartbeats" by the Knife was playing and I mentioned to the waiter that I loved the song, so he played the original as well. (How nice) 

When you are at Sens the atmosphere is hip and comfortable. Good for a group or date night.
