My daughter Mackenzie has been coming here for about 4 months and absolutely loves it! The kids class is very well organized and is is a great way for kids of all skill levels to get a basic understanding of Capoeira.  My daughter gets so excited for Saturdays now because she knows she's going to have a blast!
