This is one of the best things to happen to old town in quite awhile - and a damn fine tribute to the hallowed ground of Pischke's Paradise. Iruna offers some seriously good food, a modern euro-lounge atmosphere, great cocktails (Try the "Ginger Lemonado"), and a really comfy patio. The staff are passionate, talented, and eager to please.
