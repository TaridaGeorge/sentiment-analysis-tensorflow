A past client used to come in for meetings carrying treats like chocolate filled croissants from Essence Bakery. They were amazing!...and fast forward quite a few months, I finally decided to stop in on my to work.  When I walked in, the only thing I thought was "I smell butter. This is awesome." And it was. Great menu featuring local ingredients, nice little patio, and the quiche I had was delicious.  I know I'll be back for more breakfast, lunch, and baked goods like that chocolate croissant.
