Refreshing new concept for our fine city.  Quick, affordable and high quality product to go with some very friendly/helpful service.  Vibe of restaurant is very "hip" and clean.  Rear patio area is a great place to people watch.  Nice to leave a fast casual restaurant without feeling guilty.  Will be back next time in am in the area.
