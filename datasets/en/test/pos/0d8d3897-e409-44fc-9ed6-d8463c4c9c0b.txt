I've been going to Freestone for about 6 months now and I like it better than any gym I have ever belonged to. The staff is friendly and the facilities are great!  They have a rockwall and I have seen kids as well as adults on it. Although....I would never do it!  The fitness classes they offer are great too and the times work with my schedule.
