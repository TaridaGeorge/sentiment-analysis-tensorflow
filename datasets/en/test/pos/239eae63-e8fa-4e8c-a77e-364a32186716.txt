We've been going to see the Jester'z for at least 10 years, and it never gets old. In fact, my family still laughs about some of the jokes we heard years ago. I am always blown away at how funny and creative all the players are, all the while keeping it clean. Once in a while you'll get a player who might be having an "off" night, but the other players more than make up for it. We have a blast every single time we go. Highly recommended!
