My cup runneth over. After my near-spiritual experience at Torres Cigar Factory I checked this place out the next day. Super, super friendly, and new enough that there are no cliques. The selection is not overwhelming, but he has all the favorites. Best of all, he has a very nice, comfy lounge/club area that is...ready for this...FREE!!! I like Tinder Box, but whenever I am there and want to have a cigar I feel like a steerage-class passenger on the Titanic. All the "special" people that can afford it are in the club, while the rest of us hoi polloi are outside in 3rd class. I live practically across the street from Tinder Box, which is a fine store, but it is worth it to me to drive down the road to this place.
