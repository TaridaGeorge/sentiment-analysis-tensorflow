I've eaten here for lunch at least once a week for about two years.  I absolutely love the food here, and the service is fantastic.  It's also a bargain for the price.  

Try the #4 medium on the lunch menu or the Hot & Sour soup.  The yellow curry (#2 lunch), red curry (#3 lunch) and the #6 lunch are also delicious.  

I love this place!
