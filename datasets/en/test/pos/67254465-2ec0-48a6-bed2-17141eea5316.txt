Three friends and I were visiting Phoenix for the Rock n Roll marathon, and a local recommended the place for our post-race meal.  We called ahead for a reservation, and when we arrived, they seated us on the back patio.

Service was really good - they moved a few heat lamps around to make sure we were warm - and we all ordered a drink.  But the star was the food - our Vegan friend totally dug the vegetarian tacos, and two of us went to town on the fried chicken, green beans, cinnamon roll and mashed (or mac n cheese).  Nothing bad at the table - period. 

The food was simple, but very fresh, and the atmosphere was something we Chicagoans wish we could take advantage of more - outdoor setting, perfect service, great food.  We'll be back.
