I work just up the street and we always eat here for lunch, every time i go in they are always super nice and friendly, the food is fresh and I'm always in and out. Most of the time I'm picking up food for the whole office so one of the employees told me that i can call and order over the phone to make it easier on me which was great! I love going here, i always get GREAT service :)!
