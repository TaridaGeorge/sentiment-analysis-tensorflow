The space is home not only to a showroom but also a custom production and design studio, distribution center and the general office of "Designer Mike" as seen on Bravo TV's Kathy Griffin My Life on the D List. -- Perhaps, Sunnyslope's biggest celebrity!?!

Their award winning line of permanent botanicals, arrangements, planters, vases and canvas art is sleek and contemporary and can be found in Bomberos, Corbin's, the W hotels, and Robb & Stuckey's across the country.

They supply interior design professionals, retailers, the hospitality industry and commercial and business accounts.
