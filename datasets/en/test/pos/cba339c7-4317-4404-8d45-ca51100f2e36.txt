Beer and spam. Let's goo!

I wanted to go here for a while and happened to walk in with some friends, not knowing the name. I looked at all of the different beers, the cool patio and interesting menu. Finally someone told me where we were and it all came together! This is a very cool spot, fairly unassuming from the outside. Once you're in, they have TONS of craft brews from across the country. Take your out-of-town friends here. Each have a decent alcohol percentage, so watch yourself.

There is a good assortment of interesting items on the menu, including spam! Other dishes are pretty creative and add to the mystique of the place.  I wasn't able to spend much time here but can't wait to go back.
