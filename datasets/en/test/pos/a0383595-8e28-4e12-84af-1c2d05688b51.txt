I'm vegetarian so I just had the waffles and eggs the first day we went... aside from the line and it taking 10 minutes to get our name on the list, the food was definitely worth the wait. A friend of mine and I were on a road trip, read the awesome reviews here and we were not disappointed! The next morning we CRAVED the waffles. We went back and filled our tummy's with more amazing noms. My friend that went with me recommends the chicken legs instead of the breasts though, she said the breasts were a little dry. Who knew this would actually go together?!?!?! We were amazed. AWESOME PLACE!! I'm driving threw there again in a few days and we are definitely going back!
