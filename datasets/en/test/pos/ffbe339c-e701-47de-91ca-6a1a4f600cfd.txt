Where can you eat at a historic building in downtown Phoenix after 12 am? At Hanny's that's where! The pizza's are out of this world with their thin crispy crust and rich cheeses that tickle the palate. If you want to have some great drinks then come here too! If it's a weekend and you're not with a group you probably want to show up early for a spot at the bar, but be sure to come either way because the staff is extremely friendly. Take it from someone that works in hospitality and sends people here on a daily/nightly basis. Hanny's is an experience where there's hipness, class, elegance, ambiance, and no feeling of regret afterwards. Regardless of you're "scene" you are sure to enjoy the environment here.
