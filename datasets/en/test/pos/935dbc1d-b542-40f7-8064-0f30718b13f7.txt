My husband and I bought a Kia Forte in March 2010 from Salazar Kia and had such a good experience (which was a total surprise to us because in the past car buying had been painful, at best) that when I was in the market for a new car this year we went back.  Salazar Kia has given us truly two of the best car buying experiences in our lives.  They don't play games with the price, their customer service is amazing and Mike Bergesson, our sales person, was fabulous.  I wouldn't hesitate to go back to Salazar for my next vehicle purchase or to recommend them to a friend.
