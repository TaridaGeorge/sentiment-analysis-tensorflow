The wingless buffalo dip is amazing. I have never found anything close to it anywhere. I always order it with veggies. So good you will be licking the bowl! The salmon salad is also excellent. I have taken my kids, clients and had a girls night out. It is the perfect place for all and Maizie's has become a regular hang out for me. Be aware that Mondays are crazy. I would avoid going there. They have a special cheap burger that draws crowds pay the extra for another night and enjoy the true vibe of Maizie's. 
Fabulous wine list with decent prices.
