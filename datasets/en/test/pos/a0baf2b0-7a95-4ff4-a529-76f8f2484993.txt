Thai Basil is my go-to carry-out Thai place. I love the green curry. Mmmm. Green Curry.....
The staff is very friendly. They don't just say trite things when they talk to you. They are definitely interested in getting to know their patrons. That makes a big difference to me!
The food is always, always fresh. I love how the carrots are scalloped, and obviously never frozen. Fresh green beans, jiminey, I could go on and on!
You can't go wrong here. It is a chain restaurant, but the owners have made it their own. I love to go here. 
Can't go wrong!
