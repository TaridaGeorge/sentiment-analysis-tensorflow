omg! i love this new roller coaster...i mean train. its so much fun. be prepared to move a little if your on the route with curves and not in a seat. i'm an avid roller coaster fan, and hate the fact that there aren't any in town worth talking about, (encanto park has no hills). this is the most beautiful thing to come to phoenix in a long time. in not sad to see the lanes along central filled with metal, eliminating the left turns all together in some parts. as the train is so supper dupper i love it! it's only $2.50 for an all day pass too! just make sure your on it for home before 11am or you'll be left to fend your own ride. people watching is fun on the train too. don't get so caught up or you might miss your stop.
