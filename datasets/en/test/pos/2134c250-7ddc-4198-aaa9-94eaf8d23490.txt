Had dinner last night.  I have eaten at Roaring Fork many times in the past and this is the first review I have written for them.
Everything was just wonderful.  To start with we had fresh guacamole, chips and great margaritas.  The entrees we're amazing....I had fresh halibut and my husband had a huge ny steak.  The fish was wonderful and the steak had the best flavor and cooked just right.  The Green Chili Mac and Cheese was a stand out.
Our server Matt was great and the manager Ivars is just the nicest host.  The chef Brian H. Even came by our table.
It just made for a very enjoyable dinning experience.
Can't wait until we can go again!
