Great movie selection, old stuff you'd never find elswhere. Plus they get all the new releases in  and have a tons of copies. Prices rule and the people there are full of good tips on movies, something that's going extinct in this business. They solved my problem of having to stream the first 15 minutes of movies on netflix to see what's good or not!
