We now live in Vegas.  We have searched all over Vegas for Persian or Middle Eastern food that matches the quality and taste of Pars to no avail.  

The Gyros at Pars are the best I've had and all of the other dishes are very authentic.  We have never waited for a meal or had a server that is anything other than very polite.  Even the tea is exceptional.  

The dinner prices are fair considering the portion size (yes, you can easily get two meals out of each plate unless you are accustomed to overeating).  Their lunches are huge and very fairly priced.
