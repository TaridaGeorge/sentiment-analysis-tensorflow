There's not a whole lot to say except this store Rocks!  Tony, who helped us on Sunday afternoon, was incredibly knowledgable. He took the time to fit everyone with the proper helmet and inserts.  It was the equivalent of a custom fitting. He could have easily "upsold" , but didn't.  When it comes to helmets for quads, I will never go anywhere else.
