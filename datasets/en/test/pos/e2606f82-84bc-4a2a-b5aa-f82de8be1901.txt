Ted's is simply amazing. I love a charbroiled hot dog & Ted's is one of the few places you can get one in the valley. I wish they had more around town, but it is well worth the drive. Their mustard is something that dreams are made of... horseradishy yellow. They have all the great toppings to make a superior dog, cheese, chile, sauerkraut, mustard!, pickles, etc . Although I am not a fan of their chile, but to each there own. Also, their onion rings are delish, fresh and hand battered. Ted's is definitely a place to stop every now and then... or everyday.
