Rosati's is a Chicagoland staple. I used to order from Rosati's about every week around the mid 80's until they went downhill. Twenty years later I find out that the owner's from the Rosati's I used to patronize moved to Arizona. Ok - that explains everything.

We ordered a couple of large pizzas for delivery yesterday when we had some friends over. We ordered a thin crust sausage, onion and greenpepper which was delicious and a half pepperoni and half vegetarian which I was told was excellent. They even delivered on time, we asked for a 6pm delivery and they delivered. Best pizza in the Biltmore area.
