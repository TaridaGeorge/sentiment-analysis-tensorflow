I got stranded in AZ last week after missing my connecting flight.  I was so upset.  They gave me a voucher for a discounted room and I picked up the phone and just called the first hotel on the list since Aloft starts with A I called them.  They had openings and had  sent a van to pick me up.  WOW Loved the rooms, very chic, very comfortable.  and they hooked me up with free bottles of water and a tooth brush and tooth paste.  I wish I was there longer than 10 hours it was very nice.  I will look into staying at one in the near future.
