AAAAAAAH. I love the margherita pizza (damnit...now I'm hungry). I will eat the whole damn pie by myself. There is no pizza crust like pizzeria bianco's. Ive always been a pizza crust aficionado. (seriously....always saved them for last, since I was a kid). Now I get to enjoy that EXTRA because of how good their pies are. Also recommend the speidini. Very few things can tempt me to eat meat...prosciutto wrapped around fontina is one of them. EVERYTHING about this place and its food is fantastic.
