I LOVE TOTAL WINE SO HARD IT HURTS. OUCH. IT HURTS. SEE? :) I've been to a few locations here in the valley, all of which have been amazing, this one just seems to tickle me in that right spot.. Their staff is a bit friendlier, and outgoing than the other's I've been to, and can talk you into buying just about anything.. SUCH a good thing, when it comes to value priced booze!
