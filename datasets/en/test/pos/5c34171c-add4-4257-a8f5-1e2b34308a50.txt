"Happiness is finding two olives in your Martini when you're hungry"
Johnny Carson.

Short and sweet ; )

Four ahi tacos 6. HH kicked up a notch.

Seared ahi tuna, citrus spice, fire roasted pico de gallo, guacamole, a slight fistful of daikon sprouts served on jicama tortillas. Botany in cooking at it's best.

Dirty gin martini, three queen olives.

A brilliant neighborhood hang.
