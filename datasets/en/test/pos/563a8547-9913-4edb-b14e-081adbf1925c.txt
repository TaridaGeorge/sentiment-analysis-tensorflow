Dear San Diego Padres,

You're always a great Spring Training team! Especially when you practice and play at the PSC. The hours of pre-game up-close access to throwing, batting practice, fielding drills and such is AWESOME!! Players are friendly, attentive to the kids (and sometimes even pesky adults) and the complex lends itself well to having a great Spring Training experience.
The games are played in the 'oldest' park on the Arizona Spring Training circuit, but the venue is great and we love that berm tickets are still rock-bottom priced. Good grub and beverages make this an annual trek worth making.

However, why do you suck so bad during the regular season? sniff sniff...

Love,
Padres Fans
