Never before in my life have I tasted breakfast this good. The place is small (very small), expect to wait around an hour on the weekends.

Once you get in here try the "Hog and Chick", I suggest you get the hash browns over the potatoes, and you MUST MUST MUST try the bacon! (if you're a vegan - let it go for one day!) 

Their waffles are to die for too.

Another 100 places like this and Downtown Phoenix will be THE place to live!!!
