This place is the best American buffet in the phoenix area.  The quality of food you get here is comparable to good wedding food, fathers/mothers day buffet, or other banquet type events.  All this for only $15 which includes a drink and a wide selection of desserts.  

I go here once a month and the staff is always friendly and very  professional
