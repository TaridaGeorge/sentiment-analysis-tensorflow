I have to start off by saying that this is not the best buffet that I have ever tried; for that you would have to go to Vegas.  That said, I doubt that you will find a better buffet in the Phoenix area.  We ate outside with a nice view of the nearby mountains at sunset.  The food quality was very good, the variety was excellent, and the service prompt.  The desert bar is on par with the best I've seen anywhere.  For what you get, I found the pricing very reasonable.  Overall a very good experience.
