You will have to pay a lot to hang here, but if you are in Scottsdale, definitely one of the top places to stay!  The pool is great, and the constant ice water, great food service is great.  Its near impossible to get a room that has a great mountain view and even if you do you are quite a ways away from the pool.  The casitas close to the pool are really  nice, like little condos, and most have nice sliding doors out to the pool area.  The grounds are gorgeous and the place really is worth it.  Be sure and use the hotel's car service to take you up to the hiking trail.  Great Scottsdale Haven.
