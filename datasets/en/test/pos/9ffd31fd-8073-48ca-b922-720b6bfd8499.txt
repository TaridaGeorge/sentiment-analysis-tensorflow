I discovered this place when I was having a dinner party and wanted to serve sushi.  It's a great ethnic supermarket and is very reasonably priced.  They sell pretty much everything I need from serving pieces to beer.  They have a great Sake collection as you would imagine.  They also have an extensive selection of frozen foods and some other regional selections.

They also have a refrigerator section with fresh sushi, seaweed salad, etc.  

I recommend it for a quick lunch if you work or live in the area and also if you are an adventurous cook.  Fun!
