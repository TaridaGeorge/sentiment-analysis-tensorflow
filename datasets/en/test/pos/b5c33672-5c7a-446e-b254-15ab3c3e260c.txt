I went here finally!  I have been going to another salon for a long time but they were rude to my daughter and nieces about doing their nails, so we went here.  THey were able to help us right away and seemed to have competitive prices.  I would decently come here again, but it doesn't seem like there is anything "special" about this location, just a normal nail salon.  :)
