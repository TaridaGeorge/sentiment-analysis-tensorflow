I grew up in San Diego and never figured I would ever eat sushi east of I-5!  I moved to Goodyear last year and went to Tomo for the first time about 6 months ago.... well i'm now hopelessly addicted to their "Superman"  my boyfriend comes out from Cali about once a month and he insists that we go directly from the airport to Tomo.... The service is Great everyone there is super friendly and even on a busy Friday night you never sit with an empty glass.  This place is truely a Gem for the west valley!
