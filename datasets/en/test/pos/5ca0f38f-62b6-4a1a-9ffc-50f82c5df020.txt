I have been here a few times for both lunch and dinner....and I will keep coming back. Its in a great location to have dinner and a movie, since the Cine Capri is a stones throw away.
Their menu is the only one that I have seen that starts listing the desserts first!! HELLO - I think they are onto something here!
My recommendations: 
the Blackend Fish Sandwich
The Mahi Mahi
Rainbow Trout (yeah I like my fish...living in the desert!)
Parmesan Filet

The service has always been great. I really like the interior  - wood from floor to celiing and the lighting is a good mood-setter.
Thumbs Up for me!!!
