I love this place. It is "My neighborhood Thai restaurant". They have amazing happy hour specials (and reverse happy hour later on), I love the chicken pad thai, love the spring rolls, love the thai iced tea. 
I've never had bad service (and I've been a LOT). I've always found them to be friendly and quick.
