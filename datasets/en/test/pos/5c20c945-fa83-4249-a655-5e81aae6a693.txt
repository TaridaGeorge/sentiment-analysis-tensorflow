This is a great whole foods in a great area. Like most whole foods, it is kept extremely clean and extremely fresh. The staff is very friendly and on my first visit I was very surprised that 3 different employees greeted me when walking in the door.

Plenty of parking outfront of this location and a few tables to sit outside and have lunch. They are a specialty store, so in my opinion worth the money.
