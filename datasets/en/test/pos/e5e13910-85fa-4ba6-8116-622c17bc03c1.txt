This is a nice Home Depot. It's exactly like the one at 90th & Shea in N Scottsdale. I'm not sure why I said that, but they're almost identical, except the garden center is on the RH side @ Riverview.

Actually, everything is on the RH side here in Mesa. So don't try nothing funny.

Interestingly- this store seems to capture shoppers from all different demographics.  Apparently, it is the only home improvement store around except for Lowes in S Scottsdale- so you get people that would normally not venture into Mesa, "slumming" at Home Depot. kinda funny.

Other than that, it's a Home Depot.
