I think this is my new favorite Italian restaurant!  The service and food were amazing!!! We had a 3 course meal and it was all perfect.  I loved the calamari (not overly fried or breaded).  The manager had a great knowledge of the wines they had available and the wine list was also impressive.  I have not tried their 'backdoor pizza'  but I intend on trying it soon!  If it is anything like the food in the restaurant, I am sure it will be awesome.
