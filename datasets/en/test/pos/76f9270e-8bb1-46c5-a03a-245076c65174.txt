This is my favorite bar in the entire world.  While in college at ASU, we found a mathematical truth:  No matter where you were in Tempe and where you were heading, Casey's was always in the middle.

I really like that it doesn't cater to one crowd, but instead welcomes all.  It goes through phases with different groups, but at the end of the day this is just one of the most comfortable places to knock back a pint or 5.
