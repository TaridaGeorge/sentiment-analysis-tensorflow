Very cool bar with very nice staff and servers.  The beer selection is huge so there will always be some new beer to try every time you go.

I only had a chance to have a burger for food, but if it is any indicator of the rest of the food they make, their food is delicious and a steal for the price.

All in all I would say this is an outstanding bar whether you want to go and have a few drinks hanging out at the bar or enjoy a delicious dinner at any number of tables or some more private booths.
