Anyone who tells you this place isn't amazing is cu cu for coco puffs. The owners are equally amazing. They will remember you and tell you amazing stories and the cocktails are always amazing. My favorite is the lychejito made from lychee infused vodka made in house. The spring roll bar is amazing and they always change it up for me if I ask for substitutions. There really isn't anything on the menu that isn't good they offer everything from Vietnamese sammies to amazing clay pots. I always go for the soup but that hasn't stopped me from trying everything else. Everything is always fresh and delicious. Their happy hour is awesome as well.
