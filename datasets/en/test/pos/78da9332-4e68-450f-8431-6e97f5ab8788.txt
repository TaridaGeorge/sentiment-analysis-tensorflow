I loved everything about my experience at Firebirds!  I was with a large group that sat in a private room and we had a pre-fixed menu to choose from that was very tasty.
Started with an appetizer of chips, salsa and really good guacamole. 2nd we all had a caesar salad and then I ordered the cilantro chicken that came with some amazing parmesan mashed potatoes and tasty saut√©ed squash.

The chicken was flavorful, plentiful and moist......what more could you ask for.

The service was outstanding and very helpful even with the set-up.

Thanks Firebirds for doing a stand up job for a dear friends birthday celebration!
