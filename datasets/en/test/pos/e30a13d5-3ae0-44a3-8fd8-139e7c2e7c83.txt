I am a local event planner. I toured the space and was excited to find just how great the view was from the 2nd floor balcony. Granted, the first floor (street level) also makes for great people watching. There is room for a couple hundred people (total), and I would highly recommend the space for a private meeting or social gathering. Note: there is a pretty cool fireplace and furniture set-up on the 2nd floor that deserves kudos.  It may be a little hot for summer use, but that still leaves 9 months out of the year to use the space.
