This is a terrific independent hardware store, a rare gem in the world of Home Depot and Lowe's.  They have a massive selection of hard-to-find fasteners and bits that no big box retailer could touch, and the staff is friendly and helpful.  I just went in there for some obscure parts for a project I was doing and they were able to find me everything I needed for under $20.

Keep up the good work fellas!
