What a great sports bar!!! Terrific place to watch all of the World Cup games. Super venue, ample parking, great staff and engaging patrons.
The breakfast burrito is awesome.
Be sure to sit down with and get to know the propietor, Keith. An outstanding guy. Personally sees to it that you are having a good time and not wanting for anything.
If you are still searching for the sports bar that you have always wanted to find ... look no further. Go to the 16th Street Sports Bar.
