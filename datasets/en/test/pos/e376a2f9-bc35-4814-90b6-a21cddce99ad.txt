Just had a great experience at this location. Called before hand to make sure I didn't need an appt. I got there and was immeadiately greeted by someone which is always nice. I asked for The Works (haircut, shave and shampoo) which was a reasonably priced $45.  I was quickly helped by Jack who was obviously a very experienced barber and expert in his field. I had probably the best experience of getting haircut I have ever had and the best strait razor shave I have ever had! 

The environment is great, old fashioned barber chairs, TV's at every station, pool table in the back and great customer service. Im glad to see that the traditional barber shop for men and boys is not gone. No "stylists" and $200 haircuts here, just good ol' fashion quality, attention to detail and service. 

I will definitely be coming back!
