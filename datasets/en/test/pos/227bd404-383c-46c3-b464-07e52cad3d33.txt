Food is great.  Really good deal, lots of tasty food for a great price.  My favorite combo is the Pulled Pork sandwich with side of Mac & Cheese & Coleslaw & Kool Aid.  Founded by former NFL & ASU Football player they know how to barbecue I truly recommend everyone trying it out.  The atmosphere is not that inviting yet the food is worth staying and will get you to come back I can guarantee,
