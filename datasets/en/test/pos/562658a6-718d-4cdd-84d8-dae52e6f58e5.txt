PHENOMENAL place for Chinese cuisine. The portions are HUGE! My fiance and I always only order one thing and share it, and still always have leftovers. The menu prices are very reasonable. Including tip, we usually don't spend more than $15 for the both of us for dinner. They are very personable and attentive to your needs. I love that it is a very dainty, and has a very laid back atmosphere. The lemon chicken is our favorite!! :) They are also very kid friendly. We have an 18 month old son who always leaves a nice pile of rice on the floor every time we leave lol, but they love him! Highly recommend!
