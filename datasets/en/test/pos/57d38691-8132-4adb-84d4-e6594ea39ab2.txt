I went inside today to pick up our pizzas (usually hubby makes the trip) and I have to add...what a nice place!!  Very comfortable, family friendly vibe!  Like a great neighborhood mom/pop restaurant should be. :)  Add the fact that we can get good pizza while our daughter can enjoy a few slices of good gluten free pizza = 5 stars all the way. :)
