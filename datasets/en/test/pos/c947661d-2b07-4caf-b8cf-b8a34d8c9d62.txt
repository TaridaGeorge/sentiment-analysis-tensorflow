Had the pork porterhouse on my most recent visit.  Stupendous.  The green chile pork is damn good, the salmon is great (and I normally am not a fish-eater), all of the sides I've had have been ridiculously good.  Not outrageously expensive, but not cheap, either.  After some bad experiences at Roaring Fork (years ago, when they would be pertinent to mention here), I was fully expecting to be treated rudely and with disdain, but that hasn't happened here - the service has been phenomenal.  That's actually my favorite part about this place - it's not stuffy at all, but the service is akin to what you'd find in a more traditionally uppity restaurant - ably dancing between cloying and laissez-faire - in other words, there when you need them and non-existant when they should be.  I love this place.
