I recently moved in across the street from Joe's, and have been walking over every Saturday morning. I get the border omelet and potatoes everytime, so I can't speak for anything else on the menu, but it's good for what it is. Joe usually stops by the tables and talks to everyone which I really like. The guy knows how to run a business. Coffee is good too.
