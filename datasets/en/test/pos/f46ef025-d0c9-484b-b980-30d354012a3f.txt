YUM!

I have recently become a vegetarian (NO MEAT!) and really enjoy having a strictly vegetarian eatery within a half hour drive.

The food here is amazing & makes me come back for more.

Anyone who likes good food or is trying to cut down their meat consumption, should definitely check out the Green Vegetarian Restaurant.
