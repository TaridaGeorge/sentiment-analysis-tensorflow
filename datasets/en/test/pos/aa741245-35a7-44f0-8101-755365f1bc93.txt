OMG this is the coolest store I have ever been in....They are actually a family business run byt the original family!  I am going to a party, not really excited about dressing up and then I walked into Easley's and instead of a chore, it became so much fun!  They have the costumes, the wigs, the shoes, I had so much fun and I can't wait to go to another party now.  I will never dread being invited to a dress up party again as long as I can go to Easley's.....they are the best!!!
