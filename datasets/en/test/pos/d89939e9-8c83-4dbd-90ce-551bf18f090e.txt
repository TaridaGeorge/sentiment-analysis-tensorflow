Came here while on vacation, based on the reviews. Overall the food was great, but we developed a few words of wisdom on what to order - 

The whole wheat pancakes and the challah french toast were incredible. The pancakes nearly floated off the plate, and the challah and candied nuts on the french toast made it taste like the perfect middle ground between brunch and desert. 

I didn't eat the omelet with salmon or the honeydew (omelets come with fruit) but was told they were great too. 

The only downside were the wild mushroom omelets and the potatoes it came with - they lacked seasoning. If they had any, we would be giving the restaurant 5 stars. The salmon omelet came with the same potatoes, but she opted for the hashbrowns which were awesome (I wish I had such foresight...)!
