I've been to Ticoz several times now and finally need to give this place the kudos it deserves.

Great food, unique cocktails, and outstanding service is what earned Ticoz 5 stars in my book. When we were first seated last night, we were accidentally overlooked by the serving staff for about 8 minutes. The host forgot to inform the server he had a new table. As a result, we received two free drinks and around 7 apologies from various staff. We weren't even waiting that long.

I had the paella, which was great, and my wife had the vegetarian tamales. Both were outstanding. 

Happy hour deals are fantastic for drinks and apps.

I will be going to Ticoz more often.
