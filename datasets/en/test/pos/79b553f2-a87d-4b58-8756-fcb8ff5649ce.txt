These guys really are Woohoo! As good as it gets! This is the second time I have had my car in there for work. Honest fair assesment and have saved me considerable money over other estimates both times. They give you the real story and will tell you what needs to be done right away and what can wait a little while so you can budget your repairs. Thanks again Steve and everyone else at NOE for fair and honest work!
