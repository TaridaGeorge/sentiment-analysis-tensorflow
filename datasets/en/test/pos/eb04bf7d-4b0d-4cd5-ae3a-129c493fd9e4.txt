Awesome food! Possibly the best restaurant fare I have ever eaten of any cuisine. Had the mixed market greens salad, rack of lamb, grits, mashed potatoes, green chili macaroni and cheese, and boysenberry bread pudding for dessert. The tastes of all were just intense and pleasing. Place has an upscale feel to it, but the food is down-to-earth and high-quality. Wished I lived in Phoenix for a go-back real soon. 
Will have to wait until my next trip up. Will probably have to make sure I have reservations, though. Very popular place, it appears.
