Been to this location a couple times now and always get the Cheef sandwich. There is no way you'll find a better sandwich for $6.50. The thing is huge and the Italian beef is tender and tasty. Gotta get it with the hot peppers and au jus. Dump that juicy goodness on there and bust out the fork and knife cause you aint picking that bad boy up. I keep saying I want to try their pizza but I have to get that damn Cheef everytime. They even screwed up my order last time (twice) but I gon't care. That sandwich is frickin good.
