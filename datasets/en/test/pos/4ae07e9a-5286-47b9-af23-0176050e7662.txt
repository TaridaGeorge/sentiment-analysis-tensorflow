AWESOME! This place is now my number 1 burger place to go to in Arizona.  
I used a groupon here and thought it was going to be just another burger place, but
it wasn't. The hamburgers must be made with premium beef because you can 
definitely taste the difference.  The onion strings are delicious. 
I would say it is about $15 - $20 bucks per person,  but well worth it.
