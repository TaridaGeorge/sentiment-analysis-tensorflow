This is our favorite Thai place between Central Phoenix and Chandler.   The serving staff isn't dripping with warmth, but they're attentive and pretty quick.   We've been there half a dozen times and haven't made it too deep into the menu yet, but so far our favorites are the Pad gra prow and the Massaman curry.  And the Golden Curry Puffs are delightfully different and delicious appetizers.  We took some Thai food lovers here from out of town, and they agreed, it was as good or better as any Thai they'd had in a variety of cities.
