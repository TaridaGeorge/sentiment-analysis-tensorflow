I called this business at end of day yesterday explaining my car problem. They said they were a couple days behind but if I came early in the morning the following day they could check out my car. He said they'd either fix it on the spot or give me an assessment of how much it would cost to fix. I showed up the next day and was out in 5 minutes. Not only was I greeted right away but my car was fixed for a very nominal fee. Great service!
