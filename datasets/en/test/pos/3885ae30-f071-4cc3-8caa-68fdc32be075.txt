Absolutely addicted! We have now began making this our weekly lunch stop (sometimes 3/4 times a week shh) I always get a calzone. I had the pizza and salad the first time and really enjoyed it! But the calzone is my love I get the plain calzone cheese, sauce, and I add only one ingredient PINEAPPLE! LOVE LOVE LOVE!  Everytime we walked in i pick up and menu set it down and get my regular. Pretty bad when the gal at the counter knows my order :) We have yet to be let down by this place! Our whole work is addicted, I cant wait til we move closer, but my pants im sure can wait! ;)
