My husband's family has been using Exclusive Paint and Auto Body for years although when a nasty hail storm hit the Scottsdale area in the Fall of 2010 (just months before our wedding) damaging our SUV (which was only a few months) we called Tracy and his team. They got the repairs done in a timely and professional manner bringing our vehicle back to the pristine condition it was in before that vicious hail storm hit. Tracy is a true professional and really cares about his customers. We're grateful to have them if we ever need them again - although we hope we won't.... :)
