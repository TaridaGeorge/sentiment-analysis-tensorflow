Officially a fan. I wasn't able to review the place fully because I hadn't tried the food yet, but last night I made a delish mix at Genghis. 
Marinated steak chased by a few seasonings, and that yummy teriyaki, dragon, and asian sauces with Udon noodles...I think I'm drooling writing about this right now. It was seriously soo good and fresh nothing frozen. 

My buddy and I sat at the bar watched the game, enjoyed great food with good convo and sipped out countless mimosa's. Definitely a great way to spend a Sunday.
