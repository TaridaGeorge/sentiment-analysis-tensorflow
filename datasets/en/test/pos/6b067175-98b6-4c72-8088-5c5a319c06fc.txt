Great place to stay and the staff is the best. Now I am not just saying that lightly. they are wonderful. It was 108 when I arrived and the staff offered me a bottle of water. they made a wonderful recommendation for dinner and offered a shuttle. Yest they still have a shuttle to the airport and willing to drive you to restaurants. great location and easy to get to.
