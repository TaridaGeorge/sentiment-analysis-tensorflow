Authentic Mexican fast food in Phoenix. Checked in a Radison hotel near Airpor before my morning flight, wanted some real Mexican before heading back east. Found this great place thanks to Yelp
Place is kind of scary outside, but people there super friendly and great authentic mexican tacos. No tex mex here!
