Every sushi place I eat at is compared to Ah Hai. They are the best, price- and taste-wise! Whenever I try new things I'm never disappointed, but I love to stick to my beloved favorite Cotton roll and miso soup. My friends love it and my family does too. Plus it's so close to us! Cute decor and Yuki is great. If you've never gone here, try it, you won't regret it!
