Wife and I stayed here the other day, and even though we had to leave early, it was a great experience. The bathrooms were amazing! The steak I had at their restaurant was pretty good too. Only downside was the TV. Seemed like a 28 inch crt style tv, but I wasn't there to watch television so it wasn't a big deal.
Guy at the steak house suggested a great place to stargaze as well.
