I am not often in this area as a general rule... but my daughter live pretty close, so I always make a detour into Dutch Bros Coffee! 

I just filled up my first punch card so now I get a FREE coffee next visit! Yay!

I always get the hot Latte Breve... so much BETTER than Starbucks!

Highly Recommended!
