I've been to a few different Zipp's location and this is my favorite location to sit outside on the patio. If you like sports and bar food, then my friend, you have found your place. Lots of TV's, lots of beer (heck yes, I'll take the 32 oz one, duh!), and wings! Their golden style wings are so incredibly delicious that when I'm watching sports at home, I'm wishing I had a dozen of Zipps wings in front of me!
