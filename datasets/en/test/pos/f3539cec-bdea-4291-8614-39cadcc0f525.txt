Yippee, an Ace Hardware that opens at 6am M-S (and 8am on Sun). I love Ace Hardware and everyone of them have very helpful, easy-to-find employees. When I don't feel like fighting the endurance contest of negotiating a big box hardware store, Ace Hardware is my go-to solution.
Parking is easy, right at the front door. The product selection is excellent. Getting out of the AZ summer heat before 7am is priceless!
