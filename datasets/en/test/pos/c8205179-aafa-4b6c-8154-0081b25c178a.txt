Been here a few times and have not had a bad experience.  Very good selection of beer.  The menu is limited and the servings are small but everything is delicious.  The one can't miss item: bacon wrapped dates.

I actually dropped in before a Suns game and in the spirit of the upcoming event had a hotdog.  Not your backyard-barbecue-type flair, but great nonetheless.   

Get there early, as others have noted, because seating is limited and naturally goes quickly.
