I remember first going to Sun Camera when I was a freshman in high school.
Eager to start my first photography class ever, I bought a Minolta X-700 SLR....still continuing with my passion for photography, today I shoot mostly digital, but I still (when I feel like shooting film) use that camera.

The employees here are all extremely helpful and really nice. I come here every so often still to get my Ilford B&W 400 speed film. They have a decent selection of films and a pretty vast selection of cameras for those who are looking to buy new or used. 

I love this shop.
