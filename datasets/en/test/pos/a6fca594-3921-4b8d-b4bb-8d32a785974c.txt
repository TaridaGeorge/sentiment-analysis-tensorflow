I got a coupon for this new salon so I stopped in.  I had a great experience.  Colorful Nails is running great specials right now--$15 for a pedicure, $25 for a mani/ped, $6 for a brow wax.  I'm not sure how long the specials will last (I was in on 5/21), but it is a great way to try the place out.  The service was excellent-Cindy did a really good job and was friendly.  She really took her time on my brows and they look great for her efforts.  I'd recommend this salon to anyone--can't wait to go back.
