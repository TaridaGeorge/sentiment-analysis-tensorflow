Love the food, the bar, and the small intimate dining room. I prefer to order food at the bar and watch the cooking. However, if your with more then four people, the dining area is also very nice. Unlike the rude bartenders at their sister (brother) restaurant, The Rokerij, service is very pleasant at Dick's Hideaway. Nice little place to dine and have a drink. Again great food!
