This is my favorite barbecue joint in the Valley. I'm not much of a meat eater, but I can't resist the BBQ at Joe's. I love the pulled pork sandwich. The barbecue sauce is phenomenal and will have you lapping up every last bite. The mac 'n' cheese, which comes with a crusted topping, is to-die-for and makes a wonderful side. The desserts here are also awesome. Be sure to try the rootbeer or the lemon cake.
