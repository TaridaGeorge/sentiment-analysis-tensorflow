My wife took me here for my birthday last night.  Lush green outdoor environment.  Charming cheese plate appetizer with yummy apricot and fig preserves.  Tasty duck breast with wonderful vegetables and the dark meat also.  Delightful crab capellini.  You have to see the gondolino dessert to believe it.  Creme brule definitely floats their boat.  Carafe of sparkling cava, as well as a Zinfandel with the duck. It was all topped off with the complimentary gondola ride with a singing gondolier.  What's not to like?
