I really enjoyed my experience with the Embassy Suites. It was in a great location. Right next to the Biltmore Fashion Park, a movie theater, tons of good restaurants, and not far from Scottsdale. Our room was very roomy and clean. They had a free breakfast in the morning which included made to order omlets, fruit, bagels, etc... The hotel also had an Omaha Steakhouse ajoined which delivered to your room. They had free drinks from 5 - 7 pm. The customer service was great. For $125 we couldn't have asked for anything better.
