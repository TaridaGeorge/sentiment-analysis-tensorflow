Our 74 yr old neighbor lady "Lavonne" recommended this restaurant to us! Lavonne is a born and raised "Arizonan" (not to many of those around). She has never steered us wrong and has gave us many great restaurant recommendations and, this restaurant is I believe the best she has ever recommended to us.

 Energized atmosphere, great food, excellent service and price is just fine for a steak restaurant.  The cheesy garlic bread is the best I have ever had. We will go back here just like Lavonne and her late husband again and again and again - and next time we will bring Lavonne who has not been back since her husband died 4yrs ago!
