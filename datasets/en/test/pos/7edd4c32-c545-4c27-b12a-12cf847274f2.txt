Known for their steakhouses, the Mastro Group's seafood house in upscale Kierland Commons offers an overwhelming choice of seafood dishes...in addition to their extensive menu they had about 10 specials on the night I ate there.  I opted for the surf and turf...a 12oz filet and "huge" alaskan king crab legs.  The filet was to die for (one of the best steaks I've ever eaten) and the crab legs were awesome.  They have an excellent wine list and a hoppin' bar scene.  The excellent food does come at a high price $$$$.
