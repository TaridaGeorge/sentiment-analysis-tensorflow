Its sushi so its going to be a bit pricey but WELL worth it!

There are various rolls which are all delicious and like another reviewer mentioned each unique in their own way. My FAVORITE is the spicy seared albacore and Kristy roll. Oh LORD they are to DIE for!! 

This establishment also serves chicken teriyaki which is served with white rice and cabbage salad with that incredible "mystery" dressing. You know what I am talking about right? That orange/pinky colored dressing that ALL teriyaki joints serve. Oh gosh, I just LOVE that dressing.

Ok, anyway...back to the review.....its a great place for two to dine OR for a smallish group. The staff is super helpful and friendly and the food is prepared and served VERY quickly.

I'm pleased to see more sushi restaurants creeping up in the WEST valley and this one is no exception.
