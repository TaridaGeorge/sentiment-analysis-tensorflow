God, I love Cracker and Co. Coma-inducing sumptuousness. On those rare occasions that I order something other than a skillet breakfast, I am always rewarded - I've never had anything that wasn't tasty and cooked with apparent love.  This is some seriously delicious food.

My only complaint is that their hours are too short.
