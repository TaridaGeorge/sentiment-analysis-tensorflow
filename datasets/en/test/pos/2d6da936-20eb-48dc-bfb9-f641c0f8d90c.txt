Think hot pocket but way better. I tried the cottage pie pasty. It had ground beef, onions, mashed potatoes l, and a few other goodies. The pastry shell was very flavorful. Very interesting atmosphere. Very poorly light, tatted cooks, and 80's metal music blaring. Wanted to try the dessert but the pasty was very filling.
