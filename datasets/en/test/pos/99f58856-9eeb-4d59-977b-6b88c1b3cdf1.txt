4 Peaks, thank you for existing. You serve me delicious beer and food that would stand alone as 5 star class. Your salmon BTL makes me question my prior understanding of beautiful.  Your only flaw is a testament to your goodness, you can be a little too busy from time to time. 

You are a jewel of Tempe and I salute you. Cheers.
