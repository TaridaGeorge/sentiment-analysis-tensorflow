Superb wine selection. (try the ones on tap - Yum!)  Great deals on good beer during happy hour. ($5 mini pitchers!)
Very friendly staff, comfortable seating, clean restrooms.
Enjoyed most of the bruschetta.  The 'Butcher Board' was amazing.  Try it.
Looking forward to going back.  
Welcome to the neighborhood.  (:
