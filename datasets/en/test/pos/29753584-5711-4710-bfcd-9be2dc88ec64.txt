This store hits the nail on the head. It's a perfect blend of chic and eclectic. As an jewelry afficiando, I can honestly say their selecion is top notch. Frances is definately the place to go for unique and one of kind items. I could spend hours perusing there collection of merchandise and I always end up spending way more money that I should. On the up side I have never left there suffering from buyer's remorse.
