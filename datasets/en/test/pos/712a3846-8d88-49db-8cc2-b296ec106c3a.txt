GOOBER REALLY IS THE BEST!!  I have NEVER been disappointed.  They have lovely people who answer the phone - - they are always soo helpful (especially Patsy)!  If they don't know an answer to a question I might have, they find out the info and let me  know.  I truly believe they care!  They deliver when they say they are going to and that is nice to find a company soo dependable!    I used to go to Petsmart & Petco to get treats, food & supplements, but no more - - I just call Goober!  I cook my own food now, but supplement it with Zeal by Honest Kitchen and the next day delivery Goober provides just can't be beat!  Keep up the great work Goober!
