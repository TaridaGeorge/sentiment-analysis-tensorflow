Anything I say here will have already been said but Joe's is the best BBQ in the east valley. 

The food is great, the place is clean, seating inside or outside, their Saturday Breakfast is awesome and I don't want to get in trouble for telling you what kind of experience your mouth will have with the home made root beer. 

Lets just say if your spouse makes you feel like this root beer make your mouth feel you are one lucky person.
