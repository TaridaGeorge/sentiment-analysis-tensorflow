Some of the finest Thai food in the valley. Great service, nice environment,  wonderfully prepared food. However, I would like to quibble with a previous reviewer-- this is NOT the hottest Thai food around. It has been moderated somewhat for American tastes. (I have been to Thailand 3 times so I should know) The hottest Thai food and amazingly good as well is Thai Lahna. Espeically if Thom is cooking. 

But Malee's is excellent, excellent food. Great service. I love the place.
