The first thing I do when I walk into UO is go straight to the back.  AMAZING sales and cool stuff on sale - not just rejected stuff!
I agree - the women's selection here is better than Tempe and (I can't believe I am saying this) I actually prefer to go to the Scottsdale location.
Yes, the college kids can be irritating!  I always wear my headphones just so I don't use some strange bobble-head I find at UO to knock someone out!  "Like OH MY GOD Brittany, did you SEE anything in a size zero?"
