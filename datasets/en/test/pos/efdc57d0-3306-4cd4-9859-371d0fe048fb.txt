O'Brien Physical Therapy was fantastic. I felt like a patient, not just a number. My back has significantly improved. Patrick O'Brien was so knowledgeable and probably the best PT I have ever been to. Josh his assistant was great and so helpful. I would recommend O'Brien Physical Therapy to everyone!
