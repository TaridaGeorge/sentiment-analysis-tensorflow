Great job "quickly" re-attaching the side bumper..almost  falling off. 2 trips since he had to order the OEM small tabs. Initially went to get cost est, then nice to get a quote that was less! Confusing is walking in, receiptionist isnt always there & a salesman looks at you sideways..like why are you here?  The correct one steps in and is focused, professional.  I never use debit but was asked.
