i came her for my foreign travel immunizations.

i can't really speak about the other clinics there like STD testing, general health, etc., the foreign travel clinic was very clean, organized, and i received exceptional service.

although you don't have many options for travel immunizations, DPH is a great place to go for your needs.

i have no complaints!
