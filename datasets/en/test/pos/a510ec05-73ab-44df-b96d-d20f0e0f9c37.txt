I recently had to have an Oreder of Proctection servered on my husband.
 No only where they empathetic to my situation but they even worked on me with pricing. The serve was done in two attempts I couldnt belive it. Even the police couldnt get it done. I have already told everyone downtown to use them. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!
