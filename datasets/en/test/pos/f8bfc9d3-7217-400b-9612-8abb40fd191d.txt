It is deff a small hole in the wall place but excellent service, food and quick! My mom works at the barber/hair salon at the end of the row and I prefer Hiro to Ajo Al's any day of the week. If I take my mom to lunch it will be here. I have also been in with my kid and they don't seem to mind the mess she makes with the rice and Ikura =) thankfully she is older now O:-) They have great stuff like Toro oh yummmmm not too many places have it!! Thank you seafood sushi god's!!
