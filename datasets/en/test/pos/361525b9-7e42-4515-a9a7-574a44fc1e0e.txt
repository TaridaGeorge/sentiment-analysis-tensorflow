Oh my, the tastebuds are singing a happy tune!  Never did I think I'd eat pineapple and coconut on a hot dog or slider...it was surprisingly delicious.  I ordered an Island Dog, a Chicago Dog and three sliders hawaiian style, all with medium spice.  I am so pleased with these selections and definitely looking forward to returning.  Seriously good stuff!
