I live in the neighborhood and finally stopped by for check this updated coffee shop and I am so happy that I did. 
I had a latte with Almond Milk (yes, finally a place that has something more to offer than soy milk) which was delicious and I felt even better that knowing my dollars were going to a local business. 
Then I had to stop by today for lunch. The Le Grande Tuna sandwich was great. I had a lot of food for not a lot of $$ and it tasted great. 
I will be back and often, especially when they start serving dinner. 
Thanks 32 Shea. I am so glad that you are here.
