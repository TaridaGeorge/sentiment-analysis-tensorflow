Happy! The people who work here are super-friendly, attentive, and cook your food to order and it comes out FAST. Meals are inexpensive and I had NO issue with grease, and I ordered my hashbrowns with "the works" which included sauteed veggies and chili. The chili had a lot of meat in it, too, pretty awesome! I also had an order of biscuits and gravy and I was super-happy with that, as the biscuits were soft and chewy with just a few crunchy edges. The gravy may be a little salty for some but for me it was perfect! Even had some mystery chunks in there (sausage?) that gave the dish depth. I enjoyed it and I will be back!
