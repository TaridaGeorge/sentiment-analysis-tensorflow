Yummy!!! I am in love with paradise bakery! I could seriously war there everyday. I've had just about every one of their soups and they are all good. My favorite salads are the southwest chicken ceasar and the greek. Oh and those cookie are beyond fab. They just melt in your mouth. Two thumbs up paradise!
