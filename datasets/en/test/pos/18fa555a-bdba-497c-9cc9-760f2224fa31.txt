What a Deeee-licious find!

I was in a pinch and needed a small birthday cake, (non-grocery store made).
I spotted this place and walked in to find a girl with a big smile welcoming me in.
She informed of the freshness of these rare tasty treats. SOLD! 
Got home and was so glad I ordered from there. We devoured those tasty Bundt!
They need no fixing.
