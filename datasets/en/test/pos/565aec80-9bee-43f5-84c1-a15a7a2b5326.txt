The memorabilia here is amazing. You could spend all night trying to look at it. 

It was cool star gazing - we saw Mike Murphy leaving as we arrived (the Giants trainer who not only has his own table there, but the Pork Chops are named after him) and we also saw Gaylord Perry by the bar. 

That being said, the food is fantastic and very reasonable for a higher end steak house. 

Most of us had the same things - steaks. But we also split a rack of ribs that were surprisingly great.
