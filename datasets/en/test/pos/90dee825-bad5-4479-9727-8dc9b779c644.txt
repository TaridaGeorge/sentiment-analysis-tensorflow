This place was quite good! We went for breakfast and I ordered a mushroom and spinach omelet with potatoes, with the most amazing rosemary creme frishe (sp?). yuuummmmyy!!! My bf ordered one of the big burgers on the menu and said it was very moist but a little bland. The fries sweet potato fries were so good, especially with the creme frishe.
