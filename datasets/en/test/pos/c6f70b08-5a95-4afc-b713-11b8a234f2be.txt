So this is a little secret i'm gonna blow! Toast was soooo amazing! located on 7th st just past Thomas, on East side of street. The food was out of this world. I had an delicious smoked salmon sandwich on ciabatta, and my friend had an egg and veggie sandwich with cheese.  The coffee is great served in Big mugs, and the staff is so enjoyable! I recommend this restaurant to everyone, meat lovers or vegetarians, all will like! Yummy!!!!! You must go! DO IT!
