Since when did Whole Foods look like a snapshot of San Francisco's Market Place near Pier 39? I walked in and was impressed! They've got a juice shop, a bar, and a mini place to order some delish meals! When I lived in SF, I went to the Whole Foods in Noe Valley, and this one is by far more impressive! I'm so shocked! Although Whole Foods is expensive, what other place will give you ice for your recently purchased salmon? The cash register lady gave me tons of ice for my produce and salmon due to Az's 100+ degree heat. It's far, but I'll have to consider coming here as a restaurant with friends in the future =]
