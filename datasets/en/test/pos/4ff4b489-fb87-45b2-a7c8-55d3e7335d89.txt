We stopped by based on Yelp reviews about a month ago. We loved this place, it's got a real great feel, from the friendly staff who are passionate about their food and explain the process, offer samples to the fact that they clearly are swedes. The food was excellent. Our entrees did not come out together, but the staff explained that they bring the food out as it's ready, and since they do as much as possible from scratch, the dishes have different preparation time. Having all the food at the same time is nice, but I'll take this authentic style over heat and serve mass productions.
The food and staff rate 5 stars. The only downsides to me, were the Ikea-style plastic furniture and coffee in styrofoam cups - a little investment on both would make this an absolute solid five-star bistro!
