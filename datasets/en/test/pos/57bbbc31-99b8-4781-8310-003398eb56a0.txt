Fogo de Chao has the best meat I have ever tasted, hands down!  

The salad bar has some really great items, especially the potato salad.  The service is amazing, which makes the entire experience that much better.  I would highly recommend anything with "sirloin" in the name, which I think far outweighs any of the other amazing offerings, even the filet.  They also have the best sausage I have ever tasted.  

I was skeptical about the fried bananas the first time I went, but by the end of the meal had tried them, and they are amazing.  As a bonus, after eatin way, way more meat than any human ought, they make your belly feel great! 

It is a little pricey, but if you go for lunch it is roughly half the price of dinner, with exactly the same food and service.  

What a great invention, Brazil!
