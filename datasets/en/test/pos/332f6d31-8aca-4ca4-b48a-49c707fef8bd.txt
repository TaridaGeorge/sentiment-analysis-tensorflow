The workers there are very helpful and sweet. They have a huge selection of saltwater taffy and sugar free. There bulk selection is awesome. Love the fact that everything is wrapped. Nice Pezz area too. Prices are higher the gas stations but it's a candy store not a gas station so understand able. They are my favorite out of all the candy stores I have been to. And the prices are better too. I recommend checking in if you have foursquare. Best place EVER.
