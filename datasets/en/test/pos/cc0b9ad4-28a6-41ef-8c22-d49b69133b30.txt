5 stars primarily due to our individual server, John Auer. He was personable, friendly, expressed interest in us, and bantered with our kiddos.

Food way above average, he even asked if we wanted an extra appetizer that was made free of charge (spare ribs, yum) We split the duck and enjoyed the tenderness. Great strong drink gulped - mai tai

Love the ambiance & atomosphere. You'd think being next to ASU that if would be filled with a bunch of college kids. Not the case. Good mixture of families, groups, couples ,and even high schoolers out for prom
