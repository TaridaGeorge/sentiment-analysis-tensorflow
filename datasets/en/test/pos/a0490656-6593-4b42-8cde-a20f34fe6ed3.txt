Seriously the best Mexican Food out there, period.  You can try all the others in town, the big chains, the fast food, the dives and you'll come back to Zamora's each and every time.  When I leave town on a business trip, the first place I go to eat is Cafe Zamora!

Try the chicken fajitas...they are my favorite.
