This place is heaven on earth...I have probably been here over 100 times and never get sick of it!  I've searched all over the US for better gelato and just can't find it...makes you feel like you're in Italy!  I'm hoping they'll open a Gelato Spot in City Center in downtown Phoenix...that would be really dangerous!
