I have been going to Wong's since I was a small child, and I never get tired of it! I have recently moved to Tucson, which is super inconvenient considering no other Chinese food restaurant even compares to Wong's. The food is delicious, service is great, and prices are low. I try to stop in every time I am in the area, it never disappoints! Hands down, my favorite Chinese restaurant. I recommend the mongolian beef, kung pao chicken, and hunan tofu (vegan).
