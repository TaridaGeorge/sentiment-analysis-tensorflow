I love this Target. I shop here all the time. The employees are always friendly and willing to help. I also love how clean and neat the store is.  This Target also has an awesome Pharmacy. The Pharmacist and the staff in the pharmacy are very kind and sensitive to their patients. My hubby and I have seen many pharmacies, but this is the first one where we didn't feel rushed or feel like the staff is irritated. For a few years I have been trying to figure out what career I wanted to pursue in the healthcare field. This Pharmacist has inspired me to pursue becoming a pharmacist. I encourage patients to go to this pharmacy. I recommend this Target to everyone.
