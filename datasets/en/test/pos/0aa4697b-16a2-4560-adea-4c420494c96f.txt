Awesome place for kids of all ages! My 1 yr old boy loves it! One of the best if not the best children's museums I've been to.  Everything is very hands on.  Kids can really get involved and I'm not ashame to admit that I was also very excited myself to play.  :)  Climbed the massive tree maze.  My 1 yr old was not afraid but I sure was when we climbed to the 3rd floor of the maze.  Heights is not my forte.  There were lots to do.  You can not bring outside drinks here except water.  They do have a cafe where you can purchase items.  Really enjoyed our time here.
