One of my favorite brunch spots.  Not the cheapest, but you come here to admire the Arcadia families/couples coming into have brunch.  There is sometimes a wait but it is worth it.  I have a hard time deciding between the lunch salads and breakfast.  I usually cave and get the french toast or ginormous belgian waffle.  Parking is plentiful but it is on a weird corner in the strip mall, if you are going, look for cork and cleaver.
