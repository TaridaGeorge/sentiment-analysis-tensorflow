If you want to go "out", but don't want to get all dressed up, The Lodge is the place to go in Old Town.  We got there around 6:30 and the music was at a perfect level, you could hear it, but you didn't have to talk over it.  After some tasty nachos, a good chicken club sandwich (with waffle AND shoestring fries), we were ready to par-tay.  Nicole was great at serving our group in the private pool table area all night.  The Honey Brown been was a delicious change of pace, but eventually I did go back to my old friends Miller Lite and Dos Equis Lager.

I would highly recommend reserving the pool table area for an intimate gathering with friends early in the night.
