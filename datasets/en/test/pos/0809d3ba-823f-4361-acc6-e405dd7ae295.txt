Wow. Every time I go, I'm a little more impressed and full than the last. This was the first location I went to, and it's intimate and cozy. The food..... yum yum.
Note: I think some of the Best falafels I've ever had.
I most recently went to the location in Chandler. It was crazy!
It seemed as though, in the matter of a year, this place had blown-up. Everyone and they're babies and grandmoms were sitting.
Despite the almost standing-room-onliness, we got a seat right away, by the delightfully hipster staff, and were waited on immediately.
I figured our orders would take forever, but they were very timely. And did that impact the taste, you ask?
Nope.
Amazing.
Well done guys!
