This is my FAVORITE Whole Foods and my FAVORITE grocery store! I love coming here! I love that the vegan products are labeled vegan! I love that they can make a vegan cake for my birthday! I come here and can spend like an hour plus there! My favorite is the Yasmin hummus (MUST TRY), I also love the vegan cookie dough, DELICIOUS! Oh and their fresh made salsa, yummyyyyy!!! This place is a bit far from me but it's worth a trip!
