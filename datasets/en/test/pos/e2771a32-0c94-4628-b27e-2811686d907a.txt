My hubby and i decided to give this place a try for breakfast.  We had been looking for a good local place to go and enjoy a hearty breakfast/brunch, after long night of patying...
The overall appearance of the place didn't feel cozy, but we had no wait and our server was very attentive, lively, and just plain pleasant.
The food was GREAT, and we were served quickly! 
I did notice that we were surrounded by huge people...i guess they must be "regulars"...LOL!
Overall a great experiance, loved the food and will visiting again soon...Hope not to become "regulars", but a big hearty brunch won't hurt us!!!
