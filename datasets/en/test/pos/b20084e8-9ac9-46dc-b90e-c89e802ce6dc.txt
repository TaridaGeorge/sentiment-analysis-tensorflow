Well almost a year and they are still there. They must be doing something right. 

If you go to Leslies, or Paddock or Walmart for your pool supplies. STOP 

I found that the products at Bobbi's are superior to Walmarts and the staff is so much better then Paddock and Leslies. Seriously. 

I am on my 3rd bucket of chlorine and my 2nd floater. They always help me when the water gets a little cloudy and I don't know why, with out selling me a ton of stuff I do not need.
