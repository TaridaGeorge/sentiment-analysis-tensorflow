I've lived on the West Side (capital letters!) of Phoenix for most of my life. Lam's came when the West Side changed from lower middle class white to a very colorful bunch of all kinds of people. (well, sometimes colorful means "violent" and that's not good, but the good outweighs the bad...). The addition of Lam's is one of the best things to happen to the West Side in years. I used to go to the "Lucky" whatever grocery in the Chinese Cultural Center at 202 and 44th Street. It's nice. But Lam's is soooo much better. The fact that it's cheaper too give it the 5th star.

That's the best I can do for a review. For a WAYYYY better one, read the one from "Jetta R". She needs to be a professional writer....
