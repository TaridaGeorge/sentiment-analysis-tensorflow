We dined here againg during the recent restaurant week offering.   We basically ordered everything stated in my past review.   However, the portions this time were definitely smaller than the previous visit.   Still good though.    My steak was undercooked and had to send it back.   The server was polite and overall the food was good.   I ordered a margarita for my cocktail and it was fantastic.   This place is just very expensive so, in my opinion, should be reserved for a special occasion.
