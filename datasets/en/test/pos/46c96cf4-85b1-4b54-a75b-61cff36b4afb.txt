I got a chance to try the coffee here, and I was very pleased.  Great, smooth flavor, lovely latte art, and friendly service.  They need a trash can within view of the patio, though.  I don't know if I was just really confused or what, but I completely missed it if there is one.  I had to walk all the way back inside to throw a few pieces of trash away.  

This is a great place, now I just have to check out the alcohol options!
