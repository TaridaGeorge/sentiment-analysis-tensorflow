5-Star service. Lovely property; immaculately-maintained in every respect; prompt, friendly, efficient services from our valet-assisted arrival through check-out. We both felt very comfortable and will return again the next time we are going to Scottsdale. I would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys being pampered that they stay here.
