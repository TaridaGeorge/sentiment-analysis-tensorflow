If you are a parent going to Imagination Avenue, which is the same shopping center, stopping here is a must.  They have a drive thru with all the same kinds of things you can get at any good coffee house.  Then after your kids are worn out from playing, you can go back to get lunch.  My turkey sandwich was so good.  The staff was very friendly.
