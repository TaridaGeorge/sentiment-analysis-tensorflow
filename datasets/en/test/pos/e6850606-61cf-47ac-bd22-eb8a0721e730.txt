I loved everything I had. Schnitzel, Rosti, Tomato basil salad. My wife had the Swedish meatballs which were great and my daughter had the chicken with cardamom sauce and the green beans were garlicy and light.  Every item was great. We shared a poutine which fantastic.  We will eat the desserts later.
