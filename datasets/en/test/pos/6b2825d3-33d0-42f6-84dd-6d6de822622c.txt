Played January of 2011($60).This is quite simply the best golf course I have ever played! Water everywhere, I probably left at least a half dozen balls in the lakes and I still had a blast. Homes surround the course, but lakes seperate them and dont really come into play, they actually ad to the beauty of this course. The course was in immaculate condition. I dont play resort golf very often, from the friendly and helpfull cart guys to the bartender, I was very impressed with the service. Troon Golf now has a reputation with me, I will forever compare all courses to this one. Will definately play this course again when I return.
