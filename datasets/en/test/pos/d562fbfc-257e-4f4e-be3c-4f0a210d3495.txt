One of the best views in the valley.  Zen atmosphere and decor.  Uptempo lite techno background music.  The food was all perfectly cooked.  The tempura-battered fiery calamari was excellent.  The Halibut and Ahi was fantastic with very complementary sauces. Great dessert.  The staff was friendly and knowledgable...  ...always available without overly "hovering."  HIghly recommended for special occasions and a "splurge."
