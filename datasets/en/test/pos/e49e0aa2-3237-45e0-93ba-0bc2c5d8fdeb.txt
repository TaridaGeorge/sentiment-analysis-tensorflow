My Fiance and I went here today for the first time. We shared a meat pie
and a serving of the largest  Bosnian Sausage dish. 
     ALL of it was amazing. I cannot speak highly enough of their food. Service was very prompt and the waitress courteous and quick. The food was very reasonably priced and the restaurant itself was very charming and nicely decorated. All over, the ambiance was pleasant. I look forward to returning!
