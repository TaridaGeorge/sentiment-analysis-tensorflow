I just moved into the Gainey Ranch area and have been checking out my surroundings.  I was having a hankering for some BBQ so I "Yelped" it and found Lucille's.  I am very glad I went.  The service was prompt and very polite; the space was large, clean and appropriate; the menu is huge and most importantly the food was excellent.  I will definitely be going back!!
