Fez is just FREAKIN' fabulous!

With it's modern decor, low lighting, hip music and intimate setting in central Phoenix, it's the perfect little getaway restaurant. 

And the food.....TO DIE FOR! Where shall I start? The cinnamon dusted sweet potato fries will melt in your mouth. I highly recommend them and any of the kisra plates. The Casablanca chicken sandwich is also delish.

The service is also very friendly and attentive...very refreshing!They also have a nice little patio in the back which is nice if you're a smoker, considering it's banned so many different places now!

And even if you aren't in the mood for dinner, it's got a great bar area to sip a cocktail or two.
