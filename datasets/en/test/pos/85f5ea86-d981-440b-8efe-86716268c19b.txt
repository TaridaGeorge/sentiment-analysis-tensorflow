Just ate here for dinner and everything was exceptional. We tried the Beach House Burger and the Paradise Bacon Cheese with Fried Onions. We loved both but our favorite was the Paradise Bacon Cheese. It was perfectly cooked and the bun didn't overpower the burger, nor did it disintegrate like a lot of buns do. We also tried the fries which were really good with a slightly sweet taste. When they heard it was our first visit they brought us a basket of French toast fries which were ridiculously good. Only issue we had was the lack of fountain soda but overall it was a great experience. We will be back very soon.
