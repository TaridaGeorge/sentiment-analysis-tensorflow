Would it be to forward to say that I want to live here, on premises? I mean, is that allowed?  I love this place. How did I live before coming here?  Do you think Joe would care if I made this my new home?

Love love love this place.  I am currently sitting in the back writing my review and never want to leave.  Joe, if your out there, your awesome.  this place rocks!
