Lox stock is my favorite bagel place in town.  They do some wonderful catering also.  I always avoid the typical chain restaurants and while it may be hard to try a new place, you will be happy with the food at Lox Stock.  Let the boring and unadventerous go elsewhere.  It is quite possible the bagels at Lox Stock are the best you will find west of the Hudson River!
