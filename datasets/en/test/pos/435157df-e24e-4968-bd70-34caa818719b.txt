I don't have a bad thing to say about the Ho!  :)
We stayed here over Memorial Day weekend and had an absolute blast.  The mid-century modern decor is totally fun, the food/drinks are amazing, service is excellent, and the room was comfy and large with a huge patio.  
I wish I would have known about the rooftop patio before we came - we'll definitely return!
