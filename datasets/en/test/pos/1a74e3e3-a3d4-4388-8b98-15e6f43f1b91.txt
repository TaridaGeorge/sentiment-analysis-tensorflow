Amazing afternoon supper and affordable .  You would think that crepes are good but maybe a bit limited, but you would be wrong.  We each had a savory crepe and shared a dessert crepe.  I had the turkey roulade (sp) and it has some robust cheese with a perfectly tart stonefruit.  My wife had ham and mushroom with pepper jack and crusted parm on the edges.

I missed out on the daily special, but I was not sorry in the least.
