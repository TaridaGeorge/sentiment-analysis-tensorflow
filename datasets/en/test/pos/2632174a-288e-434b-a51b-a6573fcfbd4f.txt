Honestly, the best experience I've ever had in a computer store.  My Toshiba laptop screen had stopped working and I wasn't sure if it was an inverter or the screen itself.  They ended up replacing the screen for a very reasonable price after explaining in very specific detail just what my options were and what the costs would be.  As other reviewers have pointed out, there was no diagnostic charge and no minimum. 

The store itself is beautifully designed.  Nelson, the person who helped me was extremely courteous and thorough and they kept in constant communication with me through each step of the process.  I was very pleased with every aspect of this experience.  Highly recommended.
