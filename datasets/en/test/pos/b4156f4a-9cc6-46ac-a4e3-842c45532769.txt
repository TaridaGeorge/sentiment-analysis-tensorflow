My husband and I love this place.  It is so close to where we live, that when we decide last minute that we don't want to cook, we more than likely call Babbo for carryout.  It is best on Mondays and Tuesdays because they have spaghetti and meatball for $5.99.  They are huge portions too.  It also comes with garlic bread, which is really good.  Sometimes we split 1 and are completely satisfied with that.  I also had the Pasta Rustico, which was really good as well.  We've never dined in though, so I can't really say what that experience would be.
