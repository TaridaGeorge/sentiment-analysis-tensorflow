YUM! 
I had breakfast here last weekend. The patio is a great place to enjoy the fresh air. Our waitress was attentive and friendly. I started with the organic bloody mary. It was not my favorite. The skewer had cheese on it that tasted like refrigerator, yuck. 
The meal was much better. I ordered the veggie omelet and switched my side to the sweet potato tots based on previous reviews. The tots were delish. They were crispy and not greasy. The omelet was perfectly cooked, I asked for no oil and they made it perfectly. 
I will most certainly be back!
