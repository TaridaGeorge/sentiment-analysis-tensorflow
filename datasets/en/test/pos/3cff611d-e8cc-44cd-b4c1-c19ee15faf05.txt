I don't know. I guess I can consider this is 'authentic' Vietnamese. But the food is just great. BEST Pho in Phoenix, I guarantee. 
This place is worn, could be little bit dirty. Servers are not the friendliest people in the world, but they do serve. 
But the soup is just great. People, don't come if you don't like good tastes. Or cheap prices. 
But yes, if you are looking for a nice restaurant, this is not a nice place to visit. But for good food, this is by far the best Pho in Phoenix.
