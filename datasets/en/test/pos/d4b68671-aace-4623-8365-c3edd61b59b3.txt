Arcadia Montessori is nothing but a gem! This school has been around for quite a while, & with good reason! My daughter was a 2nd generation student and absolutely LOVED it there. The yoga, &
Zumba was one of her favs. She met so many other wonderful children that she called her friends. We relocated to CA recently, & if it wasn't for that she would definitely still be attending. Must see school. The campus is beautiful as well, as it was originally Judy (the owners) home.
