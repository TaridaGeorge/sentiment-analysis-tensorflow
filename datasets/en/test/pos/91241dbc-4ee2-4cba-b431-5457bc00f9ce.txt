This was my first time having Indian fry bread and it was pretty good. If you're a fan of chinese donuts (yow tieu), this is a close cousin to it. 
The  wifey and I both had the hominy soup and it was super filling. Good thing we shared one fry bread as it's so big for both of us.
The hominy soup had huge chucks of lean beef. A full meal in itself. Great mom and pop place. I wish we had more places like this in California.
