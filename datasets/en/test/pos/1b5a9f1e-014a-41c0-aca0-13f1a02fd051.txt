Alright, first things first...Their thin crust pizza is the best pizza I have EVER had in AZ.  On the downside and this almost cost them a star, it is always more $$$ then we want to spend on pick-up/delivery pizza.  We off set this however by getting the large with the small cheese for free and then make 3-5 meals out of it.  Hopefully they will begin to offer good deals on their Facebook page to help out their faithful supporters.  I have never had a burger/sandwich or fries, as pizza is the only way to go for us but I'm sure they are good.  My only question is why haven't they expanded their space to offer a dine-in option?  That would be a successful venture for sure as we always look fwd to our next ROSATI'S night.
