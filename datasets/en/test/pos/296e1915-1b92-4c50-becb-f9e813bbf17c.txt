I've been going to Crazy Jim's for at least 12 years and it is one of my favorite spots for anything Feta. I have probably had every item on the menu throughout this 12 year relationship and have never had anything I did not like. Here are my top 5: 

1. Gyro Feta Pita (loaded with gyro meat, onions, tomatoes, and feta)
2. Spring Mix Chicken Feta Salad (Enough to feed two people)
3. Calamari Feta Salad (Crunchy and tasty) 
4. Penelope Pizza (Chicken and Artichoke)
5. Fresh Warm Pita Bread (a must have)

The restaurant is cozy, casual, clean, and the staff is very friendly and prompt.  

I have tried other Greek restaurants in Phx that have either been way to gimmicky or a total bust and none compare to Crazy Jim's. If anything ever happened to this place I would go "CRAZY"!!!!!!
