This is like the Home Depot and Costco of Wine and Spirits!!
Do not visit here with the intention of leaving quickly - I assure you it will not happen.
It starts at the door upon entering...SIGH....where you will be greeted by rows of bottles that invite you into their depths.
I will say that I think that they not only have the best selection but also the best pricing I have seen.
On my last visit I also noticed that they also have cigars - while I am not an aficianado (but I do enjoy the slow wafting aroma of a cigar)....if they stock their cigars like they do their wine...then we're all good!
