I was part of Desert Bloom a few weeks ago and it was my first time at the new Gangplank location.  Though I don't know what it looks like during working hours (the room was cleared for painting and such), it's an awesome space.  
I have a lot of friends who go to Gangplank to work and it's just such a cool concept all-around!  I don't get out to this part of the Valley very often, but I would definitely consider business meetings here.
