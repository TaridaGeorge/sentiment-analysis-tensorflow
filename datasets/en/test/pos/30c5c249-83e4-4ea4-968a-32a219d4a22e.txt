Best (and cleanest) fro yo joint in the city!  The oatmeal cookie and (seasonal) gingerbread flavors are outstanding - really flavorful and creamy.  There is a good selection of both sweet and tart options, and the topping bar is nothing short of amazing.  The candy bars come whole, the fruit is fresh, and they even have baklava!

The employees at Yogurtology seem to really enjoy their jobs, and there is always someone wiping up yogurt messes and vacuuming up toppings that have strayed from their buckets.  

An enthusiastic 5 stars!
