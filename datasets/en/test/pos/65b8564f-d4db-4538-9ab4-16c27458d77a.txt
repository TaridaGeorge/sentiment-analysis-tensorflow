Fabulous Experience!!  I have been living in the area for 13 years now and must say this was the BEST dental office I have been to in Arizona!  I was greeted by a super friendly staff, got a tour of the office and then we got down to business.  Dr. Tran introduced herself and started the exam.  She was very friendly and my teeth felt wonderfully clean and fantastic.  The office was clean, updated and even had TVs on the ceiling to watch while getting your treatment.  I was blown away when I received not only a phone call a few days later to see how my visit was but also a hand written thank you note.  My search for a fabulous dentist is over!!
