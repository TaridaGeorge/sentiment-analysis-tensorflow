My friends and I are in there at least once a week. (we all live near)  The place has switched hands quite a few times since I moved to the neighborhood but the "Why Knot" is definitely the best cafe so far.  It's obvious the new owner loves to cook.  She puts actual effort into the food.  Started going there for breakfast, but lunch is super good too, and very reasonable.  A hidden gem.
