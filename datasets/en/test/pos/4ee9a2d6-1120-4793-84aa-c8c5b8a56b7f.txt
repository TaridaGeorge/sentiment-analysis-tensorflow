So we have been here probably 50-70 times, and this is the first time I am reviewing Mellow!!  I love this place. I believe that Mellow has the best beer selection in town with both rotating local and national micro brews. And of course the happy hour is half off all of the beer and other alcohol selection. So basically you can get a large 20oz beer for $3.50!

The pizza is also amazing. My personal favorite is the Thai dye pizza which has sweet chili sauce and chicken Curry. Sounds crazy but it is super good! I've also had the meat pizza, buffalo chicken pizza and they were all good. Also during happy hour all of the appetizers are half off and all are great!  You can't beat it!
