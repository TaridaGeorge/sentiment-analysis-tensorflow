I dig Michael's.  I go here for my scrapbooking supplies, and other crafty stuff that I may need.  They carry loads of stuff-floral, art supplies, candles and do framing as well.  The store is well organized, well lit, and they are open late!  Plus, they also send out weekly coupons for 20-50 percent off, so make sure you use it!

This place is right off the loop 101, and kind of hidden.  Its right near a pier one, so make sure you keep an eye peeled for it...easy to miss, especially if its your first time there!
