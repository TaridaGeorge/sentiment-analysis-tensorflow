I feel very confident that anyone/everyone, no matter their level in yoga practice, will feel welcomed and inspired in this wonderful studio!!! 

Owner/ operator Tish Hegel is amazing!! She teaches her classes with in such an informative, productive and positive manner; all will feel a sense of accomplishment and self-motivation at the end of each practice. 

$$The pricing is very reasonable and well-worth the money spent$$ 

**I promise** if you go to one class you will come back for more! 
There are a variety of classes and times so you can fit it into any schedule, and she hosts different workshops and classes throughout the seasons. 

OH!!! and you cant miss the full moon class she holds monthly, focusing on moon salutations to candle light and soft music! 

Life for me has forever changed after finding this enchanting studio...
