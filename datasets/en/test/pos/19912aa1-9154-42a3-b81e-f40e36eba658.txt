Yes I like this airport. It is NOT bad at all. I would give it less than 5 stars for a bit longer lines but they seriously go by sooo fast! I like how it's huge. I don't like small airports. Bigger means, they know what they're doing! They also have good looking guys here! Major +++ for eye candy! I'll definitely be flying here again. Well, I kind of have to since my brother and sister-in-law live in Arizona. They have plenty of stores and places to eat.
