I go to Liberty market as often as I can. The food here is great! I've tried many things from all 3 menus and have not been disappointed by any of them! I'm now also hooked on the cortadito (sp?) because Joe bought me one just to prove how good they were! 

Everyone is always friendly and the food usually comes out fast. I really cant think of any complaints!! keep up the good work and if you have never been here, definitely try it!!
