I was so pleasantly surprised with the food and service at this restaurant. We had the Applewood Smoked Duck, Pan Seared Scallops and Chopped salad and they were all amazing. The food duck and scallops were cooked to perfection. Our waiter was hilarious.

I would absolutely come back here next time I'm in Scottsdale.
