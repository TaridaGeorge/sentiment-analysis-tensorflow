I love this TJs! The staff is always friendly and they look like they genuinely enjoy their jobs! The manager, Lauren, is wonderful! We had a minor issue with a product and she fixed it immediately, with no hassles! The selection is great, and I can find affordable, healthy options! If you're careful about what you choose, a little bit of cash can go a long way here.
