Love this place!  I have never ever been disappointed here.  I have come here for dinner a few times and everything I had was spectacular.  The last time I was here for dinner I had their short rib entree, it was amazing!! I crave this dish all the time.  I recently heard that Eddie was opening for lunch on the 20th of September so my lunch companions and I decided to try it out.  I am sooo glad we did:).  BTW you still get that wonderful pesto dipping sauce with cracker bread... Yummy!  For lunch I had the cob salad and a cup of their soup of the day it was excellent.  My other lunch companions had the bacon infused meatloaf and a veggie paninni.  They both were also really pleased with their choices.  I will be back for sure!
