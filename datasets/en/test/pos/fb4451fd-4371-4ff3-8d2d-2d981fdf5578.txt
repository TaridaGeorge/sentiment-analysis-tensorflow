If you're looking for some kind of special map for your next adventure, or even a basic road map for wherever, this place either will have it or can probably get it. I came in looking for the new version of the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest map a couple weeks ago, after no luck at REI. Not only did they have it, but they had about 10 copies of it! Sure, I could have bought it online, but if I can get it now, AND support a local business at the same time, then score!

Staff was friendly and helpful, and you can tell they like what they are doing. Store is right off I-17. It's slightly difficult to pull in and out of their parking lot because of how close you are to the street, so be careful.
