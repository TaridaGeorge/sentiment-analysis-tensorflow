Excellent chaat! Dont go by the looks of the place, the food is one of the best around here. They have been very consistent with the quality of the food which is rare for Indian restaurants in the valley. I have tried almost all the chaat items on the menu and have never been disappointed. The gravies that come along with the combo specials are not that great. Their Vada Paav (Indian burger) deserves a special mention.
Definitely try the place for a quick and tasty evening snack.
