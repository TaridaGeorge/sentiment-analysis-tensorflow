I generally don't venture out of my ten mile radius rule.  But for sushi ken, I am happy to get into the car and venture out to Chandler.  I've already been familiar with this restaurant since it was in Tucson.  Nothing much has changed.  Friendly (leisurely) service, solid mom and pop Japanese food.  Good prices, good amount of food.  Some of my favorites are the ramen, the korroke curry, and oyako donburi.  Nothing fancy, just delicious.
