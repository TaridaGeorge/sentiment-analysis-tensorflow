I met my husband three years ago on the patio for Sunday Funday so I had to rate The Vig a "5". We met with Elvis Before Noon  playing in the background (the Sunday band that plays ever week) so hired them to play at our wedding. Needless to say, this place is special to us. 
I really like the food here although my husband doesn't - not sure why. I love the grilled veggie sandwich and hummus. Once he had the special, ahi tacos, which he said was the best he's ever had, but they haven't had it again! 
Food is good, great patio, awesome drink specials, and fantastic music! What else can you ask for? To meet a man? Well, you can do that too!
