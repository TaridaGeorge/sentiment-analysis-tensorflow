Best Thai Restaurant I've tried, beats Thai Basil and Swaddee Thai in Chandler.
I've only gone there for lunch, I love their lunch specials: soup, spring roll, Thai chips and an entree for under $8! You can ask for hot Jasmine tea as well - it's free! 
The food is less Americanized than other Asian places I've tried. They are usually really busy at lunch, but I've never waited long to be seated. The waiters are attentive.

I recommend trying their garlic chicken or their sweet and sour chicken. There is plenty of white lean meat in all of their chicken entrees!
