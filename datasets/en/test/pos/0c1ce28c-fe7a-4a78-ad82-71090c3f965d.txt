Yes, 5 stars when you compare this place to any other place in the area, or in Phoenix for that matter.  Best customer service I have encountered in Scottsdale, PERIOD. I took an associate there on good Yelp reviews and it was in the area, he too was as impressed with the service, he will be mentioning this visit in his next lecture on RETAIL CUSTOMER SERVICE for the specialty coffee industry.   The Ahi salad I had was excellent, and the sweet potato tots are great!  Looking forward to getting back there for dinner!
