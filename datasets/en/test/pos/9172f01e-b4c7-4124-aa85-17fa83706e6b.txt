I bring them my dry cleaning and shirts that need to be laundered. The next day, they're done by 4, perfectly. I bring them 10 or so shirts and some sport coats and pants on a regular basis - they've never lost or damaged anything. Service is always friendly. They do all their own cleaning onsite.

Not a long review, but what do you want from me? It's a freaking laundry. Go launder some stuff.
