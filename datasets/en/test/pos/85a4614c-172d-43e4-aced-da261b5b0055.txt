I had to have a tire replaced (obviously, haha) and I knew the dealership and WalMart were both overcharging me. I went in on a Saturday to see if they had the exact tire I needed in stock. They did not have the tire I needed but ordered it that same day, and informed me that they should have it in by Monday. They phoned on Monday to notify me that the tire was in, and also asked when I would be able to come by. I went in around 3:20pm and was out well before 4:00pm. Each staff member I came in contact with was very friendly and helpful. They rotated my tires, and my Volkswagen is happy again = ).
