85 Miles round trip. Ughhhhh, this is what we drive to get to George & Sons, yes it is that good!  Several years ago we were treated to take out at a friends house and as it turns out she picked up dinner from George & Sons and we have been hooked ever since.  

Stand outs for us is the Sizzling Rice soup, Shrimp spring rolls filled with nothing but Shrimp, Thai Basil Chicken and the Honey Walnut Shrimp.  Everything tastes fresh and as it should be.  The service is top notch and it the mood strikes him, even George himself might stop by to say hello.
