They have arguably the best thai food in phoenix, however they are only open about half of the time that I want to eat there... They close for a few hours in between lunch and dinner during the week, and sometime they will just be closed with a handwritten sign saying they will be open the next day.  Very inconvenient, however the food is sooooo good that I can't help but go back again and again!  5 stars!
