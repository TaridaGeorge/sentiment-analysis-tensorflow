What a fantastic breakfast! My husband and I were searching high and low in the Ahwatukee area for a good breakfast spot. We recently moved to the area and are not into the chain restaurants or fast food joints. Pomegranate Cafe fit the bill perfectly. Breakfast was healthful and delicious with lots of flavorful ingredients like avocado, kale, pesto and nuts. We had the Green Garden Protein Bowl and the Breakfast Burrito- they were both a huge hit. Cassie, one of the owners, was delightful and helpful as we were making our selections. The restaurant itself is colorful and cheerful. We will definitely keep the Pomegranate on our 'must eat there often list.'
