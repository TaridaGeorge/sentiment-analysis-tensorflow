This location is a bit bigger than some other locations, offering free wifi as usual.
It's always crowded during lunch but never a long wait and never a sacrifice on quality.
I get the chicken walnut salad of course, or sometimes the new turkey with avocado sandwich, and the chicken chopped cobb salad.
It's been open longer than a year I think, and still looks brand new. Kept up very well.
I haven't experienced them running out of anything at lunch, although I have only come during dinner hours a few times. Always during the week.
