ok, so if you do not get the Filet Mignon...you will miss out. Melt in your mouth delectible!! We celebrated our anniversary with them and  we were treated like royalty. complimentary Creme Brule even!! And the wait staff were fabulous, a waiter who majes all your meal decisions seem like the greatest decision since the soviets took down the wall. Great talent, never an empty glass, most needs anticipated with ease.
