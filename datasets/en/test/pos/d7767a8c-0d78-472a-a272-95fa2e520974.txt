Great food, excellent service, got in right before the dinner rush....it was allllll good. :)  Calamari and jalapenos left me wanting more and top sirloin was excellent.  My coworkers agreed.  I actually liked this location a million times better than in Markham, ON (toronto) where I first found this restaurant chain.  Thanks Chandler!
