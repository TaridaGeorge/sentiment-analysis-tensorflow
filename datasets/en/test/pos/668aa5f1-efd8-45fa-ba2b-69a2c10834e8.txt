Excellent customer service!  I attended a major premier this holiday weekend at the theater, and the long line was created by a staff member in a suit, who graciously offered everyone water while they waited.  The procedure for entering the theater was also smooth and friendly.  The concession stand also met our needs, as we had a small group with us and a rather large order.  No complaints, and we will definitely be back to this theater!  Also before the show, a suited gentleman also announced that this was the largest movie screen in Arizona.  The show started with the dramatic opening of large, golden curtains across the movie screen.  There was even an attendance situated in our theater, so that we could approach him with any concerns instead of having to miss the show.  Best movie experience I've had so far!
