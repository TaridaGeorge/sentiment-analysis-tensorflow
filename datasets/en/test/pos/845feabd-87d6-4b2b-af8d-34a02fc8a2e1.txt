Awesome gelato in a variety of flavors, a beautiful and clean shop, and friendly service - what more could you ask?!  I won't bother with a Gelato Spot comparison, because they're both fantastic - I'm just glad we have one gelato place in this area!  While I usually try to be good and stick to fro-yo from Golden Spoon, I visit Sweet Life every once-in-a-while when I'm at Scottsdale101 or just craving gelato.
