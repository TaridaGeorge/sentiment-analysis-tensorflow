No matter what the occasion, AZ 88 is always a great choice! The atmosphere is always fun and upbeat, and the food never lets you down! My favorite thing to order is the AZ 88 chicken sandwich served with their famous waffle fries. If you like buffalo chicken sandwiches, let me tell you, this one is hard to beat! Although this is my go to order... anything on the menu is great. Not only is the food fabulous but the martinis are out of this world! I have been going here for years and never once have I been even slightly disappointed with the experience.
