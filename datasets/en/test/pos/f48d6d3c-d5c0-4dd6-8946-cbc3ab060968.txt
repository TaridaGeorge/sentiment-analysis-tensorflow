Without a doubt the coolest little joint I've ever been to. I am by no means a "health nut" but came across this place last January when I was in town for Barrett Jackson event, went back twice when I came to visit over the summer. Now live in Scottsdale and still think it has the  most refreshing, light best breakfast croissant/sandwiches I've ever had. You could drive right by the place if you don't know it's there!
