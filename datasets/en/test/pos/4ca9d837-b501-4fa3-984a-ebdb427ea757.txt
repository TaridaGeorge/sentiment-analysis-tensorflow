I had been anxiously watching Baby's move in to their new location.  I was hoping it was a tasty as it sounded!  Boy was it ever!

I ordered a Mediterranean Chicken Pita and My husband tried the Philly Steak.  We were both exceptionally happy with the food. The vegetables on my pita were so crunchy and delicious, the feta was smooth and yummy, the pita was super soft, and the chicken was perfect too!  The food was made quickly and the employees were friendly and helpful!!  They even came around and offered us a free piece of the most delicious lemon tart for dessert.  

I was craving Baby's again by lunch time!
