This might be the best dive bar ever! Used to go here all the time from 2000 - 2002, cause of the $3 pitchers, now i can only make it back every few months :(  Scott is right about the smoke, but with the AZ smoking ban it is no longer an issue. The bar is roughly the size of a large living room with a pool table, darts, real bathrooms, and 2 tvs. Cant remember how much the pitchers are now, but last time i got totally plowed and spent like $20. Crowd is hit or miss, but always friendly. Sometime its all regulars, sometime there are some attractive younger singles in there.. just depends. If your trying to find the place, don't get confused. Its wedged back in the corner of a shopping center, the door of which does not face the street.
