I had lunch here with some clients, and fell in love with their fries! I think we had sweet potato fries and truffle oil fries, very yummy! Along with the fries that were almost a meal, I had the Zinc house salad with goat cheese, the dressing was so delish! Great spot for lunch or dinner, GREAT decor, very hip!
