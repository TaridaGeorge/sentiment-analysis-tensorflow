This place is located inside the airport. On the Southwest Airline side. 
So if you have a flight on Southwest on the C gate side you could stop in here.
It is not cheap for drinks, it's the Airport.  A Drink on the Plane is $7.00 so it is not bad. Anywhere in the Airport is high priced. That is the Nature of the Beast.
They have very good Coffee and you get free refills. They are a very busy place, so you might  have to wait a bit. I suggest if you do not have a lot of time then you should not go to a sit down restaurant.   
The food is not over priced maybe not the healthiest food, but that is why we have choices. Thank you Jesus ,lots of choices.   Really good customer Service, they are running non stop in here.
