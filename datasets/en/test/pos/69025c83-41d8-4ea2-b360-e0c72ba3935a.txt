Located off of Elliot and I-10, Sakana is the place to go for fresh, inventive sushi.  

Fresh, fresh, fresh! That is the name of the game here.  For starters try their spring rolls, crunchy and delicious! Their sashimi melts in your mouth. Like budda, baby. I normally get salmon and yellowtail. Good stuff.  I have never had a roll here that I didn't like. If it looks like it will be good when you order it...it'll be even better on the plate.  Try 'em all.  

After 6:00 or so on the weekends, look for hour waits. But it will be worth it.   The combination of taste, value, and unassuming atmosphere is hard to duplicate here in the valley.
