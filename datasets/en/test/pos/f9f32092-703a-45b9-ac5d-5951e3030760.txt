Stopped in on a late Saturday afternoon for happy hour and sat at the sushi bar. The sushi chef was incredibly nice and kept making us samples of stuff. We ordered oysters and lump crab with avocado. Both dishes were great, especially the oysters and I'm usually not an oyster fan. The place is very upscale but no one made us feel uncomfortable in jeans and tees. I'll be going back for sure.
