Dear Cracker Barrel,

Where have you been all my life? 
Love,
Jen

This has got to be one of the best finds in a long long time. I've been told that they don't exist in CA so I had the pleasure of dining here on a work trip. Talk about good ole home cooked meals with a southern taste. This place not only has fantastic and affordable dishes but they are delish. Their service was impeccable and I had such a great time wandering the fun lobby filled with candy and toys from back in the day. If you love comfort food don't pass up this place.
