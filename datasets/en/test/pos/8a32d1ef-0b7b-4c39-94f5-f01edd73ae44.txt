LOVE THIS PLACE!!! A real neighborhood gem!! I've been there twice for lunch and twice for dinner. Anxious to try more things on the menu as I have had a hard time trying to choose between all the great items. Great casual atmosphere with a bar and the inside dining area is open to the outside patio, also open for dining. Check it out!!!
