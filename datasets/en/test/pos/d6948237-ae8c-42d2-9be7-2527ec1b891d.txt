The absolute best fried chicken I've ever had. The waffles and syrup are heaven on a plate, with a hint of cinnamon.

Lo-Lo's is a required stop after an overnight visit to Phoenix. My fiance and I wake up, check out of our hotel in a hurry, ignoring any and all continental breakfasts that stand in our way. We never remember where Lo-Lo's is exactly, except that it's on some side street, but fortunately GPS has never let us down.

Lo-Lo's makes a point of hanging signs that indicate that service is slow, but I've never had a bad experience there.

Mmm mmm mmm!
