I went here a few days ago after a hike and worked up an appetite.  A friend showed me the place and I never would have seen it because it is hidden behind some other buildings in front of it.  

Had some of the best pizza I've tasted in a while, and I have pizza a lot. I walked in and sat down, but you can also do take out.  The waiter was efficient and polite, which is a big deal.  There weren't that many people there for a Saturday night, but I saw more people come in and do take-out.  The music they play is great.  It's satellite radio on Sirius radio.  40s on 4.  

They say it is circa New York in th 1940's, and I would believe it.  Cool vintage pictures on the wall.  Fun place for lunch or dinner.
