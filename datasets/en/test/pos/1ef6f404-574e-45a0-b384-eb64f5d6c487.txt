before i knew of mama mia, i ordered dominos delivery. the day i had my very first mama mia pizza delivered to my house, i nearly creamed my chonies. never, ever, will i order another dominos, pizza hut, or little ceasars pizza ever again.

the pizzas are HUGE, the sauce isn't overwhelming, the cheese is perfectly melted, and the crusty is crispy and thin. love the size of the slices - large and in charge. my favorite pizza to get delivered. i picked up inside once and they were extremely friendly to me and had my pizza piping hot and ready. they even gave me 5 bucks off since they fucked up a previous order. rad.

delivery might take you a while, usually it runs about 40-50 minutes, so order early. its worth it.
