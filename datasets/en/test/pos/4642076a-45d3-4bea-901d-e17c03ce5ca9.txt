I have been going to the Dilly for 3 years; and I'm not ashamed to say, I know all the bartenders and regular customers. The drinks are cheap, and stiff. There is pool, shuffle board, darts, and other games to play. There is a huge fish tank and several TVs for any sports game... They serve hot nuts, and pop popcorn upon request....The atmosphere is friendly, clean, and fun! They also have a juke box with tons of songs to select from.... Voted best dive bar in PHX.
