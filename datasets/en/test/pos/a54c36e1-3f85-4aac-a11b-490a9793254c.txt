I loved this place!

Its very cute and they have a nice selection of stuff. (Food and non-food items.)

I love that everything is fresh and the breads/pastries etc are all made on site. 

Had the yogurt with fruit and granola. Yummers!!

Also had a muffin of some sort... I think it was like blueberry white chocolate. Super yummy!

Note: The place isnt all that big and its crammed with stuff. It can get really busy and very crowded with people inside. 

Parking is also a bit of a pain...

But its all worth it. Go here!!
