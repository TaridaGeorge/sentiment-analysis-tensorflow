Only three stars?  That's odd--their VIB (Very Important Breakfast) boasts a four item meal for $6.99 that's really hard to beat in my mind considering how good the french toast is here.  All of our meals here were fantastic today, with really friendly service.  This place blows Denny's out of the water in terms of overall quality.

The only drawback is that you can't repeat any breakfast items on the VIB--they all gotta be different.  Small price to pay--literally.
