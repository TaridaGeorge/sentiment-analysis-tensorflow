OMG that is the best fry bread! I was visiting during Memorial weekday and place was closed until Tuesday but I was determined not to leave w/o trying that fry bread and I am sooo glad I did. I ordered the Indian Taco which comes with lettuces, beans and cheese and I also ordered plain with honey. You have to it eat it while is hot; it tastes the best. After finishing one, I ordered another it was so good. Super friendly staff, parking outside the place.
