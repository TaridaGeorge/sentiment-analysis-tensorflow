Looking for a relaxing experience .... You'll find it at Advanced Back and Neck ... You'll be greeted friendly by Debbie at the front desk every time you visit. The staff are always making an effort to make your visit comfortable. You have your choice of several professionally trained massage therapist ... I prefer Amy ... Her deep tissue massage always does the trick ... after each massage you are escorted to the Dr for the adjustment ....  I never fail to get the most from the adjustment ... Upper back , Lower back and neck ... I always feel great after leaving the office. You will not be disappointed
