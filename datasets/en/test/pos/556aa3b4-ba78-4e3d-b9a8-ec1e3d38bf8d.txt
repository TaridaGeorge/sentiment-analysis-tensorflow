Clare, the sales person, was excellent. She wasn't pushy and helped us get an excellent deal on a really, really nice mattress. The delivery guys a couple days later were polite, prompt and super helpful. They forgot something when the delivered the bed in the morning and came back at 9:30PM on their own to bring it to us. Really impressed with the level of service and would recommend to anyone.
