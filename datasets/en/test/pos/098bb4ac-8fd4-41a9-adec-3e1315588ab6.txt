I was lucky to grow up on 38th St, because I had this classic burger joint at the end of my block. Whenever I go back home to see my old man, I always stop in to grab a real taste of Chicago. To this day, they still got it!

I recently visited Chicago (the city) for the first time on St. Patty's weekend. I was amazed when I felt right at home, must have been all those lunches as a kid at The Chicago Hamburger Co.

Put me down for 3 double cheese sliders...
Thanks Bob!
