If you have not seen a movie at Camelview, you are missing out. For some reason, Camelview gets access to play indie films that other theatres don't. I have seen some amazing movies here that are not playing at any other theatres in the State! Living in North Phoenix, it is kinda far, but it is worth the drive. If you are seeing a new movie, make sure you get there early as there is often a line and they only have 5 theatres which are not very big. Also...it is a Harkins, so I recommend investing in the soda cup and popcorn t-shirt, they are a great deal!
