This place is amazing! Everything is organic, the whole place is done up "green" and the food is just good.
My favorite is the greek caesar! It's like a mountain of salad! And the hummus with crusty bread is always consistently good.
I've tried a few of their pastries, they're pretty good, and really cute.

I definitely recommend this place as a good lunch spot.
