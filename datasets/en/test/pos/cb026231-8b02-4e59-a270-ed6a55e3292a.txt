This is my favorite Mimi's in the entire valley.  I have been here a ton of time during the last few years (mostly business related).  The hostess was always nice enough to get us a seat far enough away from the normal customers so we could conduct business.  The food is always good, and the place always seems friendly. 

Great place!
