I was amazed! being a native San Franciscan where dimsum is readily available.. I find this gem in Arizona?? The prices were ridiculously cheap, food was hot and tasty..... bean curd, siu mai, chow mein, shrimp dumpling, EVERYTHING TASTED GREAT.. (beef balls were a little gamy) quick service, wide array of food and the best part is when the bill came.. $27 bucks?? for a whole lunch for 2.... that sealed the deal. Staff was friendly and polite. I will be back! :)
