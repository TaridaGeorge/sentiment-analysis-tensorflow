Consistently one of my favorite spots which keeps me coming back year after year.  

If you want the true Southwest experience- stay in one of the more traditional "casitas".  A little further away from the main buildings but the rooms are larger and you feel like you are in your own home with the outdoor patios, front outside door and some even have their own pools.

Truly a great experience every time I come!
