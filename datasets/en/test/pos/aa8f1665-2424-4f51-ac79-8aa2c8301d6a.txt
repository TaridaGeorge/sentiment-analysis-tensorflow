Very good place for breakfast and their pies are to die for.  We've been here about five times and they never seem to be crowded, which is a shame.  Their staff is always friendly and the food is always good.  It's like a Dennys-type place, but I think the food tastes better.  I've honestly never had a lunch or dinner item but I don't think that's what you go here for :)  The prices are very reasonable.  Once again, pies are TO DIE FOR! We've had their strawberry pie (x2), pumpkin pie, peanut butter chocolate pie and most recently, their mixed berry pie.  We're going to be moving across the valley and I'm actually a little upset this location won't be coming with us.
