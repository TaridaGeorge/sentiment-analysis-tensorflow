Kinda spicy, but not too spicy fried chicken. I saw this last time I was in Phoenix, and am glad I went this time. I also had the rice (I think it was dirty rice) and it was also a bit spicy but not too. I put the hot sauce on the bread for a while, but the spice of all the food started to catch up on me, so I stopped doing that. 

I had Coca Cola with a spritzer of Fanta Strawberry. Wow, that strawberry is pretty potent. It really had the taste. Will have to return and try some of the other things.
