Pane Bianco is a great place to take out of towners. My sister was visiting from chilly Boston last weekend, so I was determined keep her outdoors in this beautiful weather as much as possible. After roaming the downtown phoenix farmer's market, we enjoyed lunch at Pane Bianco. 

PB is sandwiched between a cafe (with amazing-looking baked goods) and a bike shop. The seating is outdoors on communal picnic tables. They keep their menu simple, offering just a few sandwiches and salads. The food items continue the theme of simplicity... they use very high quality ingredients, so a lot of toppings aren't necessary. I had fresh mozarella, basil, and proscuitto... So good! And the bread, oh the bread! Delicious!
