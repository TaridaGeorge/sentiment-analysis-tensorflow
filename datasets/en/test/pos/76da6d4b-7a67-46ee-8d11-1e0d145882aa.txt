One of my all time favorites I used to frequent two times a week but since I have cut down on dining out for lunch has slowed. This was the first place I ate at  that made a salad good enough to order over anything else. The service is fast and is more of a pickup than dine in but I have done both and it is ok. Here is a list of food I have tried and what I rate them at:

italian sub w/ feta added 5/5--favorite of mine
meatball/sausage calzone w/ feta added 5/5
greek salad 5/5
antipasto salad 4/5
wings 5/5
gyros 2/5(im not a fan of gyros though)
pizza 3/5( im not a fan of pizza much either but what they do have is good)
manicotti 2/5 (too saucy for me)
