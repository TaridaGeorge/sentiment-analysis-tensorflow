Man I wish I lived closer to this place because I always end up lit and full when I leave. First of all I don't even want to rave about their Tuesday special because I do not want to show up and ever wait for a seat but I guess they deserve the props. The $5 tuna with avocado and spicy sauce kicks AZZ and the garlic and ginger edamame is AMAZING! Don't leave with out trying the bottle rockets and a bomber! I love the presentation of their food, its like modern art. The place is cool and the servers are fun, friendly, and down to earth. (High five Lindsay- you're great!) Ahhh now I'm craving all of that. Looks like I know where I'll be tomorrow night after work.
