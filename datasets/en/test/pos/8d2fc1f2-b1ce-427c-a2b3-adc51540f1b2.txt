Brian acted as our buying agent and was able to negotiate the price down on a foreclosure.  He was responsive to our needs and kept us up to date on the transaction.  Being self-employed he also worked closely with our mortgage person and gave us solid advice to ensure the loan process went as smoothly as possible.  Great agent, highly recommended.
