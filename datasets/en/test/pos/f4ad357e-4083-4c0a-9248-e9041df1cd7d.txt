Awesome....  Came here not knowing what to expect but i was certainly not disappointed.  Beers were excellent.  EXCELLENT.   Highly surprised I have never heard of Sleepy Dog Brewing.  St Bernard and Wet Snout were 2 of the best brews I have ever tasted.  Great atmosphere, plenty of TVs. No food, but bar snacks are just fine for me.  Highly recommend!!!
