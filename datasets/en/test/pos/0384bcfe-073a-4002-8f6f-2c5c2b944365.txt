I had an emergency just 30 minutes before they closed and despite having a full schedule, they made the room for us to see one of the top docs.   Not only did every staff member come by and love-up my very uncomfortable boxer-baby; but they took several hours to give him the most thorough work-up ever!    My previous vets would have gouged me with high fees and/or unnecessary tests for a last minute emergency like this;  so imagine my delight to hear them suggest very sensible tests under a price schedule that was surprisingly reasonable.  In fact, the final invoice was BELOW what they quoted me in the room!    Doggy and Daddy are very happy; and planning to make AAWC out new regular vet.
