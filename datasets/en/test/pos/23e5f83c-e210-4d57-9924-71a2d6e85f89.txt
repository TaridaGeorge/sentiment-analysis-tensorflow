So I love clothes and I hate to iron . . . so many of my work clothes go to the drycleaners!

When we first moved to AZ I tried several and finally came across Oxford when I worked down the street. Now I work in Tempe and drive to Oxford to get my dry cleaning done! They do a great job and are priced right! Not to mention, they have great customer service!
