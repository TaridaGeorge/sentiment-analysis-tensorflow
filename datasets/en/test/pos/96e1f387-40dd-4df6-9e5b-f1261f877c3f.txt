This is an awesome place! The atmosphere is very comfortable, the service and food were excellent.  The owner James came to meet us and tell us about the food and restaurant...I have NEVER met a nicer restaurant owner! We felt like we've known him for years! My husband and I got burgers (I got the Cardinal, he got the Diablo).  Both were excellent and extremely tasty.  I got the sweet potato fries, which were perfectly cooked, but maybe just a bit too salty for my taste.  Next time we for sure will try the Cajun Mac-N-Cheese, it sounded delicious.  And I have to say that they have a great music soundtrack that they play in the restaurant- you have good taste James!  We eat out often and will  DEFINITELY add Zing to our dining rotation. Ha!
