Excellant, old fashioned (there is a relish tray people), delicious, expensive.  That about sums it up, dont expect more or less.  I highly recommend the wedge salad (its home made blue cheese) and the manhattans!  When they sat us the hostess coordinated our napkin color to what we were wearing to avoid lint.  Love that!  

P.S. Yes there are old people.  Old people have money and taste.  These are not little blue haired biddies.
