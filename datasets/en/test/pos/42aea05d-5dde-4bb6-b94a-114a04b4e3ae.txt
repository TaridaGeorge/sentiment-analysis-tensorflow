This place is da bomb!  This is my go to place whenever I'm in Phoenix.  Great food, great prices, great staff.  And the portions are huge so you'll never leave here hungry.  I've had the ribs, beans, sweet potato fries, and sweet potato pie and they are all great.  Now they just need to open a location in Los Angeles...
