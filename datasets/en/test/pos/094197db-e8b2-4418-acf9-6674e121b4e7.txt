This is the only sushi restaurant my wife and I will eat at in the Phoenix area. We've tried Tomo's, Nakama and the horrible sushi place in WestGate, but Fresh Wasabi is the best. Everything is always fresh and delicious. We usually get the Alaska, Phoenix and Tootsie rolls. They offer a military discount, and one of the sushi chefs is ex-Army and likes to come out and greet fellow military personnel.
