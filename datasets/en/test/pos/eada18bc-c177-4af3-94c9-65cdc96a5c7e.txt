Even if you don't live in the east Valley, it's worth the time and gas to buy your produce at the Superstition Market in Mesa. The prices are low and for the most part, the quality is good. Today I got cranberries for $0.50 a pound. Sweet potatoes were $0.49 a pound and yellow onions just $0.39 a pound.

The markets have weekly specials and prices are rarely what the supermarkets charge for fresh fruit and vegetables. Check them out and start saving on your family's food bills. The staff is friendly and helpful. We eat really well all year, thanks to this market.
