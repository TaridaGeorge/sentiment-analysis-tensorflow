I LOVE this store!  I went through it item by item when I was on an extended visit from Seattle last summer and told them I felt like having furniture shipped home.  I am now going to re-locate in the Phoenix area and rather than haul all my furniture down, I am going to re-create my world via this store!  Beautiful things that do not look used and good prices!  If you are looking for junk do NOT shop here, LOL!!

Thank you for your existence!!
