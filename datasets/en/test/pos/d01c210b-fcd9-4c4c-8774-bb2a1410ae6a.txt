Helped my department at work a lot and mostly from out of state via email and phone. Ordered some foam core posters and custom size print pieces. 

When we physically got to Arizona to pick up our order, the only snag was they lost my work order and it took quite some time looking for it when I was in a hurry to get to a work conference that we needed the posters for.
