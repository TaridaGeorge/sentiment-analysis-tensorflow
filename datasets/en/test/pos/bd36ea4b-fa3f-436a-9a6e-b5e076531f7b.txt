This review is just for the bazookie dessert, cookie with ice cream. It was such a whirlwind evening I don't even recall seeing this on the menu before it showed up at our table. As we pulled up into the lot right before they were closing we ordered 2 of these and quickly, illegally parked to devour our dessert. Imagine warm succulent cookie dough, crispy crust on the outside, warm gooey in the middle, and just cold ice cream floating on top. Orgasmic Heaven!!
when is this coming to California?!?!
Oh, the staff is warm and friendly and treats you like family even when they are about to close.
Go!
