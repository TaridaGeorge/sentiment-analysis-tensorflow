I'm from San Diego and after moving here, I was searching for a decent Thai restaurant. I've tried more than 5 Thai restaurants in Arizona. My favorite is Siam! It's authentic and extremely good. It's comparable to San Diego Thai cuisine. However, I think Siam has the best Pad Thai I've ever tried! The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is very unique. My favorite restaurant in Arizona!!

Favorite dishes,

- Pad Thai
- Pad See Ew
- Spicy Basil Fried Rice
- Spicy Curry with Fried Fish (I'm not sure what the Thai name of this dish is)
