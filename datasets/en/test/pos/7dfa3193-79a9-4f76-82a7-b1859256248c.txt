If you are from New England and live in the desert now and miss good pizza, look no further than Sal's! Big crust on the edges, thin crust on the bottom, large slices you have to fold in half, yep its all there! I like a plain old school cheese pizza but if your looking for more options they have those too. Best of all is price. $11 for a 19 inch cheese pizza these days is one of the best deals for real pizza.
