You will not find a better Italian restaurant in Arizona. This family owned and operated eatery is simply amazing from start to finish. Chefs Sonia and Tony DiFranco execute their menu to perfection. Their wine list is unique, affordable and offers something for everyone. You need to try the butter nut squash ravioli (you will not be disappointed). They unfortunately close during the month of July, so you will have to wait until August to enjoy everything the DiFranco family has to offer.
