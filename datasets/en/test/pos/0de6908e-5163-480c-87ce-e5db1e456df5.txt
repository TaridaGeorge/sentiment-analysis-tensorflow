I only ever get their fish tacos, which is a Friday only special. Absolutely love this place and the fish tacos. You need to check it out and make sure to order two, because you will being wishing for another one if you don't. This is the Two Hippies off of 40th street and Thomas. Not the one on Camelback road, although they have them there, 7 days a week, but they are made a bit differently.
