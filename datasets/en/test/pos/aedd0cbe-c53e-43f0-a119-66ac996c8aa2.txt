The food is great! Too many schnitzels to choose from and every one I have had is great. Try the rouladen if you happen to go when it's a special, it is amazing! Service is good and the portions are too big to eat in one sitting, you will be taking some home. Nice selection of imported German beer, so don't expect to get a domestic brew.
