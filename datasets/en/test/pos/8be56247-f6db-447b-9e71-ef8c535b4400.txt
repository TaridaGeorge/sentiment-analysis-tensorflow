I don't know where the bad reviews come from... I think each an every one of you might just disagree with life itself. Go be a pessimist somewhere else! If you prefer Applebees go back there.

Anyways... I've eaten here many times and have enjoyed every meal.  The appetizers are amazing (especially the skewered meatballs and charred jalapeno poppers). The main courses are amazing too. I've had the surf and turf skewer, and the bacon wrapped scallops skewer. Both are money! And the dessert, oh man. Chocolate bread pudding with banana ice cream CAN'T be beat!

Long story short... check it out! You'll love everything from the atmosphere to the food.
