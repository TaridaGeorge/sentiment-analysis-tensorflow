Stopped in here about 20 minutes before last call.  Greeted and seated right away at the middle bar.  Decor is very mod.  Blue lights everywhere.  The restrooms are fresh and clean.  I loved it.

We ordered two Delux drafts and a double chocolate stout.  The lights come on.  The waiter urges us strongly to do a shot.  We knew it was a bad idea.  No go.

Then came the freshly baked cookies [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/NJ0RzuWd5xDqfJejYQZ65g?select=RWLEGQXa2ss05mth8fxn-w].  So enticing.  The waiter says no free cookie until you take a shot.  We really wanted the cookies.

In the end, no shot, free cookies.  Extra star for service!
