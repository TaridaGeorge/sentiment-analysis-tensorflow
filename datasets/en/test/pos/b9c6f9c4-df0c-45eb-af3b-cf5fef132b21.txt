I have been here a handful times since opening day, and couldn't be happier with the best coffee house in Phoenix!

The layout and ambiance is perfect! The service is top notch; the owners are the employees and always up for a chat. 

If you are hungry, try the chorizo burrito, you won't regret it! And that sums it all up, you won't regret spending your afternoon here and enjoying the best coffee around. (A quick tip: try the Cubano. Having had it growing up it is made perfectly!)
