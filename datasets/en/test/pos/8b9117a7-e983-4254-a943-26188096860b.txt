Where do I begin. Was in Scottsdale on biz and celebrated Valentines Day with another couple. The scallops were just right. The Chop Salad is the best in the nation, possible exception, the 1905 at Tampa's venerable Columbia. We split Sea Bass & a petite filet. I love the butter they cook the steak in. Asparagus & sweet potatoes along side. 4 forks to the Chocolate Sin Cake. Ask for Stu or Stacia, Cost? If you have to ask........
