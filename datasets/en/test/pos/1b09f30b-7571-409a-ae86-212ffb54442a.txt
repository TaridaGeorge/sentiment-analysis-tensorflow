This by far is the BEST Sushi place! From experience, every where we went for sushi there will always something that was made different or not tasting very good. At Sakana's everything was GREAT!. Their happy hour is Sunday through Thursdays all day. Granted, on the happy hour menu instead of 8 pieces on a roll you get only 5 rolls. Dont let that dissapoint you too much, The rolls are big. Price is a little more then what we would pay at RA or Kona for happy hour but it is all worth it. Definately will be going back and we will bring friends!
