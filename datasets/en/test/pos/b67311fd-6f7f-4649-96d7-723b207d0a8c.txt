Simply Stunning.  Cowboy Ciao has one of the most original and delicious menus I have ever seen.  The service is impeccable, and the wait staff is knowledgeable and and friendly.  Every single thing I have ever eaten at Cowboy Ciao was astounding.  I just can't recommend it enough.  
      The atmosphere is upscale casual, and the food is like a modern American fusion cuisine with southwestern influences.  The only drawback of Cowboy Ciao is its cost.  The prices are very high, and the food is very expensive.  However, when compared to other restaurants where you might pay the same amount for your meal, Cowboy Ciao is worth every penny.  Go there. Now.
