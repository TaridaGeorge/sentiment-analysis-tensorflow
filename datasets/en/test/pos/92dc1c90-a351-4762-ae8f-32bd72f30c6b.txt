Take a flying leap Denny's!  It's the Bear or nothing from now on.  I knew the portions were going to be huge so I ordered from the Senior/Small Plate section and  there was still a ton of food, easily 2000-3000 calories.  So a half order of chicken fried steak comes with smashed red potatoes, green beans with bacon (so f-ing good) big garlic bread and of course a dinner salad to start with.

Friendly service too.  This place surely doesn't suck.
