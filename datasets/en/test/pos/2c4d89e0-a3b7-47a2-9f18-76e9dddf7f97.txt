Pleasantly surprise to say the least, their happy hour last until 10pm. When you sit down you get free miso, edamame, and sesame salad. My boyfriend and I ordered three rolls and two iced teas thinking we would be paying at least $30 (what we usually pay at RA) and our bill was only $17.17! The spicy yellowtail roll was my favorite. We say at the sushi bar and were very entertained by the chefs, one who grunted and yelled "hoy".
We eat sushi at least once every two weeks, and this is probably our new favorite spot.
