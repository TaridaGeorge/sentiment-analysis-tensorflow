OK. first thing! you think is just bbq but when you see the menu WOW they have mexican food and not just any mexican food i mean i am mexican n im tired of just tacos,burritos, etc the comun thing ugh! NO this guys know whats up they have pollo en mole, chiles rellenos, COCHINITA PIBIL!!!, enchiladas suizas gosh i just got hungry to think about them! LOL but of course they still have the bbq ribs so dont think is no more bbq anymore they just were smart n made a fusion. 
the service is perfect and quick! if you wanna try legit mexican food that you cant find anywhere this is your place and if your friends dont want mex they still have the great bbq ribs.
