This museum is like no other. It's full of musical Instruments from all over the world. There is a room for each continent containing traditional instruments used by people in different countries. There's even an experience room where you get to play with the instruments hands-on without being yelled that! I didn't have enough time to see everything because I was only there for an hour. But I will be back! I know the Taylor Swift exhibit just opened and I want to explore more of the other rooms with different countries. It was the most fun I've ever had learning about music- that's for sure!
