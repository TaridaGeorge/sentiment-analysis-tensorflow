Great lunch sushi special: Two rolls (spicy tuna + one from a separate list) + miso soup for $9.

I came here with my brother and sister for lunch after we had gone carting nearby. The service was excellent and we all ordered the lunch sushi special. Spicy tuna roll was sooo good. Fortunately, my brother couldn't finish his, and I obviously couldn't let it go to waste! lol! ;P

I also had the yellowtail/scallion roll which was fresh and delicious as well. For appetizers, we got the cucumber salad and squid salad. Both huge portions (especially the squid salad) and tasty!

They had a pretty extensive menu with lots of other rolls. Mmm...will have to come back here next time I'm in PHX.
