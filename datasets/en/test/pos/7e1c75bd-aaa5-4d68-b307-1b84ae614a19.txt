Fantastic!!!  Miracle Method of Tempe just completed my shower & vanity in my master bath.  It was my first experience with them and I am glad I found them.  They took a 1978 master bath & made it look NEW!  It is incredible.  The entire team, from the owner, Shawn to Robin - in the office & Bob the technician were absolutely wonderful to work with.  I have another bath & a half that I will definitely use Miracle Method.
