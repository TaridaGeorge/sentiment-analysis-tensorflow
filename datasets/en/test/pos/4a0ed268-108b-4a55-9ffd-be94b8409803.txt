I cannot say enough fantastic things about Tony's. He is THE BEST in Scottsdale/Phoenix, and you'd be foolish to take your leather anywhere else. The service is ALWAYS fast and his prices are beyond reasonable. This man can seriously fix anything and will sometimes do it within two minutes of you walking in. I have told countless friends/family members about his shop and insist they give him a go. His skill and customer service are outstanding, and I will forever be a repeat customer.
