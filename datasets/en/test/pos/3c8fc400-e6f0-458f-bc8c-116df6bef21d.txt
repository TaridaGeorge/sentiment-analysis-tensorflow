This hidden gem is located just across the street from my pad so short walk over and I am there.  I have only been over a few times and the shop is setup in an old historic home, the staff is super friendly, and the finds are many.  The clothes are cool and not overpriced like Buffalo Exchange.  Anytime you are looking for a few unique fun vintage/retro items to add into your wardrobe without breaking the bank hit up Butter Toast... You won't be disappointed and be sure to mention YELP for 20% discount!
