This TJMaxx/Home Goods location is awesome! It is always super clean and organized, the employees are extremely friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful, and the selection is excellent. I've found so many things I was looking for, and then some, here! TJMaxx is already my favourite chain store of this type (better than Ross, Marshalls, etc.. imho), but this location is even better! The prices are always great, and they carry some very nice items. Whether you are looking for luggage, clothing, furniture, silverware, or household decorations, this store is likely to have something you'll like!
