I have been here so far quite a few times and have not been disappointed yet. Great atmosphere, great food, great live music on fridays and saturdays. I have been here for both dinner and drink and for lunch and a beer. The atmosphere is always laid back and never really uncomfortable. Looking for a great irish pub experience here in phx, az.... Rosie McCaffrey's is your place for small and quaint. Enjoy.
