This is my go to place for great Asian food. Its priced reasonably. The quality is excellent. Top marks for the Teriyaki  chicken and the fried rice. The Teriyaki chicken is not the usual sweet stuff. Its a hearty almost beef broth like flavor. I'm a huge fan of the friend rice as well. I've had numerous beef dishes. The meat is always super tender. The staff is super nice, very attentive, always quick to take your order or get a drink. Its never busy for dinner either. With a restaurant.com certificate it makes the deal even better.
