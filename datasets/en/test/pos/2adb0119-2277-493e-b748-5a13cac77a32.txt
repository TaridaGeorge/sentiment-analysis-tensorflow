I really enjoyed the 8th Street Ale. For dinner, I asked the server what's the "must-have" here at Four Peaks and she recommended the Salmon B.L.T. Excellent recommendation! Everyone agreed that it's a place we have to return to when we're in town. Our server was friendly and attentive, and kept the brew coming. If there was anything negative to mention, it would be that the designated driver never got his water refilled even once. Numerous flat-screen TVs dot the joint, as well. Street parking was sparce, but it was well worth the walk!
