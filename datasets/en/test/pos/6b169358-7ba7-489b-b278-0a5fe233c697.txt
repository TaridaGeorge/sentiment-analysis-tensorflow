For an old school burger and shake this place is great! I still have yet to try their hot dogs and onion rings. Burgers are simple and greasy. The fries are fresh cut and delicious! I've had the vanilla, chocolate and peanut butter+chocolate shake. Some of the best milk shakes I have ever had! Their lemonade is also FRESH. Beware if you like your lemonade sweet cause their is very tangy. Anyways, great place for a greasy burger and fries :)
