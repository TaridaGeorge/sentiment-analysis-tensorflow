Absolutely loved it! We booked a stay-cation here with a group of friends and had a fabulous time. The staff was exceedingly polite and hospitable from the moment we stepped foot on the grounds. Good customer service goes a long way with me and I could not have asked for more. The property is gorgeous and the accommodations are everything you could hope for. All we wanted to do is hang out poolside with the kids and they had great time. Between the pool, the hot tub, and the water slide (which my almost three year old twins LOVED) everyone had fun. We've been to other resorts in Phoenix and this was by far the best. I can't wait to go back!
