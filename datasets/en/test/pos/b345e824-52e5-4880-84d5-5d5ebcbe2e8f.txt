I must say that this is one of the only restaurants that my wife an I really stand behind.  EVERY time we come here, we are always blown away by how wonderful the pho is.  No MSG, free range chicken, super sweet music on Fridays; it's great.  In all fairness, i have not tried much on the menu because the pho is just THAT GOOD!  we did however have some tiger prawn spring rolls and some green tea ice cream that pretty much knocked our socks off as well.  We are regulars here and will be for a long time.
