Awesome design to the place. I noticed the stamp on the box mimicked the brick detail shape on the outside of the building. I was expecting a same-old-regular brick oven fired pizza, but the flavor was awesomely tasty! And they had my favorite toppings, artichoke, sun dried tomatoes and prosciutto. Ingredients tasted fresh.
