We've been visiting this resort since the very day it opened.  Even when we lived w/n walking distance we would stay!  Now we are 25 mins away, and still have amazing wknd get-aways. Views, food, rooms, lobby, spa all GR8!  Summer has dive-in movie pkgs.  Luv to people watch in the huge lobby.  Rooms decorately in lively happy colours.  The only downer is the high cost of the kids club, which i hate.  (Princess resort is free!).  Sunday brunch is Fabby.  Drinks around the outdoor fire pits is beautiful.  Treat someone to a gorgeous view & drink 1 day or nite - i will blow them away.  (ie: glass of champange with bowl or strwaberries n cream - wow - how romantic is that??)
