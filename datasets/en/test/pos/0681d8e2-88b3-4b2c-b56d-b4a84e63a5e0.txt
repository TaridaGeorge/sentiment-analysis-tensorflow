I'm a self serve soft serve snob and I will go out of my way to go to Yogurtology.  Yogurt quality and flavor is top notch.  Creamy, not too soft, perfect flavor!  Toppings are endless and I love that they have Nutella in squeeze bottle.  The girl working the cashier for the last couple of Thursdays has been awesome, friendly and helpful.  Only thing I'd like to see is more seating.  Otherwise, rock on with your bad selves.  Love you yogurtology.  Can you bring one to Tempe?  PLEAAAAZZZZEEEEE!!!!
