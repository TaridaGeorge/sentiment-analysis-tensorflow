i love palatte. 

since i first became addicted in the summer, it has been a weekly fixture in my life. since the weather has been inviting sitting outside with a group of fantastic people is so wonderful. everything i have eaten there has been delicious. the lattes and mimosas are outstanding. the baked goods are always something different and interesting and tasty. 

spending a sunday morning here is my favorite thing in the world. sunday morning has quality musicians playing quality songs.

the wait for food on the weekend is always pretty crazy, but if you have a morning to spare. i highly recommend spending it here. get a muffin right away and sit down and enjoy some music and the fresh air. it will be worth it.
