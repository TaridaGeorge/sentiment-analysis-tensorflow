At this moment, I'm on a frozen yogurt kick and have tried a ton of these trendy shops. So far, Orange Leaf has been the best.  The flavors don't have that diet-yogurty after taste that some others do. I typically stick with the peanut butter and cookies and cream and they are yum! Plus the toppings are the best, including peanut butter cookie dough. Major plus.  I do love the Oatmeal flavor that Yogurtology and Zoyo have, so I'm hoping they bring it in.  Other than that, it's perfect!
