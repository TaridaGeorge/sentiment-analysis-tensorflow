I've been looking for a good Chinese restaurant for almost 3 years since I moved from SF bay area. I had a dim sum lunch today and my tummy is happy, happy. It's a good sign that restaurant was crowded and I saw many Asian customers. I've been dreaming about eating dim sum for a long time. I had sticky rice, shumai, har gow, gailan and sesame balls. I love them all, can't wait to go there again. The price is very reasonable and very authentic. No more P.F Chang or Panda Express, lol
