Amazing food. The vegetarian mini tacos are to live for! And if you aren't vegetarian, the buttermilk chicken melts in your mouth. 

Great service depends on what server you get. 5 + stars for the food, 4 stars for the service (the best server works at the bar most nights, I can't recall his name, sorry!)
