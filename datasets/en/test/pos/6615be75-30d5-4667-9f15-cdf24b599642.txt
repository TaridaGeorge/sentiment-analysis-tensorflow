Ordered the Bento Special plate, with Chicken BBQ, Spam,Mahi etc... but then I saw the Poke Plate (Hawaiian Sashimi) and had to have that. They were very nice to change the order without charging me the difference. They suggested I try it with the Shoyu which was a good suggestion.

Everything was really good, next time will try their other varied dishes.
