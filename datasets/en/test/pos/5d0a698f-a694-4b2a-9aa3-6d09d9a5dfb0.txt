The grocery part of the store has the cheapest fruit in town, especially if you make it there on a Wednesday.  Their meat is also really cheap but you can find anything there a regular grocery store has.  Their diner side is the best Mexican food in the valley.  Very authentic, and very cheap.  So good!  I'd recommend getting a torta sandwich with a fresa flavored "aqua". But really you can't go wrong.
