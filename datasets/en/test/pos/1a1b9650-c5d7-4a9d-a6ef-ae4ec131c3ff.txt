Love love love.  We came here for a Saturday morning breakfast.  This bakery has STYLE!  Wish they were in California - they would do so well!  Gray & pink walls, vintage framed magazine covers from French Vogue, handsome wood tables, fun flexible pink doily placemats.  

We ordered a chai latte, almond croissant, and a cage-free omelette with goat cheese and mushrooms + a side of micro greens.  Lovely, delicate, simple, French-inspired.  We enjoyed a relaxing breakfast & read the local newspaper.  Please - come to the Bay Area!  :)
