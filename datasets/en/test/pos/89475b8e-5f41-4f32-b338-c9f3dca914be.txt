One stop shopping for your beloved four-legged friend!  Wag and Wash has replaced my usual dog food/supply store.  They offer an array of high quality pet food and even refrigerators full of raw food.  You can find great herbal treatments for your pets, toys, healthy treats, leashes, fancy bowls, etc., and they even have a counter full of gourmet treats for those special occasions.  

I almost forgot the "Wash" from the "Wag".  They offer a place to pamper your pet with a fancy do-it-yourself wash or you can pay to have someone do it for ya.

I suggest bringing your doggie to help you shop but be warned about the live-in orange tabby cat(s) sleeping around the store in case your doggie doesn't play nice with cats like mine.

Kudos to Miguel, the store manager who is extremely knowledgeable and helpful.
