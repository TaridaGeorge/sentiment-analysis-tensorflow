Great pizza! I went to pick up a large pepperoni and was surprised at own big the slices were. You can tell they use quality ingredients. The pizza was hot, fresh, and the cheese melts in your mouth. I ordered a Pepsi while waiting and even the glass was big. The atmosphere seemed really nice and you can eat on the patio where the small pond is.

I reheated a piece in the oven the day after my visit and it was just as good as it was when I got it fresh, that says a lot. 

If you're willing to pay for the quality (I paid $23.00 including the Pepsi) with so many other pizza restaurants charging $10.00 for a pizza then it's well worth it.
