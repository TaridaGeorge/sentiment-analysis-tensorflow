I am hardly ever in the area. But sometimes i exit on the 101 and cactus and go straight down to the mall. I love there foccacia bread. I always get a sandwich and add the pesto mayo sauce to it. And no one can resist their Molten choco cookies. 

This is a great little bakery who makes traditional artisan breads. Their breads are awesome. If you are one of those whinny bitches that say, 'oh this bread is too hard' stay away. First of all, you wouldn't know what good bread is if i hit you with a day old baguette. Their bread is crispy slightly burnt on the outside and soft on the inside. Perfect artistry here.
