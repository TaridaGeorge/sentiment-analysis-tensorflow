Little Saigon has been a favorite of mine for several years. I live in Philadelphia, but my parents retired out in Sun City West and discovered Little Saigon through the newspaper. I have been to a number of vietnamese restaurants and this is always my benchmark, but nothing has beaten it yet. John and his wife, Ha, do an amazing job and are so friendly!
