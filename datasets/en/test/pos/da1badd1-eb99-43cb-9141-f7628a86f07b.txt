If you love accessories and you love a bargain ...you MUST  head to Charming Charlie.  It's a complete dress you up kinda place. The store is chocked full of necklaces, bracelets, rings , purses, earrings , scarves etc. all set up by color and type. Quality is good enough to wear a season but cheap enough you won't be bummed to lose it. Think Forever 21 jewelery but expand that by more  colors , kinds and types. 
They  have good looking fake pearls, turquoise and gems.   They also have a lot of great vintage looking pieces and little wallets/ wristlets. 
I know that I will going back and getting lots of fun stuff!
