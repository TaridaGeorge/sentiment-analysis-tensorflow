You can't beat Shriner's meat!! 
After a visit to Short Leash dogs (they serve Shriner's meats) I had to go to the source. 
I am of German decent and grew up with some dang good weenies. They have to be in a natural casing with a great flavor and snap. We got two pounds and they are marvelous, just pick them up and dip in some good mustard and you are set. 
We also bought some traditional brats. These were the best I have ever had. The flavor was outstanding. 
Last but not least we got some of the bacon. They will slice it to your preferred thickness and boy is it good! 
The prices here are fair especially considering the quality you receive. 

Go get some! (Wieners that is) :)
