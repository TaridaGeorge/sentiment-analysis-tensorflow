We have 3 kids with very severe food allergies (dairy/milk, peanut, tree nuts, egg, sesame, flax, etc.). The manager patiently worked with me and made sure the items we ordered would be safe and free from cross contamination. Food was great!  And, worked just fine for our allergies.  Tons of vegan options as well as chicken, beef, lamb, etc. Thanks Keith and the staff at Bombay Spice!!!!
