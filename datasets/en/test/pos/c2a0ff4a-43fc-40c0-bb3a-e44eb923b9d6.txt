Great food! Wonderful patio!! And amazing company!!! I am so glad they have only relocated because this is a treasure in a sea of junk:) The food is quite delicious and I cannot tell you how good the caprese pizza was. It is more than enough to share. Love love love the pesto base topped with fresh mozzarella and sliced tomatoes. The crust was light and fresh. Really enjoyed the citrus mint iced tea and to top off the meal I enjoyed the no bake chocolate and peanut butter cookies. soy free of course. This place is so amazing and I love the little changes they made since relocating downtown. Did I tell you I had great company for lunch? Thanks Michael!!!
