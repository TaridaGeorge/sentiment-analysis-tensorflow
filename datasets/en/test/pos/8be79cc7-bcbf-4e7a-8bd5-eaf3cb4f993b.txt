Forgot the name of the burger but had fresh jalepenos, hatch chilies, sauteed onions, thousand island, cheese, lettuce and tomatoes. Sooo good. Only five bucks with a drink and fries. I would have paid much more. Brandon, the guy working the counter, was very friendly. Even though it is counter service, he brought us our food and came and checked on us after we had eaten a few bites. I will be going here again.
