This place is GREAT!  And if you don't say so, they'll have your comments deleted!  So even though there's absolutely no smoke in their meats, even though the dominant flavor in the ribs is ridiclously un-yummy amounts of black pepper, I have to say, it's great!  No, really, I have to say it, because they won't let anyone say anything else.  Awesome, I tell you!  Most awesomely sorry excuse for barbecue you will ever run into, but it's GREAT!  Can't you see the smile on my face?  Yeah.
