I have always been a cupcake lover.  When my hubby and I went to Urban cookies about a year ago. I feel in love with the cupcakes from Urban Cookies.  My two favorite cupcakes are the peanut butter and the strawberry cupcakes.   So,  if you like cupcakes you will definitely have to go to Urban Cookies.  :)
