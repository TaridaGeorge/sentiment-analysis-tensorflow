I like coming to this Target during my lunch break because it is super relaxing. It's never too crowded, and the staff consistently gives excellent customer service. I once realized I had forgotten my wallet when I was being rung up. Instead of making me feel like a d- bag, the cashier was helpful and asked the manager if I could pay by check without an id. The manager said they could hold my stuff for me in guest services, and I could come by later. She put me at ease and accommodated me without making me feel like I was a nuisance. This Target is the best kept secret in the Valley!
