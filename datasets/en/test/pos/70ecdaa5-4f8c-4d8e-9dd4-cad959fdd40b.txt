We saw a movie here tonight, very comfortable seats, very clean. The movie had an enjoyable,  unpredictable story, great acting, and honest emotions. So much better than regular, commercial movies. Everyone who loves movies should go to downtown Phoenix, just about a block south of Roosevelt. We don't want to lose this important place! We deserve to have it right here. I've lived here my whole life and I was so glad to have this place open up.
 The people who own and work for the theater are very nice and welcoming. Come and check it out!
