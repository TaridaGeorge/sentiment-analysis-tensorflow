I was there just last night, and today received a ROTD for my original review. Too weird.

Updates - They mix a great margarita! No fluorescent green pre mixed Margarita mix - they make it themselves with fresh lime juice. Yum.

The wine list is small but good. My current fave is the Argentinian Malbec.  It's only $6 a glass, and they pour generously. Very tasty wine.

The seating is not comfy if you like to slouch. If you sit up straight, it's fine. But seriously.... good posture is over rated.

It gets a little cold in there once in a while during the winter. Wear long sleeves. :) After 3 glasses of the Malbec last night, I didn't care.

This place has really been growing on me... nice to have such a great neighborhood watering hole!
