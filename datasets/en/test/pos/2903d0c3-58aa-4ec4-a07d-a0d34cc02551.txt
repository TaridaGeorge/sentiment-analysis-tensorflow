I just moved back to Phoenix from Las Vegas, so I get to experience the magic that is Fez whenever I want now! 

I've taken to going Tuesday nights for Tini' Tuesday when they offer $3 martini's. There's not a better deal in the valley on Tuesday night. The Fez burger is an oral explosion with honey molasses BBQ sauce, cinnamon pears, and crispy onion strings! 

You'll find me on the patio all summer!
