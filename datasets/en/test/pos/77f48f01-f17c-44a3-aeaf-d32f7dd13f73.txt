Great food, great ambiance, good service and nice selection of drinks and food. I normally get a seafood curry, not sure of the name, but it is amazing. Everything I have ever had here, is very good. The owner is very professional and easy to talk to. It feels like a small town/family atmosphere once you walk through the door. Love the decor and lots to do, within walking distance, if you are in the mood to hang out for a while.
