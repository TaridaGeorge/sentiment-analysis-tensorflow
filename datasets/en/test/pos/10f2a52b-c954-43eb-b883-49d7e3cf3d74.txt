I will keep it short.

Salad bar: Mediocre, not that great. But it's a bbq buffet, it shouldn't matter.
Meat: Some of them were a overcooked, but they were all very delicious. Very responsive when your card is green, which is great because other places make you wait.
They automatically give you fried bananas, mash potatoes and corn bread! They were okay, the bananas were delicious though!
Drinks: a tiny glass bottle of coke is 3 bucks. They don't serve fountain drinks :( 

They had great customer service, and the cuts of meet were good. I will definietly come here during lunch...I don't think it is worth the dinner price though ($40).
