This place is fantastic and cheap. The flavors are hand crafted an real, not the product of the flavor syrups that every other yogurt shop buys from the same company. There are new flavors all the time, so you should check in at least once a week.

The owner is there working the shop from 11 to 11 every day, so you'll always get great service and he's open to suggestions about new flavors.

If you like frozen yogurt, you have no excuse for not patronizing this place. Try it out!
