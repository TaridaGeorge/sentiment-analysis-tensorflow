This is probably the best Indian cuisine I have had 'hands down'....now having said that...I will say that they are not known for their decor or service. But if you can look beyond that....I can clearly say that they spend their efforts then on their cuisine. 
Having grown up amongst their culinary culture and nurtured a desire in cooking some of their specialities - Jewel of the Crown is pretty much tops for me!
My favorite WAS Vig's in Vancouver, but that is now a close second to Jewel of the Crown.
From the Samosa's to start, Mulligtawny Soup, Kormas/Saag/Vindaloo with Raita, finish with Gulab Jamun ---YUM!!!
