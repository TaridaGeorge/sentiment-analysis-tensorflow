For a quieter, more hip bar than what you'll likely find right on Mill Ave, head to Bison Witches!  The pub food menu is reasonably priced, and the nachos are delicious!  The beer selection here is awesome!  It's the only bar in town that I know of that serves beers from the elusive Canadian Unibrue.  The best beer at the bar is "La Fin du Monde," and it'll be served to you in a wine glass.  The atmosphere is fun but not as trashy as other bars right on the street.  A great place to people-watch!  There's a nice-sized outdoor area for smokers.  The inside is clean.  Service is fast, friendly, and personalized.  It's my favorite bar in all of Maricopa County!
