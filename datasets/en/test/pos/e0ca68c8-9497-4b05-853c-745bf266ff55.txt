Anyone who can find fault with this establishment is impossible to please...period.  This resort is exceptional in nearly every way.  The grounds are extremely intimate and phenomenally well designed and maintained...exotic, cozy, sexy, exclusive, warm, inviting.  Pool , workout room, yoga and spa services - quite nice.  Quiet classical guitar playing throughout the grounds by day, candlelit and the air "scented" with a fantastic piano player at night.  The food was way above average, the staff; front desk, concierge, bartenders, valet, "chambermaids", maintenance engineers were all extremely friendly, courteous and timely.  The other patrons were mature, respectful adults and we had the best time.  One last plus from my angle: no kids...YAY!!!
