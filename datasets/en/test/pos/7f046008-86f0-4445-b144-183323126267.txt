Had a great visit at Dr. Cohen's! He made me feel comfortable and was very talkative. We had great, smooth conversation, and Dr. Cohen was interested in my life and what I do. He is a great listener and a happy guy! The office visit was quick, and he described what he was doing throughout the process. We also had a few good laughs!

Dr. Cohen's staff was friendly and personable, and I was seen quickly. The office is very clean and welcoming.

Would definitely return to Dr. Cohen!
