This is one of the better festivals I have been to here in AZ. The selection for food is HUGE! So much to choose from. I went with full intentions to satisfy my plate lunch craving and that's what I got. Delicious chicken teriyaki with rice & mac salad. Besides that there was every kind of meat imaginable, kahlua pig, shrimp, lomi lomi salmon, banana egg rolls, malasadas, kona coffee, the list goes on.

There are lots of booths with interesting crafts. I loved the Hawaiian snacks tents where you could find every kind of dried fruit and lots of authentic Hawaiian and Asian inspired candies. The entertainment was great too - there were dance acts, bands, and more on stages throughout the festival. And on a hot day what's better than a real shave ice? So refreshing and love the little ice cream surprise on the bottom.
