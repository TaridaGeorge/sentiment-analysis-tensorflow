I probably would've given this a 4.5, if I could've..but not because of the service, or the food--both of those are amazing (especially the skillets)...  The prices might be a little higher than some surrounding restaurants, but they're still pretty decent for what you get.  The ambience leaves a bit to be desired--the tables are a bit cheap and the restaurant has an industrial feel to it.  But the service and food are BOTH 5-star!
