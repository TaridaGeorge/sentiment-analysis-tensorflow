What a great find!  Great service, food, atmosphere.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  A good story behind the ambience.  Just ask one of the very attentive wait help or in our case, the owner.  The aroma and decor added to the night.  Can't wait to go back again and try something differnt.  Mac n cheese...mmmmmm.
