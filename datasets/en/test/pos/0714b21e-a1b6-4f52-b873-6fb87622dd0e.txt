I was recently in Scottsdale and ate here 3 mornings in a row. I can't think of anything they can improve on here. Delicious, well-cooked food and great service. Loved the coffee, fresh squeezed orange juice, bacon (perfectly thick, chewy and crispy around edges), eggs cooked perfectly (had them both scrambled and over easy), fluffy pancakes and crispy hash browns. Even the butter that came with the toast and pancakes was soft and easy to spread. This place is just perfect. Wish they were in every city.
