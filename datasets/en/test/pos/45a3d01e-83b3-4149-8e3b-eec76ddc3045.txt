This place was really awesome. Went with the NERDs Meetup group a few months back to watch Summer Wars, and have been back with friends a couple times since.

I really liked the atmosphere of the place, very almost bohemian in nature. The drinks were priced ok. I was very surprised to find the theater was an actual theater, I sort of assumed it was going to be a bar with a TV behind the counter but it was an honest to goodness lights out theater seating room with a projector and everything. The image quality was great as well as the audio.
