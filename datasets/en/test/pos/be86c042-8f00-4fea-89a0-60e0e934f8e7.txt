This bookstore is the diadem in the crown of all that is shopping local. The selection and knowledge of the staff are huge for such limited square footage, not just books but really wonderful and unique gift selections. If they don't have a book in stock,  they will in less than a week. Their bathrooms are much cleaner and easier to access then Amazons, and don't forget to pick up a calendar, their community events cater to all ages and tastes. If that isn't enough to get you to visit, they are attached to a Wildflower Bread company (tasty food and beverages) and just down the way from Hoodlum's Records (Best Music Store in AZ!)
