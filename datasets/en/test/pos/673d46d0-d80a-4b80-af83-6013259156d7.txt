Cibo = pizza perfection.  I've been to many of the "top" pizza places in the valley, and I've come to a conclusion: you won't find a place better than this in Phoenix. I frequent here quite often.  I'm truly in love.

Dessert crepes are also amazing. Just try one. Any one.

The service is great. The waitstaff is extremely attentive, including the hostess/host. The food comes out quickly. Very quickly. These are things to appreciate, but I'm reviewing this place because the food is fantastic.
