Had a nice lunch at Planet Sub that just opened up South of my house. My Fiance and I have both worked for Planet Sub's in Wichita and Kansas City and were very sad to move away from great oven baked subs! I got word that P Sub opened up in Chandler and went down for lunch and had an AMAZING southwest chicken sandwich and my fiance had The Torpedo. Everything was as i remember it 4 years ago. nothing beats Fresh Baked Bread made IN THE STORE and that chicken is to die for. if you are in the area then be sure to stop here for a sandwich! i hope Planet Sub expands down here!
