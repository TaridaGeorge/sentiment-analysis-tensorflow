I work in a nearby office building so I have been eating here for the past 3 years at least once a week. The staff is always friendly and my order is always ready for me. My faves are the bacon breakfast burrito,the turkey cranberry and the chicken ceasar salad. I highly recommend Ladybug Cafe to anybody.
