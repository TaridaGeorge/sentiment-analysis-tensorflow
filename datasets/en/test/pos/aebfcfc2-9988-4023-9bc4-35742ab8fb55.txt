This mall is pretty damn awesome!!!! Dillards in there has the best shit ever! def my new fave spot to shop. i bought a few things there. cheap prices for brand names.

Went to windsor and bought a $50 dress... my area in cali doesnt even carry nice dresses like this windsor O_O hitting up this mall when i come back :D
