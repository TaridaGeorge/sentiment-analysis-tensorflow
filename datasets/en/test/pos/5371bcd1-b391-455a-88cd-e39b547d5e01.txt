Well, our little Vixen passed away a few months ago. It took me a while to want to write about it, but it does give me another great (considering the circumstances) opportunity to review WTAH. The techs and Dr. Rollins were excellent in allowing us to say goodbye to our girl with dignity. They even sent us a card and made a pawprint for us after she passed away. I'll never take our dogs anywhere else. Thanks guys.
