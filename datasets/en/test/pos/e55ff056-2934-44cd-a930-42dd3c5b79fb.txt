This is one of my favorite foodie trucks.  I am probably at this truck once a week at the Gilbert Farmer's Market.  The husband and wife owners are super sweet.  They also serve lunch at Food Truck Fridays but I haven't had a chance to get out there yet.  

The portions are huge and I always have leftovers of my favorite dish.  It is the chilled butternut oats and it comes organic fruit and scone of the day (topped with coconut or almond milk).  It is almost like a baked oatmeal and it is so good.   The scone is always leftovers for me.  If I start my Saturday morning here, I always make better choices for the rest of the day.
