We went with a group of 12 on 4th of July. Except for the MUCH longer wait than anticipated we had the time of our lives!

I ordered the grapefruit Basil Belini and it was delicious. 

Our group took advantage of the 4$ 4th special and we ordered practically everything on the menu. 

The Deviled Eggs with bacon were delicious! The french fries with spicy aioli are the best things I have ever tasted. The Filet Mignon was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The Brussel Sprout salad was divine. The Ahi Tuna was delicious. The ribeye tacos, phenomenal. 

The service was outstanding. Our server, Kara, took care of us with such expertise!~ We had the time of our lives and I would recommend this restaurant to everyone I know :) ...If I could, I would give it 6 stars.
