I really like the service of Paws. It's small and has a nice independent feel to it.  I've taken my cat in twice.  Once for a check up and another so he could get neutered.  They answered all my questions and even gave me some help with his post-surgery behavior.  Everyone there is friendly and helpful.  If I wasn't moving I would definitely take my cat back there for his annual again.
