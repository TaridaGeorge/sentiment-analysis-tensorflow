Having just moved around the corner, I was very excited to have a locally owned coffee place to replace my former Starbucks self.  As we all could have guessed, I am in love.

The breakfast sandwiches are amazing- I get mine with American cheese, scrambled eggs and avocado (in lieu of meat) on a buttermilk roll.  Delicious!  I've had a variety of iced coffee treats but my favorite is the Salted Butter Carmel iced coffee.

I have also bought many, many cupcakes here- the red velvet is for sure the best.  I find myself looking for occasions that I can bring TC cupcakes to, which is a bit ridiculous.

Tammie Coe is a wonderfully indulgent place with awesome customer service and tasty morsels.  Bonus:  They are super dog-friendly.
