My second visit today was a good as my first! Yummy fast food & I don't feel bad eating it! Plus, it's great quality. Staff is friendly which is also a plus. 
First time I went, I ordered a breakfast sandwich. Yummm.
This time I ordered the Hummus Plate. It came with veggies and warm flat bread. Veggies were crispy, flat bread was soft, and hummus was smooth and creamy. 
Only downside is that they're only open until 4.
Needless to say, I will definitely be a regular!
