Really nice hotel.........  Great staff, great full "FREE" breakfast, shuttle with in 5 miles and a nice big heated pool.  Looked like the hotel just got all new carpet, the place is really fresh and clean.    Just what our group needed.  This hotel is great for Sport teams.  Great places to eat right in the parking lot.  Only a few miles from a big casino
