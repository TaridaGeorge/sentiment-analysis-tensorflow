Been here a couple times. It came highly recommended. The guy up front is very friendly. My check engine light had been on for a week. I came in, he helped me right away- didn't try to take advantage, or oversell me like other mechanics do when they see a single girl. The first time, I actually had to leave my car here because it was totally dead- (needed new spark plugs) he worked with me and gave me a discount which I appreciated as times are tough! I feel safe leaving my car here, I feel like this is a good honest local shop.
