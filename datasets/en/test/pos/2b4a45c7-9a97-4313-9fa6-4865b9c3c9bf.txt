How is it I haven't written a review for Middle Eastern Bakery & Deli? I eat here so much the staff knows me. 

If you go, treat yourself to the lemonade, even if you don't like lemonade or have diabetes. Trust me. It's worth the spike in blood sugars. Sweet, yet not sugary. 

Some of my faves: chicken shawarma, Lebanese chicken, falafel, kibbeh and the Avgolemono soup. Their pita bread is soft and tasty. I love their baklava. Just the right amounts of ingredients making it one light and delicious dessert.
