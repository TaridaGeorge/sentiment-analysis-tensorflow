My wife and I have enjoyed Nina's cooking for years.  Met Nina at the Bell and 36th Street location before the 51 took it out.  Best Italian food in town, 5 stars on the Ravioli, 5 stars on the fried calamari, 4 stars on the salad, but what the heck, it's just salad.  Actually 5 stars on everything, including the wait staff!
