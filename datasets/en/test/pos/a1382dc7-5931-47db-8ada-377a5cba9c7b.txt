I LOVE this place.  I was never a big fan of Middle Eastern cuisine.  That is, until my coworkers made me eat there with them.  The employees who work there treat you as if you've been coming in for years and are very funny.  My favorite meal there is the Falafel plate (good for vegetarians) accompanied by a large lemonade.  The lemonade is without a doubt the best lemonade i've ever had.  This place is definitely as good as it gets, nothing bad to say about it at all.
