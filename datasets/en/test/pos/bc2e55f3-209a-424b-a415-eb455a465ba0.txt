I wanted to post an update as I've been going to this facility for several weeks now (my original review was after only a couple of visits).

I've been mostly going there to attend Zumba class, which I love. The instructor Myuly is fabulous. I generally hate aerobics but the Latin dance moves thrown in with Zumba makes it interesting and fun. At first I felt a little silly, shaking my money maker and all, but when there are 30 other women there (of varying ability levels and body types) doing the same, you just feel comfortable.
