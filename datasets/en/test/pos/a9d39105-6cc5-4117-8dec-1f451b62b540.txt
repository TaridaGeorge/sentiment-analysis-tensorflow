Wow this BBQ is the best!!! I had searched for this place on the Internet because I had been here years ago and it was a themed restaurant  .....Bobby McGees where the wait staff was dressed in character. When we arrived we were told that they quit doing that 8 yrs ago ;( They told us we would not be sorry if we stayed and they were right. It was by far the best BBQ ever!! Melted in your mouth. I told them I was looking on yelp to see if others loved them too and that they did!!! Then our excellent friendly server told us we got 10% off for mentioning yelp!! Wooo hoo icing on the cake.
