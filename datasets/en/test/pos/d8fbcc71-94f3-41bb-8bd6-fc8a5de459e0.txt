3 times in 2 weeks should tell you thy this place is stellar! I have had both the basil chicken and the garlic pepper chicken. They are both super tasty. If you like spicy I would go hot over medium. All of their meat and veggie are very fresh. Service is good and to-go orders are very fast. The place is small and cute inside. Best part, they have brown rice! Yummy. This place is a MUST try!
