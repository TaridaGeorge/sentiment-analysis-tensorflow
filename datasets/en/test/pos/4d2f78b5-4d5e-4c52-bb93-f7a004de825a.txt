Visited this location for the first time yesterday and I have nothing negative to say about it. Large selection of favors and the place was clean and tidy. The presentation of the yogurt and the toppings are the best I've seen of any frozen yogurt place I've been to!

Tasted great too. I had the cake flavored fro-yo.
