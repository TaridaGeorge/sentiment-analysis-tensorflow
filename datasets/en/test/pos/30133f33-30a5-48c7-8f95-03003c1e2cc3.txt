I've been here a couple of times and their food is wonderful! Their HH goes on til 8PM and their breakfast items are amazing! We got the hangover sandwhich and it was Great! The waitress even split the meal for us on two separate plates and gave us another cup of fruit. My friend told me to try the pancakes, since they are to die for. Will try that next time!
