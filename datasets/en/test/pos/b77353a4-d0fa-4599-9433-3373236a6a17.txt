Awesome restaurant! 

I met some girlfriends for lunch, and we had a great experience! I accidentally went through the wrong entry, and ended up walking through the kitchen (which was very clean). The staff didn't mind my mishap, and kindly showed me to the dining room. 

Our server was gracious and attentive. He gladly gave recommendations to my friends who hadn't tried Cambodian food before. I ordered the Noumpang Pate (pork and pate sandwich on a baguette) for $3, and a Jasmine iced tea for $2. The food came out quickly, and was fresh and flavorful. Great deal for $5! 

The website says you can get a discount by subscribing to their email list. I submitted my information, but never got the coupon. I told our server, and he gave us all 10% off. 

I will definitely be back!
