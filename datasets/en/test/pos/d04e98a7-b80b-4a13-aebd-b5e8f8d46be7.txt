I have been now about 5 times, I must say.. It just keeps getting better... Yes the service issues mentioned in so many reviews, I think MGMT has taken notice, and service the last two times has been notched way up.. The Food here for a Hotel is outstanding.. Wife and I had the Buffalo Rib eye, Yukon Souffle, Crispy rock shrimp app, Pumpkin Whoopie Pie(YUM) And the Choc PB Cake(Double YUM) They have free Valet, it is never busy, so you can walk right in, and it is a gorgeous restaurant. I feel like it is our little guilty pleasure.
