Ray is a great guy! Very fair rates. I'd the home work. ;) I HIGHLY recommend Ray & Todd to everyone I know!

First Class Auto Service is a hidden little car repair gem! These guys are honest, and true to thier word. If they say it costs a certain amount, thats what it is. They are SUPER fast. I have been going to Ray since 2011, cause he way recommended for the alignment specialists, but they go above and beyond for customer satisfaction!
