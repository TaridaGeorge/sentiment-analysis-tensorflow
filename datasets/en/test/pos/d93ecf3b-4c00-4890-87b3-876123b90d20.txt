Been a while since i have written a review but I love to get the word out on good places to eat in the valley and Meatballz is a great lunch place. You can get chicken parm with a couple garlic knots and a drink for 10 bucks which is a great deal. The sauce is great, portions big, and the staff is nice. 

The owner is a great guy who talks to everyone in the restaurant and really makes u feel at home. 

If you like fast, inexpensive, good italian then this is the place to go.
