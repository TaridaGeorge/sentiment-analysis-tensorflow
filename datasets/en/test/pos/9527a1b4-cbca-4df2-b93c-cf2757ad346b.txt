I've been to La Grande Orange (or LGO as Gabi seems to refer to it) more times than any other business in Phoenix! I even ate here twice yesterday and have to admit I'm thinking about going back before I leave town today!  I've learned that La Grande does more than make a mean sandwich- they also have some of the best yogurt/granola I've ever had and have decent sushi for being a grocery (I recommend the spicy tuna).

But my favorite part of LGO- the curbside checkout! We called to place our order, pulled up, and a lovely gentleman brought the food to our car.  Now, that's good service! I need that in Chicago to get me thru the winter!!
