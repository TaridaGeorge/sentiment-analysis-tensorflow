Hegel yoga is as good as it gets. Tish is an incredible teacher whose passion for yoga is infectious. Tish also has a degree in something exercise science related, I think Kinesiology (but not certain about that). Talking with her about my injuries has helped me use yoga for rehab and to improve my overall level of fitness. 

In contrast to some other studios I've visited, Tish truly wants to see her students advance in their practice and has a keen eye for where students need help with a given pose. She also seems to be good at selecting like minded folks for teachers as the rest of the teachers in this studio have a similar attitude. 

In short this place is the real deal and a great place to go from never even seen a yoga mat before to advanced practitioner.
