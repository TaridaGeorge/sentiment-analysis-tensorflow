i was in last week to purchase a contour helmet camera and the minute i walked in the door i was was greeted with a smile.  This made me feel very comfortable and not pressured. The staff was very knowledgable and helpful .  I can honestly say i left the store with what i wanted and very happy with the attention i was given.  Thank you ski pro staff and i would recommend the shop to everyone.  I am giving the shop five stars.
