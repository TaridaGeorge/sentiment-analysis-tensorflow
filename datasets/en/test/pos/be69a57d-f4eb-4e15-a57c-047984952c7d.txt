So I'm sitting in my house in Oklahoma, wishing I was in Mesa so I could go get a baby strawberry-colada with cream. It just sounds so, so good right now. I miss Bahama Bucks. It was a fun treat while I was growing up and then turned into a fun treat for my kids. We would go in almost once a week, and every time I'm home, I home visiting, BB is a place I must go. 
The couply that owns this particular franchise is fantastic. They get to know their regulars and definitely are great people.
