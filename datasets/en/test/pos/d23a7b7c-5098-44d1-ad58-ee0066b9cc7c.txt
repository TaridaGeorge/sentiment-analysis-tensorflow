Excellent food and service. The waitress was very knowledgeable about Thai food (knows the difference between Americanized and semi-authentic Thai dishes). We ordered Drunken noodles (lots of thai basil and keffir lime leaves), basil chicken and a red curry with white rice. All dishes were cooked perfectly. Extremely intimate seating allows you to make new friends :)
Visited many art galleries (on the same street). Very lively atmosphere. Would definitely visit again.
