Lobby's is fantastic. I love the hamburger's and the french fries. Ask for a side of sauce to dip the fries in. I have yet to try anything on the menu except the burgers and the dog. I just can't get myself to order anything else because the burgers are so good.

Make sure to try this spot if you're in the area, its my go to joint when I'm at work and craving a hamburger!
