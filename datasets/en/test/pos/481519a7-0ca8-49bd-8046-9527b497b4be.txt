SRP rocks with their outstanding service. My hubby and I are enjoying their pre-paid option (M-Power). When I lost my job I couldn't afford to pay the electric bill. I called customer service to see if they we could split up the bill, that is when the lady told us about M-Power. At the time they were taking 40% of the money you put on the card    towards the  money you owe. They have since lowered the percentage to  25%. 

Secondly, today I called in  because my M-Power box wasn't working and my electric shut off. Within 2hrs of my call the guy showed up to fix the problem. Their employees are very friendly, understanding and hard working people.

Because of their outstanding service my husband and I will only live where SRP serves. They make it affordable for people. They seem to  understand their customers.
