Was in town for business and met up with a couple of friends to have dinner-- went to Beckett's Table on their suggestion (and trust me, I always follow these friends suggestions when it comes to food!!)

Had an absolutely wonderful experience. The outdoor seating was comfortable even with it being 90+ degrees outside. Loved the wine selection, and the wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable on what to pair with food. 

They were helpful in narrowing down a selection for me within my dietary restrictions-- and the meal I had was one of the best pieces of salmon I have ever had. Recommended this to the rest of the individuals in my training class!!
