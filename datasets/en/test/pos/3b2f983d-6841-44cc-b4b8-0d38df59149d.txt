If this place is YOUR type of pizza (Venezia's, NY-style pies) this is best of it's kind in the East Valley. I am always on a quest for the best in every category - pizza, Mexican Food, gastro-pub, what-have-you. It's family-owned, no corp-chains for me either whenever possible. Give this place a try...you will like and the folks who work there are really good - great service, great attitude, great experience. I got a pizza to go, but looks fine for a lunch or very casual dine. Didn't see any beer or wine...hopefully they catch the opportunity to serve up some great local craft beer and some wines. I'll be back.
