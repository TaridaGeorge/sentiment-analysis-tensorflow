Great service.  This is one of the best experiences I have ever had at a Red Robin.  We were in the mood for burgers and something the kids could eat that was close to where we were at when we were out and about.  I have not had anything else on the menu but this is a great place for burgers.  Check out the pics if you want to see for yourself.
