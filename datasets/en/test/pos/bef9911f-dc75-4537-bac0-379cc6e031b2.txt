Went here recently on a trip to Phoenix and it is as good as ever.  I have been here 20+ times when I lived in Phoenix and I never had a bad experience.  

The pizza is amazing.  I always go with the wiseguy (sausage made locally from Schreiners) and has never disappointed.  The appetizers at the wine bar next door are fantastic.

Expect a long wait...who cares, grab a bottle of vino and enjoy the atmosphere next door.

FYI - get a babysitter, not a great place for children.
