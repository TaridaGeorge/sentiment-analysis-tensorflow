How to begin AMAZING! 

I had lunch here on Sunday. Because I was dining alone I sat at the bar that opened onto a beautiful patio. Was such a nice day outside. I was greeted by a very friendly and knowledgeable bar tender. Everything on the menu looked so good I couldn't make up my mind, so I asked for help. After some wonderful suggestions I went with the GRILLED AHI TUNA taco plate. The fish was seared to perfection with a side of black beans and rice. The tacos came with hand made tortillas, spicy aioli sauce, fresh guacamole and chipotle salsa. I topped it all off with a fantastic margarita.

This is my new favorite place!
