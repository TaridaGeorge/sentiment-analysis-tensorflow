What a great place to have a fun dinner with the family.  Did not really know what to expect but I am so glad that we went.  The staff is so nice and the food is great.  It is served all you can eat family style.  You get Ham, chicken and ribs.  It also comes with bean, cole slaw, green beans and fresh bread as well as drinks and cookies for desert.  You eat off of metal plates with metal cups just like the miners did back in the day.  The kids loved it as much as we did.  There is a cute two man band that plays and keeps everyone happy.

Also I can not say enough about the staff.  They are all so friendly and helpful.  This is now our new spot to take out of town guests.
