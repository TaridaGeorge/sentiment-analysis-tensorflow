This is my "Cheers!" They have great drink specials, friendly 'tender's and an array of flavored vodkas that you wouldn't believe. Cotton Candy anyone? Not to mention a great (and updated) Jukebox as well as darts and Golden Tee for the kiddies, er, hubby's. :) 
Karaoke if you dare, but come with a smile and kick back with some of regulars you'll see there at the same time, everyday! While you're there, leave your mark and sign one of the tables. 
Yay Cobb's!!!
