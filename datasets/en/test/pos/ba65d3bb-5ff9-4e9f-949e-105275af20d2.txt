I agree with Michael H wholeheartedly!  Unlike him though I always get the same thing and it is not BBQ:).  I always get their Lazy A Chicken sandwich and it is awesome!  I have dined in and have received delivery through their catering.  This place is always jam packed at lunch time but it is a pretty big place so the wait is usually minimal.   Everyone that I have taken here loves it.  It is a hidden BBQ gem and I almost don't want to tell people about it:).  So if you work in the area definitely give them a try you will not be disappointed.
