Dr. Greenberg and staff are absolutely the best. He is super friendly and approachable. I have been going to Dr. Greenberg for probably 8+ years now, and have recommended him to lots of co workers and friends. 

 He loves his job and it shows through to his office, staff, patients etc.  I so appreciate when doctors really educate their patients and tell you what they are doing and why.  Dr. Greenberg takes the cake here! He is so enthusiastic about the purpose of each test and what the resulting images show.  I am a bit of a science nerd, so I really love that he doesn't mind taking the time to explain things.  

When I got my contacts last year, he even made sure they placed the order a certain way so that I would get the highest rebate back. Best eye doc ever! Enough said!
