Inexpensive, classy, clean, casual, and a good sign of cultural development in central Phoenix. Film Bar not only has an excellent lineup of indie and foreign films, but a bar stocked with excellent regional microwbrews. The staff is helpful when you cant choose between your familiar old lager or a new IPA. Always have had a good experience every time I come for a film. This theater is not for everyone, but it sure is welcome and needed in the Valley for the population that it serves.
