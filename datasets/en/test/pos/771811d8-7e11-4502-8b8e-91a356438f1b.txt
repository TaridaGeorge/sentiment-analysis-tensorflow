One of the best spots for Sunday brunch without stuffing yourself like you would at a buffet. Setting is cozy reminiscent of a spot in Provence, staff is attentive without being overbearing and the food is superb and exquisitely prepared. The a la carte Sunday brunch is a three course menu and very reasonably priced. 

My three courses were:
-Quiche Lorraine
- Steak with Eggs and pommes frites served with bearnaise
-Tarte Tatin

Their coffee is great and served French press style. Now that the weather is warming up, the patio is delightful to sit on and mingle and relax with good friends.

At $ 29 per person plus tax and grat, I really was pleasantly surprised. Chef James Porter really found a great location for this restaurant and the cuisine is truly outstanding.
