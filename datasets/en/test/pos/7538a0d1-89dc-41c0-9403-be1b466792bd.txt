Ok, so its a tourist trap.  But the view of the Superstition Mountains makes it worthwhile.  There are lots of fun activities for adults and kids, and I think the prices are reasonable.  We ate at the Saloon, was pricy, but very good.

All the staff here is very friendly and makes the trip a pleasure.  I recommend the train ride for some good gold mining stories.

The Gold panning is also a lot of fun, and you actually get a little bid of gold in every pan.

Highly recommend.
