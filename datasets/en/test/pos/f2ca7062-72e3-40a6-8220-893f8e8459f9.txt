I absoloutely love this place.  Great Coffee, Americanos, and Lattes.  Try the Chemex if you are looking for something unique.  Very Tasty Breakfast Burritos and friendly staff.  I wish the North Location was still open, but I'll take their brews anywhere I can get them.  Skip Starbucks and hit up a real coffee shop...
