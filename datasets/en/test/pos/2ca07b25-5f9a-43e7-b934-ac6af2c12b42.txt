So excited that Rita's has finally come to the Valley!  I grew up on Rita's in PA and always thought it would be a hit in the Valley since we have year round fantastic weather!  The staff was extremely nice and were also excited when I told them I grew up with Rita's italian ice.  The mango gelati is still my favorite...yummy!
