I have been going here since they opened a few years back and have NEVER once been disappointed.  Everything is super fresh and they are the nicest people ever.  I am glad to see this place thriving.

My favorite is the old reliable Pho Tai.  I also love getting the crispy eggrolls.  They come with lettuce, cucumber, carrots, basil and mint to create little eggroll burritos...  Man I am hungry!

Even if you order your food to go, they take extra care to pack everything nice and when you get home it is as good as you would have in the restaurant!

My first review and I chose Noodles Ranch, that has got to say something!
