Like many others saw this place on triple D.  Have eaten here a couple of times since and have enjoyed it every time.  Go out on a limb and order some of the odd combos they have as speacials and you won't be sorry.

A lot of people complain about the wait however there is one sure fire cure for it.....get up a little early and be there prior to 8am and the wait will be very short.  A group of 8 of us arrived at 745 and were in at 8am.

Highly recommended!
