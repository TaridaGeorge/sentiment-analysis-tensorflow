Amazing, amazing, amazing. 
I knew I would love it the second I walked in, because the entire atmosphere of this establishment screams: "my owners and employees take care of me and care a lot about quality!!!"
The staff was friendly, and patient with me while I spent about 20 minutes deciding what to order for take out (everything, I mean EVERYTHING looked tasty!)
While this place isn't "cheap", I didn't regret a single penny because the portion sizes were generous, and I knew that what I was putting into my mouth had been thoughtfully prepared and was healthy and filling. 
I cannot rave about this place enough.. check it out!
