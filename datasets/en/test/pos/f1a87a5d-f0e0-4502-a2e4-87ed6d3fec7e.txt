I am pleased with the service and quality of this place.

First of all, it is easy to locate-- especially if you are visiting downtown Phoenix and using the light rail for the first time (it's right across the Central & Roosevelt station).

The atmosphere is perfect for:
- studying/ reading/ internet browsing
- meeting with a friend for some coffee/tea/snack

They have an outside patio as well. Their drink selection is great. They have coffees, smoothies, teas, sandwiches, and other pastries. Prices were reasonable. The staff is definitely friendly and they are very efficient in how they operate. 

Definitely would go there again if I am in the Phoenix area. Loved it.
