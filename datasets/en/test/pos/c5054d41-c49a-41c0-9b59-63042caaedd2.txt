I was in phoenix on business for the first time Ventured in there by accident. An upstairs bar reminded me of my favorite college hangout so I gave it.a try. What I found was hardly a college dive. Very "groovey vibe". Great drink selection. Good demographic mix in customers gave it a relaxing, welcoming feel. Really liked the music, which wasn't too loud. Sports on the TV behind the bar, which didn't I didn't expect with the look of the place, but I appreciated. Staff, was outstanding. Just a great place to relax and unwind after a busy day. 
The Side Bar is now marked as "my Phoenix bar" and I stop in on every subsequent return.
