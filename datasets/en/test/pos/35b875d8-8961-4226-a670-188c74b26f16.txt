My roommate made this assessment and I completely agree.

 "This place was simply amazing.  I know (the reader) can appreciate really authentic food for a very inexpensive price.  The seafood soup was very tasty which included fish, squid, oysters, onions, etc.  One dish was very close to a good ole Irish beef stew.  It included rice noodles with wontons stewed beef with cabbage.  Bottom line is this place is very different from any Chinese restaurant I have ever eaten at.  You walk in there and it may look suspect, however it wont disappoint.

 

4.5 stars on my weighted rating system."
