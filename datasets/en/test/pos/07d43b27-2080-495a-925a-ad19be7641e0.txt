I will admit I was hesitant to book my anniversary dinner here after some of the recent reviews but I am very glad I did!  We ate at the brick oven table last night and it was a fabulous experience.  Eight courses of well prepared inventive food served with a relaxed but polished style.  Not for control freaks since the chef dictates the choices.  Also not cheap at  $105 per person  but  for 3 hours of good food and a great quite setting by the fire it was well worth it.
