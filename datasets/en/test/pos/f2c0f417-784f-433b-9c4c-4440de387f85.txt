I love Cracker Barrel!  It's my favorite chain restaurant and I stop in as often as I can. They give you hearty helpings of fantastic comfort food, have a great homey atmosphere and a cute store with all kinds of seasonal and novelty items. Their lunch and dinner meals are my favorite but breakfast is good too.
