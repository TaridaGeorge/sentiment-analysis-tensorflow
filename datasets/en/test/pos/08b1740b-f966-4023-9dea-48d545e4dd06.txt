Hands down, my favorite bar in Tempe. 

I recently went for happy hour and they had awesome specials on drinks and appetizers. The waitresses are always great there as well.

I tend to go here on the weekends when it is really busy but it's a fun time whenever and it seems to always bring in good people.

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to have a good time.
