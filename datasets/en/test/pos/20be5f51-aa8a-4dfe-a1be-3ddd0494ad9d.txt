This place is AWESOME... I am a meat and potatoes kind of girl... a definite carnivore but I just keep having to return time and time again to this place. The Spicy Ginger Soy Beef and the Pad Thai are both excellent and the Mint Lemonade is refreshing. If you want to see how good vegetarian food can be this is THE place to go... If there were more places like this I could see being an occasional vegetarian (I couldn't give up meat completely).
