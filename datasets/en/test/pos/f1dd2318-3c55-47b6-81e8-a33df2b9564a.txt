ZOO-TASTIC!  

I really enjoy how this zoo is set up.  It takes you into the habitat of the animal you are viewing.  You become one with the animal.  When you first walk in, you'll see what I mean about becoming part of the animals' habitat.  I appreciate how close you can get and still be at a safe distance.  

I got to see my first up close and personal view of a male and female lion.  The male was sitting at the edge of the habitat right in the middle and let out this big roar.  It was the most beautiful sound.  He roared a few more times, then he went and played in the water.  How cool to see something like that?!  Oh, it was pretty awesome.

Drink lots of water on the trails, plenty of places to stop and eat along the trails, Zoo Lights is awesome!
