i'm not much of a sub fan, but i was blown away by what i got.  it was the new york steamer and it was the right amount of juicy without soaking through to the bread.  it melted in my mouth and tasted awesome.  it's a firehouse theme so it was cool that there was an actual firetruck out front- and city of Mesa firemen eating there.  I guess that was just a timing thing, but my son got a kick out of it.  Plus they've got one of those fancy digital Coke machines that are all the rage.  Too bad I gave up soda a year ago.  Hey, how bout a digital beer machine...
