Apparently until today, I didn't know how much I had been missing the Chicago style cheesy beef.  Based on how quickly I inhaled Luke's cheesy beef at lunch, I have greatly missed having cheesy beef in my life.  

Bonus points awarded for Luke's carrying the ubiquitous and something I always found strange to sell (although all cheesy beef joints in Chicago sell them) the pizza puff and the tamale's.
