I finally came back to Press and feel comfortable giving a 5-star rating after sampling more of the offerings.  I met a friend for lunch and she immediately commented that it's a very cute place.  

We both had sandwiches served on rosemary focaccia.  Sometimes sandwiches can feel a bit too carb-heavy but their focaccia is nice and thin so it's just right.  The sandwiches come with chips but you can get a small salad instead, which I did.  The balsamic dressing was quite yummy.

We both noted that the music is pretty solid here.  The volume was low but I managed to catch some Snow Patrol in there.  I couldn't leave without a cup of their delicious chai with skim milk, and once again it just made my day.  

Business seemed a bit slow there, so be sure to stop in and keep this great little Starbucks-alternative in business!!
