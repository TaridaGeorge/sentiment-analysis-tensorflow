5 star service & food!!  First of all, the girls behind the bar were super friendly and helpful.  They were patient and kind as we took forever to make up our minds.  

The burger I had was truly one of the BEST I have ever had.  The kobe beef was seasoned to perfection and the whole thing came together perfectly.  

We followed dinner with the s'mores dessert and it so much fun!!!  5 stars for the dessert "experience" alone.  They bring out your own personal little fire pit with hot coals and everything you need to make a s'more.  It's like having your own personal little campfire right there at the table.  WE LOVED IT!!!
