I am still giving this place 5 stars, as they absolutely deserve it. However, my one beef is that, while the music is great, it's just too loud for getting work done. Trying to listen to my own music via headphones doesn't work at all, unless I crank it LOUD (which is hardly conducive to getting work done either).

 Please Lux, can you tone it down a little? At least during working hours?
