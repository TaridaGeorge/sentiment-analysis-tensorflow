3 Things; The service, price & quality of the food, Shangri-La manages to juggle all three with great finesse! They have the BEST egg drop soup! It's a thick flavorful chicken stock with egg (of coarse!) corn, peas, Chinese cabbage and chicken meat seasoned perfectly. The crunchy noodles compliment the soup nicely. I've been a loyal fan of this place since the '80's and I can tell you it is CONSISTENTLY good. All of the entrees are wonderfully flavorful and served hot from the wok. They will gladly spice up or down per your request any dish like the kung pow chicken. The sauce served with the almond chicken is lovely and tuned perfectly for the dish. I have long since moved to Northern AZ but Shangri-La is a must do whenever I'm visiting Phoenix looking for great Chinese cuisine in a casual atmosphere.
