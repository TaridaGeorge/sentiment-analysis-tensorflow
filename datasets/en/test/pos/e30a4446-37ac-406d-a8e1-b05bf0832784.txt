I've eaten here twice and the food has been excellent both times.  

The chicken curry I had there for lunch today was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  The rice and naan it was served with were also good if unremarkable.  For some reason I decided to try the salted lassie today and salty is an understatement.  I LOVE salt and still only managed to make it through 1/3 of this drink so lassie drinkers beware.  I had the plain lassie the time before and it was good, if a bit foamy.

Will definitely eat here again.
