My boss recommended the place. As of 5/11, $15 gets you a very good haircut, and:
-Straight razor shave around the ears and neck
-Ear de-fuzzing
-Eyebrow cleanup
-Hot towel, moisturizer and gel if you want 'em

I'd been going to Sport Clips, and found this to be a better value all around. Good place.

Never go a barber with a credit card.
