Love Donovan's....by far, the best steak in the valley.  And the one time they gave us bad service, I called and spoke to the manager.  They sent me a $150 gift card!  Better yet, I got a call from them the other day, wishing me a happy wedding anniversary.  So thoughtful.   We will always go to donovan's for special occasions!
