Definitely a great plce to find both that odd spice you can't find anywhere else but also great prices on bulk amounts of the good stuff you use every day.  For the lover of everything chipotle, try the Northwoods Fire Seasoning, it will be the new seasoning for just about everything.

Warning: The store has moved to Tempe Marketplace.  You'll find an empty shop if you try to look for it on Hayden now.
