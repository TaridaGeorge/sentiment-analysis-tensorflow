Call me sheltered, but I'd never had coconut in anything that wasn't sweet before I ate at Mint Thai :)  I was with a client and he ordered. I remember I was SO apprehensive about trying the new and weird-sounding dishes he chose! I know, I am revealing how *white* I am. But, the point of the story is, thanks to Mint Thai, now I am positively addicted to Thai and anything with coconut milk in particular! 

Mint Thai Cafe is cute, clean, although only average ambiance and service. The dishes I have tried are all very tasty. Try the Satay, Tom Yum Gui, Thai BBQ chicken, and all of their curries. Mmmm.... coconut.....
