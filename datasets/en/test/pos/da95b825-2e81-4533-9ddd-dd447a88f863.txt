This is the best sushi in town, hands down!!  They have amazing specialty rolls and all of the ingredients are so fresh! When your roll has shrimp tempura, it comes out warm because they have just done the tempura right then-to die for!  We have tried other things on the menu that are phenomenal too.  This is a great, local business!
