Yes, five stars!  First review and I thought I'd make it a good one.  

From start to finish a fantastic experience.  The fish is *so* fresh and perfectly prepared.  My friend had a bone in filet - best steak we've ever had.  Just done to perfection.  

The ambiance is nice - definitely upscale and vibrant.  And once it cools down a bit, I cannot wait for the patio to get going.  

Great job Wildfish, I will definitely be back!
