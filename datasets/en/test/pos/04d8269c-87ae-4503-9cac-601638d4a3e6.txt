I was visiting a friend of mine and we were looking for a new place to try for lunch. I found Arcadia Farms Cafe. It was a bit hard to find a parking spot, but completely worth it! We enjoyed everything we had, including the white Sangria! YUM! I also highly recommend the small cakes. Caution: they are extremely delicious!
