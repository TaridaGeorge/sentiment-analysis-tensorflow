First the coco shrimp are delicious!
The house salad with blue cheese is the freshest and tastiest I have had in years!
The garlic mashed potatoes were unmatched   The best part of the meal was the medium rare Victorias filet. The best steak I have tasted. the vegetables were also fantastic!
This place is very good and is very consistent. You can't go wrong here.
