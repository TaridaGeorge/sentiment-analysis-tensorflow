Came here for dinner on 9-6-2012 with my mom and son. My first time here, but my moms fifth or sixth time. Excellent food really nice place! But the best thing was the service. Matt benton(sp) was our server and he was seriously really good. I have been a server for about six years and he was great he was extremely fast and precise and split our salad without being asked. Very knowledgeable and friendly. I will definitely be back he got three out of the five stars because he made the experience better!!!
