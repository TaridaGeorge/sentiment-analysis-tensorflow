Best damn pizza EVER. Chris Bianco is a friend of the family and I have been visiting this place whenever I have been in AZ for over 10 years... and I have never seen anyone but his original investor get preferential treatment... so props for keeping with it!

Love the Sonny Boy, the salami, the bread, the drinks, the ambiance and well... everything. Try, it's worth  the wait, but get there at 4:00 and you will be one of the first to be served when the doors open at five.
