really really great!!!
yep that sums it up!!! they remember who you are, the prices are reasonable and the quality of the work is very very good - they do alterations too!
I had a love affair with bell cleaners for quite a long time and while they are great also, their prices just got to be too much!!
so without sacrificing quality, i found thomas cleaners.
yes they are not as pretentious as bell cleaners, no fancy coffee machine, fake flowers in the waiting room, but when I get my perfectly pressed, perfectly cleaned clothes home and I still have $ in my pocket, none of that matters!
