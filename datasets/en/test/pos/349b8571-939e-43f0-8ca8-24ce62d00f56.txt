Ted's is a classic Tempe landmark. I grew up ni Tempe and this place always brings back great memories. The food is all made from scratch fresh each day. The staff is always friendly. Try the italian sausage and potato salad. Ted's never disappoints.

Get there by 11 for an early lunch or after 1pm to avoid the massive lines.
