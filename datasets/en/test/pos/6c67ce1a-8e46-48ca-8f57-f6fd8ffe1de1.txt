Bar Bianco shows how fresh ingredients make all the difference. I never mind waiting for the excellent pizza served next door, at Pizzeria Bianco, because it is always a treat to order some appetizers here. I love the cheese platter because not only are both the cheese and bread excellent, but the additions like raisins and nuts are delicious too. 

Even though you may think that you need to go into Pizzeria Bianco with an empty stomach so you can have as much pizza as possible, it would be a mistake to not try some of the amazingly fresh and tasty things off the Bar Bianco menu.
