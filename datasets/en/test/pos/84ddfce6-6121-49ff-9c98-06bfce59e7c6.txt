Dropped in late Sunday afternoon after shooting photos for a few hours. Was tired and welcomed warmly by Arthur behind the bar. He introduced himself and shook both and my photo buddies hand. 

While I had only a Coke it was refreshed with a new one when I got to about 1/2 way. My buddy ended up ordering two club sandwiches and judging by the fact that a) he ordered two and b) the plate looked mighty clean they were pretty darn yummy. 

I've been the Majerle's before this visit was very nice and I would definitely come back...will come back this time with an appetite.
