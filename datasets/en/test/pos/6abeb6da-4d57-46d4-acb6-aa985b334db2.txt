I love the Vanilla Latte and I made up my own drink, i get regular latte and have them put peppermint syrup in it, it is so delicious....one barista couldnt belive i dont also put chocolate in it but it doesnt need it, its just wonderful and perfect just like that. mmmmm makes me want to go get one now....
