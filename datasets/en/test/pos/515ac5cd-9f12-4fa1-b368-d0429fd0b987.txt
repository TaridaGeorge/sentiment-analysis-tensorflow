A beautiful wine cafe finally here in Gilbert.  The space has beautifully contemporary design and the food and wine are fantastic.  If you are anywhere remotely close to Gilbert, It is a must see!!   They have an eclectic wine list and have great bruschetta boards with an array of different bruschettas to chose from, they also serve gourmet sandwiches.  Monday and Tuesday they have a special when you purchase a bottle you receive a free Bruschetta board GRATIS!!!!  Really!!!
