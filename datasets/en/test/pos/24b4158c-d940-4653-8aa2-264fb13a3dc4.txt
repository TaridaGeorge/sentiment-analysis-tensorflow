Stopped in to pick up some lunch today, and I went with the veggie jackson. i ordered it sans eggplant, so it came with broccoli, asparagus tops, carrots, onions, feta cheese, garlic rice and a balsalmic salsa. It was exactly what my tummy was hoping for. :) I opted for the tortilla chips and salsa today instead of the miso soup (which is delicious), and was happy with my choice. the salsa is chunky, with lots of veggies and flavor. The place was pretty empty, so it didn't take long for my food to come up. Quick, affordable and delicious!
