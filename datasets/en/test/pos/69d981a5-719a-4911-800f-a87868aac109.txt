I had never had a root canal done and was extremely nervous! I wasn't sure what to expect, but his place is amazing! From the second you walk in the door until the second you leave! The front staff are kind and welcoming and the office is very clean.  Dr. Baker and his assistant Jen were so kind! The doctor actually looked me in the eyes while shaking my hand! He walked me through the steps as he was doing them, always checking that I was comfortble, even offering me juice and a blanket before we got started! The procedure was fast and I was encouraged to listen to Pandora on my iphone. This place has top of the line equipment and service! I will be referring family and friends for sure!
