I love this grocery store!  I wish there was one closer to my house but its okay I have alot of great places in my area too...anyways I have always loved going here for groceries...especially for specialty stuff and I think their frozen meals are the best and second to none!  My boyfriend loves their coffee and I love their hummus!  I love how they set up their stores and its such an inviting and fun atmosphere!  If you like fruit bars try the high fiber fruit and veggie bars they are good for you and they are good!  Their wine selection is awesome too; especially for being a smaller grocery store, but I really like their white wine selection.  Go here and shop shop shop!!!!
