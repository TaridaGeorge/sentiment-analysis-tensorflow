We have been to St. Francis quite a few times and each time I am pleasantly surprised. The service is always outstanding and the food is fresh and contemporary with a solid touch of home. The Pork Chili Verde is a perfect example of this with its' fire and comfort in every spoonful. 

This visit we were surprised to find some new menu items and we were not disappointed. If you haven't been here in a while, check out the new meatball entr√©e (Moroccan spice, tomato sauce, hen egg and olive oil toast) and if you thought the chili was good, this will rock your world!
