Most of their menu is gluten free - and SO amazing that their part of a celiac association! Everything is labeled so you know what you can eat and what you can't, but you can eat almost everything!

YOU HAVE TO TRY THEIR GLUTEN FREE PIZZA. This is THE most amazing crust I've ever had that's gluten free! It's a must have. Most everything else is organic and natural and you just feel GOOD after either their food. It's pretty pricey - but it's worth it. This would be such a good date restaurant too. Great on a date before the movies right above it! 

Oh, and try their watermelon mojito. It's pretty legit.
