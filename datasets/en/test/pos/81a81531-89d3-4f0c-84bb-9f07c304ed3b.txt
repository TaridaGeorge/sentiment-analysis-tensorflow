Being from Hawaii, I've been looking for a good plate lunch place in Arizona.  I FINALLY FOUND IT!  Aloha Kitchen gets an A+.  The owner, Ray, is a really cool relaxed dude and all the aunties in the back are from Hawaii.

Very authentic Hawaiian style food.  All the classics from the islands within a 10 minute drive from my apartment!  Can't wait to go back!
