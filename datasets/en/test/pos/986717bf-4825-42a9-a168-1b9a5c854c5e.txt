Love this place. Nice employees, fast service. I love the sense of urgency in a fast food restaurant. The sandwiches are filling and delicious. Their salads are also hefty, that makes me happy because sometimes salads are small because the company thinks you don't want to eat a lot because youre ordering a salad, not here.
