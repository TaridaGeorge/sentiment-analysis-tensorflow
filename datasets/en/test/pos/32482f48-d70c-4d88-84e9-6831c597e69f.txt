Once again, Fleming's was the PERFECT place to celebrate a special event. Brian R was one of the best servers we've had anywhere! Everything was perfect, the food was amazing (main filet mignons, Fleming's Potatoes, Garlic Mashed Potatoes and Steamed Carrots) and we had the Chocolate Mousse Cake for dessert. I beg Fleming's to add this to their dessert menu permanently, it was amazing and had no nuts! Thanks again for another incredible celebration, we'll be back soon!
