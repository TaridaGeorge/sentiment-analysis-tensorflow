Very impressive space and design.  I attended the "soft" opening and was very pleased. If you like artistically crafted drinks... this is the place for you.
I enjoyed a "Black" Manhattan which was made with Rye Whiskey. It was perfect! Of the menu items I was able to sample the macaroni and cheese was very impressive. Completely unique and light, where most mac and cheeses are clumpy, heavy and boring.

The staff is delightful!

I can't wait to come back to Phoenix and get my LUX on!!
