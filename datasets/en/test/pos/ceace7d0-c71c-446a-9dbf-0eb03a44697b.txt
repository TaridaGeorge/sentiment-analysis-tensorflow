Ultimate Body Bootcamp provides incredible workouts, support and fun! Working out with a group of people helps me stay  motivated. I also like all of the additional ways to get involved in an active lifestyle - newsletters with good nutrition info, short or long races, hikes, charity bootcamp, and more. Camps are Valley wide. Check out the 2010 Best of the Valley winner - your body will ultimately thank you for it!
