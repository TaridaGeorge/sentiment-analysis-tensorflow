This place is seriously de-friggen-licious!!  My old roomie, a native of Mesa, took me here and I dream about coming here whenever it's hot (and that's most of the time if you're in the Phoenix-Scottsdale-Tempe-Mesa area).

Their shaved ice is super soft and fluffy.  They have a bagillion flavors and their cream is awesome!  You have to get it!  It is another 45 cents, I think, but don't think twice!  

I noticed some people said this was a dodgy location, but maybe I'm from the 'hood or something, cuz this place was NOT iffy at all!  If anything it is a little dim-lit at night, but really no big deal.

I wish I still lived in AZ just so I could enjoy Bahama Bucks on the daily!
