This store carries some of the most unique southwest items in the area. If they don't have it - they'll get it for you.  On top of that, the prices are incredibly reasonable.  If you're in doubt - price an item at Buffalo Bill's and then drive 300 yards up Cave Creek and price the same item.  Guaranteed it will cost 10x more elsewhere.  The owners are incredibly friendly and helpful.  They've even delivered larger furniture items to the house at no additional cost.  I don't shop anywhere else.
