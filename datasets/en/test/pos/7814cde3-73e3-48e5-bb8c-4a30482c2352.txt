I have been a patient here for 6 years and I am very impressed with their service. Both Dr. Reed and Dr. Elg are very friendly and knowledgeable and there staff is very helpful. I wear progressive lenses and know that you get what you pay for. They carry the most up to date lenses which I have found really does make a difference with your vision being that I have tried the bargain brand. They have a large selection of frames, and surprisingly a large selection of contacts also which I have found can be cheaper here than other big name companies. Definitely should give them a try you will be happy you did!
