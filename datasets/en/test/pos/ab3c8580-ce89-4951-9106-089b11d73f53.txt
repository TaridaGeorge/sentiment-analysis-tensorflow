This place is one of the best places I have ever eaten at. 

The prices are really good and they have a good happy hour for drinks and appetizers. I think this place is much better quality food then most sushi places and its a lot cheaper. The atmosphere is also very pleasant. The service is outstanding and always friendly. 

The sushi is the best here. They have a large menu, all very tasty and well worth the visit. I love sushi, and this place is by far the best.. If you are looking for a good time with some great food this is your place.
