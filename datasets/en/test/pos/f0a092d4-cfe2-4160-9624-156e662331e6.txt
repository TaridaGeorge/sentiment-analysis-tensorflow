This summer I shadowed Faust Animal Hospital veterinarians and Vet techs a couple days a week. I am a pre-vet student and they were kind enough to let me sit in on some surgeries and day to day procedures. 
From what I observed, the staff at this hospital are at the high end of professional. Every case they took on was approached in the most attentive and caring way. 
On top of their work ethic and professorial demeanor, the staff was welcoming, friendly, and fun to be around. 

If I lived in Phoenix and not 1500 miles away, this is where I would bring my pets, hands down!
