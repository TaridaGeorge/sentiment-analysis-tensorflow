Great place!  Monica at the bar was extremely attentive, Nicole was terrific at the table everything was spot on!  Had the Guac and chips which were great, then a spinach salad and short rib with the egg.  The short rib could have used a touch more sauce but all and all everything was very good.  My friend had the chicken and also thought it was the shit.  The restaurant was cosy with the fireplace and well dressed milf's prancing around.  Just how I remembered it =)  party on!
