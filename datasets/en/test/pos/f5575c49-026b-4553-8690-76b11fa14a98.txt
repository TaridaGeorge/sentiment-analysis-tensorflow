I have always loved Zpizza. I haven't had it in awhile since the location near me closed and then I became a Vegan and pretty much swore off Pizza. 

I heard that they now have a VEGAN pizza and are serving it by the slice this weekend! (5/14-5/16)
I went in for a slice and left with 4! It was pretty damn Delicious! 
I cant wait to go back and order up my own Vegan creation, Like the ZBQ No chicken, sub vegan cheese, I might just die! 

All hail Zpizza for making pizza possible for Vegans!
