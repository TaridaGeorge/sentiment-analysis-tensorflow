I love this place!  My husband and I found this place and loved it back when we were eating anything we wanted.  After finding out about some food allergies and health issues, what we can eat is much more limited - and True Food is one of few restaurants that can accommodate our needs.  Because of my extensive "forbidden foods" list, I order like Meg Ryan in "When Harry Met Sally" - substitute this for that, put this on the side, add that - yet the staff never treats me like the pain I know I'm being.  Instead, they politely take my order and get it right every time.  I would recommend this place to anyone!
