Come to Mama, pretty precious little drops of Heaven.  And I'm just talking about the packaging.  What's INSIDE the package is the real treat.  First off, do not eat your chocolate in the store.  Buy it and have them wrap it all up and put it in the bag.  Go home and sit down and eat your chocolate in at least 2 bite-- you hear me?!!  TWO BITES at least.  Savor the taste and feel your heart skip a beat.  

** Note: In the summer, go home right after the purchase and crank your a/c up on the floor board and place the Godiva bag down there-- do not let it get ruined by the heat.
