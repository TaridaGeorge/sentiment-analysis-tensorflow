Absolutely love this place.  Have been to China and this food is Authentic.  We had the Szechuan Dumplings to start which were fluffy clouds of home made dough surrounding perfectly spiced pork with an awesome spicy sauce.  We then had the Hot and Sour soup which was one of the best I have had.  My favorite dish, which I have had many times already, is the water boiled fish.  It is not for the faint of tongue but I love the spice and the fish is very light and flakey.  We also had the Dry Pot Chicken which was like the Chongqing chicken we had while in China.  Finally, the Mao Po Tofu done szechuan style is very good.  The cooks are from Chengdu at the heart of sichuan province and it shows.  Try this place, it is fantastic.
