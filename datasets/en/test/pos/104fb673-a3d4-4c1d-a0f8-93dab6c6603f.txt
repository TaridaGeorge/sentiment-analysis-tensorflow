We had yet another fabulous experience at my favorite dining place, The Melting Pot. Sean was our waiter and did a wonderful job. We were called in by the special, which more than fed the two of us. When you get a chance to go, make it a more intimate ordeal like we did and reserve a private booth. Thanks again for a tasty dinner and great ambiance.
