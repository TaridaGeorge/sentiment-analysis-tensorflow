Times Square is both a warm family atmosphere and an excellent restaurant.  The people make the difference here.  When you enter you are welcomed like a family friend.  The main entrees are all extremely tasty.  They range from Ossobuco to Sausage and Peppers.  The seafood dishes are a hit as well.  I agree with Tom W. that the Pasta Giovanni is out of this world.  There are too many incredible dishes to review them all.  Times Square is a diamond in the rough.
