Went last night for 4 year anniversary with my amazing wife.

T Cook's took care of us amazingly, and just for mentioning it was our anniversary. I won't divulge everything, but from best seats to customized menus with our names printed on them to extra-attentive service, these guys were top-notch and caring. 

The food was great too. From the warm bread with extra-parmesan-y pesto, to mussels and salad, to lamb and salmon, nothing let us down. Even the dessert was great. We got the $99 for two price-fixe-like summer special - app, entree + dessert.

It really is nice to know there is a place TRULY to take someone special for an anniversary dinner. 

Tip - wander the grounds after and seek out hidden spots among the orange grove and gardens.
