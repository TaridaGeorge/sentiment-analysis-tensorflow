Crazy Jim's probably has the best calamari salad ever! I've been here 4 times already and always with my good friend Sage.
This hole-in-the-wall joint serves up some outstanding greek fare. It's a small family owned restaurant serving delicious food with a friendly smile. I'm not too crazy about the parking lot being too close to the dumpster, but the food and service is really good.
