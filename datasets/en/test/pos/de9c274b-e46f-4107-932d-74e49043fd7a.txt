Picked up my new imac today. Everyone is just super friendly and upbeat. I love good customer service. I did have to wait a bit, but everyone is just so nice I really didn't mind! Plus, I got to chat while I waited with Quinton who was sexy (and he knows it). I'm just sayin'. He carried my computer to my car for me and wished me a very genuine happy christmas. Very pleasant experience with every employee I encountered. I love those nerds!
