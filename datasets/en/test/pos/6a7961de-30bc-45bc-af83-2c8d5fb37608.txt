I worked at Macy's at metro for a long time and a couple of friends and I decided try this place randomly one day not knowing anything about this place. Loved the quirkiness of the red and white striped roof. Was surprised by the inside which I swear everytime I go there's new bumper stickers I haven't seen yet. So without even eating yet I thought to myself I like this place. Then the food came out and I have to say its sooo much better then subway or any other sandwich shop ive ever eat at. Loved the food and loved that the drinks have crushed ice! Awesome quirky place.
