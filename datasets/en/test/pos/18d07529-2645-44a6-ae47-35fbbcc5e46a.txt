My hubby and I are regulars at this great place! Our favorite is the "Spicey Boiled Wonton" Holy Moly this dish is fab! We each get our own cause there is no way I am sharing. From Pot Stickers to the Orange Chicken and beyond, this place has tasty food. The service is always there-so welcoming and friendly!!
