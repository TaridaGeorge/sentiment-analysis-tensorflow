Me and my fiancee have been to Roy's several times now.  My first time was in Hawaii.  When I saw this location we definitely had to try it out.  We came for Easter Brunch last year (Pricey!) then a couple more times after that for romantic dinners.  Each time has been awesome. 

 We spent valentine's day here and I am very happy we did.  We had a four course dinner and each entree was timed perfectly and was delicious.  Service was great. My beverage was excellent. The dessert was delightful. The patio was pretty and romantic with the tiki torches.

Only drawback is that portions are kinda small and its pricey.  They do have a great happy hour, or actually its called "Aloha" hour.  This is  One of my favorite restaurants.
