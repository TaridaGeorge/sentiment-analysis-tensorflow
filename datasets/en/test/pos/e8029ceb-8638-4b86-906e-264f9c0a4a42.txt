I am so glad that Sprouts decided to invest a beautiful new store in Ahwatukee.  I am a regular weekly shopper and usually go earlier in the morning or later in the evening so I have not experienced the traffic jams/loud screaming kids, etc. that were mentioned in some of the other reviews.

I like the produce department; there are always fresh conventional and organic selections at great prices in addition to the bins that have varieties of assorted coffees, nuts, dried fruits, sweet treats, etc. 

The cashiers are so friendly and accommodating.  I rarely have to wait long in line.
