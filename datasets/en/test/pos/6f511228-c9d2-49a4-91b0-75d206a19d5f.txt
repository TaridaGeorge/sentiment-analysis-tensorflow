I am just visiting the Scottsdale area but had some free time tonight and Yelp'd to find a decently priced salon. Min did my mani/pedi and did a great job. Although they close at 7p, she took her time and even offered an extra massage, despite the time crunch. She's super sweet and fun to talk to and I most definitely recommend her!
