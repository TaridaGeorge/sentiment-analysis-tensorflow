Never did I think that purchasing my 2004 XK8 Jaguar would be an enjoyable experience, but it was, because of Autohaus Intternational, LLC of Tempe, AZ.  I was purchasing my Jaguar long distance with the help of my son, to check out the automobile for me, plus working with Wesley Pawlowski, the owner.  I found Wesley to be extremely knowlegeable, and a person of rare integrity.  Wesley helped me with everything from finding my car, working thru all of the paperwork, down to having it transported, fully insured directly to my home in Colorado.  I have owned this classic beauty for about 3 months now and it is a pure joy!  Thank you Wesley!  Margaret
