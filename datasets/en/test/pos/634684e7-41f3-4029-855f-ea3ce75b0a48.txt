Seems like people have been complaining about slow service. I usually only notice that on incredibly busy nights. Which if you have any common sense you should know its going to take a while to get to everyone if you only have 2 servers running a fully packed floor. Patience people or simply get up and go some where else lol. 

Anyway besides that, the owner, that cat is mad cool. Props to you Bryan you've done great things with Tomo. Easily the best sushi in the area. If you're super far south west in goodyear avondale area and you want sushi. Tomo is the top choice.
