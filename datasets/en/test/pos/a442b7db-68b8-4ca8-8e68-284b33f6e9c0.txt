Awesome location set among the Tempe Buttes (with a long E). Great pool area, including live music on weekends, a small water slide, swim-through passageway, and activities for kids. Lovely rooms-- ask for one with a deck facing the pool. There are several Jacuzzis set among the rocks, which is very unusual and romantic. Look for specials for under $100 during the summer months.
