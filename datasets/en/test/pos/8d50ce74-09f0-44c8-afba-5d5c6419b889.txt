PERFECTION.

Best restaurant in AZ hands down. It is over the top. From the moment you walk in, the service, the execution of the food, the wine pairings, the artistry of the menu, from the moment you leave - a handwritten thank you note, water, and chocolates in your car. Everything is on point. Pure artistry and close attention to every detail. Very, very expensive but worth it. The price point will probably keep me from becoming a regular but I very much look forward to returning again.
