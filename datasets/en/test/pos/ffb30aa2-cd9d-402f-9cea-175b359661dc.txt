This may well be the best roast beef sandwich I've ever had. The meat was really good and was prepared very well, and the bread was incredible. I had some of their own brew root beer and really liked it. Very rich flavor and full-bodied.
  The place is pretty small, and not much room to sit and eat. The staff felt like they were all family and it was very cordial - I felt like they were glad I was there.
