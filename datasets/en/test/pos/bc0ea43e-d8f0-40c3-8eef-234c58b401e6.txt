Beautiful office, awesome staff. The hygienists are very nice and have a gentle hand when they do the cleanings.

Plus there are little perks that a lot of dental and medical practices seem to forget these days. They are really good about reminding you for your appointments and I have never had longer than a 5 or 10 minute wait for my appointment.

My only quibble with them, is that they are always going for the upsell (whitening, straightening, oral cancer screening?). Thankfully, they've toned it down quite a bit recently, and if you give them a firm "not interested" they leave you alone.
