This review is written by a former skeptic--thinking Boot Camp would consist of aerobic dancing and yoga. . . 

I was mistaken.  The Ultimate Body Boot Camp (UBBC) is an intense, fast paced full body workout that is often grueling.  It rivals 2 a day football practices, condensed into an hour.  Within 4 weeks, I saw dramatic improvements in both cardiovascular endurance and strength, and quickly lost weight.  

It is never boring, and Richelle is great and highly amusing.  The one nit--6:30 a.m. or 7 p.m. classes por favor!

I recommend!
