Rosati's Pizza is the best Pizza I have eaten in Arizona. I call in my order and it is always ready after my twenty minute drive. You heard that right, I will drive twenty minutes for an excellent pizza. Rosati's Pizza originated from my home town of Chicago. They put their ingredients under the cheese and it is cooked to perfection every time. The staff is friendly and competent. There is no dinning room at this location.
