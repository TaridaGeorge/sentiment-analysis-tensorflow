This market makes me wish I lived in Chandler.  Now that I know about it, I am going to have to start making weekly shopping trips all the way from N. Sucksdale.  Solid meat and seafood offerings.  Dry and frozen ingredients that make me want to get into the kitchen ASAFP.  Tons of sauces and spices.  Good prices.

I've heard that the Peoria location has more and better produce available, but what was available at the Chandler store seemed totally good to me.

PLEASE NOTE:  In the event that there is anyone looking for legit Caribbean/West Indian items, this place is holding.  Walkerswood, Matouk's, Pickapeppa and Grace, among others.  

Right on, Lee Lee...right on.
