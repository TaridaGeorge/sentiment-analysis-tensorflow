This gym is awesome. Since it is new, it is clean and well kept. Not to mention it has both a swimming pool AND basketball court. This is rare in that most clubs have just one or neither.

Also, since I am overweight, I hate going to gyms where I get harassed by personal trainers who say, "Have you looked into personal training?" except they really mean, "Hey Fatso, gimme your money!" At this 24 hour I have never been approached by a trainer. I appreciate that, I really do.

It is a great facility, highly recommended. The only downside is it is near a Wal-Mart. Anything near a Wal-Mart usually lose a star in my book, but I'll make an exception for this 24 hour.
