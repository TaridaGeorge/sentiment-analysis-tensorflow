By far one of my new favorite places in the valley !
It Is what I wish ever public park looked like throughout the united states.
Summer nights on Sunday are a picture perfect postcard of America -fireflies in June, families dancing and singing along with the live band..
This place is kids dream true a rail road train that goes around the park only  $2 (:
