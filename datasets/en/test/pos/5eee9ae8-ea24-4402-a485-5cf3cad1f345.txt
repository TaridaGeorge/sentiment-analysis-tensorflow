i have always loved  whole foods but this one tops them all as they have an amazing bar with at least 20 beers on tap- microbrews and imports. they have a beer class every friday at 7:00pm and james, the brewmaster, is super knowledgable and does an awesome job. they have mini restaurants in the store so you can eat while you drink. i look forward to my friday nights off so i can go, be educated, and have great beer!
