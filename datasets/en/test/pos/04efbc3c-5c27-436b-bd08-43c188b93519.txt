The lady that makes the tea is a true professional. She even has degrees in it! She was extremely knowledgeable and was willing to make or suggest anything to heal your ailment. It's a truly wonderful place to go, especially if you are not feeling very well. This is the first place I go if I start to feel like I'm about to get sick. And the prices are pretty good too!
