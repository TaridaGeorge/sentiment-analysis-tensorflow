LOVE THIS PLACE!  This place should not be hidden - wish I found it sooner.  Since I found the place we go on an average three times a week.  They have this amazing happy hour with 20 items to pick from averaging $4 dollars each.  I have not found one item I did not like, their empanadas are their signature dish for $9.  The staff is helpful, friendly and make your visit fun.  

The sangria's are the best I've had and for $5 is right up my alley.  For those complaining about paying $20 for dinner item, this is the average for all higher end places, this is no pancho's and not to mention you can pick many items from their happy hour and walk out with a $35 bill with drinks two adults!  Also, I've been given several 20% discount cards to save more - LOVE THIS PLACE!
