I tried this place out for the first time today and must say it was the best experience I've ever had eating Filipino food in Arizona. Not only is the food spectacular (I had the Lechon plate), but the people are as friendly as ever! I'd been waiting to find a place in the metro Phoenix valley that serves tasty Filipino food with integrity and a positive attitude. I am happy to say that I have found it. Pinakamasarap na pagkain sa valley for sure!
