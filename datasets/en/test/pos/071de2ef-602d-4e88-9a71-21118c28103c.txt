Wow. Tuck Shop is totally one of those places that you want to remain hidden so you can have it all to yourself, but you feel torn because it is so incredibly amazing, that you know it deserves to be really successful. But moving on; ever since my first visit to the Tuck Shop 2 months ago, I have returned 4 times. Each time a friend is visiting town I take them there because it is such a crowd pleaser. 

Like everyone said, you could just point to anything on the menu and be satisfied. I order the mac and cheese with lobstah~ every time but I've also tried the roasted beets, chickory salad, tamales, and chicken and waffles. All so so good. The cheese curds also out of this world!

They have good drink specials also!
