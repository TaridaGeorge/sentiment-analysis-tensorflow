Oh Bev Mo how I miss you!!!

I used to live five minutes from this location and would shop here at least once a week.

Bev Mo is an alcoholics paradise! They stock hard to find beers and wines that you won't find at most liquor stores. 

Now that I'm living in Central PHX I'm at least 15 minutes away from the nearest Bev Mo, so now I have to resort crappy, over priced liquor stores.

I have always found the prices at Bev Mo to be great and cheaper than you can get at the grocery store or liquor store.  They have an excellent selection of booze.
