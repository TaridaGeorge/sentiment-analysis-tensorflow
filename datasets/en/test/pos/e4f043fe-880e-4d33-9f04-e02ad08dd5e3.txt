Wow! The tabbouli salad here was impressive, fresh and delicious. 
The gyro meat was thickly sliced, ot thinly sliced like most greek places serve.
The hummus was flavorful and had a kick to it.  Maybe paprika?  
The pita chips are fried in house. They where served hot and greasy.

My entire dining experience here was amazing and alot $$$$ cheaper than the other greek place that we frequent! 

FREE WIFI at this place! Not bad.  

***You will need some serious mouthwash when you're done eating here.  So I don't recommend it if you're out on a date*** smooch smooch, no, no!
