I cannot say enough good things about this place.  Everything, absolutely everything, was impeccable.  We dined in a private room with a party of about 20 and were impressed with the details, the quality of the service, and the food.

First off, the wait staff is well trained and even has personality.  Imagine that!  They often set down plates in synchrony or picked things up in synchrony.  My wine glass never got too low and everything from the amuse to the dessert was very tasty.  

I had:

Salad inspired by Local Farmers- 4 stars
Rib Eye steak, medium rare- 4 stars- a little fatty but they always are!
Chocolate Three Ways, dessert- 5 stars

Service- 5 stars
Wine- 5 stars
Atmosphere- 5 stars

What a lovely experience.  Exactly what a fine dining event should feel like, without the pretentiousness and snobbish attitude one often encounters in "nice" restaurants.
