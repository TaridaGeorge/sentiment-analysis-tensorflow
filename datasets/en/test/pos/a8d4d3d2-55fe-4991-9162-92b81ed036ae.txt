This is such a fun shop to visit...great selection of Vintage apparel & accessories, with NO FUNKY smells either--items are cleaned before they are available for sale.

The clothing room is nicely organized; blouses, skirts, jackets, coats, shoes, scarves, mens clothing, purses, and much more! So many wonderful things to look at...items are nicely displayed.

I haven't found anything I couldn't live without yet, but I stop in whenever I'm in the area, sometimes it's just hit or miss with Vintage finds. Love this place!
