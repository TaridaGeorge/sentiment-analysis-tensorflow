Definitely 5 star BBQ!!! 
We went to Joes based on local recommendations but it was sub par and dry... The meat wasn't moist and juicy... 
Rudy's BBQ was outstanding!! We had to drive out of our way to get there and our whole softball team showed up and everybody loved it!! 
Even my buddy... We are from NorCal and guys had to admit it was better than our hometown favorite Everett & Jones!!! 
I'm looking forward to our next trip out this way... Just to come back to Rudy's!!!
