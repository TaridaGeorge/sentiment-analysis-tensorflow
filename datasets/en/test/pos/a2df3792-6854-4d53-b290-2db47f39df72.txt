You have to get here early and careful they close when they run out of donuts. This is a great spot for freshly made donuts. The prices are great and the breakfast sandwiches are good also.
  I was a regular at D.D. in FL until they shrunk the portion sizes... Like we wouldn't notice Mr.Dunkin? Anyhow a huge tiger tail aka. Bow Tie or a giant Bear Claw for only $1.69, you can't beat it. 
  I've been a regular here for about a month, the only down side is if you go around noon your selection shrinks considerably. And don't expect them to be open by three. Enjoy your donuts, but if you start going to often you may have to renew your gym membership!
