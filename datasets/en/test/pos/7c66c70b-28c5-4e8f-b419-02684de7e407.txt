I can't say enough about Zin burger at the Biltmore. In addition to the great food, the service is phenomenal!  We usually sit at the bar, and the bartenders are attentive an friendly and on top of everything no matter how busy it gets. The management seems top notch as well, and incredibly accommodating. The atmosphere is the other great thing about this restaurant. It just doesnt get any better than this!
