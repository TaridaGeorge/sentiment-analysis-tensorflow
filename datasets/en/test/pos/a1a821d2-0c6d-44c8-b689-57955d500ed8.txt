Super friendly and knowledgeable staff.  No liquor licence, but they also don't charge a corking fee which is great.

The rolls are average, but their sashimi is excellent.  The yellow tail, toro, golden thai, and the holomokosomethingorother were so good and fresh that it basically melted in the mouth.  The pickled wasabi root that came with the Yellowtail was also quite excellent.  
Apparently they get their fish in on Thursday, so if you want it fresh, Thursday is the day to go.  That's when I went and I gotta say Wow!  So good.
The bill wasn't exactly cheap, but it isn't every day that you get that fresh of fish in Phoenix that meets that quality.
A+  I will definitely be back (on a Thursday)
