Bottom line is Tops has an outrageous selection of beers, liquors, and wines.  If you are a scotch fan look no further than the single malt heaven that awaits you here.  Chances are very good that you will find what you are looking for.  I reported a while back that their refrigerators don't seem to do the trick but they've since been fixed and I am happy to say that the beers are as cold as the Rocky Mountain peaks.  I also like that Tops is locally owned and operated.
