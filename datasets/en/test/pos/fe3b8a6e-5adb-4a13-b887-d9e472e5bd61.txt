Stayed there for the first time while visiting for work.  I was pleasantly surprised to find all the amenities and style of an expensive hotel at such a competitive price.  I highly recommend it.   While there, I had a unique situation that the entire staff helped resolve.  The professionalism was superb.  Mr. Metgzer and Mr. Watkins went above the call of duty to make sure I was happy.  They alone were reason to return.  It was my first time staying at Aloft in Tempe, I look forward to coming back often.
