Love this place. I went there for the first time this morning. It was outstanding. When we where told the wait was over an hour we debated not staying. I am so glad we did. Totally worth it. 

Everything was cooked perfect. The homemade bread with preserves was awesome. I got the hashbrowns which where great. So much butter which I know is bad for you but if you are coming here for breakfast I doubt health food is what you are looking for. My girlfriend got the home fries which where actually better. 

Just the best breakfast in town period. Go there and wait it out. So worth it.
