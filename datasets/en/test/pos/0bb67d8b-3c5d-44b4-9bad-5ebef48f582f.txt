Read quite a few reviews on yelp before trying this place out. Decided to get the Thai Chicken Wrap today, it was phenomenal!! I'm still smiling from the wonderful blend of flavors!! I will def be coming back to try out the rest of their menu. For a dessert I tried one of their Pecan Bars, it was a delight! I suggest anyone that is in the area and is looking for a light, but filling lunch, give Bertha's Cafe a try!
