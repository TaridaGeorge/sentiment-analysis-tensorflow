I don't usually give a five star review but this is the best of the best in our growing town of Surprise.  I have eaten there twice now and I can't wait to go back. First time we ate at the bar and it was very busy so we had to wait longer than usual for our food.  I had the cornish game hen and it was falling off the bone delicious. Service is good & I like the modern decor of the restaurant.  Next visit I invited four friends to join us for dinner and much to my surprise everyone was happy.  It is hard to please everyone!  I had the garlic noodles and they were divine.  We need more restaurants like this in Surprise.  Next I'm going to try the Shaken Beef.
