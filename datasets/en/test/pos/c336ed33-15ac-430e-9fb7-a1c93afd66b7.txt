Todd was very pleasant when I phoned to make my appointment to have my carpets cleaned.  He gave me a window when he would be at my house and said he would call me 1/2 hour beforehand.  Sure enough, on the appointed day, I got the phone call from Todd in the window telling me he would be there in 1/2 hour.  He quickly assessed the rooms and stairs that I wanted done and quoted me a very fair price.  I left him to work and he was done in less than 1.5 hours (and I had a LOT of large areas to do!)  The carpets not only look fabulous but, he got out several stains that I thought were permanent.  Thanks Todd!  Excellent service and price.  I will be calling you again.
