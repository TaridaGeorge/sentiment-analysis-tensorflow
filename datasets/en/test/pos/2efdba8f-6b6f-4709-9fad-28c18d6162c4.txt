Great beer, Great food! Love this place! My family and I go here about once a week and the food and service are always fantastic! The patio is the best place to sit even during the summer! My favorite is the vegetarian Greek.  The apple and cinnamon dessert pasty is excellent as well.  

Highly recommend!
