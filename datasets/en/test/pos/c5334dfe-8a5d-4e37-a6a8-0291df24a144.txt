Funghi pizza: Crispy, chewy crust topped with the perfect blend of wild mushrooms!

Pesto pizza: deliciously chewy crust with basil pesto sauce and cherry tomatoes, a little too heavy on the cheese for my liking.

Margherita pizza: same amazing crust, my only complaint is too much cheese making the pizza very heavy.
