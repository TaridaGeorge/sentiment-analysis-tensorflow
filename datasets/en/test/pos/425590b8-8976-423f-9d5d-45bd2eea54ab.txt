5 stars for the great $5 happy hour specials. the short rib tacos and the fish tacos are delicious and a bargain at 5 for 5 bucks. My favorite drink is the green tea lemonade--it was heavy on the liqour and so refreshing.

Service was flawless. We were greeted hello and goodbye by two cheerful hostesses, our waiter and waitress offered great suggestions and the bar tender was sweet as well.
