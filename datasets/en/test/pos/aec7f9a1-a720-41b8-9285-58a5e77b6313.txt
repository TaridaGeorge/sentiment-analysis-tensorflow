What a wonderful ladies lunch spot in North Scottsdale!   This place is amazing!   The atmosphere is fantastic for a light summer dress and a refreshing glass of wine.   
We ordered the crab dip to start and I had the salmon as my main course.  The perfect amount of food and a great value.  My family has a farming background so I LOVE the fact they support the local growers.   
Our server couldn't have been cuter.  She was very attentive and welcoming.   It was more like a homey bed and breakfast type feel than a restaurant.   
Mini-stay-cation!
