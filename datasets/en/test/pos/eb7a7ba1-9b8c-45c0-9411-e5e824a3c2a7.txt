If you need short-term nursing care and rehabilitation following a surgery, this is the place to get it.  

Dear Mom is currently here following back surgery, and what a place it is!  This is an excellent alternative to a nursing home.  We have nicknamed this place the Taj Majal.  

The rooms are all private suites, beautifully decorated and luxurious.  There is 24-hour nursing care, great dining facilities, and rehabilitation services.  Mom's insurance covers the costs.

The staff is very attentive and the place is spotless.  It smells great- like a hotel, not a hospital.  The staff is professional and friendly, and not only do they remember the details about Mom, they remember who we are.  T too.  The public facilities are as luxurious as any nice resort.  Heck, I'd consider vacationing here if they did price fixe and cocktails!
