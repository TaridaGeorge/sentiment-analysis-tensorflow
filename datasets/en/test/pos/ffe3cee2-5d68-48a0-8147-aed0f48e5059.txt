This is one of my very favorite places. The food is consistent, the service is great and the prices are fair. 

Slate martini and lemoncello are certainly highly recommended.

I had a calzone with the ingredients I always order my pizza: Caramelized onions, peperoni, goat cheese and mushrooms!

Chop harvest salad, beet salad, caprese or Melburry sandwich are some of my favs. And if you like garlic, the elephant garlic is great.

BTW, the cheese platter and the hummus are unbeatable!

Enjoy.
