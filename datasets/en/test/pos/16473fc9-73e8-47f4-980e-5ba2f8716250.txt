We recently went shopping and of course our kids belong to their kids club. Our daughter couldn't decide on her organic apple. Well the nice gentleman stocking the apple section offered to let her daughter sample an apple. He gladly cut up a super cold Pink Lady and brought it to us. It was fantastic & our daughter found a new favorite. Our only regret, we didn't get the gentleman's name to thank him in this review. Thank You Sir for being so kind to our daughter!
