This place is awesome!! It was easy to find and has its own parking lot which is a major plus for an old town restaurant. I love the overall decor. I went with a group of people and it was great. I think it would be equally as nice on a date or just with a friend. The chef was really welcoming and came out to our table to see how everything was. The beer and wine selection was extensive. I have never been much of a beer fan but I actually tried one I liked. It's called "OMG" or something like that. The beers seemed to be very high in alcohol content which my friends loved. The food was amazing!! We ordered some apps and each got our own meals. Everything I tasted was wonderful. I absolutely can't wait to go back again!
