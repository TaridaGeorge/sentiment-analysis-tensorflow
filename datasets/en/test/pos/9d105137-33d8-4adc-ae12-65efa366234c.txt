this place is FANTASTIC!!! for $2.25/piece, you really can't go wrong with getting your clothes dry cleaned here! The staff was friendly, my clothing came back spotless, and everyone was happy! For all those interviews, conferences, board meetings when you need to be looking sharp, definitely take your clothes to park avenue cleaners!
