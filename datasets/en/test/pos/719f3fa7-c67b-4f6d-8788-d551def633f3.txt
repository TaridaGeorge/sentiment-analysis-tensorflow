I loved this little bar and would love to come back to catch an independent flick!  I certainly would have caught todays matinee if I had the time.  

Thanks for hosting the Yelp group for our Yelpiday Local Crawl.

Great art and decor in this lounge/bar/cinema.  The staff was super nice and the wine was superb.

Thanks FilmBar for supporting the downtown area!
