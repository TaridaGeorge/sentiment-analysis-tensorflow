Very good.  Not the best I have ever had but near the top for sure.  I travel alot and being a pizza hound my goal is to try them all.  Its got a original taste to it.  Think its the cheese.  Original in a good way.  Crust is unique also.  Price was good and staff was very nice.  Will be on my regular rotation when I'm in the area.  You gotta go try it.
