I've only been here once for a birthday dinner party outing, but I will definitely be back. Food was fantastic and everyone in our group of 8 was satisfied. If you like spicy and delicious Thai, look no further!  Lots of variety on the menu and a lot of vegetarian options or the option to make a dish veggie, which is not often found dining out.  The atmosphere was also lovely, and this place was rocking on a Friday night! Seems like I recall several large parties, so you know it's a crowd pleaser. Come prepared with cash though if dining in a large group, as it is not their policy to split checks. Since we did not come prepared, our waiter was very courteous and did split out the bill for us when requested, but I know it took some work for him behind the scenes.
