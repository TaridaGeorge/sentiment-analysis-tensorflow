I've been here for several events, most recently Madame Butterfly, but also some plays and saw Regina Spektor.  Every time I go, I get a little thrill of excitement, knowing that I'll be in such a historic and regal enviornment.

I've never had a bad seat, and even waiting for the show to begin, you can enjoy just looking at the amazing details in this building.

If you can, they do a lunchtime tour of the theater, I highly recommend it.    You learn a whole new level of appreciation for the building, and you can impress your friends next time you go there for a show.
