amen.
there's finally a really great chinese restaurant near my house.
i'm telling you, chandler is the secret gem of phoenix.
anyway...my husband just picked out some food and brought it home.
we had hot & sour soup, kund pao chicken, and what i think would be called lo mein. (soft noodles). oh man, oh man.
everything was great but especially the noodles. these things were homemade.
