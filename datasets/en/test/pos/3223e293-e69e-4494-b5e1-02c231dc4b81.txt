I love this place!! I've been here 3 or 4 times now and have never been disappointed! So far, we've tried the rusticas, the thin pie, the mozzarella encorozza (have to get it!) and even the Club sandwich!! Everything has been delicious!! In addition to the great food, the service couldn't be better either - our servers have been friendly, courteous and always ask how everything was. Not to mention, I've seen each of the owners back behind the bar serving customers as well! It's a good place for pizza and you're not compromising anything in return!! Go already!
