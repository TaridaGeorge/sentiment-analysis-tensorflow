Sweet Republic was so good that I came here the very next day after I discovered it.  I felt a little bit guilty having the scooper help me test almost all of their delicious flavors, but I figured I am going to become their best customer ever!  Their Belgium chocolate is creamy and has just a delicious chocolate flavor.  Their pumpkin ice cream tastes just like pie and their sorbets are icy goodness.
