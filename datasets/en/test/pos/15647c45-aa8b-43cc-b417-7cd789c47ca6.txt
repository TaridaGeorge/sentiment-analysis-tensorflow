The barista held nothing back in describing the flavor characteristics of their roasted beans, and helped me pick out the perfect coffee for me, it being my first time in the shop.  I eventually settled on the 24-hour cold brew coffee, which is amazing, an I'm looking forward to trying their other flavors.  

Big pluses are the friendly barista, atmosphere, and quality.  I'll definitely be coming back Macbook in hand to spend some more quality time here.  Maybe I'll be lucky enough to find some people to play chess with or make interesting conversation.
