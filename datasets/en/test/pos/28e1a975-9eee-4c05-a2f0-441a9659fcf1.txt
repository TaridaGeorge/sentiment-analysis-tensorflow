I love this place!  After a trip to Paris a couple years ago where I literally LIVED off ham & cheese baguettes and crepes... I was searching for a place locally to get my "fix."  Found Chez Vous and so glad I did.  I always order the same thing, the croque sandwich and one of the crepes.  Both are always amazing and service is attentive as well.
