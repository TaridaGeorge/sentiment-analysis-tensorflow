This was my first time here. I was jonesing for something Italian and this was the closest. I ended up getting the baked spaghetti calzone. Unlike the other reviewer, I thought it was fabulous. Very good. I got it to go, so the marinara was on the side, which I prefer. I've never had a baked spaghetti calzone and this was a great first experience. I'll definitely come back, maybe to sit and stay a bit.
