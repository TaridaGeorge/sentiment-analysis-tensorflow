This place is awesome! The staff works hard, they are friendly and I am amazed how often I have watched them out cleaning tables and windows while I have been here.

The children's menu is very good. Chicken, fruit, box of Minute Maid apple juice. I couldn't do better myself. And the kid's love the play area which is enclosed so the adults can listen to the awesome classical music while we enjoy our meal.

My 6 year old enjoyed listening to the music while we discussed what instruments (cello, flute, violin) he was hearing while I brought up pictures on my iPad. Quite an educational lunch for him!

You can't beat this place for "fast food"!!!
