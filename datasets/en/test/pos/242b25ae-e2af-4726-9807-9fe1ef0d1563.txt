Been eating at Royal Thai ever it opened maybe 12 years ago.  LOVE it.  The owners are wonderful and the food is FANTASTIC!     They always ask you how spicy you want it.  The menu choices include your choice of meat.  If you don't want any meat you can choose that also.  Just about everything is made to order.  You can order from the menu are order one of the lunch or dinner specials.  The owners always greet us warmly and are very friendly and helpful.
