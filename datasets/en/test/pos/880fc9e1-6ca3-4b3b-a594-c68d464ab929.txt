As a person who has no idea how to do my own hair, I have been forced to go to countless salons every time that I have an event to attend where I need to look presentable.   I end up doing this about once a month - so I have quite a large basis for comparison - and I have never been so pleased as I was with my blowout yesterday.   I got it done at 1 PM and looked good through the entire evening.  Also, Alexis, the receptionist was super friendly and helpful in terms of figuring out exactly what I wanted and my stylist, Sarah, made it happen.  It was like magic.   I'm going to come to drybar from now on.....no need to keep trying other places.  :)  

Highly recommend!
