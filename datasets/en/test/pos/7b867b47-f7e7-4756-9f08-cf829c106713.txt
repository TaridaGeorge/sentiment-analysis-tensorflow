For my second visit to Crust, I convinced my friends who are also mothers of twins to go and have our girls night.  We had an awesome time.  The pizza rustica is so delicious.  I wolfed it down so fast I didn't realize I had no left overs for my husband to take home.  We were having such a great time and a nice couple on the next table decided to buy our wine bottles. That was a really sweet gesture. I can't wait to come back.  Actually, I am going to check out their new restaurant on Tatum and Bell.  Our server mentioned it opened a couple of days ago.  That branch is closer to us and I was told Toni, the guy at the oven making the pizzas will be there.
