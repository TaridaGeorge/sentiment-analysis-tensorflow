SO my friend, and I wanted something to eat for dinner..we were craving something other than the usual McDonald's, Denny's, or any other mundane restaurant that failed at tantalizing our taste buds.  So I went on yelp, and looked around for a new, and exciting place for us to explore, and I saw this place.  Now I've had Indian Fry Bread for the first time several months ago, and I loved the store but could never acquire more..so when I saw this place I was all over it.  There isn't an abundance of parking, and it gets crowded very quickly but as my friend stated that's a good sign.  The interior is decorated with Native American artwork, artifacts, and pictures.  It's a pretty cozy place, we will be back.
