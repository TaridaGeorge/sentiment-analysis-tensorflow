The Scottsdale Greenbelt is one of the most impressive array of parks in the valley. The multiple mile long paved walking / biking path is a haven for riders and joggers alike. The string of fabulous parks serves as both a phenomenal flood basin, and a fantastic community centerpoint. 

I love riding my bike or running down the paved road numerous times a week. It's one of the city's best accomplishments. The Scottsdale Green Belt brings two sides of a city into a whole, and provides the cities of Scottsdale and Tempe a beautiful green space complimented by an excellent multi-use path.
