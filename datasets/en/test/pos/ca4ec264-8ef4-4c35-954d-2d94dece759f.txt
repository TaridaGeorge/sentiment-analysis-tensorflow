Yes! Best Pho in Phoenix, taking into account price and convenience. The portions are huge, as is to be expected with a XL bowl of pho. The broth is superb. No salt water here, like some other cut rate places. I don't know what else I can say that other's haven't already. This place doesn't have a high rating for nothing. The build-your-own spring rolls are good too.

It's small and homey. Exactly what you would expect for a family owned restaurant. It's like having a meal in someone's home. You can taste the love that has gone into the meal and that's what counts.
