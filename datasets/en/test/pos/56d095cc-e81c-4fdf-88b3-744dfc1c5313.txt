SUCH a beautiful park. The first time I walked around 1) the lake 2) hiking trails I couldn't stop smiling. Probably looked like a cougar ready to pounce on her prey haha 

Went close to sunset so the colors of the skyline were amazing over the water. LOVED the natural beauty of the hiking trail and the wildlife animals that adorned it. Definitely recommend this place to visitors and residents. 

Family friendly, pet friendly, exercise friendly, and all of the above!
