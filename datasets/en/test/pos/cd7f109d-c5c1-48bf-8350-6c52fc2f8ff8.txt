I ate here on consecutive days early in the morning.  US Egg opens at 6:30 AM.  The charming hostess cheerfully greeted me the first day and the owner greeted me the next day.

I ordered the wonderful french toast the first day and was greeted with the wonderful smell of cinnamon on top of the perfectly prepared breakfast.  The hostess and the waitress came by to check to see how I was doing.

I ordered the traditional breakfast the next day consisting of two eggs over easy, four sausages, potatoes and an English muffin.  

I will come here again, maybe for lunch.
