On Sunday, Chef Porter had a Labor Day special of Maine Lobster.  It was fantastic!  The food was excellent and the service was incredible.  Thank you Amy, Sarah & Michael for a wonderful experience.  We will definitely be back.  In fact, 2 weeks ago we had the Sunday brunch and it was another outstanding dining experience.
