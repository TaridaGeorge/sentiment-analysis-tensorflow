This place is fantastic. Great for all sushi and non-sushi lovers.  

Service was great, atmosphere is relaxing and modern, and the food is delicious. My group and I ordered the spring rolls, gyozas, shrimp tempura rolls, chicken teriyaki, and lobster tempura. All absolutely mouth-watering. The lobster tempura actually feels like it's melting in your mouth it's so good. 

Our server was so nice and very attentive. 

This place is now on my regular circulation of restaurants. I can't wait to come back for happy hour.
