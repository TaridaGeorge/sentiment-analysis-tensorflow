OMG
I freakin' love this place!

How have I not been here before??!?!?!

I want to eat here everyday.

I had the spicy teriyaki chicken with brown rice, and I thought it was AMAZING

My bf had the pulled pork and I tried it and thought it was better than most of the pulled pork we had in Hawaii (though they don't carry poi... boo)

So yeah.  I dug this place.  I'm excited to try the other items on the menu, although since the teriyaki was soooo good it'll be hard not to get it!

AGHH!
I LOVE!
