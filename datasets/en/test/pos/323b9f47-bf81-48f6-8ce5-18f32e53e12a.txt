Some of the most bomb pho this state has to offer.  I can vouch for the Pho Tai, the Bun/noodle salad dishes, and the wonton noodle soup dealio.  Plus, the old dude who works there is a pretty friendly guy unlike most Asian-hole-in-the-wall establishments that put customer service dead last.  Thus, the food is good, the prices are fair, and the workers are friendly.  Why not eat here?
