My husband and I go here every year for our anniversary. Absolutely LOVE it! We look forward to it every year. We really go all out and each get our own appetizer, drinks, main course, and dessert. My husband always gets the BBQ shrimp and I get the crab cakes. Both amazing!!! For our main course I get the petite fillet and shrimp and he gets the rib eye. Never been disappointed. Cooked to perfection. Sides are always wonderful too. Service is great too. I really have NOTHING bad to say. :)
