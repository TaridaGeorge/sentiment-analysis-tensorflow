This is a tiny, independent establishment... and I loved it.

I headed here for supper after a foodie friend highly recommended it. It felt more like eating in someones home rather than a restaurant. I enjoyed everything from the appetizer (stuffed mushrooms), to the main course (salmon) and dessert (tiramisu). 

This kind of place is what makes the valley so special.
