I met the Pastry Chef (Katie) @ anthropolgie casually talking about  dainty dishes wich lead into conversations about Lux and after hearing about it  I had to try it.  The coffee was FAB!  The cake we had and Pie  Was fantastic *****five stars!  Next time I visit Arizona I am making it one of my destinations for that perfect pastry and coffee combo!  Katie if you ever go anywhere else let me know I will Follow!  Come to Texas!  LOL
