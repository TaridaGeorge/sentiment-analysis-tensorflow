We purchased a foreclosure home and have a lot of 'to do lists', one of them solved by Dryer Vent Doctor! We had a great washer/dryer set, but seemed upon installing them in this home the dryer would take two cycles (or more) to dry, That was unusual as it had always worked before and was of great quality. The dryer vent goes straight up and vents to the roof. Dyer Vent Doctor came by, cleaned the vent and now the dryer performs in less than one cycle, sometimes 20 minutes. Highly recommend this inexpensive and cost saving service!
