I ordered pizza tonight, delivery of course. I ordered online. The pizza was delivered fresh and fast. The young lady who delivered the pizza was friendly. Pizza was absolutely deliciious. Ordering online is great. No having to be on hold or wait  in line. Ordering online is fast and even fun. They have a pizza online and when you add the toppings it is animated. So cool!
