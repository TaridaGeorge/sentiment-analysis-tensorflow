Arguably some of the best food in AZ. I've been going here since college. It's electric 'free-spirit' vibe only adds to the experience of some seriously amazing food. I've been to nearly all the locations and unlike some multiple-location restaurants each one is very similar to the other and carries its indie vibe through-and-through.

Would recommend the hummus w/ grilled chicken (if you're feeling adventurous go with the TRIO of hummus) Tsatziki and the 'Fruit and Cheese Fantasia.' 

I've really never been let down in almost 10 years and the prices will work for a big or college-thrifty budget.
