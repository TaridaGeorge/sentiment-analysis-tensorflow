Wow what a surprise that I have walked right past this spot for years. Thank goodness for Groupon.I purchased a Groupon deal that encouraged me to try their food. We ordered 2 types of pizza, a side salad, and sampled some Gelato. Of course the Gelato was delish, but I can finally say I have found a place in Old town who makes a GOOD small salad that doesnt charge an arm & a leg. I am so glad to have finally found a good spot to eat, that is also open late. The only improvement I could see being made...delivery to local businesses :-)
