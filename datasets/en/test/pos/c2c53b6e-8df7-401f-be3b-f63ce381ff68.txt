I have seen all three doctors (Dr. Pham only once in the hospital when my third was born).  Because he was the attending pediatrician I fell into this office and have felt grateful ever since.  The doctors are friendly (especially the PA Johanna!)  The staff is courteous, helpful, and really know their stuff!!  I particularly appreciate their knowledge on billing situations.  I have only had to wait once or twice, mostly I am seen quickly.  I've moved a lot and therefore have had my kids go to a lot of different pediatricians and this is by far my favorite office.
