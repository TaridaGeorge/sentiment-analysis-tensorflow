There is a place, not so far away, where the wine is delicious and the tranquil sounds of divine music play. Should you arrive at this place with a desire for stomach satisfaction, the food will provide the vehicle for your satisfaction. My family came here to have dinner prior to going to Zoo Lights. Our guide was friendly and gentle. Ryn is the best and was able to direct our choices as to food and drink. We had the pizza which was okay (a little soggy) and the vegetabe plate and the hot dogs with fries and fruit. The place is best with just you and someone that you want to pounce on (super romantic) however, they are kind to children as well.
