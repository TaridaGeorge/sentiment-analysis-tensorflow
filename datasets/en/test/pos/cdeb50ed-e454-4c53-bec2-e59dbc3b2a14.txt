This is a must for anyone in the valley during the holidays. This is my second year attending and once again I felt the Christmas Holiday as soon as I stepped into the gardens. Never feel like I have enough time hustling from band to band. 

DBG did another amazing job with a great selection of music, service and of course the beauty of the luminarias thru out the gardens. We had the set meal again this time and it was well worth the additional cost. 

Whether you want to relax by the fire listening to Spanish guitar, or get energized by the Travelers band the DBG Luminarias is one of the most memorable yearly events in Phoenix.

This event is great for families, couples or friends.
