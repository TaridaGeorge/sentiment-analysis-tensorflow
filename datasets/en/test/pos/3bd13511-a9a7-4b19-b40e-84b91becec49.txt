great food, huge portions (though wouldn't mind some more pita!), very friendly waitstaff, and they never disappoint.

the lamb souvlaki is AMAZING, the zucchini cakes, greek fries, gyros, desserts, and pastas are all good... everything we've ordered (and we've been here a lot) has been great

can't think of anything negative really! five stars it is
