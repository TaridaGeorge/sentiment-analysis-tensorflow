I have to review this place to give it 5 stars for just one sandwich.  For what it is (fast food) their hamburger (not all of them) is top notch.

Here's the deal.  Go in and get a 1/2 pound double with cheese.  No substitutions.  Nada.

Get some napkins too.  You'll need them.

I'm pretty snobby about burgers. Holy crap is it good. It just is. I almost hate that it is so damn good.  BUT IT IS!

Could be that I didn't spend $13 dollars on it, BUT IT IS!
