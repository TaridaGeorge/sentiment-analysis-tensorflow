I'm not going to pretend to know what authentic Hawaiian food is supposed to taste like but my ex-boyfriend is from there and says this place is the real deal. He use to take me to eat here all the time and I loved it. So when I had a luau I knew I had to come here for some manapua and beef sticks. Aloha kitchen did not disappoint. I placed a large order of both and everything was delish and went smoothly.
