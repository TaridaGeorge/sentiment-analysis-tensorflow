I have been working out at CrossFit Southwest for the past year and a half. During that time my Olympic lifts have shot through the roof, along with my barbell lifts. My conditioning improved and I learned various gymnastic exercises. I have met some great friends at the gym and enjoy the training atmosphere. Ken is educated and experienced and can help anybody with their fitness goals. I would highly recommend CrossFit Southwest.
