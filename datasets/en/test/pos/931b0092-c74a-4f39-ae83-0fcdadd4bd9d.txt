I used to travel halfway across the valley to go to Joe's BBQ in Gilbert; now, I have a new favorite destination for loaded bakers.  This place is wonderful - fast service, friendly people, and AMAZING food (to be fair, I have only tried the brisket, loaded baker, pulled pork sandwich, macaroni & cheese and cornbread. I am sure there is much more to taste).  We need more go-to family restaurants like this in the neighborhood. Also, their BBQ sauce is delicious. I'm not sure what the other reviewers are talking about.
