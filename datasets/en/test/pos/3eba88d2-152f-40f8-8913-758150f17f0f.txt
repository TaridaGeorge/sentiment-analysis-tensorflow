I have been to this place several times now. Always unbelievably good! We ate there once,quite cute and quiet. Very small inside, It smells wonderful inside as well.  I love to get it to go though. The Pizza crust is amazing. Love everything we have ever ordered here. Salads, pasta and the Pizza. It is located in a rough little shopping center, but so worth going there. My most favorite Pizza shop.
