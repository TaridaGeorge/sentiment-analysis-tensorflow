we love this theatre!!! we've been going to this location ever since they opened and it never disappoints.  we've never had any problems with parking (even at their busiest ) and the place is clean (theatres and restrooms) and they have friendly staff.

don't forget that if you buy or recharge a harkins gift card with at least $25, they give you a coupon for a free medium popcorn and for $1 more you can upgrade it to a large popcorn.  it also helps to buy their refillable cup - it's $4.75 when you first purchase the cup but refills are only $1.  and as far as candies go, you're better off buying the theatre size candies at walgreens for $1 - in the theatre they're around $3.25 for the same size.
