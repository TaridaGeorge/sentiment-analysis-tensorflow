No inside area. Just drive thru and walk up.  Good for a quickie! I was SO happy to find this location when I was visiting my sis in Az! I was in need of a fix and they actually had a few pastries on the menu that I hadn't seen at other locations.. not that i tried them, but i noted them! :)

Someone said that this is actually the one on Dysart - FYI
