OOOOOWWWEEEE!! Have yall tried ATL Wings yet!!! If not what are you waiting for!  They are the BOMB Diggity!

I don't know why I haven't updated my review either, so here I go! 


The honey habanero are still my #1 but I also love the Cajun Hot!  Holy Crap!! Get some of the Cajun Hot wings and some ranch and their hot sauce on the side, dip your wing in the ranch and then the hot sauce and watch out!! The only time you really feel the burn is when you're no longer eating, gums & tongue just be blaze hot and mouth just be water for more, yes my friends that's the heat I love!!


Luv me some wings from ATL!
