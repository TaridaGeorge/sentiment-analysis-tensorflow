As far as I'm concerned this is the best corporate sandwich shop. If you've never been, when you order a sub they literally slice the meat in front you.. its more like a deli experience than a pre-weighed, pre-measured corporate chain. Their white bread is so soft and squishy and does a wonderful job of absorbing mayo, oil, vinegar.. this to me is what a sub should taste like. 

Also, they are doing the $5 dollar sub deal here, any cold sub 5 bucks!!!
