This place has a been favorite of mine since my ASU days and it doesn't get as good as having to travel to the Middle East for Shawarma, Falafel, Hummus, Kabobs, Kibbi, Tabouli Salad, etc. Haji Baba at times can be crowded but it is so worth the wait and their prices are super reasonable. After wards one can browse the adjacent market aisles of imported products from the Middle East, Asia and Europe. The front counter space area is filled with baklava, dates, candied fruits and other delectable sweets.
