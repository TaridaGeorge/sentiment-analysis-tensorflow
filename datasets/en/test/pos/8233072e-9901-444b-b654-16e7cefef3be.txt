I love this place, love taking new people here, love taking out of towners here. There isn't a bad thing on the menu. I've order all their vegetarian dishes and they are all great and super fresh! The portion sizes and prices are great for the food quality [and for Snobsdale].
The beer selection is great. My best friend ordered a Green Flash's Le Freak beer, I got a smell of it from his pour and ordered myself one. One of the best beers I've ever had and I'm a bit of a beer snob.
