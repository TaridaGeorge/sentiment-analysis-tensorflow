Apparently I am the only guy who is speaking up for guys who hate shopping, on these Yelp reviews. My ideal shopping experience is like a surgical procedure: you know what you're getting and where it is before going in, and you're in and out as quickly as possible. 

So, on behalf of that silent majority, let me say that if you are going to drag me to the mall to force me to waste 3 hours wandering around aimlessly, please do so here at the Biltmore, where I can at least get some fresh air and sunshine.
