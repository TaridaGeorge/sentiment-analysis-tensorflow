Karsh's is a transplanted New Yorker's baked good heaven.  Bagels, rugulach, black and white cookies - all delicious.  I spent a high school summer toiling away in one of the neighboring stores and gained at least five pounds due to my daily dessert of a giant fudge brownie.  

The best thing about Karsh's though is their chocolate seven-layer cake.  It is the cake of choice for almost every family gathering we have.  Not only is the yellow cake just the right amount of sponginess, but the chocolate frosting is probably the best I've ever had.  I could eat this cake for every meal of the day, and may actually have done so on at least one occasion.  Mmmm...cake.
