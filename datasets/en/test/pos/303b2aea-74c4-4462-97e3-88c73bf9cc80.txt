The food is as original as it gets..
Try the garlic wings..... and the pork fried rice..
Best egg rolls on the west coast, hands down..
greasy food when it's needed, amazing flavors that remind you of when food was good.. 

it is a very ghetto establishment, pick up only, no tables, but when you get there, you will see why..

just grab the amazing food and go!!! 

you will thank me later for the amazing food...
