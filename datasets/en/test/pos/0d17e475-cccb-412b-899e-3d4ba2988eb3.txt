I don't give five stars out often, but when I do.
Anyways long story short, if you like really good craft beers and great food, this is the place!
I've been going to Four Peaks since the owner(s) used to sleep in a cot in the back room.
It can get crowded, probably the only downside, but the atmosphere, patio and overall vibe make it worth any wait you might have to endure.
Check it out, you will be happy you did!
