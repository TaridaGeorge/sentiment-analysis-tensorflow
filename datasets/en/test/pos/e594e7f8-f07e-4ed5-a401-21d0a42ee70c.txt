This is our absolute favorite restaurant in the valley. We started going to the Tempe Four Peaks location when we were at ASU, but have since moved up north. Luckily, they have another restaurant by us! The location is a bit odd (essentially behind Party City, in a strip mall) but the food and beer is amazing.

Our favorites are: the popper burger, Italian beer bread (wrap), beer battered fries, buffalo wings, peach ale and kiltlifter. I'm sure there are MANY great options, but we've been stuck on the same order for a while because it's so good! I would like to try the french dip because every time I see someone order it, I get pretty jealous. 

The portions are huge (I always get a second meal out of mine) and the prices are fair. 

Overall it's just an awesome place and I would recommend it 100%.
