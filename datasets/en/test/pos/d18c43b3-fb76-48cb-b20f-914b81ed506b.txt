HOLY SMEEKS!

Smeeks is the greatest news for Phoenix; especially with businesses closing right and left.  I'm so happy to see another great addition to my favorite complex.  Stinkweeds, RHR, Frances, Halo, AND NOW SMEEKS. Too much greatness for my little heart.

Let's be real, where else in Phoenix can you find a 5 cent treat? Also an awesome photobooth, plus I love that I got to add my photo to the wall.  If you're disapointed by Smeeks then you must also be disappointed by Christmas morning, all birthdays, and dolphins kissing. 

Let me recommend the fat pig chocolate. SO GOOD. LIKE BEST CHOCOLATE I HAVE EVER TASTED GOOD. (are these capitals getting through to you?)

If you're going by call me, I'll meet you there.  if you're looking for m&m's head over to circle k...and enjoy your beef jerky.
