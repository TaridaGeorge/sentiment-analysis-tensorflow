We have visited twice, one time with clients and the other with family, and had delicious food and absolutely superb service each time.  Do not miss the Original Chopped Salad - justifiably famous.  Don't split it - get one all for yourself!  The bar has an excellent beer list - the Goose Island Matilda is always a treat.  Get over there!
