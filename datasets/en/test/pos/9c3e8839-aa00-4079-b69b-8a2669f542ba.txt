Wow. So I drive past this joint all the time and go, "A local bar. I should go in some time." I realize they are active on Twitter and whatnot, which is really cool.

Tonight I finally made it down there after tweeting to them to leave a TV on the Coyotes game for me. Not only did they do that, but the dude that apparently monitors the social media for CK's was actually expecting me and introduced himself to me. Do you get this kind of personal treatment at most any other place?

No, you certainly do not. It's like a modern-day Cheers, except no Woody, which is actually a positive. I always hated Woody.

Good food, good brews--they have Molson Canadian on tap, which earns them an extra-special place in my heart. Nice people. What else does a bar need?
