This was my first ever Trader Joe's experience. Now I know why all my mainland-savvy friends list this chain as their most wanted in Hawaii. Fantastic products, incredible prices, great people. Sadly, shipping anything to Hawaii would probably remove any of the freshness and price advantages a Trader Joe's offers anywhere else. But now that I've tasted Trader Joe's, I'll be back.

Note: This location didn't have a lighted exterior sign the night I came looking for it, so it took a bit of searching. The entrance to this location is currently under renovation, and that may have been the reason.
