Great food!!!! We would not have gone to this place without the rave reviews. In fact, I have never noticed Grady's, nestled in a small, half empty strip mall. The owners were so friendly and welcoming. We ordered the ribs and the chicken. The side of mac and cheese is excellent! Creamy, with a bit of a crunch. The ribs were great! A little fatty, but the portion was so large, the center cut, that I was only able to finish about 1/3 of the meal. My husband had the chicken, but he liked my ribs so much, he finished my meal. We will definitely be back for seconds!
