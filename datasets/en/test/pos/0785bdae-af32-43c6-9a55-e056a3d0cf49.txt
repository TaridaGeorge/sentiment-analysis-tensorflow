Dude, seriously?... Ive only been here for lunch, which is perfect. Tonight I popped my gal's CK Dinner Cherry. Its such a great trick at night. Great buzz, great patio. I had the Chelsea's Cheeseburger, which is $12. Yea, 12 bux for a Cheeseburger and Fries, thats so money. Check out the fish tacos too. There's definitely something about this place that keeps me wanting more.... and its not the parking.
