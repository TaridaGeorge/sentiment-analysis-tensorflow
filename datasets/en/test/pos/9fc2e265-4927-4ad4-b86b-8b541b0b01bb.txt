This place is always great.  I've never had a bad experience here.  The staff is very efficient and friendly.  

The food is awesome!  Try the garlic naan, vegetable pakoras, vegetable korma and chicken tikka masala.  

I highly recommend this restaurant.  You won't be disappointed.   Very authentic indian food.
