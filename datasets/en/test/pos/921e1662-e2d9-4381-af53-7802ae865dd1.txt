All I can say is YUM!  This is my new favorite place.  Not only can you build your own salad, but the premade ones they prepare are excellent too!  The broccoli salad is a must try, and the won ton chicken happiness salad.  I've already been 3 times since I first went a week and a half ago and still haven't made it to the soups, but the selection is great and they all look amazing!  I will try next time and report back.  Also, the lemonade mixed with the strawberry lemonade is soooo good!  I could go on forever... eat at Sweet Tomatoes!!!
