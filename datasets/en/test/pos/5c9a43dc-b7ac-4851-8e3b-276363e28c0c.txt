I've eaten majority of their menu and haven't found anything that I haven't liked.  It's a great place for any meal.  My boyfriend is more a breakfast person and I'm more of a lunch person so this place is perfect for us.  I love their avocado pizza - we did it with proscuitto once and it was fantastic.  The spicy tuna roll makes a great appetizer.  The white sangria is probably one of the best I've had in Phoenix.  For dessert, the red velvet cupcake is unbelievable - the frosting is the best part.  The parking kinda stinks but you can always park across the street at arcadia room and walk to LGO.  Can't say how much I love this place!
