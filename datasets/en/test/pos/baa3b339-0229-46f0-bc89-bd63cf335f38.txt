This is a great Japanese restaurant. The appetizers that we had were gyoza, tuna tempura roll, and the calamari. They were all very good and tasted fresh. My wife had the chicken katsu which was well prepared. It was not heavily breaded like many I have tasted before, and the sauce to go with it was good. I had some yellowtail and salmon sashimi. It all tasted very fresh! It all just melted in my mouth. The head sushi chef/owner also had us try some special wasabi that he made. That tasted really well with everything. We also tried the miso soup, which was one of the better ones I have had. I am half Japanese and have had tried many Japanese restaurants and this one is one of the best in the Phoenix area. To top it all off the owner is very friendly.
