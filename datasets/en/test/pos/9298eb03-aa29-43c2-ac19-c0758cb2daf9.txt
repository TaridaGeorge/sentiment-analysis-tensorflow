The only complaint I have about this place is that I wish there was another location closer to my home. My Key is set up inside the Chocolate Star Bakery (which is also phenomenal!) The coffee is delicious to say the very least, full bodied and rich full of flavor...the owner roasts, grinds, and pours the coffee all himself. The place is completely about the ambiance and experience..from the gingham table cloths to the porcelain cow creamer...everything about this place oozes quality. A great cup of coffee, in a cozy little place, with friendly conversation...it was the perfect escape in my busy day. I will definitely be going back to this place! I hope they stick around.
