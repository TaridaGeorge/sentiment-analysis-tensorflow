This is a really great place to sit down and work.  The people who work there are always friendly.  There's a central table to plug your laptop into, like a central command for some movie about central commanding things, then everywhere else has couches and tables.  There's also gelato, and a variety of different sodas.  Only thing I find wrong with it is I keep wanting to say "Coffee Unlimited" instead of "Unlimited Coffee."  I feel it's more "coffee + unlimited horizons" instead of "drink coffee forever."
