My husband I have been "dentist shopping" since we moved to Chandler and have been very unhappy!  I found Dr. Dominick on Yelp and we tried him out. We are very pleased to say that we have finally found a dentist that we trust and like. His office staff is great and very welcoming. Dr. Dominick explained everything he was doing and even did the cleaning himself!  We will definitely be referring people to him!
