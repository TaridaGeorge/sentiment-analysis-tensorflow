Tommy V's is a delightful twist on old town dining where fine wines come with a surprisingly  refreshing price and food pairings  are always fresh and so delicious.  The atmosphere matches the name - just oh, so chic! and the staff is always very gracious!  We will return many times this summer with the new special app & entree deal too! 

When I set out to go to happy hour last week, I didn't expect Prince Edward Island Mussels and a most fantastic wine that our waiter recommended!

Tommy V's has the recipe for success in good cuisine, wine, and ambiance!
