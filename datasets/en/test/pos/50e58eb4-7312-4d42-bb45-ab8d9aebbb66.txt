If I eat food from different cultures, I always prefer that the ones preparing my food, serving me food, and patron eating the food are all from that culture. It tells me, "THIS PLACE IS AUTHENTIC." And that is what Korean BBQ is. The servers barely know English and I LOOOOVE that. The patrons near me....same thing! There are karoake rooms, etc. This place is awesome. I have yet to find any other korean bbq place that lets you cook your OWN meal on your OWN table on your OWN, just like Los Angeles. 

I take dates and family here all the time!!
