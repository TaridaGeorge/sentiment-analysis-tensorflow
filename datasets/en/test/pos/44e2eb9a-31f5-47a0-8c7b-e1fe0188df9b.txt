For the full effect see my review on Palo Verde Animal Hospital in Phoenix.

I took my dog to Dr. Grant after a very bad experience the day prior. Let me tell you guys: Jesus himself couldn't sing higher praise for Dr. Grant and his team at Glenfair. That man and his assistants have a way with animals that is unprecedented in this city. And the best part is their incredibly reasonable prices. 

My verdict? This is the only place that I will be taking my animals to. They really are that good. When you factor in the incredibly reasonable prices, you have the recipe for one of the best kept secrets in Phoenix!
