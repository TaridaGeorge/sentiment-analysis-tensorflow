I have been coming to Ted's for nearly 20 years. Very little has changed. They make properly char-broiled hot dogs and burgers, which is awesome in-and-of itself. Their onion rings are one-of-a-kind awesome. The service has always been friendly and super speedy. To top it off, they have always been an active supporter and heavily involved with the local community. What more could you possibly want?

I really wish Ted's was in SF. I miss this place. They're the best!
