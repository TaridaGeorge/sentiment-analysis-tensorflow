We went to Sekong by Night last night. It was some goodness! We had divine spring rolls, soup that reminds me of Pho (one of my ultimate favorite soups), beef and noodles, and Shrimp with a black pepper sauce.  My general descriptions are not doing this place justice. 
It is a tad difficult to find...so look between the Aurthur Murry Dance Studio and the 99 cent store. The atmosphere was very relaxing, service was outstanding, and price for portions were great! I was skeptical to try...but my Yelp friends have yet to steer me wrong. I ended up with a satisfying and tasty dinner :)
Lets fill this place up with patrons! It is Sekong super yummy!
