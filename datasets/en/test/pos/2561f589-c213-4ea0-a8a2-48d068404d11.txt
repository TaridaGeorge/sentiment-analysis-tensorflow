My partner and I needed two new tires and an alignment. We have a Chevy Cobalt and its only two years old. Went to the dealership and they wanted almost $700 out the door! We came to S&S and they gave all that for less than half the price. They were kind, courteous, and did not treat us badly for being gay. It was a great experience.
