Some girlfriends and I were in old town one night and we took one of the "gypsy" cabs home by mistake and got charged up the back end by a man that could not speak English and took us around in loops. The next week we called Chris with AZ ELite. I will never take another car service home! Chris was polite, punctual, knew the city well, and he is safe! If you ever need a car service this is the one to take... thank you so much Chris!!
