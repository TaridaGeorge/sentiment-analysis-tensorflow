SUper nice resort! The lazy river and ample lounge chairs were awesome!! The hotel is beautiful and the suites are very large. Each suite had its own balcony with 2 sets of chairs and table.  AND THEY HAVE THE MOST COMFORTABLE BEDS. EVER.
if you figure out how to navigate the hotel, DO NOT TRY TO TAKE A SHORTCUT!!! You'll never find your way back to your room.  I promise you. It's huge.
