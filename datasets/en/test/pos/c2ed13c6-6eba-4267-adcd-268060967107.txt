Every time I am here, I enjoy the rosa and the caprese.  Their homemade mozzarella is so delicious.   Just be ready to wait, which isn't bad because you can enjoy a glass of wine and a lil cheese/meat/olive bites in their waiting area... or bring a game while you wait.  Who gives an F how long the wait is when the food is this yummy fresh.
