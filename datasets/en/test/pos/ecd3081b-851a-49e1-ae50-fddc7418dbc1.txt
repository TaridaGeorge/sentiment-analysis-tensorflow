what a great performance!! The seats were amazing!! orchestra seats wohoo!! Thanks so much to Lindsey for the three tickets!! I felt like we had VIP tickets since we got a pre-interview before the show. The show was amazing!! The Nutcracker is my favorite ballet ever, since its a story about dolls from around the world. It reminds me of riding the its a small world in Disneyland :) I loved the live music the costume and the glitter. My favorite seen was the fairies dancing and snowflakes falling so pretty :)  This was my first time watching the Nutcracker since as a kid I always played a background ballerina like a flower or a background fairy  from my ballets school production. So much fun, thanks for inviting me and setting this Lindsey! Such a good way to get into the holiday spirit.
