I went to turn on the computer yesterday and nothing.  I hate it when this happens!  However, I didn't fret too much because I knew Computer Guys would take care of it swiftly and at a great price.  Once again, I was in and out in just a few minutes.  My computer is back up and running and all is right with the world again.  The friendly banter between technicians made the time pass even quicker--it was a repair PLUS a free show!  

(To mitigate today's exchange:  After a period of time has passed, many things come back into style...such as hardwood floors, vinyl records, AND the mustache!)
