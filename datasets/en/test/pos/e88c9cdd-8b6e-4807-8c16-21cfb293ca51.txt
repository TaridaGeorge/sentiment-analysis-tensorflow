Long story short, the quote to do the maintenance and a few repairs on my RX at Bell Lexus was $800 less than at Scottsdale Lexus and they could guarantee me an RX loaner (I needed the rear air and room for the stroller). Now I'm frugal so I would have driven all the way up there from Ahwatukee to save $100 but $800! That's crazy! Not only that, but they found things that Scottsdale Lexus didn't find and they were real, honest-to-god problems because my car quit making the exhaust leak sound after they fixed it (when it never had an exhaust leak). I'll definitely keep driving up there. It's farther away but it's by far worth it for the quality of service and the savings.
