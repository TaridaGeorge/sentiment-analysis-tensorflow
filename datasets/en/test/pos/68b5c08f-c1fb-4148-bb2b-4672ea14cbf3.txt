I heard good things about the Main Ingredient and decided to check it out for a Friday happy hour.  Drinks were half off until 6, which was nice.  I was not sure what to expect, since I don't always have the best of luck when I go to places that are newly opened.  This place went beyond my expectations, especially with the food.  We started with the antipasto plate, which was great.  We decided to stick around for dinner.  The sandwiches were amazing, especially the roast beef.  I would definitely go back.
