I stumbled upon this treasure using my AroundMe app one night when my boyfriend and I were looking for delivery Chinese.  My family and I have been frequenting Shangri-La in the Metrocenter area for over 20 years and this may have topped it! Queen's Bowl checked all our boxes: option for delivery, authentic taste, soup available, and at a most valuable price.  We will make this a regular spot.  An absolute must!
