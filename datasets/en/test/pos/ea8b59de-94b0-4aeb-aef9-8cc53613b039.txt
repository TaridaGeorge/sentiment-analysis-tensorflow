I've been going here very regularly for six years. They make the best Tom Kha Gai soup in town. I get it pretty much every time. They used to put slivers of lime leaves in the sweet, rich panang curry which made it really good. Often now they leave them out- I think maybe the chef changed. I also enjoy the mussaman stew. Another recommendation would be the yahm pla meug (squid salad). I can't comment on the noodle dishes as I'm not really into those and haven't tried any. The thai iced tea is good. Prices are quite reasonable.
