I had never been here before but decided to try going for Happy Hour.

From the moment we arrived we had great service from Darlene and crew.  They offered ideas of wines to try, were prompt with service, the Warmed Brie, Panini Sandwiches and other appetizers were very good.
 
While we had eight people buying wine, beer and assorted food they had no problem taking care of us and offered to split the bill up after the fact...something many places won't do if you ask and never offer to do!

We will be back!
