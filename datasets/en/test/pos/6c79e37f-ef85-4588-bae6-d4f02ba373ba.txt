The creme de la creme of antique stores. The Brass Armadillo and Chandler's Merchant Square may be larger but it seems to lack the character of this store. I love to browse through this place for a couple of hours. It's unfortunate that its far out of my way for it to be convienent but I'm glad that it has stuck around for all these years. My favorite section is the crates filled with vintage advertisements. I'll be one sad man if this store ever closes down like the one at Scottsdale and Curry. Don't remember the name of that place but if somebody wants to help me out with that I'd appreciate it. Hooray to the Trove!!
