It's so hard to find hikes near Phoenix that aren't packed with people. We went on one of the shorter loops and it was wonderful-- we only bumped into two groups the whole time we were gone (about 3 hours). The hikes provide a wonderful view of the city, but they also take you into more wilderness areas where you can really get into nature. The trails are nicely maintained and are clean. Two hearty chihuahuas and two people had a great time and will be going back!
