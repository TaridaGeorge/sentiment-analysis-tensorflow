We usually go for breakfast, but wow, dinner is outstanding! (And today we went to Liberty Market for both... LOL) It can be pricey & you will spend a pretty penny on any of the specials they have, but we do it every time because it is so worth it!!! When Chef Dave puts a special on the menu, you can be certain that it will be full of flavor & amazing! I have to say, he has perfected the soup du jour-it has been delicious no matter which one we try. Highly recommend dining here =)
