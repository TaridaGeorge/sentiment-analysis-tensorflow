everytime i go here i crack up laughing and meet the funniest people at the bar...they serve Heffveisen on tap-fabulous and the bartenders and waitresses are super nice. I am pissed OFF however that they no longer can have dogs there. TOTAL BUMMER! Oh and the veggie burgers rock! and so do the yummy french fries-steak fries. its a good place- go visit and the view is nice, right on the lake and all lit up.
