Without hesitation 5stars!!!!!! 
I had a wonderful experience at the Roaring Fork last Saturday evening and I cannot wait to return! Amazing food, and amazing service makes for a spectacular evening out...wouldn't you agree? :) 

The Roaring Fork sponsored the 2008 Arizona yoga asana championships which took place in Tempe last weekend. Following the competition, competitors, teachers, and volunteers were all invited to enjoy dinner courtesy of Roaring Fork! From the moment I walked in the restaurant all of my senses were stimulated-from the delicious smells to the wonderful decor to the terrific music playing, it was perfect! We enjoyed amazing appetizers and a wonderful plank salmon. Our sides included macaroni and asparagus that was to die for. Although I don't usually indulge in dessert, I figured I could reward myself for participating in the competition and enjoy the chocolate lava cake which I am still dreaming about!
