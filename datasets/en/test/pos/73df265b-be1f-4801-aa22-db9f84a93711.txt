I was stunned by the quality of the veal chop with apple glaze.  Tender, flavorful, cooked perfectly and beautifully presented with wild rice and arranged asparagus.  House wines by the glass were a good accompaniment.  The Tiramisu was one of the best I've had.  Service was attentive, and sitting outside on the patio on a warm fall evening made for nice ambiance.  Two of us with wine and one dessert was $75, so a good value as well.  My best meal on this trip--wish we had a Italian restaurant like this close to home.
