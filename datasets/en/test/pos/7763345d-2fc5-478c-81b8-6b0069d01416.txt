Wow! This place is awesome. The Mexican hot dog is to die for. They make their own salsa and it tasted like they make their own bread too. The fries were fresh. And my husband and I both ate lunch for less than 8 bucks. I ate here on a Sunday and walked in at 1030. I didn't notice that they don't normally open until 11 but the guy was super cool and warned me it would take an extra few minutes, but had no problem serving me. It was well worth the wait!
