I've often heard of Jason's Deli but never really had the hankering to try until my friend France R. was actually in that side of town and was looking for some healthy food for our dinner. I don't think there could have been a better choice in the area. Just options for every type of taste bud! What surprised me the most was the variety of foods that  they offered. I came in thinking "typical sandwich place...OMG tomato soup!?" It's definitely a place that I can keep revisiting and not get bored of because they have so much to offer.
