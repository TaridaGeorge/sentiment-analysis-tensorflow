I like burgers... a lot, and I eat them wherever I go!

I tried the Chuck Box because of YELP reviews, and I can't express enough appreciation for those YELPers who turned me on to this place.  FANTASTIC burger and rings.   I had the Tijuana Torpedo -- a most tasty concoction of wood-grilled meat, spicy cheese, and green chile pepper.  I've had many similar burgers but none quite so tasty.  I wish I had more frequent opportunity to be in Tempe.
