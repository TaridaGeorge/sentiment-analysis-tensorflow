Alright, know these things before going: 

- You're going to wait a long time. Plan on enjoying a beer or bottle of wine at Bar Bianco with a cheese plate and enjoy the Phoenix weather outside for the 1.5-4 hours that you'll be waiting. 

- This is not NY or Chicago pizza. It is REAL pizza. I've been to Italy multiple times and honestly, I haven't had a better pizza than Biancos. I love this place. 

I highly suggest the Wiseguy with fennel sausage and the Biancoverde with Prosciutto. Also, get the tomato's and mozzarella to start and order a bottle of the "Green and Red". You'll be set. 

Living in NYC, I will take any trip or stop over in Phoenix that I can just for this place. I cannot get enough!
