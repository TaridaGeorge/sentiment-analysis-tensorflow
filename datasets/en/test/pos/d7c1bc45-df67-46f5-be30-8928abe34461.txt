Scratch catered a baby shower for 50 people about 8 months ago.  I have another shower I need catered and I immediately thought of Scratch.  The food was OUTSTANDING!!!  The guests, which included a previous Governor of AZ, (I make this point because she most likely has culinary experiences due to the job), was impressed as well.  Every bit of the food went with exception to the salads, and that was only because I ordered too many.  I HIGHLY recommend SCRATCH. I can't imagine one could be disappointed.
