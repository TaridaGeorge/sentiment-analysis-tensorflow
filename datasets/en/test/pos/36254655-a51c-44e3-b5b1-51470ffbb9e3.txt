So Good!

The restaurant does not look like much when you first walk in but the food definitely makes up for it! We had the hard apple cider pot roast and the seared scallop picatta.  Both got rave reviews although we could have skipped dinner altogether and filled up on the bread and oil served before the meal.

The waitstaff was friendly and attentive but not overbearing. The atmosphere was warm and inviting and unlike grumpy Mike S below, I love the fact that they allow pets on 1/2 pf the patio.
