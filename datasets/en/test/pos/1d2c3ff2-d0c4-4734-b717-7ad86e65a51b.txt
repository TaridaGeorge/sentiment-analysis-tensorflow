Wow!  This place also knocked my socks off....I had the Green Flannel Hash - Extremly Delicious, and a side Jalapeno Pecan pancake as my fellow yelpers recommended...both were incredible (although I am not a big pancake/sweet fan so only had a few bites of the pancake before I grew tired of it).

I went both times on a weekday, so not too busy but still took a good 1/2 hour to get the food...Well Worth the Wait.
