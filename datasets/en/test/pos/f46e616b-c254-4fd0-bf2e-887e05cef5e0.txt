Oregano's rocks! This location is the best by far. Cool atmosphere and awesome staff! I've never had anything from their menu that I haven't liked and every time I go the staff recommends something new for me that is always right on. Had the shrimp diablo pasta last time out, it was great, but very spicy! 

I usually get a sub, meatball or sausage. All the pizza is fantastic, and their wings are probably the best in PHX (being from Buffalo myself I should know!) 

What can I say Oregano's, I love you!
