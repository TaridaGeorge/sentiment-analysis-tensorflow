Went in to get some ramekins, while holding a toddler in my arms, possibly not the best scenario, but it had to be done. The staff quickly asked if I needed any assitance. They happily found the size and amount I needed. They even asked what I would be making with them, gave me tips and suggestions, etc. Overall wonderful experience. Next time I will bring a stroller to look at all the awesome gadgets.
