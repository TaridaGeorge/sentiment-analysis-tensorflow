Lunch buffet is so good!  And the staff really couldn't be nicer.
My husband and I have been twice, once for take-out and once for lunch.  The friendly man at the counter took the time to explain the difference between northern and southern indian cuisine to us, which was very helpful.  Everything we have had has tasted great, but I especially love their samosas, which are also included in the lunch buffet.  We are happy to make this our new indian food spot!
