I love Qcumberz so much that I visit once a week. I have found enough treasures to fill my house and I don't want to stop there. I'm in danger of becoming a hoarder because every time I go to Qcumberz I see something else I have to have. The owner Ron and his son Dylan are so friendly and personable, I'm always greeted with a warm hello and a cold bottle of water. I recommend Qcumbers for anything from a new dresser to an old window frame. I am a qcumber for life.
