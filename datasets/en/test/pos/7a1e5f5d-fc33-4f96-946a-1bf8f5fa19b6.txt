I would not have changed a single thing about our wedding flowers.  Amanda was very patient as I changed my mind a few times in the initial planning about what I wanted.  She offered suggestions based on our budget, checked out my pinterest to see exactly what I liked, and sent me a few quotes so I had an idea of what prices I was looking at based on what I liked.  I finally figured out what worked based on what I wanted and a price compromise.  Our flowers were absolutely stunning and were even more beautiful than I could have imagined.  I had so many compliments on the bouquets, centerpieces, and even the simple ceremony decor.  The price was extremely reasonable, especially for the thorough communication and excellent service provided by Amanda.
