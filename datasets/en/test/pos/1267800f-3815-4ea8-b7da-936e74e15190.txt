Now here is a way to earn an extra star for excellent customer service in my book! Recently, I was in the mood for a beach vacation and unfortunately, Hawaii was a little too far away so I opted for Tommy Bahamas instead. Second best right? When I sat down, I ordered a nice Bahama Mama Hurricane and jokingly asked for a side of beach to go with it as she was walking away. Moments later, she returned with my drink and a side of beach! Literally...she brought a plate with sand, two shells and an umbrella! Tommy Bahama should give this waitress a raise for having such good customer service skills that she goes out of her way to think of something like creating a makeshift beach for a customer!
