This is a great repair shop. It is very difficult to find an honest mechanic, so I was very happy to find 25th Street Automotive. I originally went there for a second opinion when the dealership had recommended some very expensive repairs. It turns out those repairs were unnecessary, and the car has run just fine since then. I now take my car to 25 Street Automotive for all routine maintenance.
