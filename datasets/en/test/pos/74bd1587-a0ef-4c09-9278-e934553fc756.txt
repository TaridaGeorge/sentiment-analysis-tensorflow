Everything that we ate here was delicious. I started off with the the pork belly pastrami and it was delicious. For the main meal i got was the lamb burger and it was insanely good. Never had a burger like that. It was gamey but tender. For dessert i got the bread pudding. I licked the plate clean. Everything at the restaurant is great. I would recommend this place to all.
