I'm a fan! Self-serve frozen yogurt, rotating selection of flavors, and friendly workers--nice! All their flavors are great, but I keep going back to the vanilla (?) tart with blackberry toppings (lately they've had raspberries, but I hope they bring back the blackberries). The staff is friendly and they keep the place clean. I don't know how they put up with some customers who try to make a meal out of the sample cups and walk out--but I have to say the workers are always courteous and professional.  I wish I could find out where they buy those green chairs so I can get a pair!  This is definitely my favorite frozen yogurt spot!
