Was in AZ for a conference and a friend had a huge craving for Scandinavian food. It's located in a strip mall and looks like a cafeteria with a stuffed Beaver on the counter. There's games to play while you wait, which is nice. 

The food was reasonably priced and the Swedish meatballs tasted amazing. Even all their side dishes were delicious.

They have poutine!!! I finally understood why all my Canadians missed home. I gained 5 pounds that weekend. So worth it.
