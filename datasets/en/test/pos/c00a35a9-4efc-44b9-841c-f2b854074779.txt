One of favorite places on earth! The fish is very fresh the prices are reasonable which I suppose helps keep the fish fresh. Unfortunately many Sushi bars don't even meet those standards. Thankfuly there are a few places on town that do and Sakana is one of those. But what makes Salamander my favorite is the people. The chefs are friendly and engaging. The servers are a blast. And some of the nicest people hang out there including the likes of Kurt Warner and Larry Fitzgerald.

The sushi experience is more than just food it is also fun and Sakana is the complete package
