Best coffee in the Valley, let alone Tempe.

They roast their own beans on site (roasting days are heaven). At any given moment they'll have a dozen different beans available, and they'll offer you advice on which you might like based on your tastes. They'll tell you about the plantation each bean comes from (they buy limited batches directly from small producers). Then they grind YOUR beans in front of you and use a manual drip filter to brew your coffee while you watch. Cool artsy/hipster/gay/collegey menagerie of folks always there. And great music plus free Internet (though it took forever to get some kinks worked out last summer...).
