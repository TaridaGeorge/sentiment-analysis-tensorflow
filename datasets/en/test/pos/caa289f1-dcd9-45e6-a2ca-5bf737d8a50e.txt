I hear Chelsea's! 

The food is fantastic, healthy and unique. My fave entree is the brussel sprout salad. I know, sounds raunchy, but it's unbelievable. Trust me.

Plus - who doesn't enjoy getting free cookies as a parting gift? 

This is in a fun location right off the canal that always has a good energy. I've also had great servers both times I was there. I think this place does a great job of representing the non chain side of Phx.
