If you're eating Japanese food in America, it's not going to be authentic, just the same as if you were eating American food in Japan.

As for the food, I actually quite liked it.  I ordered the Arizona Bowl which included soft shell crab, avocado and sauce over white rice.  The crab is the real deal- instead of the cheap artificial option which was a nice surprise considering the price.  The proportion of crab to avocado to rice is perfect and the flavor and consistency is great.  

I was really happy with what I ordered and considering the convenience of this location, I'll definitely be back.
