If I ever stay at another hotel in Phoenix, it won't be by choice! This place is wonderful. The customer service was outstanding-- from valet to concierge to bar staff. And there's an amazing breakfast restaurant literally steps from the hotel so you don't have to eat just room service if you're feeling lazy. 

The hotel is clean, well organized and signed, amazing pool/cabanas and right in the middle of it all. And it's pet friendly (as I learned when I met the adorable "hotel dog" cocker spaniel, Bosco). 

To top it off it was less than $100 a night. Kudos to the management and staff on a well-run, friendly, comfortable and fun environment.
