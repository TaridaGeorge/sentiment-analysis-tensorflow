I LOVED The Parlor. 

I didn't love the very-full parking lot, but I guess when you have food this good, it's a given that parking may be an issue.

My friend and I both  had the carrot-ginger soup, which was excellent.
I had the small cesear salad and my friend had the tuna melt and like it alot. Both excellent!

I am going to try the pizza some day soon (I try to NOT eat pizza, because I love it, and will eat it way too often) and will update at that time. The pizza menu looks wonderful, by the way.

Our  waiter was very nice, the food was served quickly, and the prices were average for a nice place such as this.

All in all, The Parlor is a winner!
