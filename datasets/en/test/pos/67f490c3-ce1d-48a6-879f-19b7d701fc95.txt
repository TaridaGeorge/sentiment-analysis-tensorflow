I come here every year to meet my good friend for coffee as it's between our folk's houses. i have many fond memories of jamming a years worth of events into 90 min conversations over tasty coffee and chai.

everyone who works here is awesome and the drinks are good. i never see a crowd but i go at fairly off hours - i could see it getting crowded as they have it set up more like a living / dining room than a restaurant.

my favorite place to sit is at the giant light table. can't wait for the next time i am back in AZ so i get to go back!
