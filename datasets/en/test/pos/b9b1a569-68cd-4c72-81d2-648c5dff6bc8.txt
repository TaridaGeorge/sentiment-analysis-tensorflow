I used to do many century (100 mi.) rides but age and ailments have changed that.  I needed a bike that was more forgiving on my old bones.  I went to several of the big name shops and was either ignored or dismissed or shown only high end high dollar bikes.  When I walked into Try Me Bicycle Shop I was greeted like a friend they haven't seen for some time (I've never been there before).  This is an old school bike shop like I remember as a kid.  Nothing fancy, just a great selection of bikes and accessories and WORLD CLASS service.  I got a fair price for my trade-in and bought a great new Raleigh hybrid.  I'm glad I found this gem.
