Me & my daughter have been searching high & low all over the valley for a good pad Thai, so far this is her favorite spot & we've been to 6 or 7 Thai restaurants in our quest.  I LOVE their drunken noodles with chicken,... Best flavor ever,. I never finish all my food but I licked the plate clean!!!  

I've been there 3 or 4 times now, & the service is always very nice & accommodating.  The decor is very inviting & simple. Happy yummy food hunting!!
