I was excited for my first visit for dinner---I had heard so many great things about Latitude Eight! Guess what---everything I heard was true or even better!! Wonderful, authentic Thai food, very reasonably priced. Charming ambiance---very small venue which makes the owner's (David) presence very personal and authentic. David made our evening so special! Service was perfect; our server anticipated our every need and that was with a party of 12!! 

One more thing I have to say. They make a cantaloupe martini that is off the frigging hook. Seriously, I can't wait to go back there.

If you like Thai, make reservations and enjoy a fabulous evening out.

I love it when I get a find like this one!!
