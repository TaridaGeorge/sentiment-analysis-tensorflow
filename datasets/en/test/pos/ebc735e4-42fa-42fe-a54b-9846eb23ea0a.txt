Ah this one is definitely my favorite for lunch/dinner. They have awesome grilled meat over rice with tons of flavors. Don't even expect to come here to try the soup or anything (which are not their specials) and then complain.... Try to eat their spring bowl portion or rice plates!
Food usually come quick within 5minutes :) Quick and friendly services!!! How can I say, I just love it !!!!
