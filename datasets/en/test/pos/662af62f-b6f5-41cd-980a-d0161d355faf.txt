You have to visit this bakery.  The sisters that own it are super friendly and make delicious treats.  Everyone that I have sent in there agrees with me. They made a root beer float cupcake that was so amazing. They are truly a part of the local community featuring local artists on their walls.

Do yourself a favor and make the trip, you won't regret it.
