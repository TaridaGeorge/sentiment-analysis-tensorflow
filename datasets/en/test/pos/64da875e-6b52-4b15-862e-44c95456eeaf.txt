Rock n Roll Fingers is one of a kind. Honestly has the greatest chicken fingers I've ever tasted. Juicy, crunchy, and absolutely to die for. The waffle fries are really unique too with a special seasoning the owner dusts on all of them. The Texas toast is nothing short of great either. The owner is very friendly and usually hooks customers up with an extra finger or sauce if you bring friends. He's always really grateful for your business because it's a family owned business.

Not open on Sundays: so don't expect to go here for a hangover cure. 

Bring cash so you don't have to pay an extra 75 cents to use your credit/debit card.
