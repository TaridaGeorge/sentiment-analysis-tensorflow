My husband and I went here recently for dinner on a Saturday - we had heard from friends it was the best Greek on the east end of the valley.  We both ordered the Greek plate dinner with lamb/beef gyro meat - rice, salad and pita.  It was nothing short of superb - the meat unlike any other usual Greek fare - tender and real meat.  Everything was good and there were generous portions.  Our service was excellent and the atmosphere is good.  It is worth the hour drive from our house in Mesa.
