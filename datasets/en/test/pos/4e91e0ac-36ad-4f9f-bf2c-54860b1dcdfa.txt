This area of Gilbert is so quaint!  But even if I was in love with its surroundings, we always stop by when we're in the mood for delicious desserts, specifically the red velvet cheesecake, which is indescribable.  You just have to try it!  As for the regular food, I've tried a different entree each time, and I have never been disappointed.
