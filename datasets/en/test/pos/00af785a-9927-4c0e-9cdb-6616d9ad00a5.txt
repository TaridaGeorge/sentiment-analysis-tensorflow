Stopped in on a Saturday night at about ten pm and got a table right away. 

I got a blueberry hill drink that felt like it needed something more, or a little bit less of something. Still a large drink, and not too bad. 

We ordered the appetizer of rosemary brie.  The menu said serves 2 but definitely more like 4. Had left overs. 
 
For burgers we got the BLT and the Nogales burger med rare. The food came quick and the staff very friendly. 

BLT was AWESOME. Juicy and flavorful. Snagged one bite of the Nogales, and it was tasty too. 

Highly recommend and will definitely come back.
