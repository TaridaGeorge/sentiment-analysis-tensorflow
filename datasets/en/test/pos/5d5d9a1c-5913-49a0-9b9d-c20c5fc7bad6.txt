I know a lot of people have complaints, but I was here for a convention in January and it was a perfect place to stay.  I had a small room with an adorable bathroom, all of which had character.  The bar had great beer, the staff was friendly and my hot water was just fine, unless the room next door flushed.  :)
It's an old hotel, with character, so if you want sterility book somewhere else.  I loved it.  It was the only good thing about downtown Phoenix as far as I could tell.
