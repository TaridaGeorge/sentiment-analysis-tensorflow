Oh. St. Francis. You are the wind beneath my wings. You truly are king of the world. You complete me.  And yes, yes, indeed you had me at hello. Kitty. Sorry. Couldn't resist

Ate here last night with my folks and my visiting bro and his beau. Everything was absolutely outstanding. With a shout out to our server and I'm completely bummed I don't remember  her name. Though I'm happy to report my dad made a point to tell the manager how fabulous she was.

Flatbread. Roasted chicken. Roasted veggies with goat cheese. Pork chop. Ribeye. And the famous green chile pork stew.

I love you more than my luggage. Drink your juice Shelby. Hit her Weezer! Hit her. 

Go. To. St. Francis.
