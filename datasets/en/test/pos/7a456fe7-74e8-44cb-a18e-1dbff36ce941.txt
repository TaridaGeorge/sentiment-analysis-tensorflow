Since my visit to Paris over a year ago, I have been hesitant to have my way with a(n American) crepe. One afternoon with the food network changed my mind. A quick call to the husband and a colorful pep talk in the car, we decided to give Pastis a try. 

The first thing I noticed was the owner! Everything my fellow yelpers have said (and moaned) was true! Quite the stallion! 

Service was awesome. Friendly. Not overbearing. 

Cocktails were fruity and fun. The food was yummy but completely wiped from memory once the nutella and banana crepe (under $6) hit the table. Poor hubs barely got a nibble. 

We're heading down for happy hour this week! Seems like a deal!
