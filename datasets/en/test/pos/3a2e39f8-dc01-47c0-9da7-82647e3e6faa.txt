Stacy, many congrats on your well-deserved designation of one of the top 10 new BBQ joints in Bon Appetit. 

Today's lunch was, as always, delectable. Your pulled pork makes me smile and my tummy sing. 

People.....get thee to Stacy's if you have not been yet. Come hungry. Try the ribs your first time out. You will be in awe. Greens, candied yams, red beans and rice....the list goes on. It's alllllll good!
