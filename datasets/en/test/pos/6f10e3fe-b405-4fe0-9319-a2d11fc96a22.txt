Thanks fellow Yelpers!

I was in AZ for the weekend visiting a girlfriend and we decided on sushi. I hit the Yelp site and based on the previous reviews gave Honmachi Grill a shot. It was excellent and I highly recommend it. My only complaint was that my Salmon Sashimi was sliced a little thicker than I normally like it but it was fresh and tasty. We also had the Smoked salmon roll, spicy scallop hand rolls, and the dynamite roll. The service was excellent and the prices were great. Each roll was less than $10. I plan to relocate to AZ by summers end and this will be my weekend sushi spot until I find something better.
