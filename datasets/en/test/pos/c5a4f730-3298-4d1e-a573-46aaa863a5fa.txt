I haven't visited Bertha in a while, but she still has quite a hold on me.  I am kind of a creature of habit, and so I usually get the same sandwich, but they have a great selection of house baked goods, sandwiches, soups and salads.  The lemonade is fresh and delicious and the staff is super nice.  It's kind of tucked back in the corner of the little strip mall it's in, so you have to keep your eyes open.  They have indoor and outdoor seating, which is great when the weather is permits.  They always have good jams playing, too.
