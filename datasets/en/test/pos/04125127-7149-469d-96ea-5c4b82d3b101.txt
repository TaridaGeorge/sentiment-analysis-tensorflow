They could have come up with a better name, but I am not gonna fault them for that. We were in Scottsdale for a get-away week and I had brought my most recent Sunset Magazine with me to read and lo n behold, they had a little blurb on this joint. 

We got there about 10 minutes before their 2200 quittin' time. I had the Basil Lime sorbet as well as the fig and bleu cheese ice cream pairing. Wow! These women are brilliant- great job of executing their concept. Now, if they could/would only distribute to San Diego! MMMMMM, Cowboy Ciao for dinner and this place for dessert and Cash Inn Country for a little nightlife. Perfect combination.
