I have now been here for a work dinner, and on a date with my wife.  This place is an amazing secret.  Excellent food, great atmosphere, perfect service.  If you go during the spring or fall, you can sit on the patio without it being too hot.  Being so close to the mountain and surrounded by trees, it really is an amazing place.  And with great food to go with it, it can't be beat.
