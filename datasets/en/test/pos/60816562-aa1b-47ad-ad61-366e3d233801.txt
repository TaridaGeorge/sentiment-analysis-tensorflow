I took my 18 month old son to MIM a few weeks ago, and so didn't get to see everything due to the fact that I was operating within the confines of his attention span.  We got to see the African exhibit, as well as part of the Middle East and Asia, as well as the experience room where you can test out different instruments.  It was so much fun!  Will have to go back and see everything.
