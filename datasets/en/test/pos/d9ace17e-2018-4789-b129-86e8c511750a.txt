We were looking for something new and different in Phoenix. We decided to let Yelp help us and we stumbled upon St Francis. We read the reviews and decided to give it a try. WOW!!! The reviews did not do it justice! The service was outstanding, the food was one of the best we had in a long time. The chicken with garlic sauce was beyond anything we ever tried. The BEST!!! Highly recommend... Try something new!
