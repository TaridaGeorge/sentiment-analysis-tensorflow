This place is legen, hope you're not lactose intolerant, DARY!!!!! Random place, in a random area, with random music, and random beer. Basically I couldn't ask for anything more, besides free beer. I can't wait to come back to this place. It's just a house converted into a bar/coffehouse/beer heaven. There was awesome music from Michelle Blades on the yuke. Atmosphere was fantastic. Great place to meet people. Drank and smoked with some random swing/jazz band. Beer selection of the gods! Makes Phoenix more super hipster than it already is and that's a good thing. I give this place 5 noms! NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM!
