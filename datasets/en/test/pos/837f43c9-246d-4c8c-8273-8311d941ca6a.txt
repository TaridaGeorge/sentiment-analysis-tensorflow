I had a really great lunch today at St. Francis.  The food was excellent, the ambiance was beautiful, and the service was very good.

I had the lunch soup/salad/half sandwich for $12.  My girlfriends each had a spinach salad and a pizzeta (sp?).  I think our total tab was around $50 for 3 of us and my son.  I'm pretty sure I inhaled my lunch in 5 minutes, maybe less.  SO GOOD. Can't wait to go back for dinner.

The space is beautiful.  So much light and so well-designed.  Kudos to Aaron for transforming an office building so beautifully.  Not a detail was missed.

I was really pleased to have a great experience at St. Francis.  After reading the mixed reviews, I wasn't sure what to expect.  Will definitely be back--I just wish it wasn't an hour away from me....
