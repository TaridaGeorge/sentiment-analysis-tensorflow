Love this library! Did you know that you don't even have to be a Scottsdale resident, just a Maricopa County resident to get a library card here? They have an excellent selection of books, magazines, movies, and DVD's. There's a large children's and young adult section as well and numerous computers for those who want to get online. Plus, you can have books or other items delivered here from any of the Scottsdale libraries and they will e-mail you when your items arrive.

There's even a new coffee shop in the lobby and all of the employees are extremely friendly.

Definitely high on my list of recommendations.
