I have been going to this salon for all of my nail needs for about 8 months now and I have to say they have never done me wrong. When I pay the extra $5 for the callus removal it is well worth it, the heels are always smooth and callus free. They are always pleasant and don't talk to each other in another language. The salon is extremely clean and they never fail to ask me if I want a bottle of water. Good job ladies. You keep me coming back!
