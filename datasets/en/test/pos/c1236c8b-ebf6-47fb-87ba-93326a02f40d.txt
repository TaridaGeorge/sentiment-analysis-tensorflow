There are 2 options for bathing your own dog, one involving you scrubbing, the other costs a few $ extra to have the soap and water pre mix and spray. It's much faster, works great, and is well worth it. The groomer who trims nails has a great natural way with dogs. For the most expensive do it yourself package + nail trimming, it was about $25. The baked doggie goods smelled so good, I wanted to eat some. The staff were friendly and helpful, I'll be back.
