Hmm, I usually come here late now...like between 2 and 4am. Maybe one less than average food experience out of the last 10....and even that one wasn't bad. The rolled tacos here are really good and my favorite out of all Mexican food shacks in Phoenix. I think too many undercook their food but Polibertos gets it just right.
