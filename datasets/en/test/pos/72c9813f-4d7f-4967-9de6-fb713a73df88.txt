To date I have found 2 great yogurt shops. This first is Cherry On Top in So. Cal. and the other is MoJo's at Phoenix North. Now I have found the 3rd and possibly the best. Yogurtime not only has a big variety of flavors that taste great but a staff that is quick to help with the tough decisions and taste testing. I have been in several times since my first encounter and met Jesse the manager who has made a positive impression each time. His friendly enthusiasm when he introduced himself made my whole family feel welcome. 

This is a great spot to stop by for a date or after catching a movie at the Harkins across the street. Two big thumbs up for me.
