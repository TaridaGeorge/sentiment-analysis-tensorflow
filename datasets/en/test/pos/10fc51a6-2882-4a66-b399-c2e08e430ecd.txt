First time getting a massage! (Its not as scary as it sounds)

Did the one hour session. Really great head, back, neck, and foot massage. I never thought I'd be paying for a massage, but the prices are reasonable and well worth the expenditure. Liz is great.

And yes, this location is in North Scottsdale, so some clients in the waiting room will definitely be, "Scottsdale People" ...You all know what I mean.
