First, let me begin by saying I am not a candy fan.  Chips?  Popcorn?  Nachos?  A hot dog?  Triple-yes.  Candy?  I can walk by the dish 100 times and not feel a twinge.

HOWEVER, this place is INCREDIBLE.  My husband and I purchased almost twice the candy we would typically purchase for him at HALF the price of a "mall store."  

They have all your childhood favorites, they have amazing prices...  

And, my favorite part, it is all family-owned and operated.  They have the BEST service, and they are EXTREMELY knowledgeable about their products.  They know each aisle, the history of each candy... 

Impressed is an understatement.  Check it out!
