I'm giving this Urban a perfect rating, for it never fails that when I walk through its doors, I always find something I want (or could) buy - even if it's a gift for somebody else, like my younger sister or best bud in Detroit. I even found one of my favorite sweaters here on clearance for $20. I think this Urban has a better selection for women than the one in Tempe, so if I had my choice, I'd come here to browse and buy. 

Plus, it's within walking distance of Scottsdale Fashion Park, Borders and Olive & Ivy (the perfect spot for brunch/lunch).
