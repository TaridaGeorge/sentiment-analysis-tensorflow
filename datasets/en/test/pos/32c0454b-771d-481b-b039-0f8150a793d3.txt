Went for lunch and got right in!  The service was amazing and very friendly.  I had the ceasar salad (which was THE BEST ceasar salad I have ever had in my life)  Also ordered the chicken parmesan (lunch portion - not the normal HUGE one) and it was still almost more then I could eat.

We sat there for about 2 hours talking (was kind of a business meeting) and they kept refilling us, and it was pleasant.  I love this location (besides the construction going on around downtown Scottsdale!
