I know I reviewed this place less than a month ago, but I go here everyday! 

I always get the Caramel Ice Blended! It's the best drink I have ever tasted in my life. It has me totally addicted. 

I love this place and always go through the drive-thru, being that my doggie, Olive is always with me. It's great! Not only do they have dog treats for Olive every time I come, but they also give her a little side cup of whipped cream. She loves it and has learned to expect it everyday. Sometimes they even put caramel on top like one of the blended coffee drinks I get. They even know Olive's name and they are pretty much the only people she doesn't bark at because she knows she's getting her daily treat! 

The coffee is great and the staff is super friendly!
