I read the reviews here at yelp & agree with most of you... this is one of the best south indian restaurants outside India. The buffet is great, not greasy like a lot of other indian restaurants, typical taste of south india. I saw some reviews about the place being unhygeinic. It is as clean as it gets. It's possible it was not so clean earlier? 

The service was pretty decent, considering there was only one person serving! They could hire couple of waiters to make the service better. 

My family really enjoyed it. My son was apprehensive with it being completely vegetarian, but even he ate heartily. It was a nice mother's day buffet.
