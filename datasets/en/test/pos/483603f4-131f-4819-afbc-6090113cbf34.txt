Whats that?  A creme brule food truck?!  ReallY!  Once I spotted this truck at the phoenix market I grabbed my already over stuffed fiance by the arm and dragged him to the window.  The list of flavors was entising, but sadly we arrived late and the jolly proprieter was already out of a few flavors (salted carmel (!) oh, I will be back).  The two of us ordered a bannana creme brule to split and joked with the chef about his idustrial blow trouch as he prepared our treat.  It was amaizing, and I am generally not a huge bannana fan, but this was really great.  And whats this I read about a lavender creme brule?  I can't wait to see the flavors this man comes up with in the future, so I can try them all!
