I judge new people in the Valley this way: "Hey, do you listen to NPR?"  If the response is, "Nah, dude, I've never heard of that." The conversation ends there.  I have neither the time nor the inclination to exchange trite banalities with the vapid scottsdale echelon.  I really can't do NPR enough justice in this brief space, so I'll just say that KJZZ does the valley a tremendous service with its broadcasting, which can be heard nearly up to Prescott.
