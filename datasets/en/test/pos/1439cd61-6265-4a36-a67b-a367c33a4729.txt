I haven't been here through their "rush" hours, so service has always been fast and friendly.  

Capastrami - Hot pastrami, Cole slaw, swiss cheese, and Russian dressing WITH sweet peppers. I can't get past ordering anything else when I come here.  Quality through and through.

One of these days I'll try their famous "Bobbie" (tryptophan coma here I come)... or maybe I'll just have to go Gal vs. Food and order the Capastrami AND the Bobbie (tryptophan coma and the -itis)
