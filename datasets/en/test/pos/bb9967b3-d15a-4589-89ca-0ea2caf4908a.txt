My alma mater...my home course.  Karsten golf course at ASU is classic Pete Dye.  Large swails, pot bunkers, #16 par 3 that flirts water.  I put a 4 iron from 220 2" from teh cup...big woop...I did it in a dust storm!!!! -- ask StoizzoF about that one.  The best thing about this course is that students get to play for cheap.  The clubhouse was designed by local architect Eddie Jones and compliments the golf course perfectly.  Dye did a great job in hiding the not so fantastic sights aroudn teh golf course but over the years I got used to the power plant, power lines, and ghetto east side along McClintock.  If your on vacation you need to play the course in whcih Phil Mick perfected his game and if you're a student you need to play this course.  Devils, Devils, Devils!!!
