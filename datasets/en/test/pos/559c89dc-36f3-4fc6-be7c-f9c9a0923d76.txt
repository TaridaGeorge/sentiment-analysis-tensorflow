Hands down, one of my faves! I rarely get out of my side of town. Perhaps I learned a good lesson. Sometimes you have to drive farther than your backyard for some great grub! Hula's happens to be in the heart of the city and worth the drive. 
We took our dog Darwin with us on this beautiful Sunday. Had an amazing brunch and mimosas. Service was excellent and the food was absolutely delicious. Hula's is a dog friendly environment and Darwin had an enjoyable time in the patio. Great deals during brunch with $2 mimosas and $5 bloody mary's. MMmmmmmm
