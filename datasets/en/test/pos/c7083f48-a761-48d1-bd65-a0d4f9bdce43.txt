I recently had a massage and facial at Glow. I live in North Scottsdale and I will definitely make that drive again and again. Although I've had hundreds of massages, the massage I received from Sasha was one of the best I've ever had. My facial from Stefani was terrific too. I really appreciate the ambience, friendliness, and professionalism of the staff and I will be back soon. I only wish I could have had a driver take me home because I was so incredibly relaxed. Thank you Glow, you guys are wonderful. Ang
