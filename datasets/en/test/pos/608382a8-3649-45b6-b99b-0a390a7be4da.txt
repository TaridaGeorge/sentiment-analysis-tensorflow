This place signatures the phrase "good eats ~ hole in the wall" .. I mean the owner spends no money on decor etc... it's all about the food and people ^^ and seriously that's the way it should be yO!!

I ordered Chicken Taco ~~ to die for order this for sure!!
Chicken Chimimanga .. ~~ oh dear a huge shredded beef deep fried burrito (wow) .. so good!! (sort of heavy)

I love this place.. I'm making it my ultimate mexican grub spot!
