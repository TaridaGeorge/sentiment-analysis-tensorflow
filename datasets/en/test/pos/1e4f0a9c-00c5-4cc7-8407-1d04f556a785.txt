The Sweetness is a new small ice cream shop located in the Fair Trade Cafe. It is a great little spot to grab some delicious ice cream. With amazing extended hours and service that puts Nordstrom's to shame- this is a win every time.

I recommend getting the fresh waffle to accompany your ice cream. They are made to order, so have a little patience- as good things come to those who wait.

I think the owner's name is Jesse, and he is a great guy. He is proud of his product, as he should be. I love that he makes great ice cream, but at the same time keeps it simple. You won't find a bunch of mixins, as this ice cream stands on its own.

Keep up the good work, Sweetness!
