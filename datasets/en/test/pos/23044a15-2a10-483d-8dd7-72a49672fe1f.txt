I'd heard so much about Postino that I wasn't sure it would live up to the hype. Happily, it did! The atmosphere, the food, and the wine all measure up at Postino, the place that started the uber-urban renaissance at 40th and Campbell.

Postino is upscale, but not pretentious. The bruschetta really is out of this world, but the salads are incredible, too. Went there for lunch on a Friday and loved the diversity of the crowd. I also liked it that the noise level was reasonable, even when the place was packed.
