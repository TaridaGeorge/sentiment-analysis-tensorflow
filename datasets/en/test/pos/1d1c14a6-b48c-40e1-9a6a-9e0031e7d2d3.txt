Stuck in the upscale strip malls of Scottsdale, one of the top few architectural attractions in Phoenix: for the last 50 years or so!   While I find that most of the actual materials from the Wright buildings seem on the edge of needing replacement, the basic ideas and stunning ideas are the same.   THe 90 minute tour (only 26/adult on a midweek day) was just right, seeing the highlights of all the major spaces.  Go in the winter when it isnt too hot!  By far the most interesting this I did in the city.
