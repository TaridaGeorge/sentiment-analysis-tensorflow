I have absolutely no complaints about this place. I can't wait to go back. I went in and the artists were so welcoming and genuinely friendly. The place smells nice and is very clean. I had my nose pierced by JD who is a fellow vegan which was a bonus. He perfectly positioned the ring and the piercing was quick and I barely felt a thing. It looks awesome, I feel like it's been here for months! I am super satisfied and stoked to go back!
