Traci, the owner is amazing! She's very proffesional and friendly. Her services are great and a must try for those who have not had an organic mani/pedi before!! She also carried soy candles, and organic childrens nail polish. That I did buy for my little girl.. drys quick and no harmful chemicals. 

The shop is very calming and a place you can sit back enjoy and relax!!!
