Fun!  Lively!  Great service!  Sports galore!   The best Happy Hours deals around!  Obviously a well-liked neighborhood hang-out, as the place was booming.  This is a great spot for date night.  One Zipparita and my troubles were gone!  Husband had a specialty burger and fries; I had the chicken tacos (asked for jalapenos and received, no charge)... both meals absolutely delicious.  Will be coming back and bringing friends.
