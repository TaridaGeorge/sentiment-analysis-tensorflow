BoSa is in Scottsdale! They just opened today...we sampled a dozen at work this morning and they are delicious.  The glazed is so very tasty and the texture is much more substantial than the Krispy Kreme glazed, but still very light.  I also tried the apple fritter (like another review commented, crispy outside, light and fluffy and apply inside) and the Boston creme...this is my measure for all donut places.  It was very, very good.

The new location is at 7444 E McDowell Rd.
