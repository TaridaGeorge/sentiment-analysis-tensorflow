Delicious breads of all kinds.  They have muffins, scones, cookies, desert breads - artisan style.  I love picking some up for a special dinner or party.  The Greek Olive Ciabatta that they make on Saturdays is super yummy - so is the Freedom Bread.  Everything taste homemade and whole grain - nothing "cheap" or artificial here.
