I looooove this place.

Where else can you shop upon entering you are offered an espresso, capuccino or latte?  The sales girl even offered my son a warm frothy vanilla drink.  

This place is definitely where I splurge.  My hubby says that I just need a bigger kitchen...do I sense sarcasm?

Himalayan salt block?  Yes, they have it here.  Have you tried baking on it?  No?  Then you need to visit soon!
