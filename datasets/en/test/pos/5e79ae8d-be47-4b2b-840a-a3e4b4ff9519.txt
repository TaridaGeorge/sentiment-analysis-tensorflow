Finally got to visit this place after seeing the tweet for a free cookie. It was tasty! 
I tried the urban tropic and was not disappointed, I also tried a lemon cupcake and the frosting was so sweet/lemony and whipped. MmMm! 
Also tried the ice cream sandwich from the boyfriend and it was fantastic! Really good, and light tasting vanilla ice cream and your choice of cookies to sandwich it. 
The counter guy was real cool and the atmosphere was nice. We need more places like this in Arizona.
