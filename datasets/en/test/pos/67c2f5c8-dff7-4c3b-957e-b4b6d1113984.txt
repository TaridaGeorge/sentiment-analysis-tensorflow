This place is so cool. There is just really no other way to describe it. I love coming here. I love eating here. I love the people who work here. I love their burgers and I really love their sweet potato fries. They taste like dessert. I love their martinis, I've tried a few, and if you ask the bartender for a "surprise martini" like I did, he will bounce back with a cherrylimeaide thing.. delish! I love the sinks in the bathroom and I loved my egg white omelet I ate this morning along with the muddled grape fruit drink on the brunch menu, I forget the name of it but its yummy.. I also love this place because I won a gift card for them at the OYE last week, and I never win anything. ever. I now associate winning with FEZ and that is just awesome.
