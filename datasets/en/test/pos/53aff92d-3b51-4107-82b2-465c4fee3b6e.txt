I've been to this BJ's many times and I have gotten great service & food every time.  They often have a wait to get a seat which is never a problem because it is never really long, they get you sat pretty quickly.  Clean restrooms and restaurant overall very sanitary (one little pet peeve).  The management team is also very helpful to their employees and are constantly walking around to make sure everything is going well.  The bussers are right on taking plates and breaking down the tables and the food runners are quick and like assisting
