To start: this is not the place to go if you are looking for a Subway or Blimpie sandwich, so if that is your idea of what is "good" you won't like the experience here.  Good sandwiches (try the George's special which is the Italian Stallion referenced by others plus a couple other meats including mortadella and hot peppers) or the pastrami that they get shipped direct from New York.  They have their own off site bakery, so try some of their breads (the ciabatta is especially good) or cookies: the butter cookies are a bit hit or miss, but the rainbow cookies that they keep in the back are nearly to eastern standards.  However, the real star of the show is the sausage that they grind daily, along with the selection of certain specialty items: 30 year old balsamic, San Marzano tomatos and Mancini peppers anyone?
