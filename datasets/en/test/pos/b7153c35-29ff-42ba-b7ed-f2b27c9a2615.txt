This is for the new store in Tempe.  we have been eating at the Phx. store but very happy new the store in Tempe is open.  One of the employees in Nevada told us about the new store opening and it was great to see her her in TEMPE TRAINING THE NEW STAFF.   NATALIE from Vegas is just great.  The service is excellent and the food is consistent from store to store and very happy with that.  Management and staff at all locations come by on a regular basics and check if everything is ok or do we need anything.  Great Service for a fast food operation.  Keep up the good work, great food...
