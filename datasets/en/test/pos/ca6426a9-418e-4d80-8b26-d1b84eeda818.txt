I've been going here for years! Love it! Here are my favorites:
-Chicago Gyros ( of course ) :)
-Chicken Gyros
-Chicken Plate (yum)
-Greek Salad with chicken (when your on a diet this is good dish to eat)

Also, their Tzatziki sauce is delicious and so is their hummus. 

If you've never been, go now! You won't be disappointed.
