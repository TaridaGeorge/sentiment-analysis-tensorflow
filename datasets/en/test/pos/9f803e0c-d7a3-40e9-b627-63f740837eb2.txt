this place is going to give yogurtland a run for their money! 

the yogurt is just as tasty and creamy and the toppings are BETTER. as in, toasted coconut. do any of the other amazing full sized candy bar toppings or super fresh fruits even matter once you realize their coconut has been toasted?

if you ever want to win my heart, bring me a vanilla yogurt w strawberries and toasted coconut. there's a joyful hum going on the entire time i eat it.  

PLUS 10% off or something if you work in the area, frequent stampers card that you DONT have to carry around in your wallet.

this place is the jam!
