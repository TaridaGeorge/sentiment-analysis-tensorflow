Just discovered this absolutely fantastic Thai restaurant!!  We ordered edamame, crab rangoons, Panang curry chicken and pineapple fried rice...  

The crab rangoons were some of the best I have tasted (and I've tasted many!!) ...  it is one of my favorite appetizers to order and these tasted freshly made hot from the fryer!

The Panang curry chicken was phenomenal .. it has a coconut curry sauce over large pieces of white chicken .. had such a delicious flavor!  I chose medium spiceness (and I am a wimp when it comes to spicy) and it had just the right amount of spicy .. enjoy to clear the sinuses but not leave the mouth burning too much!!

The pineapple fried rice was tasty too ... it has shrimp and chicken with pieces of pineapple mixed in to the rice .. was very good!!

Definitely will be visiting this place again!!
