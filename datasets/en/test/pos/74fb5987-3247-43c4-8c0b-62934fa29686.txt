So almost 1 year later, we return. And I wonder why it took me so long. The service is great, non pretentious, friendly, informative & just really nice. The food is impressive. Not too much, not too little, just right in every aspect... cooking, presentation, portion, etc. When you walk out of somewhere & the 1st thing you think is.... have I Yelped this place? - You know that it's really made a mark on your feelings, your thoughts, your need to share with the world the information of a place that is getting it right! It is in the back or side of a strip mall (surprise - welcome to AZ), but when you walk in you are transported to a quaint, welcoming atmosphere, including the patio area. Definitely a hidden gem that I wouldn't pass up!
