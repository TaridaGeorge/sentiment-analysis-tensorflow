If you ever want to instantly "up" your cool factor with a friend or date, meet them at the Lost Leaf. The mere fact that there is no external sign (other than the tacky "open" sign indicating that it is, indeed, the lost leaf) you would probably never have any idea that the best neighborhood bar in Phoenix is inside. When i am asked to describe the lost leaf to someone who has never been before, it is basically a big open house with the most well-stocked beer fridge you have ever seen.

No cocktails or draft, but for atmosphere and quality of beer selection, lost leaf is by far my favorite place to meet people in dtown phoenix.
