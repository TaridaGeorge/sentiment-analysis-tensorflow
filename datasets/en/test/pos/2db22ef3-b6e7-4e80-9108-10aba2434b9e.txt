Some more favorites to share:

While THEIR crab cakes may not do it for me, I've invented my own using supplies from Trader Joe's: in the refrigerator section they sell a 1 lb. can of all claw crab meat for about $8! I mix this with 1/2 c. panko break crumbs, 1 egg, 2 tablespoons Trader Joe's Aioli Garlic Mustard Sauce and a couple shakes of louisiana hot sauce. It makes about 5 fairly large crab cakes which I pan fry in olive oil for about 4 minutes per side. Now, THAT's a crab cake! 

Another favorite concoction, thanks to Trader Joe's is their light champagne vinaigrette, black mission figs, crumbled goat cheese tossed with sliced red onion, arugula and a cut up apple -- it's an AWESOME salad!

Dessert? Trader Joe's dark chocolate bar caramel with black sea salt -- F'n A!! There are NO words!
