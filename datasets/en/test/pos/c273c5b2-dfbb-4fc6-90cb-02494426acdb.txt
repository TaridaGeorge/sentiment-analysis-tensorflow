Always a good time!  And, FINALLY, we received tech tees instead of plain old cotton t-shirts.  The expo has a lot going on, and is always packed.  One thing:  The expo should either be for runners only or not allow double strollers.  Seriously!  

We took the shuttle from the finish line to the start with no problems.  Several others told us they've had to wait for 30 mins at other races, so I think we lucked out!

The course is pretty flat with a lot of spectators and a lot of runners, but the corral system works pretty well.  The finish line is well stocked with volunteers, food, and water.  Definitely a fun race!
