Last minute we decided to go camping; however, I needed to do a little computer work...which meant I needed power. Radio Shack is always my 'go to place' for these types of needs and I swung into this one because it was close to the dog sitters. The manager could obviously see I was in a hurry, so I told him I needed a car charger for the laptop Within 2 minutes he found the charger, rung me up and out the door I went! And while he had no control over it, it was on sale! I love it when the staff knows the product and can read the situation!
