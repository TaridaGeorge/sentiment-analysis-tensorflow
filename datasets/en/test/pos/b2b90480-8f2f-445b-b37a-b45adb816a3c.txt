Just terrific.  I'm a ditz when it comes to refilling the air in my tires, so I drive over there and they do it for me.  And, of course, that kind of service earns my business when I need tires.  Happily, those purchased tires were less expensive than elsewhere, and the experience of dealing with Discount Tires sales people is absolutely flawless - no upsell, no hard sell, just straight and honest.  This is a company that i would trust - anywhere - thought I think this store is one of the best!
