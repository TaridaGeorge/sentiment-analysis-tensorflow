This place is amazing! I've been looking for a cheap, good sushi place in Arizona for the past 2 years I've lived here. Coming from Los Angeles with places like Sushi Mac and other inexpensive but yummy choices, I was a bit spoiled. 

Now I'm even more spoiled! The most expensive plate here is $2! I never even found prices that cheap in L.A. where you have sushi places on just about every other corner. Plus, this place is good! Sure, its no fine dining establishment so the quality is not top-of-the-line, but its BY FAR much, much better than store bought sushi, and again, cheaper.

I recommend this place to anyone who, like me, loves sushi but doesn't want to break the bank.
