Fresh baked cookies with ice cream? You really can't go wrong, especially since the cookies are fresh from the oven and the ice cream is a creamy goodness! Think of them like your Mom's freshly baked cookies, your Grandma's homemade ice cream and voila! You've got Cookiez on Mill. My favorite cookie is the home chocolate chip or the peanut butter cookie. Mmmmm, cookies.
