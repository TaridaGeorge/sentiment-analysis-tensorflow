I love Cheba Hut.  The White Widow is fucking awesome (excuse my french)!  Only been there a couple times.  Tried the Jamaican Red, which was okay, a little more flavor a little less heat would have helped it.  The pizza sub that my son had was really good.  You can't really mess up bread, sauce cheese and pepperoni though!  I love the kick-back atmosphere, the funny art, and the people that work there are really nice... for obvious reasons probably?  

Let me end this by saying, I'm not really a sub girl, but I'd go here anytime!  YUMMMM!

OH WAIT!  The rice krispy treat with brownie stuck together with PB is fricking awesome... but then again, my judgement may have been impaired?
