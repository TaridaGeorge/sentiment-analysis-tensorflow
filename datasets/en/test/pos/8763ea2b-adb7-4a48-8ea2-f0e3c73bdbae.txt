The people at Glenfair Veterinary Hospital are fantastic. The price for any service here is easily one-third of anywhere else, and the service you receive is genuine. They truly care about your pets and you can feel it the minute you walk in the door. I live in East Phoenix, but I'll drive the 30 minutes to give Glenfair my business.
