Right when we thought, "uh oh, we are going drop a ton of cash on food and drinks," we found this little cafe/convenient shop.  They have quite the selection of wine and a fairly large wine fridge to boot.  Prices were very reasonable especially considering we were at a very nice resort.  In fact everything at Crave was reasonable and not just cheap.  Everything we had was fantastic.  Lattes were perfectly made.  Pastries, empanadas and some breakfast pyramids stuffed with egg, cheese, bacon and sausage made me shake off the occasional hangover and hop out of bed every morning.  The breakfast pyramid was easily one of the best breakfast items I've ever had.

The staff was all very polite and helpful.
