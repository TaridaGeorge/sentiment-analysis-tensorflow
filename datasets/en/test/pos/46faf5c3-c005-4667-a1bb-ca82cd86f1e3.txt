Had take out pho (beef) last night, and my friend had the chicken bun.  Just excellent again, and now I'm left wondering why I'm not eating here more frequently than once a month.  The pho broth is consistently excellent, and the beef was served very well, including a well packaged piece of rare beef, as pho should be served.  The ingredients' freshness was superb.  If I didn't mention it before, the packaging, other than being environmentally bad, is very convenient.

My friend reports his chicken bun was pretty excellent.   

Anyway--five stars for excellent vietnamese take out.  You should be eating here.
