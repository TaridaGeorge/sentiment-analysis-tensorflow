Chicago style thin crust, cut into squares, very good sweet sauce and alot of great cheese. Spicy Italian is one of our fav's + mama's spinach pizza. Can't go wrong with this Pizza - you will crave it. For something different try the Spaghetti and meatball calzone. Couple of good beers on tap and nice canoli's if you still have room. Wish it was bigger on weekends expect a wait.
