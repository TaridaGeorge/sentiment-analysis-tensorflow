After ten years in San Francisco, I can be a bit of a coffee snob.  There's just something artistic about creating a great cup latte, espresso or coffee.  When done right, it's absolutely a wonderful taste experience.  

These guys have figured it out.  More so than any other place I've tried in the Valley.  Went for the first time and ordered a 2% latte...nailed it!  Tons of flavor but very smooth at the same time.

The place is well done but; just like it's predecessor, it's the not the most comfortable place.  I wouldn't recommend for extended hours of work.
