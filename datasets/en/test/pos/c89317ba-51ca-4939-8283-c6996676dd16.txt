Updating my review after several weeks. Appears maybe the managers read these reviews. In the last few weeks this store has improved 2 stars. The eggs in my BBs have been cooked perfectly, Diet Coke tastes better and they have not forgotten anything in all my visits. Added two stars because they have been consistently 5 stars since my last review...but I am still watching.
