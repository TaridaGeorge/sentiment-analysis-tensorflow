I love this place. If your looking for a good English treat, this is the place to go. The food is phenomenal and the atmosphere is fun. My favorite pic is "The Pilgrim", which has Turkey, stuffing, sweet potatoes, and comes with a side of cranberry sauce. My husband, who is a vegetarian always gets the vegetarian Shepard's Pie, which he loves.

The only two things that I think could be improved on is the inside of the restaurant is hot hot hot in the summer (better air conditioning). And, there could be more space (it's pretty cramped) for seating. Especially if there is more than 2 people in your party.
