My wife found this place a few months back... she was just looking for a decent tanning salon close to our house in downtown phoenix... She mentioned to me that it had a small gym connected, and that I should look into a membership there since I was between gyms. Finally, months later we decided to check it out together.... what she originally thought was a "small" gym, turned out to be a rather large gym, equipped with updated weight machines, benches, free weights, treadmills, etc! And the price CANNOT BE BEAT!! It's a no brainer! Plus we get 50% off tanning as gym members! Which comes in handy for evening out that nasty tan line....
