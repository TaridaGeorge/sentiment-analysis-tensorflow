This review is just for the deli/ country sandwich counter at this Sprouts, formerly Sunflower market.

A decent sized "make your own" sandwich for $2.99? Made w/ fresh veggies, and Boars Head meats? Surely you jest! Nope. Thats what youll find in the deli corner. Its a perfect cheap, quick, healthy lunch or dinner.
