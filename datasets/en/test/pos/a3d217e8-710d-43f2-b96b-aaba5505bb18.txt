I love Lo-Fi Coffee!! I stumbled upon this cute and quaint coffee shop after attending a show at the Nile Theater. It is located right behind the Nile and is a perfect spot to sit, hang out and drink an amazing cup of coffee while waiting for doors to open before a show.  
The baristas take the time to individually make your drink so it is brewed to perfection. The coffee is genuinely good and the baristas know their stuff. I can't recommend just one drink because everything they make is so delicious!
