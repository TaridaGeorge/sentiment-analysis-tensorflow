For a gas station, this place IS as good as it gets.  The gas isn't overly expensive because its next to a freeway or anything and the people inside are friendly and super efficient.

They have a huge selection of food and beverages.  They even include some fruit if you are super health conscious.  I'd like a few more healthy options for grabbing a quick breakfast but none of it is terrible.

Pro-tip, the cashiers work both sides of their registers, move through the line faster by going on either side.
