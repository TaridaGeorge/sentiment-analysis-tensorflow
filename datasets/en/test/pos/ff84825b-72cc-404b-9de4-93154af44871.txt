My husband and I ate here Saturday night, using a Groupon I'd recently purchased. We enjoyed the open atmosphere and great service, and we were entertained by what appeared to be a large wedding or graduation party. Despite the fact that their kitchen had to have been extremely busy with such a large group, our meal was absolutely delicious! I had the portabella mushroom dish, and my husband had penne pasta with chicken - both excellent and a pleasant surprise! Yes, a little pricey, but definitely worth it. We'll be back!
