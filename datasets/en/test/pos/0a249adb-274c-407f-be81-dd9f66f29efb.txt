Was recently in Scottsdale and went to Elements for a birthday celebration! All I can say is Elements has absolutely the best happy hour in all of Scottsdale, hands down! Drinks are $6.00 for designer cocktails (had the blueberry/taragon collins) and appetizers are $6.00 for generous portions that are delectable! Ordered the pork sliders, house made potato chips, and the hummus with vegetables. Waitstaff was attentive and efficient. Honestly, the appetizers and drinks would have been enough to feed my family of five. The cocktails offered on the happy hour menu are refreshingly creative (we all tasted each other's cocktails and couldn't decide who had the best). Everything was delicious and the view fantastic. What a wonderful place to get out of the desert sun and enjoy some libations! Will definitely make it a point to dine there every time I'm in Scottsdale!
