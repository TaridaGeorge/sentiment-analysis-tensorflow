If you are gluten intolerant this is the place to go. I was amazed at how many gluten free products they have.  I am gluten free and  it is hard to find a good loaf of bread that is not as heavy as a brick. 

I was able to find many other gluten free products in there frozen food area, I was like a kid in a candy store.  

Did you know that you can walk through the store with a glass of wine or a bottle of beer while you shop? 

This Whole Foods is just amazing, I highly recommend it.
