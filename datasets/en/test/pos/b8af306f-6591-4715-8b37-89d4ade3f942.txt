My husband told me about this place, and well I am pretty darn picky when it comes to sweets. You could call me a "Foodie" I would say hands down a "Sweetie" would be a better description. I would take desert over dinner any day of the week. 
Here are just some of my likes: 
Dark Chocolate with Vanilla Butter Cream Frosting, Red Velvet with Cream Cheese Frosting, S'mores, Peanut Butter Cup, Salted Caramel, Malted Milk Ball, Banana Nut with Cream Cheese Frosting, Cookies & Cream. 

Does anyone know is there a "group" for this?
