I was in a bind and out of town when the "boys" here really helped me out.

I called and spoke with Ted, who gave me a quote for the work I needed done.  He greeted me when I arrived and quickly got to work on starting my order.  I was happy to find that everyone here was very direct and up front, and I walked out paying the same as the quote and no one tried to up-sell me (or talk down to me).

Willy worked on my car quickly and efficiently, and Gene helped me look for parts.  I really appreciated how easy the whole trip was and that I was taken care of as soon as I pulled up.

I would definitely recommend this place for parts or service if you happen to live in the Scottsdale area.
