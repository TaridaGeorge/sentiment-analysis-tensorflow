I've gotten both my arms done by Josh.  He just moved to Lady Luck about a year ago.
The decor is awesome!  Very chic and contemporary.  The place is as clean as a whistle.  
I've spent about 20 hours at Lady Luck.  Everyone is really friendly and professional.  They even play movies while you're sitting in the chair to pass the time.  It's great!   When you've spent as much time as I have, you need something to stare at besides Josh!
