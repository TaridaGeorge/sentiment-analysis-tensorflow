Thai Pan is one of the best Asian restaurants in the valley...quick serve or not. It has a casual atmosphere - similar to Pei Wei, but the food is better. The curries are excellent and the service is always quick and friendly. And the restaurant is extremely clean!
I particularly like the yellow curry...it isn't spicy - but very flavorful.
I have travelled and lived all over Asia and the food definitely reminds me of what I ate daily while there.
