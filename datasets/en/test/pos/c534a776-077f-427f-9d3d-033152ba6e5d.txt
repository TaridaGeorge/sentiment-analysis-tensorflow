Dr. Cellars is the best there is. We own two Boxers. When our Roxie was about six months she got really sick. She was lethargic and threw up constantly. We took her to two other vets and did TONS of testing yet they could never figure out what was wrong. After spending more money that I'd like to admit we decided that vet wasn't for us and we called Dr. Cellars. We ended up having to do a surgery we were trying to avoid because of the cost but Dr. Cellars pricing was so reasonable it made our decision easy. Turns out poor Roxie had the dog version of appendicitis so he had to remove her appendix. She is almost two years old now and healthy as can be. Both our dogs love the staff and get excited every time we make a visit.
