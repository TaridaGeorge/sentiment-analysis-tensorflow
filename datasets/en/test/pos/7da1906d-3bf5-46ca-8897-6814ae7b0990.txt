I love going to Lo-Lo's.  It's unique and clever, the food is terrific, and the wait is reasonable - standard breakfast waiting.  The whole concept of Chicken with Waffles appeals to me on so many levels. It's a great place to take visitors and family members who have never been there.  It leaves a smile on your face for the whole day!
