I have eaten at Eddie's several times, and this is my first review.  I definitely prefer to sit at the bar and take advantage of their amazing Monday-Saturday, all day 1/2 off appetizer specials.  The flatbread, which is covered in whatever is fresh and tasty that day, is a favorite, as is the mash potato stuffed shrimp, grilled *or* fried calamari, kabobs.... let me stop before I get hungry again.  I have also had the bacon infused meatloaf entree, which also was excellent.
Eddie's house is a place that has yet to disappoint.
