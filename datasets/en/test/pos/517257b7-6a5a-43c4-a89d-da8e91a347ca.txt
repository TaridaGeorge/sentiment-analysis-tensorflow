The US Egg is awesome! I love their protein pancakes and their staff is very friendly. I've tried a few other things at this restaurant; however, if you've never been here before, the protein pancakes are a must!

Once when I was there my food came out wrong. I told the waitress that it was fine, and I would eat it. The manager/owner came over and apologized and comped my entire meal. I thought it was really great how they take care of their customers. I would recommend this place if you've never been there.
