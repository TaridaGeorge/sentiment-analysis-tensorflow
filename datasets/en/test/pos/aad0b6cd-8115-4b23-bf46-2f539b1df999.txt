Let this sink in: the Cardinals are going to the Superbowl.

I've had season tickets for years. I don't say that to distance myself from the bandwagon - that's just an ancillary benefit. But you've got to understand that long-suffering Cards fans find joy in small things. A win against St. Louis? Awesome. A light breeze in Sun Devil Stadium? Thank goodness. A team that approaches mediocrity? Bliss.

I didn't think I'd be going to the NFC championship game. Money's tight, ya heard? But the pops-in-law came through and hooked us up at the last second. We tailgated with a cooler of PBR and then watched the best game of our lives. All I can say is, "FINALLY!"
