There are at least six sushi restaurants closer to us, but Ah Hai Sushi and Grill is definitely worth the extra drive.  It has quickly become my family's favorite sushi restaurant.  Ah Hai serves very fresh and delicious food at a very reasonable price.  The staff are very friendly and my family has always had a pleasant experience dining there.   My wife enjoys their Scorpion Roll the best.  I like the Beef Negimaki.  If we dine during lunch, we use the $5.00 off $25.00 coupon that is always available.  If we dine during dinner, then it's Happy Hour pricing all evening long.  Happy to have a 5 STAR sushi restaurant in the West Valley!
