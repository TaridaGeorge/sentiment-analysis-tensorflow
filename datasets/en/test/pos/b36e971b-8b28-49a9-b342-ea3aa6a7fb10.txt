I have not eaten at Eddie V's but I have had the pleasure of partaking in a liquid dinner.  :)

This place is great if you want to kick back with an awesome martini, listen to some GREAT music, and just relax.  It's also a great date place if you want to cuddle up in addition to those three things.

It's pretty dark in the bar (the restaurant in general) and while the restaurant seemed pretty loud, the bar seems like its own little world  It's like a bar you would find in New York or San Francisco.

I highly recommend it and can't wait to go back for a real dinner!
