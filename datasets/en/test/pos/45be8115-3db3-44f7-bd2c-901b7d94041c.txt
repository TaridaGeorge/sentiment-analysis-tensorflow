Rented a couple mountain bikes with a friend from work yesterday.  Great experience.   5 minutes outside AOA's front door we were trekking through the AZ outback...a great ride.  Staff was friendly and knowledgable.  Provided several options for local trails, with options for different skill levels.   Equipment was great - mine: double suspension, carbon fiber with clips.  Very cost competitive. After at great 2 hr. ride, the best part was cooling down in their office.  Would definitely work with them again.
