Hands down the best food around!!!! The staff is friendly . We have not had anything less than stellar food and awesome service. We recomend hula's every chance we get and after an always great meal we shoot across the parking lot for some delicious yogurt. Great job dana and niki! We look forward to the next chance we get to eat there..Keep up the good job!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
