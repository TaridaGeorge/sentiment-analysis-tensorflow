Any place that doesn't serve Budweiser is automatically cool. Four Peaks is pretty much the watering hole of choice for anyone in Tempe. 

The beer selection is oustanding. All their normal beers are great and their seasonals are also excellent. The Pumpkin Porter and Winter Wobbler are favorites among my group of friends. I can't say enough good things about the beers they brew.

The food is surprisingly tasty for a 'bar' like this. The hamburgers are large and quite tasty. Where else can you get a burger with a slab (yes, a slab) of cream cheese on top of the patty with sliced jalapenos?

The only downside is the parking. Parking will usually consist of parking down the street next to the curb or behind the Four Peaks building  down the alleyway.
