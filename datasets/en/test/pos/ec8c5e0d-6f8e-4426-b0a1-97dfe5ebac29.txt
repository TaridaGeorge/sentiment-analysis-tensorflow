I had a slow leak in my driver rear tire recently.  I took it in yesterday (04/09/12) and the manager was nice enough to advise the shop would be closing soon but would check the tire out anyway.  I was in and out within 30 minutes.  The tech that worked on my vehicle described what he did to repair the small leak in the tire.  Everyone was friendly and fast.  It gets my vote.
