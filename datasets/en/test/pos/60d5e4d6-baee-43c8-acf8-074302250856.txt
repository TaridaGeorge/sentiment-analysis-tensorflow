Had a great day at the Mariners game today.  There are tons of great places to eat with everything from Gyros to Funnel Cakes.  They also have a great beer selection with many premium beers on draft and in big bottles.  My favorite part of the stadium is the huge lawn area.  For $6 you get a great spot in the outfield lawn and watch the game perfectly.  It's my favorite park and luckily for me my favorite team plays in it.
