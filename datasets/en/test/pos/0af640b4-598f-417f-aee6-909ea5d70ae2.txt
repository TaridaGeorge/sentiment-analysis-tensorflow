One word. Amazing. Build your own incredibly tasty burger for less than $10. Seriously. Not only that, but it includes fries, onion rings or potato salad! How can you beat that? The first time I tried the potato roll with american cheese, garlic, mushrooms, lettuce, bbq sauce, and fries. It was so good. In fact, I returned the next day for another round. Do yourself a favor and try one of the lemonades. I went with the Desert pear. So refreshing! Will definitely be back for more!
