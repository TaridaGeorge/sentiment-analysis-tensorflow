Small, mom-and-pop specialty store specializing in alternative healing, metaphysical phenomenon, spirituality, etc.  They have readers there every weekday, I believe. Super friendly, helpful, gave me a 10% discount off my big stack of books just cuz I asked for it!  Got a reading with Lori - top rate.  They have events and groups for various things - psychic group readings, drumming circles, reiki - will definitely go back.  

Watch out - the books might pick you as much as you pick them.  One book I was considering and then decided not to buy kept throwing itself off the shelf whenever I walked away, no matter how cautiously I put the damn thing back.  Srsly.  Okay, so I own it now.  How can you not respond if you're the kind of person to walk into a metaphysical books store to begin with?   ;)
