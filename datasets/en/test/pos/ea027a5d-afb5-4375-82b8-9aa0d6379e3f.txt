Monday and Wednesday at 9:30 Hegel Yoga  has the best  beginning yoga class I have ever taken. I felt like I really stretched and worked, but it wasn't so hard that I don't want to go back. She has other classes for people who are advanced, but I won't be attending those. I am sticking with her beginning class. Love it! HEr place is moving next week somewhere on Kyrene, so look up the new address.
