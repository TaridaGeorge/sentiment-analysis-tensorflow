All I had was their Sangria so I dont know if I can really rate them or not, but based off of their sangria, definitely 5 stars!! Good service also. My friend and I got a pitcher of sangria and its house made and the pitcher has a bunch of fruit in it, no ice which is good bc sometimes the pitchers has so much ice and hardly any drink. I was a fan!
