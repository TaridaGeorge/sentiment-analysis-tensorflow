We attended this event today and loved it! The grounds are beautiful and spread out so it didn't seem like it was overly crowded. 

This is a well thought out event with food trucks located throughout so if you get hungry, there will be food near by.

The admission price was $7 and we felt it was a bargain. 

There are a variety of artists so there is something for everyone to look at and/or buy.
