This was our first time at Bloom, and it was a find!  First of all, the waiter, Joseph, was incredibly accomodating.  My husband is vegetarian, and Joseph offered to create a dinner for him from any side dish or other dish on the menu.  The manager came over to talk with us as we were finishing the meal.  It was a very welcoming atmosphere.
One other outstanding point - our guest was wearing black pants, and the hostess brought a black napkin to the table for her so she wouldn't get white flecks from the napkin on her black pants.  I have never seen that anywhere before!
All in all, it was a great dinner!
