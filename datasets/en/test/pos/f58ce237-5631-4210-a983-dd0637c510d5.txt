I love Cyclo.  We've been many times and its usually VERY busy.  Excellent Vietnamese food! Every dish we've had here has been great!!  Despite the poor reviews of the Pho, every one we've had has been good, especially the seafood Pho. The owner is so nice and friendly!  Its BYOB too!  If you like Vietnamese food, check it out!!!
