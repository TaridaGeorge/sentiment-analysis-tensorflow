Everything about the food and beer are amazing. I go there all the time, but never expect to get great service. That's okay though--obviously they're putting their efforts into what counts, the food. I can never find my server, but other than that one of the best places to eat and drink in Tempe by far.

I recommend the Salmon BLT and the Spinach Artichoke Dip... Mmmmmm.... and the Raj! Heaven.
