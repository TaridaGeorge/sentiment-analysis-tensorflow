Ok, it is probably very rare that I will be handing out 5 stars that much because I'm just like that but this place really deserves it!!!!! Can I say heeelllllllloooooo heaven!!! I might have to say this is the first time I cleaned my plate (and pot). This place has just the right atmosphere for a good night out. The food was excellent and so was our waiter! I would be in trouble if they ever put one closer to me!!! Some people may say that their portions are too small but I have to differ, I never go home hungry and I never leave with that gut wrenching feeling of over eating!!!!
I would take out a second mortgage and eat here every night!!!!
