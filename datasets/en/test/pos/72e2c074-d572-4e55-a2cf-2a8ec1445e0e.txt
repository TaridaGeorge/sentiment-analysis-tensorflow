Love it love it love it.

Whether you're looking for a fantastic bottle to take home or you want to munch on cheese and crackers while you drink and converse, My Wine Cellar has you covered.  The retail portion of the restaurant is really excellent, the walls lined with a huge selection of reds and whites.  

If you're intimidated by the selection or are a beginning wino, the restaurant offers "wine education" courses.  My fiance and I attended a weekly "Wine 101" course a couple of years back.  Each week, we sampled a different genre of wine including reds, whites, dessert wines, and champagnes.  Also, each week included a guest speaker, usually a sales rep for a wine maker.  Lots of fun and I learned a huge amount of information!
