This is my second favorite Restaurant in Phoenix (behind only Tarbell's) and receives consistently Phabulous reviews. I have had much on their menu and have loved almost ALL. 

I have become a "Pho Aficionado" and I love the strong flavors in the best Phos. Cyclo's Pho leaves a lot to be desired! Broth is generally too thin, although the service is beautifully done. Plus their Pho is expensive when compared to other "Pho Joints" that I believe have better Pho.

Everything else I have eaten on their menu (and I have eaten most everything!) is indeed PHABULOUS, so I will just go elsewhere for my Pho Phix! Besides, I would miss NOT seeing Justina (Cyclo Owner) who is a delightful experience, not to mention the delightful experiences available on their menu, other than the Pho!!
