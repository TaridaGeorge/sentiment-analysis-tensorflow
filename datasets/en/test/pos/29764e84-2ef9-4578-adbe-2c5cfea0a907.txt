i didn't know cheesecake could actually inspire joy until i experienced the dark chocolate and chile arizona cheesecake company cheesecake at the main ingredient on 7th street and sheridan. 

speechless, really, which means this review will be short and sweet. in short, you haven't lived until you've tried it. and sweetly, spicyrichchocolatecreamcheesiness just doesn't get any better than this.

brilliant, i tell you. simply brilliant.

eat a piece for me.
