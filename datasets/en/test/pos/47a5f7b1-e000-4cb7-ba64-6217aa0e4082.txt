Quite possibly one of the best gelato places I've been to.  I tried some of the coconut and it was rich, smooth, creamy, with a wonderful tropical coconut flavor.  I kept on wanting to eat more and more! (I did have to restrain myself since I was sharing it with someone though)  I also had some of the Moroccan caffe, which are some shots of espresso with chocolate powder.  It tasted thick, rich, and smooth.  Service was warm and friendly.  Definitely a stop for good dessert if you're in the area!
