This last week, I had my girlfriends surprise birthday party at Vincent's Market Bistro. The food, the atmosphere, and the service were all great. As everyone else mentioned, the croissants they serve are delicious, and very euro like. 
The menu is somewhat limited, but they also had a pre fixe menu for dinner which is a great option as well. 
The atmosphere is very cozy, and has a great euro feel to it. What I was most impressed with was the service. Our waiter was very knowledgable and patient. 
But the thing that really sealed the deal was the cute little birthday dessert they made for my girlfriend, only to be shortly followed with a similar complimentary plate for everyone else at the table. 
We will definitely be coming back!!
