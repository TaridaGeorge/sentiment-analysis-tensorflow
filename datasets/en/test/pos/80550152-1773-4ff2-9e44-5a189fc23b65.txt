Love this place. Awesome cupcakes. Great location. The food is to die for. The cupcakes are amazing. You just bit into them and it's creamy. The bread in the cupcake is just right. I got a tuna sandwich. Soo yummy. I recommend this place if you love cupcakes and mellow atmosphere. This is your place. Did I mention their cupcakes won cupcake wars on the food network. Everything is just amazing here.
