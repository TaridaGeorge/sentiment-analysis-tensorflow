No matter what city I may be visiting or passing through, I am always on the constant stake out for my W experience. Be wary, this hotel is not one that is universally enjoyed, but under no means is it ever a disappointment if this is your particular thing. In hot destinations like Hollywood and Scottsdale, expect a swanky, young, and at times pretentious atmosphere. Imagine an attractive party crowd of upscale out-of-towners, ritzier Scottsdale locals, and your typical GQ-subscribing businessman. If you have money, like to be seen, or would like to meet either of the two...why not let the W be your new niche?
