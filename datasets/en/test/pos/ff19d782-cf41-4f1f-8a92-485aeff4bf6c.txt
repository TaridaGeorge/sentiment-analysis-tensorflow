Can't figure out why this place isn't busier - the food is excellent, and the prices are low. Love the taro fries and the little corn nuts they serve as a free appetizier. Rotisserie chicken is a lunch thing, but super tasty and moist. Nice atmosphere and easy parking. The fried seafood assortment is most excellent and the ceviches are super freash and tasty. Don't miss it!
