So, I noticed that I gave Durants 4 stars. Huh? 

WTF was I thinking? This is the universe's greatest bar/restaurant. 

It's just so perfect. Pictures of dogs and bartenders who simply could not improve their game. Entrances where you shouldn't sneeze and exits into the gates of political hell. It's just so perfect. 

My key board is now wet with the salty stains of my emotional discharge induced by the faintest ghost whiff of their dirty vodka martini. On the rocks.
