I love Bobby Q!  My family and I went here for dinner with my cousin and even though we were still full from our lunch, the food here still tasted great.  So great that we finished everything despite our very very full stomachs.  We had the ribs, mac and cheese, their eggroll appetizer thing, and tri tip.  Everything was really good.  And they give you complimentary fresh and warm donut holes!
