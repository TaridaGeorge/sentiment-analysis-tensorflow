Excellent, excellent, excellent. It's so great to have a restaurant that is 100% vegan so that you have no worries of making the wrong choice.  The good thing is you could take anyone there and they'd be happy.  They would have no idea it's vegan.  In addition, depending on the location you have many choices to choose from ranging from Asian inspiration to burgers and fries.

I had a Pink Lady drink which was very tasty.  For our main course we each chose the Hawaiian burger with fries.  Unknowingly we also receive soup as an appetizer.  Both items we FANTASTIC. Highly recommend.
