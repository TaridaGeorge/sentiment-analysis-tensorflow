My family and I stopped by on a whim just 30 minutes before they closed on a Friday. We were fortunate to be able to come right in and sit down, at least I think so after always seeing an enormous line as we drove past! They have the BEST french toast, it's nothing extravagant and is very simple but absolutely perfect. My husband really enjoyed his breakfast sandwich and our daughter loved sharing with both of us. The home fries here are to die for! 

The atmosphere is so cozy and homey, there aren't many tables but that's one of my favorite things about it. I still think about that french toast and I can't wait to go back!
