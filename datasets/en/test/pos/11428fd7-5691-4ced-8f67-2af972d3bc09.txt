This is a great little gem in the middle of old town!  I had their fabulous 'monkey cakes'!  These certainly did not disappoint!

The service was top notch!  We were seated immediately and had our drinks within minutes, with our orders taken quickly as well.  

I had only previously been here for dinner (which was also great!) but will certainly be back for breakfast!
