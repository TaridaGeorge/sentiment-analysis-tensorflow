Just learned today they closed down - so why am I still writing this review ? Not sure, but it was probably the best happy hour in N. Scottsdale. $3 drafts with awesome choices. 

HA food was excellent, and priced very well...

Clientele is mostly over 30 with some younger smatterings about. Every server/bartender was very nice, efficient.

I hope more places follow their reasonable happy hour (as opposed to rip-off Tanzy) but I guess for now I'll continue to stay away from Zipps and go to our good 'ol stand-by, Tilted Kilt.

Not sure what happened or why, but maybe Twin Peaks took some of their customers.

Good bye Prime Bar , I'll miss ya
