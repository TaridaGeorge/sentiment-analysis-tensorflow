I have been going here for about 2 years now. The staff is friendly & Dr. Yohannes is a really great guy. The office is very clean & nicely decorated, with flat screens in every room. I believe they are even open on weekends & will open their doors after hours if you have an emergency. I really like it here & will continue to go here as long as I can. It also helps that they are a block away from my house, so I leave literally a minute before my appointment time.
