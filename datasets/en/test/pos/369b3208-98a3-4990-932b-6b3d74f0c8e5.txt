My better half and I absolutely adore this place! We come here quite often to enjoy each other's company while having amazing beers and playing Yahtzee. The service is great, the environment is super laid back, and I can honestly say that I cannot think of a single negative thing to say about this brewery. They do not serve food but allow you to bring in your own. There is a snack cart out front that serves up some pretty badass hot dogs! Their red is by far the best I've ever had, and we are definitely beer snobs! :)
