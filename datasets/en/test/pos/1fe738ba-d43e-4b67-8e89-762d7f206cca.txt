I have been eating at this place for years and have never had a bad meal. I could care less about how a place looks. You can't eat ambiance. This food is the closest I have come to the food I have eaten in Tai Wan.  The two months I spent there taught me to eat with my mouth and not with my eyes, nose or mind. That is where a cultured pallet comes from.
