LOVE IT! Before my husband and I moved to Laveen we used to eat here once a week! Now it's a semi-rare treat for us. The food is always delicious (way better than PF changs), especially the chow mein and garlic chicken. The prices are super low and the waitresses, while they don't always speak the best english, are always really helpful and great about refilling drinks. If you're in the area and feeling Chinese, this is definitely the place for you!
