Best Thai food I ever had. If you haven't tried this place yet...you really are missing out...its that good!!

I ate from the dinner menu and had the Thai barbeque classic, my stepdaughter had Thai fried rice  (she's 9 and very picky) and my friend had one of the Pad entrees. For an appetizer we had the Golden curry puffs. Because of the way the food is served, we were able to share everything.

Everything, and I mean everything, was delicious! I can't wait to go again. No one in my party had any complaints all you could hear was "hmm" "so good"...etc.
