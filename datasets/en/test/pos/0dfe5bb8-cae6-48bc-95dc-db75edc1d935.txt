Good Food. Good Prices.

We can't go too long without ordering from Tao Garden. They have authentic Chinese food that we like.
They recently raised their prices, but still are quite reasonable.

Here are a list of the must have in no particular order:
Steamed Chicken w/ Ginger & Scallions
Mongolian Beef
Peking Pork Chop (similar to Sweet & Sour Pork)
Pork Chop w/ Salty Pepper
Seafood & Sizzling Rice
Sauteed Beef & Bitter Melon (a little bitter tast)
Deep Fried Chicken Filet
Steamed Fish
