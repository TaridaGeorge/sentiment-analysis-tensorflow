Located in a kinda beaten up strip center on Central Avenue, I wasn't expecting much from Lenny's.  As it turned out, I was very impressed.  Their burger was great, the price was very reasonable, the portion size was very generous, and the french fries were outstanding.  The 50's diner vibe makes the place feel like more than a fast food restaurant.   Next time I am in the area, I'll be coming back!
