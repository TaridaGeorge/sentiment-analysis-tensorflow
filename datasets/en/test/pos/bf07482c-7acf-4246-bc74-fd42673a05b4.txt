this place has all the requisite pieces of a wonderful neighborhood coffee shop.  decent brew, baristas who know how to pull a good shot, yummy food and snacks, and a welcoming, peaceful environment. 

if you want something sweet, try the french toasts - they will blow your mind.  ooey, gooey goodness in the form of homemade vanilla bourbon creme.  the savory stuff is good, too, from the burritos to the potatoes, and the lunch sandwiches are all pretty tasty.

i never would've thought we needed another coffee shop in downtown phoenix, but this place has its own character that makes it just as appealing as anywhere else.   yay!
