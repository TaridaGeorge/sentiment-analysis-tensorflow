I have been eating at this place since it first opened and we could walk over from school at lunch. Recently returned to Scottsdale from being out of state for a few years and it is every bit as good as I remember. Sure it takes a little longer than other places and it costs a little bit more but that is the price you pay for a superior product.
In the past I always went with my standard of pepperoni and mushrooms but recently I had their pesto pizza with chicken. Very very good. 
I always have a mental debate between nypd and grimaldis but I would say they are both on par. Will be back soon....
