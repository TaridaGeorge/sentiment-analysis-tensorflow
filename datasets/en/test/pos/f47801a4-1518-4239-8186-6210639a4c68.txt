Vincent's remains my all time favorite. It's been ten years since I have been here but the quality is the same. The spinach salad had warm sauteed mushrooms and bacon with a balsamic reduction all in perfect proportions. The duck confit wasn't on the menu. No problem. Vincent prepared it anyway and is was to die for. The brown sauce was perfection. Then, just when you are ready to cry uncle out comes the souffles and chocolate bombs. Spoon in a little creme anglais and you have gone to gastronomic heaven. A comprehensive wine list that might be weighted a little too much on the high end on the French side but plenty of good California choices in the affordable range. This is a very special restaurant with a world class chef that is a treasure known to all Valley of the Sun natives. Don't miss it.
