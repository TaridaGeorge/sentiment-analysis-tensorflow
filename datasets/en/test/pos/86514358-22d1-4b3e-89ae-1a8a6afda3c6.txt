So, I've never reviewed a grocery store, but this place was AMAZINGGGGG. 

As a guest from out of town, I was stalking up on snacks for my visit to Phoenix, and I found myself pleasantly surprised in Safeway. My first stop, the deli counter. I was able to try samples of several salads and deli cheeses and the customer service was excellent. Around the corner was the cheese guy, tried a few gourmet cheeses and ended up spending $15 on cheese/spread/crackers. 

I had so much fun in here, I'll be back. ...because... they let you sample wines on the weekend.
