The Herb Box is now officially my favorite place for brunch/lunch.  The service is great, everyone from the hostess to the waiter to the busser who filled my water was friendly and helpful.  The food is fresh and delicious.  I had the Market Street BLT which has egg, prosciutto, arugala, tomato and ricotta on brioche.  It was amazing!  My friend ordered the Cinnamon Buckwheat pancakes with honey butter and they were really good too.  Can't wait to come back and try something else!
