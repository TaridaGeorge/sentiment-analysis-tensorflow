I've been to Shady's twice, the first time a guy tried to sell me acid at 6:00pm and proceeded to challenge my friend and I to a pool match.  I don't do drugs and I certainly can't play pool to save my life so we declined both offers. 
Fast forward three years later to a more pleasant experience. This place is hip without the obnoxious hipsters. It's small with a neighborhood feel although I wouldn't consider this a dive bar. The juke box is stocked with good tunes, there's a patio for smokers and the drinks are cheap.  It's also really clean (hence the dive status denial) and they advertise a free ride home on Fridays and Saturdays although I didn't get the details on that.
