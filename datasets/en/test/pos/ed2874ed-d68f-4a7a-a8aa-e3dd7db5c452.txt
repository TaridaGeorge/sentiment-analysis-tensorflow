Inside of an airport, this is without a doubt the best burger I've ever had. Outside of an airport, it's in my top 5 of all time. Yes, I said it...this shit is the real deal.  I didn't try the fries or milkshake, but I can attest that this place is worth getting to, no matter how far you have to walk through this airport...do yourself a favor and do it.
