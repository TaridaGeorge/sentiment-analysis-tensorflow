I didn't even know this location was there... score! We were leaving the mall on a Saturday morning, just before lunchtime and saw this BWW. We went in, got a seat at a table near the bar and were promptly greeted. We ordered the fried pickles (my fav) and I had a chicken wrap. Yum. 

The location was very clean and since it was a Saturday, they had a bunch of different NCAA football games on the TVs. Another group of people requested that one of the big TVs be changed to a specific game and they changed it within seconds. 

Would definitely go back.
