Wow. Just... wow. Wow! 

I came here for a wedding rehearsal dinner and the experience was incredible. I was in a large party and we ordered damn near one of everything on the menu and every single thing I tasted I wanted more of. 
Tandoori chicken - served on a sizzling platter with seared vegetables and fall-off-the-bone tender. Had a delicious, yet mild, flavor, perfect for those venturing into Indian food for the first time. Vegetable korma is my absolute favorite. It's like a thick sauce you can eat over rice or by itself with chunks of potato in it. Very flavorful. Chicken Vindaloo is a little spicier but doesn't kill your tastebuds with heat. The spice definetly enhances the flavors in the dish. Sop it all up with rice, or garlic naan and special naan. Sooo good!
