Love the interactive, take as many samples as you please, style fro-yo joints.  This one is the best around.  It has the creamiest and least watery fro-yo.  They also rotate flavors often.  The place is packed every time we go and is filled with families, seniors, youngsters, and college students.  With In n Out next door, it is like a food Mecca that people migrate from all over to partake in the goodness.  We're kind of obsessed, tread cautiously.
