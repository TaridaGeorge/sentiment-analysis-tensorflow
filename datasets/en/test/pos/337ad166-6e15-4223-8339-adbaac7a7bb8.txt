This park is awesome! First of all .... SHADE! they have designed the spacious play area to have tons of shade which makes a huge difference, and you can tolerate bringing your kids out midday without worrying about sunburn or heatstroke (ok, it is still hot but you get my drift)... The merry go round and train rides are fun and very affordable. They keep the park clean, it is very safe and they have a lot of different play equipment for variety and different ages and it is all very well maintained. I have been there on days where there are very few people and weekends when it is packed - and it never has felt too crowded. There is a lot of space for people to spread out and enjoy themselves.

I give it two very big thumbs up!
