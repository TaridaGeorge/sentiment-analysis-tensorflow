I LOVE the decor of the store!  It's very cute.  There's a wide range of flavors of cake pops and cupcakes and they are always coming up with new ones.  My favorite is the Red Velvet cake pops.  They are so moist and just one is enough for me, but my fiance could eat about 6 before he'd be done!  I don't eat that much sugar and can only handle about half of a cupcake, but if I'm going to eat a cupcake, these are the kind I would want to spend my money on.  They are exactly what I expect out of a cupcake... decadent, sweet, flavorful, moist, and an absolute treat.
