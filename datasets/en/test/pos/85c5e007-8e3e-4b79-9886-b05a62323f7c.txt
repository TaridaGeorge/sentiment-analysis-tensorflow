My wife and I just stopped by for the first time and really enjoyed the service and products they have. We bought the Milky Ranch Beef ribeye's and really look forward to trying them. I love the fact that a lot (not all) of their products are local. We also walked the grounds and it looked like the animals are treated just fine. We look forward to continuing to shop there.
