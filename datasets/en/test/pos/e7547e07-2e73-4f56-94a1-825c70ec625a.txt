Don't you just like people that are happy about what they're doing?  It's probably because they eat there!  If you find your self shopping at the Rack in Chandler, this is an excellent meal stop.  Order the delicious standards of Pad Thai, Pineapple Fried Rice and Satay medium to slightly hot, you'll still taste all the wonderful food and that winter cold will just wanna leave :)  Live long and prosper Thai Cafe...
