The thing that I truly love about Deseo is that the kitchen obviously treasures salt and seasoning. Each wonderful dish we enjoyed was properly seasoned, either with salt, white soy, chiles and the like. The ceviches were all amazingly fresh and balanced...great citrus, awesome garnishes and nice heat when necessary. The empanada, impossibly tender filled with moist duck ropavieja, and the loup de mer was succulent and well dressed.

The cocktails are also very strong in quality and craftsmanship. Caprihnias are my favorite here, but they're most known for the mojitos...which I can attest to their great balance as well.

If you can't tell, I had a great experience here tonight and the other times I ate here as well. Check it out.

The chocolate cigar for desert us gimmicky, but pretty damned solid.
