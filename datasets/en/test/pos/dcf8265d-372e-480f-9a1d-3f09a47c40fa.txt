This place needs to not be such a secret. I have been looking for a place like this since Glendale closed down many of their shops and after coming back from Lake Mary Fl where the entire town has these little delightful specialty stores. What a wonderful adventure in the Secret Village's 6 little specialty shops. Think Coomers meets Jootenhoops. I loved their Mark Roberts collection and their unique teacher gifts. The staff here were incredible. Another reason to shop here, "Buy Local". Their 6 shops are themed for Cooking/kitchen, kids, pets, man cave, and collectables. They also do a once a month vendor sale. Amazingly, they do not charge the vendors to participate either. This place needs to expand. Thank you to the lovely folks I talked to today and my new found holiday treasures.
