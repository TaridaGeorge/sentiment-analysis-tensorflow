This is honestly my favorite place to get ice cream.  They make their own ice creams and sorbets. Because of this they are able to experiment with new flavors and combinations.....chipotle bacon, anyone? Some flavors are out there and some are closer to home, but all are rich, decadent, and delicious. Just talking about it is making me crave their Toffee Banoffee Sundae (which is a favorite of Alton Brown from the food network...in case you didn't know.)
