I love wildflower bakery.  Fresh baked bread, a good handful of delicious vegetarian options, and a friendly staff.  I'm a frequent patron and have had lunch, dinner and breakfast from this establishment.  Their breakfasts are all incredible (however, for hang over food, stick to fili b's,  this place flirts with a healthy breakfast), their salads are savory and the sandwiches are great.  The Walnut cream butternut squash ravioli is to DIE for.  Plus, plenty of bread for sopping up extra sauce to boot!
