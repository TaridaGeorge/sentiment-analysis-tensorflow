Love ethnic? Already tried Thai, Moroccan and Tandoori? Looking for a new culinary adventure? (Isn't that a lot of question marks?)

Then might I suggest a visit to Mi Cocina, Mi Pais, for a culinary tour of Ecuador, along with its southerly neighbors, Colombia and Peru. 

Mi Cocina, Mi Pais is a cheerful, mango-painted little corner in a Phoenix strip mall. There's only a handful of tables, so you may need to plan to wait or order to take-out.

There are plenty of familiar-ish dishes, such as tacos and tamales. 

But to really get the full impact of the restaurant, but you should try one of the more unique choices here. Such as, shrimp and plantains, ceviche, or aji chile wrapped in banana leaf. 

More reasons to visit? (And more question marks?) The portions are huge, and the prices very reasonable.
