Dr. Downs is the best Chiropractor I have ever been to, and his entire staff is great as well. I have a pretty active lifestyle and anytime I get aches, pains, or sports related injuries, the first thing I do is go see Dr. Downs. Without fail, he and his staff get me back to being pain free in a very short time, and also provide helpful tips, stretches, and information for avoiding those pains or injuries in the future. I also did allergy treatment there, and for the first time in my life am no longer dependent on daily allergy medications.
