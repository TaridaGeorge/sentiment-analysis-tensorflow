This has been my corner store for years. 20 years ago it was Manuel's. It still has that great small town store feel. And great fountain drinks. This is a great highlight of the community, I am happy to have grown up a mile from this store, Growing up I have seen some celebrities film movies there, Alan Alda, Luke Perry, Lilly Tomlin, Great place.
