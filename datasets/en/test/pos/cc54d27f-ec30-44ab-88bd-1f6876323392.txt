Cheesecake Factory I love you. I love you. I love you.

I have tried every single thing on the menu. You heard me. EVERY. SINGLE. THING. (Okay, not including the new hibachi menu. That is a brand new page added recently)

It was all good. Mostly great. But if about 90% of your 1,000,000,000 menu items are awesome - you deserve 5 stars from me.

PS - Please clean your bathroom more frequently. This might knoock you down a star.
