We go here every year during our annual jaunt to Glendale Glitters. It's owned by a very friendly Polish family that always make me smile. One year, one of the daughters had a fake baby and must have been "playing mommy" for a school class. It kept crying and the whole family kept taking turns rocking and feeding the baby while acting like nothing unusual was going on. I told you that make me smile! 

Every time I go there, I am sure to get the pierogi as it's not to be missed. But please don't go there during Glendale Glitters because it's so hard to get a table during the festivites and I really want to get a seat this time.
