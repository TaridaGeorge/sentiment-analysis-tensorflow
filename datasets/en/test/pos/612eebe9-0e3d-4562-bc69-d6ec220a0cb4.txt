Food and Service were excellent!

Went this morning for the first time and was  impressed.  Great coffee with plentiful refills which is very important in a breakfast location for me.  A restaurant that shall remain unnamed lost my business due to this.

  Everyone loved what they ordered, I had the quiche Lorraine and it was creamy, cheesy, very  flavorful with an amazing crust.  My mother in law had the Croque and was crazy about it .   Cute patio area and we saw someone had a dog with them.  

The chocolate croissant had me written all over but I was full from my meal.  New place for weekend breakfast with the dog, absolutely!
