I'm surprised at the negative reviews. Granted, I have only been to The Strand once, but I received great service and great food. Their happy hour specials are amazing. I got the best burger I've ever had in Arizona, along with delicious parmesean garlic fries and a beer, all for $10 plus tip. Truly a great deal, especially for happy hour.
