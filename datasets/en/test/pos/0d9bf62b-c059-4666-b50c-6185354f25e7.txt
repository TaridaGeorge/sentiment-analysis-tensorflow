Just tried thus place for the first time after buying a Localdines certificate, and it was fabulous!  Great decor and very friendly, helpful staff.  Our server had great recommendations and wow, was the food good!  I had the grilled vegetarian burrito with the cream sauce and it was definitely one of the best veggie burritos I've ever eaten!  My boyfriend had the blue corn enchiladas, and he about licked his plate clean!  We will definitely go back!
