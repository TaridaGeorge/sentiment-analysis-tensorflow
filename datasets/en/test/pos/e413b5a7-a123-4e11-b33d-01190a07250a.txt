Amazing donuts! Seriously, the best donuts I have ever had in my life. And, their jalapeno and ham croissants are worth making the drive from Sacramento for. We went there three times during a week long trip to Scottsdale after reading the reviews on Yelp. Worth the 20-minute drive every time. Bosa Donuts, we will miss you!!!
