I love this place!  It gets pretty busy after 6 most nights, if you can get there before then you can beat the rush.  I have had the pizza, regular burger, ahi tuna sandwich, the bbq pork.  Can't really go wrong with most things here.  I want to try out their breakfast menu sometime.  Definitely check this place out, worth the time and money.
