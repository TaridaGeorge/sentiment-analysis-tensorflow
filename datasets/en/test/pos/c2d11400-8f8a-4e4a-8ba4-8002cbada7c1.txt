I just found this great new place to have a warm soup bowl in our cold AZ winter.   I had a delicious  sourdough bread bowl and when I asked where the bread was from  I found out that they get there bread from my favorite bakery Bread Connection located in Chandler.  I will be back as this is close to my office and it is a great new place in North Chandler.  Our family will be back within a week as the menu is great!
