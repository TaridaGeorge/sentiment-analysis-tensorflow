My husband and children go there often.  It is convienient and entertaining.  We enjoy the Tue night sliders!  They are the best in town!  Kids like the sausage pizza.  The service is great and managers always are quick to help out and assure us if there ever is an issue, that it gets resolved.  There is plenty of room to watch ANY sports...several TVs to choose from!  We will refer...actually have referred and our friends love it.!   Thanks
