This place is the BEST!  My wife and I tried the Pad thai and the seafood noodle soup, and also the jungle curry..  all Thai hot.. YUMM.  on a different visit i tried the beef GUAY TEOW NAAM soup..Oh my, I really liked the broth, very nicely layered with flavor. I would have to say this is a great noodle soup, with a  thai twist..
