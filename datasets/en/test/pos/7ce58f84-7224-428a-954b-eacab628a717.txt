Dr. Pease made my office visit very pleasurable and I felt at home.  The office's hygienist, Roxanne, was very knowledgeable as well with great cleaning tips.. Dr. Pease brings professionalism and top shelf service to the table, which makes for a great decision when choosing your dentist. Once again, another timely appointment.  I would highly recommend.
