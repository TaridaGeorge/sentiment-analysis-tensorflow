This Sprint store is a lot like other Sprint stores but it has better music! Mike S and Chuck helped me transfer contacts from my old Palm to my new Evo and I was out in less than 20 minutes.  With such a simple request, I didn't even have to sign-in and wait. :)

They also have a self-serve kiosk so you can quickly pay your phone bill.

See ya there!
