I am giving 5 stars!  great food and service and all for a great price!  I came to their opening/Christmas party and got to taste a lot of their food then which was amazing.  I have since been for lunch and dinner a few times and have never been disappointed.  Their soups are always amazing and love their bruschetta.  They also have a very similar happy hour as postino's $5 glasses of wine till 5pm and there is plenty of space along with a nice patio for when the weather gets nice.  You should come and check it out... support our local restaurants in Arizona:)
