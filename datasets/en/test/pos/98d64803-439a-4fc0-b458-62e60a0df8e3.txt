Great place to grab some cheap sushi on the quick for takeout or eat-in.  They have some good combo deals during the week with prices that can't be beat.  I have eaten here for years and they are always consistently good and you will not be disappointed.  I give it 5 stars even though it is a hole in the wall because it always tastes great.

I highly recommend you try out their Las Vegas roll if you are a fan of them - I haven't found any other sushi place that has a better one.  They include it in a Friday special along with a spicy tuna roll and miso soup.   I really like their Alaskan Roll which has salmon covering a spicy tuna roll - delicious and not too spicy.  Very good seaweed salad and unagi sauce.
