I wasn't expecting such good food from here.
I got the gyro pita (pita on the side).
Gyro was perfectly spiced, succulent and delightful.
Pita was delicious (I made my wife taste it because I'm gluten free)
Lettuce and tomatoes were fresh
Seasoned fries were to perfection.
Tzatziki sauce was perfect and herby

Overall exact portioning and extraordinary taste.
Service was 5 of 5 - quick, pleasant and helpful.
Food quality was also 5 of 5
Pricing was great too!
My only regret is not coming here sooner!

Word from a chef - eat her now!
