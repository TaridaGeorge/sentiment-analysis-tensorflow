Nick and his family own Brothers pizza and they've been there for 8 years.  It's a great restaurant that offers much more than pizza.  The friendly employees are great and while not all of them know me by name, when I call with our order, which is usually the same and give them my name, the all recognize me.  And they all recognize me when I walk in.  I'm not quite Norm from Cheers but it's a close second.

The pizza is great and the Sicilian is awesome.  We looked for a long time for a great pizza place and found it at brothers.  If you are looking to try something new, be sure to give them a try.  They are at the corner of 67th Ave and Happy Valley Road, just down the plaza from Frys and Subway.

You won't go away hungry.
