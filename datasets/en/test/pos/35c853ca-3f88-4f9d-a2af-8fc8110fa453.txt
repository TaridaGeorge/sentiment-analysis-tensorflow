I really loved this hotel.  If you like the whole rat pack/ vintage theme with a dash of class...this is all you.  Service was great, friendly, accommodating. Valet was awesome...quick, friendly, helpful.  When I stayed there they even had a Bloody Mary do it yourself table set up...do you even know how many different ways you can make a bloody mary...one word for you.. Salami.  It was just great, I was right at home, and the pool is a blast.

The place was clean...which is a must

Caf√© ZuZu was the so cute, food was good, we ate there for breakfast.  My bloody mary from the bar was delicious.  

The bar also had a selection of cigars which was very convenient for my boyfriend.

What can I say...I'm in love...I'm a Valley Ho type of gal
