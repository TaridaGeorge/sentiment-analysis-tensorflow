Wow! This place was REALLY good Thai food! As usual, I will always base my experience on my go-to dish: Pad Thai. This place did not miss! It was very tasty and fresh and the service was excellent. The prices are acceptable, but they do have some lunch specials that we happened to just miss during our visit. The portions are large and again, the flavors were excellent. Both myself and my wife enjoyed ourselves and will return soon.
