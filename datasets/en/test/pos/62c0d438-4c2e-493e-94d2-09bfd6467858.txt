Excellent food and service.  I have been to many Hawaiian BBQs (and even have family members who run a few stores of another chain in Southern California), and this particular location definitely deserves 5 stars in my opinion.  The food was fresh, tasted great, the portions were good sizes for the prices.  The hostess was very friendly to myself and my kids, and this location is very clean.  

I had the teriyaki chicken mini bowl and my husband had the seafood plate with fish, shrimp, and BBQ beef.  We were very impressed with the quality, freshness, and flavors of everything we received.

We will definitely keep this on the list of quality family friendly restaurants in Buckeye.
