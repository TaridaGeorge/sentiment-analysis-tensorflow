I go through the drive through here every morning before work and am always greeted with the best customer service. The girls here usually recognize me and my order, and are always eager to chat while my drink is being made. When I visit other Starbucks I immediately notice the difference in customer service, not that the other ones are particularly bad, but the people at this location are 10x's better. Ive never had an order messed up, in fact I've gotten offered more free drinks here than anywhere else! Definetly a clean location, great customer service, and an all around good place.
