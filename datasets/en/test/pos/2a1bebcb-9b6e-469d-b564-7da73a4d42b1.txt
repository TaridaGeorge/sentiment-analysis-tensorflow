I love love love this place. The pastries are divine. This really is the only place to get true French pastries. I've had several of the macaron flavors and of course, the famous chocolate croissant that warranted a several page feature in the Republic.

The food is great too. It's slightly more expensive than other soup/salad/sandwich lunch cafes, but the quality really makes it a bargain. A lot of the ingredients are organic and/or local. And the attention to detail makes it all plain delicious. The gruyere roll that comes with the tomato orzo soup is feathery light. The brioche bread on the caprese salad is buttery and crisp. The smoked salmon that's sometimes on their special is really good. 

If somebody forced me to choose a favorite restaurant in Tempe...maybe even all Arizona, this would be it.
