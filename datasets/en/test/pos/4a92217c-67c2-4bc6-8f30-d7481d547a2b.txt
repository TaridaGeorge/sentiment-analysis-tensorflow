My wife and I went on Yelp's Date Night at the AZ Science Center during the final weekend for the Van Gogh exhibit.  What a fantastic experience!

The Van Gogh exhibit was amazing.  Kudos to Sensory4 (the organization that created it) for doing a great job of telling the story of Vincent Van Gogh's life through only his paintings, quotes from his letters to his brother Theo, and music.  It was very moving.  Van Gogh was further cemented in my heart as my favorite painter.

In addition to seeing Van Gogh, Yelp provided some light snacks, a scavenger hunt, and entrance to most of the museum and the Planetarium.  Thank you, Yelp, for arranging this.  it was the 2nd Yelp event my wife and I attended and can't wait to see more.
