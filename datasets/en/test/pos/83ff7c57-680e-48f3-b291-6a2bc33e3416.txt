No way, I get to bust the cherry with the first review! Phoenix Yelpers, hello???

The scenery rocks from the patio. Intimate wine room for a happening get together. Cool bar when you first come in the door. The dining room is open with a fire pit in the middle. There are way too many places trying to be Scottsdale or the New Sedona, but this place keeps its Southwestern roots. 

Dishes that rock the house. Lobster tortilla soup with cilantro creme, yowza! Try something different with your nachos, pan roasted ahi & crab with white cheese and mango salsa. The chili lime pork tenderloin is another fave, with sun dried fruit salsa and green chili mac & cheese that kinda screwed up my world. Why have plain jane when you can have her hot cousin Lupe?
