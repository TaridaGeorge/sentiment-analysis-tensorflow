I just got my vehicle back from the Car Shop.  I have been taking it there for years.  The technician always communicates to me about my vehicle and the staff is always friendly, helpful (explaining to me what needs to be done on my vehicle) and the owner is amazing.  He dropped what he was doing to take me back to work when I had told them I would wait but something came up.  I can't say enough good things about this place.  

I have referred a number of my clients here and some have traveled as far as Gilbert and the West side for the type of professionalism and service they have gotten here.

Pricing is always good.  If there were 10 stars they would get that!
