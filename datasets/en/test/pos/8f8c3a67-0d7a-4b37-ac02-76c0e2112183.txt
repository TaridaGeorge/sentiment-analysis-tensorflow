great job everytime i come here. it's amazing to watch those guys (and girls) descend upon your car to clean it. my little old beater truck comes out smelling and looking like new (minus the busted front bumber, the missing tire flare and the innumerable dents, scratches, bumps and bruises). i can just feel her "smiling" for being so clean and shiny!

for a drive-thru, no frills, it's only 4 bucks (but there is no drying or anything fance) and for a simple wash with hand dry and interior cleaning with tire cleaning, about 16 bucks. they'll do a detail job, costing up from there.
