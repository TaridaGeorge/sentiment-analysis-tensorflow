Love this cute boutique hotel. The bed is comfy with lots of pillows, and the room has great style and function. I love that there is a Keurig in every room to make a quick cup of tea or coffee. My favorite part is the night light scented oil warmer! I enjoyed my stay here. The staff were so friendly and courteous. I enjoyed getting in the huge hot tub all by myself! I felt like I was living like a celebrity! Will definitely be back...you should check it out too!
