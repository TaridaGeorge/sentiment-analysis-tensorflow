Jess' fiancee here. Now, where to start...

First thing that came out was the house made limoncello. For $5, it looks like an awfully small drink. But, holy s***, does it hit the spot. The waitress wasn't lying when she said it was basically "everclear and lemon zest." One of those, and my drink tab was fulfilled for the night. 

I ordered the Bocca Trio (sans olives,) and I've got to say, it was the best pizza I've ever had. The meat was perfectly salty, the texture of it almost blended into the cheese. The sauce was delicately applied, and the crust had a nice, light char. There wasn't a single thing about it that wasn't pizza ecstasy.

If you haven't been here, please, go. 

Seriously, get off of yelp and go!
