My first experience with Culver's was absolutely fantastic.  The food was very tasty and the atmosphere was friendly.  The girl (sad to say I forgot her name) demonstrated one of the best customer service experiences I had every had.  I wished I was fortunate to have hired her.  Culver's keep up the great work and give the Culver's Crew a raise for a job well done.
