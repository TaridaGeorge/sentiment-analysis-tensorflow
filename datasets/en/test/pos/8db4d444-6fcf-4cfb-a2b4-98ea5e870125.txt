I want to re-review this place every time I try something new here!  I think the chai tsoynami changed my life last week.  But maybe I'm only saying that because I am lost in a post chocolate peanutbutter cupcake high. So rich.  So moist. Dare I say it?  BETTER than any non-vegan cupcake I've ever had.  Utter decadance.
