A few people had told me to check this place out, I was reluctant since I am still on my parlor pizza kick.  After trying their amazing fries (sounds weird for a pizza place but are awesome), looking and drinking through their great beer collection and trying 4 different types of pizza I am now hooked!

I went in the middle of the summer and could not brave myself to sit outside, it must have one of the best views of camelback (despite the chase bank and telephone pole in the foreground) that I have seen at any place and their deck looks awesome!!!

The staff was great and knowledgeable about not only the food but the beer and wine.  Do yourself a favor and check it out.
