I've been lucky enough to dine at Carly's when visiting PHX. The food is awesome! Great local ingredients and attention to detail. In addition, the owner is about as generous and gracious as they come. She agreed to help me provide delish snacks to some local friends after the birth of their little one. I am located in FL, and it meant the world to me. Thank you Carly, and you amazing team!
