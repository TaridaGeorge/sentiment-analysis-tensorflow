Always a good idea. This hotel bar has a life of it's own, beyond the resort.

I've enjoyed my stay at Troon North a few times and always find myself at the bar...but not just for the drinks. This hotel watering hole is a destination for more than just hotel guests. A place to see and be seen pouring a decent drink at Four Seasons prices. But you get what you pay for.

Beautiful people and views fill your eyes and the quick service, even from a packed house, will keep your glass filled. Onyx is great for a date night, pre-funk or to close the house down. I suggest all the above.
