I am beyond impressions with Unique Vintage Chic! I went in searching for my wedding and bridesmaids' jewelry and was blown away the boutique's selection, authenticity and prices. 

The owner is enthusiastic and has a deep passion for vintage chic, and it shows. She held me pick out beautiful and in-budget gems for my big day. She even held my merchandise until I found all the perfect pieces.

Each piece of jewelry is one of kind and looks very expensive, but the prices are extremely reasonable. The store is bright, airy and welcome and the owner makes you feel right at home. 

I highly recommend you experience this gem full of gems in the Borgata, it's truly an experience to remember.
