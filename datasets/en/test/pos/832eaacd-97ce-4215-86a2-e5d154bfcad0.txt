I love this place for eating and happy hour. One of my favorite happy hour items is the BAKED GOAT CHEESE. Just eat it! The goat cheese is lovely, creamy and has toasted almonds on it. I also love the Orange Slice Martini. The best thing about the martini is the juice is fresh and made in the bar. 

Service has been good every time that I have gone and I love seating in the bar area. Music is also very good. They play a mix of classic rock and popular music of today.
