our tummies were so empty and we were getting ornery from furniture shopping and look there...fresh mint!
the sign said something about fresh and healthy food and our other options were greasy pizza, chinese, or fast food. the place is small but busy. very bright atmosphere and the owner was full of zeal. 
i ordered the stuffed tomato dish and she the papaya salad. both prepared made to order and did not disappoint. 

the crunchy and cool, sweet, yet sour salad was fabulouso, and then our hot dish, the tomatoes with brown rice were amazing. we were full after 3/4 of the way but our mouths craved more so we cleaned both plates and were off again to deal with furniture salespeople. 

very reasonable at 25 bucks for two. we wanted to try deserts as they all looked tasty but belly too full.
