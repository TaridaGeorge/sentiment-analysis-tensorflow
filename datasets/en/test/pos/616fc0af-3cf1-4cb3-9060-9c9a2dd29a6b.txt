This park is amazing!! Well kept, clean and lots of fun. My son is really into trains now. He wants to ride them,play, eat, bathe, sleep with them!
The cost of the train ride and carousel is very reasonable and kids younger than 3 ride for free. There's a fairly big play area, stagecoach to explore, a small train museum and a water play area.  The eating options are lacking but you can pack food and have a nice picnic under the trees. We saw several birthday parties and one family reunion going on.

They also have free outdoor concerts but by that time my kids are exhausted:)
