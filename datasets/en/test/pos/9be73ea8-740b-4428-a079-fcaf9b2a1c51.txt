This place gets extra points because of Tim ! They got throwed rolls, strawberry storm in mason jar, and peanuts on the floor. Once in a while, you gotta hit up the roadhouse and tie one on.

Oops! I forgot to mention that the food was also delightful! I asked for a roumalade to go with the fish and chips I ordered and they did not know what I meant but they were so helpful.  Turns out that they do have it but they just call it sauce.
