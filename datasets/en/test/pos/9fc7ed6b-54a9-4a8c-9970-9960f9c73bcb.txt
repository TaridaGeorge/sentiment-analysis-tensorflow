Well, Michael may not exactly want me to write that he has given away his knowledge and services for free but...I feel compelled to write about it because it gives you insight to his belief and value system as a business owner.

I have not bought a computer from Michael (though I think the service package that he offers with each new computer is OUTSTANDING).  But he has given me so much advice as a new business owner/entrepreneur: from advertising, to computers, Facebook and social media, from bartering and funding sources, to organizations and people to know.

He is a wealth of knowledge, and he is so happy to share it all because he believes in the local business owner.

THAT is why I love RedSeven!
