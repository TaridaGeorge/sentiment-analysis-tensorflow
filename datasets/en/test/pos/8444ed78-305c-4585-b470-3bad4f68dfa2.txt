All items on menu are full of flavor.  You can eat inside or outside. Take home is available too. You get a ton of food for the money. I love the matcha(drink). It's the absolute BEST.  Owners husband and wife, so cool, my first time in I was looking for something tasty, new with a good feeling after I ate it.  I asked what do you recommend for a rookie.  Chicken pho soup, spring rolls. That was two years ago. Kid friendly too.
