I've only been here once but I really want to go back. Sadly it's a bit of a hike for me. 

I got the Betty Boop and the Stupid Fries. Both were excellent. Be warned that the Stupid Fries look horrible, but they taste amazing so order them and dig in. The drinks are served in mason jars and the whole place feels and looks like you're in someone's home having a great meal. 

Hopefully I can go back soon because it was absolutely worth the drive.

Update: Went back and they've remodeled. Food was still amazing and now the restaurant is also pretty great looking. Can't wait to go back again.
