Got to hand it to these guys - they run a decent operation. The service, food, ambience is 'just right'. I've sat outside on all my 10 or so visits, with one exception in the dead of winter; the patio is so pleasant despite facing into a parking lot.  The inside looks charming and delightful too. I find it hard to steer far from the lamb chops - so few places sell them!  They are always delicious.  Very un-pretentious, while still being classy. Not your typical Scottsdale over-done setup.
