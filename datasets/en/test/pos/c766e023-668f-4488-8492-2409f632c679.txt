Spinato's,

I love your gluten-free crust. It is the best I have ever had. When it is combined with your delicious sauce, cheese, and fresh basil to top it off, there is nothing else I would rather eat. 

Thank you for the friendly service and the minimal wait, even on a Friday night. I also really appreciate your low-key atmosphere and mellow music. 

I will definitely see you soon, and until then I won't eat anyone else's pizza. Nothing could compare to you. 

Forever yours
