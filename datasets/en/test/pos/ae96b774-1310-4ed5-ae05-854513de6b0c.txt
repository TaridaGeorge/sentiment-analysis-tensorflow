I had my first Which Wich experience in Dallas back in 2006. Imagine my excitement last week when we found this Which Wich outside Jobing.com Arena. I love the concept of this place. There are over 50 different sandwich combinations at Which Wich. You pick up a bag and mark options with a Sharpie to get a sandwich customized to your liking. Your sandwich is served to you in the bag when it's complete. All the subs are $5. I love the banana shake at Which Wich also. It really hits the spot. This time I chose a chicken parmigiana sandwich that was really good. 

This Which Wich was very clean, had Phoenix related vibes on the wall, and a friendly staff. Vibes are the large circular pieces of art on the wall. They can be different at every Which Wich location. It's simply a fun place to eat.
