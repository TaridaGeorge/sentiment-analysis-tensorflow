This is hands down my favorite church. I've never been to a church that gives you such a great feeling, from the min. you enter to the min. you leave you get a feeling that's indescribable. He 9:15 Sun. mass is the best, the music is great and very upbeat, not your typical "church" music at all. They have a great children's program. Everyone is friendly and make you feel like you've known them forever. They also serve great donuts, coffee and juice after church.:)
