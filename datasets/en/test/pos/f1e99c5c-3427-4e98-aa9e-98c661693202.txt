We LOVE this place.  We found it by chance when we came last year to look for a house.
Indian food can be VERY buttery and fat laden...AKA Delicious!  Bombay Spice adds a "healthier" flair to Indian food that we love.  You can get things with lettuce wraps instead of rice.  My wife likes that their dishes are less greasy than other restaurants (not to harp on them too much), but some can get that way just because the method you have to make the meat or sauce.
Check it out sometime.  The worst you can say is you didn't like it, but if you like Indian, I think you'll love Bombay Spice.
