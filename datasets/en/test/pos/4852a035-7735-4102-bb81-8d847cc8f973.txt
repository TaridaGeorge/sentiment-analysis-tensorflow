I have thought long and hard about this.
I have tried the French Onion Burger (FOB) 3 times now.

I say this:  It is the best burger I have ever had.

That is a very difficult ruling to reach, but I am ready for it.

I have a few other issues with the place;  
*  service seems preoccupied with life's other details and not totally "in the brand".
*  a few mis-steps from the kitchen (FOB #1 overcooked), (fries undercooked) - But in each case they made it right instantly.

The FOB is the best burger I have ever had.
