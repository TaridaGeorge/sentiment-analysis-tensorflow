This place is excellent. The staff is very helpful and sweet. The prices are very reasonable. I love the fact that you can pick and choose what flowers you want in your arrangement from the walk-in and they charge just by the flower... kinda like AJ's but less expensive. Or, of course, they can create one for you... and they are gorgeous, dense arrangements that last weeks and weeks. The shop is always decorated so creatively, it always inspires me! Every first friday you can stop by (for no cost) and learn how to arrange flowers. I love this place!
