Still the best Vietnamese food in town. For that matter, the best asian comfort food. Always a good meal. My wife and I hadn't been in almost six months (stupid diets) took a friend from out of town last night, and it was amazing... just like we remembered it. John (the owners son) and his wife Ha, remembered us, and asked us where we had been! LOVE THIS PLACE. This is a must try restaurant!
