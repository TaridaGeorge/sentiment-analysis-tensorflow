I had been craving ice cream. But not just any ice cream, or "cold stone" from near our house, but the real stuff. So I yelped what was good. I read Mary Coyle's was amazing. So we went, made the 20 minute drive and it was amazing!! I had not had ice cream like this in several years!! It is really cute inside, the style and the colors. I decided that next birthday or my dinner with bridesmaids woule be here. I willd efinitely be back!
