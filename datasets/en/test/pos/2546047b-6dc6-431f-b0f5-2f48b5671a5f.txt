I had an amazing evening. I started the night with a Pomegranate Margarita.This drink is unbelievable!!!. I also had an amazing shrimp in a lobster sauce Pizza with Spinach. The staff was friendly and I felt catered to.  I stayed 3 hours with a friend and the prices were reasonable. I will gladly recommend this restaurant for anyone and will continue to visit this location while in Phoenix.
