This review is based soley on the hot chocolate cookie pie with ice cream and the Belini drink... well, and my bartender who was amazing.

My friend who is a Phoenix local took me here to show off one of her favorite spots.

These two things would have me back over and over again.  We sat outside in the patio bar, chatted with our bartender, and sipped on belini's (a drink so strong that they are only allowed to sell 2 of them per drinker).  WOW!  It is a blend of several alcohols that hit the sweet tooth and the sweet spot!  Thank god I was NOT driving!

We had a blast here.
