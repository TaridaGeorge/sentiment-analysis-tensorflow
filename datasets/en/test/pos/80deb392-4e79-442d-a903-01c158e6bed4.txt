I have been going to La Fontanella for almost 10 years and it never disappoints!! I love the atmosphere--it's always cozy and comfortable and the staff is always very friendly and attentive.  Next time you want to splurge on some decadent homemade pasta this is the place to go.  I can't help getting the butternut squash ravioli everytime-- it is absolutely delicious!!  I have never had anything that I didn't like here.  La Fontanella definitely has the best italian in the city-- FIVE STARS!!
