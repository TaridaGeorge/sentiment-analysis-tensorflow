Arai pastry is so delicious!
ironically i come here not for the sweeties: confections, cakes, cookies, cremes, not being my style- but for their delicious savory treats! The breads they make here are top knotch, the various salty pastries are all worth exploring, the red bean one and the curry filled ones being my favorites. But the real deal, the Coup de gr√¢ce, the mamoth reason of what makes this little japanese pastry shop (in my mind) is their sandwhiches/ green tea shakes
that powerful one two punch of savory sagacity is what makes me want to live sometimes
yes yes
i find the world to be a better place with those items in my tummy
