My entire family is from the Philadelphia area, so we know cheesesteaks. All of us agree that Forefathers has the best cheesesteaks that any of us have had in Arizona-- they definitely rival the famous Pat's and Geno's cheesesteaks. The bread is fresh baked daily, the meat is great quality, and the portions are generous. Ask for their fry sauce on your sandwich (they'll put it on for you at no extra charge), and get a side of sweet potato fries to dip into the fry sauce, too. Mmm, food heaven!
