Cafe Lalibela is one of the best places I've ever found to get Ethopian food.  The food is all reasonably priced and they have a fantastic selection - lots of new things to try.  No utensils here - everything is eaten with injeera bread, which also adds to the unique experience.  They have fantastic teas here as well.
