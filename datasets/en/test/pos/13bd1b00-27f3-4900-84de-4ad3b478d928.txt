Dr Steve Hruby is one of a kind. He is extremely knowledgeable and very caring. I have been in and around the chiropractic community since 1978, and I can honestly say that he is my favorite chiropractor ever. He has a thirst for knowledge and is constantly improving on an already awesome base. In addition, his practice is run very efficiently and harmoniously. I highly recommend Kai Zen.
