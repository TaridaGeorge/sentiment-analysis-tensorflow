I just went there for the second time at this location - having been to the Scottsdale location twice as well.  I like the funky charm of the extremely small old house that appears to have several small (I'm sure not permitted!  :-) additions from over the years!...Oh my god I love this place!  This is what the fried chicken in my dreams tastes like.  I always get the 3 pieces with 2 waffles and it puts me into food bliss state.  The last time I went there was a decent wait outside with the other two dozen people attempting to have lunch - this time was better because it was late lunch - my favorite time anyway!  Awesome, fast friendly service, delicious Kool-Aid, fried chicken with waffles for a late lunch - dream come true experience.
