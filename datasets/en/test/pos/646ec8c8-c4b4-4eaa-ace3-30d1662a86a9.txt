Another new-to-me car, another hassle free loan from AZFCU.  I actually tried Desert Schools FCU first who quoted me an outrageous 12% rate!  Screw that!  Back to AZFCU, where in about an hour I had all the paperwork completed for my 7% loan and a check in my hands.

The only real drawback is that I can't pay the loan online.  Well, at least not from another bank account, my regular checking account is with Chase.  On their website, all you can do is check your loan balance and make a payment from another AZFCU account.  So this remains the last establishment for which I actually write a paper check.  Cute.
