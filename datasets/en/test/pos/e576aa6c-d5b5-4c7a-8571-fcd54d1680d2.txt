I consider myself a fried chicken connoisseur.  I make it often and whether I use panko, breadcrumbs or corn flakes, I know what is good.  This place is good.  As mentioned in an earlier review, they make each order fresh.  If you can manage to wait 5-10 mins (I call ahead) then you are in for a treat.  Not too greasy, perfectly crispy all white meat chicken fingers served with a variety of sauces.  I go for the buffalo and bleu cheese sauces on my chicken finger sandwich.

Also, the owner of this joint is obsessed with providing great customer service, a clean place, and even discounts if you refer a friend!
