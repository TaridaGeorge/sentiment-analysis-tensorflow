Olive and Ivy is a restaurant in downtown Scottsdale that features great food, a very extensive wine list, and an all around cool atmosphere.

Olive and Ivy has a better than average happy hour with good food and drink specials. I love the bruschetta, love the Fritto Misto (calamari, rock shrimp, zucchini), love the lamb meatballs, love the prosciutto, love the watermelon salad (not what you'd expect), love the sweet potato cannelloni, love the Maine Lobster Risotto, and love the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin.

Olive and Ivy has an indoor bar/lounge area and an awesome outside patio. Not only do they have a great wine selection, they also have a good selection of beers from Arizona, Europe, along with other domestic options. 

You can also grab a coffee, salad, or sandwich to go, from their marketplace.

Great food along with a great atmosphere gives Olive & Ivy five stars.
