OMG, where are the letters (or words) to describe how terrific the food is at this place???

Carolina's here was very busy during my first visit today, on this Saturday mid-afternoon.  I ordered a #2 Combo with a green tamale & a red enchilada, & added a hard shredded beef taco.  In good time, my order was ready, & it included a shredded lettuce salad (you use some of the sauce for dressing), & Spanish Rice & refried beans.

Let's cut right to the chase:  Every bite of this meal was absolutely 5 Stars, and so was the service & the pricing...  Â¡periodo!     :-))

#2 Combo $5.45, Shredded Beef Taco $1.80
