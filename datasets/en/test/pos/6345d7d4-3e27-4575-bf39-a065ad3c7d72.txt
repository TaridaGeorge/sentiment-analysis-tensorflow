Great looking location.  Good atmosphere, bar is a nice size, outdoor and indoor seating areas.  Get there early as they get packed in a hurry.

Service was excellent.  Nice mix of cocktails.  Food selection (there were six of us and no complaints) is pretty diverse and quality is excellent.  Prices I thought were very reasonable.

Definitely worth a return visit.
