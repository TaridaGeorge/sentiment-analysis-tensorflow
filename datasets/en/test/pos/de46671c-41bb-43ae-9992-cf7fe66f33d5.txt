'Tis the season! One of the things I enjoy most about the holidays is that as I peruse shops and come up with gift ideas, I usually find something for myself as well...("one for you, one for me.")...is that bad? Nah!!

All the same, Scottsdale Marketplace is a treasure chest full of decor and gift giving ideas. Its a large co-operative effort of designers and vendors that bring unique items to your home or neatly wrapped with a bow on top. If you're looking for a unique gift for any occasion - give yourself the gift of stopping by the Scottsdale Marketplace. You're guaranteed to walk out with not only the perfect "something" for someone special, but you're sure to find something that is perfect for you too!
