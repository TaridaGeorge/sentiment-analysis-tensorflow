Best airport restaurant that I have ever seen.  Something for everyone, my wife had an awesome salad, I had a Cuban sandwich, while my son had a wood-fired pizza.  Clean, affordable, and inexpensive.  They made a mistake on my Cuban and gave us a free red velvet cupcake.  An airport establishment that is concerned with customer service???  What a pleasant surprise.  If you are in this terminal, this is the place to be!
