I have had the unfortunate pleasure of dealing with this hospital many times for all 3 of my girls. EVERY TIME they are wonderful, caring, knowledgeable and comforting. I do not trust anybody else and even at 2 in the morning I will make the 30 mile drive all the way from Waddell just to have my children seen here. I cam not stress enough what a great place this is. Many thanks to all the employees that work so hard to give us the care that you do!!!!
