This has to be one of the best Happy Hours in all of Scottsdale. It goes until 7:00 in the bar area only and the food and prices are hard to beat. Most of the dishes are $5.00 and they are huge. One of my favorites is the chicken in lettuce cups which comes with a large bowl of the chicken and white crispy noodle and 4 large pieces of lettuce. another favorite are the Vietnamese Chicken Summer Rolls.They are not fried and are wrapped in a soy rice paper, You get 8 pieces and they are a decent size. Where else can you eat for $10.00 for 2 people without drinks. There are many  other choices on the menu including Ahi Ceviche, Calamari with Rock shrimp, Asian Nachos which are incredible, Duck Potstickers are just of the few of the 25 or so choices. You won;t be disappointed.
