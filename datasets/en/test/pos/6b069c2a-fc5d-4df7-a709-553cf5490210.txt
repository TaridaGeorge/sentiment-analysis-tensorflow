OH GOD!  The Savior of Scottsdale!  After eating at several places in Scottsdale which were all below average in my opinion (but all had good yelp reviews, mind you), this place saved the day on my last day there.  Grimaldi's definitely came through with a delicious NY Style Thin crust.  

We had a white pizza with garlic and added italian sausage, artichoke hearts and mushrooms and it was made to perfection.  The best pizza I've had in a long time!  This place is getting my 5 star seal of approval to help bump it up above the other places that had an overall 4 star rating and were crap!
