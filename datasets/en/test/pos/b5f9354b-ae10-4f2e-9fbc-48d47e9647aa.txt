I had lunch at Pita Shack for the first time today. I had this taste in my mouth for the creamy sauce and some pita meat. Whoah! Did I get what I wanted and more. Their gyro is DEE-LICIOUS! I think it was gone in under five minutes. I got the combo and they are generous with the fries, as well (which are crispy, yum!). 

I'm very excited to go back again and have some more. Dinner?
