First and foremost - DON'T BE SHOCKED BY THE LOCATION OR FIRST IMPRESSIONS! 
This place is awesome, has a great selection of drinks (especially root beers), and the value of the sandwiches is over the top! 
Don't forget to try the onion rings. They use their own breading made out of corn meal and spices. The amount of food you get is a great value. 
I travel the nation weekly, and will be visiting here again in the future.
