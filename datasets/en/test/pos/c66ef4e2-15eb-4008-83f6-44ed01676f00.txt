Avanti rocks. Simple. 

I went there for T-day Dinner (and I know, I'm ridiculously late in reviewing this place.) 
The turkey dinner thing they did was awesome. 
The waiters all speak Italian and called me & my mom Bella. 
Our waiter suggested great wines, a white for mom & red for me. Both lovely choices. 

The ambiance alone seriously piqued my curiosity, and I was excited to check it out. People talk about this place. As in, "Yeah, I'm going to Avanti."    "Oooh, Restaurant of Distinction!!"  It's like that. And I was NOT disappointed. Probably the most comfortable booth I've ever sat in. Strangely perfect for dining and staying comfortable at the same time. 

Even the bathroom was cool. They have little velcro covers for the the pipes under the sink. Talk about class. Yes I'm being sarcastic, but at the same time I DUG THEM!!!
