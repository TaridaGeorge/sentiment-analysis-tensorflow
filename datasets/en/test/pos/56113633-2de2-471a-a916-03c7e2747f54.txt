I think Sweet Pea Bakery could turn me into a "Cookie Monster." My friend and I sought out the amazing PB&J cookie today (imagine two peanut butter cookies with jelly/jam in the center like a sandwich), but I also got an Oatmeal, Apricot & Walnut cookie that was SO good. 

Don't worry - I shared with the folks back at work ... 

MUCH better than a candy bar from the Circle K.
