Super duper place in Historic Downtown! Service was excellent. No one in our party of 7 had  empty drink glasses. Then again, it was Monday night and there were probably only 2 other parties seated. Cheese Fondue was excellent, melty and creamy. I had the grilled cheese of the day. I don't remember what the cheese was, but it had chorizo in it, not just small chunks of it, but slices of it. I am in love with the Grilled Cheese of the Day concept. I would probably order it every time. I had the Korean pear salad to go with it: spicy arugula, pecans, Asian pears with a very light vinegarette. Prices were decent, atmosphere was classy, service was great! I would go back again...except I live in Surprise.
