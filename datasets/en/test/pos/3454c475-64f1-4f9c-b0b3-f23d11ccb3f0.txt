I went here because my new vision insurance covered Lens Crafters and this was close to my house.  I was so pleasantly surprised.  Not only was the doctor knowledgable and very nice, but the office manager there was AWESOME!!  She helped me navigate my insurance to get the most bang for my buck and when I screwed up and gave my regular debit card instead of my HSA card (forgot because we were laughing and chatting so much) she rerang everything the next day which included contacting my insurance to make sure it was resubmitted properly.  I would recommend this office to EVERYONE!  Great experience!
