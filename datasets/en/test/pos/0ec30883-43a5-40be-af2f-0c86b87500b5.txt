How have I not reviewed this place?  It is one of my favorites spots in Phoenix. It's one of the very few that I will say little about, other than to say that without question, you should eat there.  That's it. If you want a great meal, wonderful service, and super-cute decor, hit up Tuck Shop. Stop reading Yelp.com and go NOW!

(when you get there, try the gin and tonic. they make their own tonic water!)
