Solo is my favorite coffeehouse in Tempe, though I'll start out by admitting I seldom drink coffee. They have a great selection of loose leaf teas and will brew it for you plain or as a latte. I recommend the Toasty Almond as a latte or a Yerba Matte Latte.  Spicy Pear brewed plain with just a touch of honey is amazing, too.  When it comes to a coffee house, atmosphere is just as important as drinks, and Solo is a really nice place to spend time.  Free wi-fi, tons of outlets, a variety of seating, friendly baristas, good decor, diverse music, clean restroom, all that good stuff.  If you have been meaning to stop in, do, and you'll become a regular before you know it.
