Best sliders I've ever had! Too bad we stopped here on our last day in Scottsdale for lunch before driving back to CA. They have exotic meats and a creative menu. We tried the Wagyu, Turkey, Buffalo, and Short Rib. All were so good! Especially the Short Rib.. I would definitely drive back to AZ for that. They also have a different exotic meat every week. The day we went they had peasant but we weren't interested, I wanted to try their elk or rabbit but I guess we'll just have to go back for those!
