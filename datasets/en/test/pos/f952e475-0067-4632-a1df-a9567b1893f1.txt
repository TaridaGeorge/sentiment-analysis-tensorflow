I go to the Tempe location often since I'm usually at Cowtown or Casey's right around the corner, and it's a great place to run in and grab a drink or sit for a while and chat.  I met a friend there not too long ago who, surrounded by $900 bikes and dozens of Mac books reflecting in Ray Bans, proclaimed that she was "not cool enough" to be there.  However, after a while of smelling the freshly brewed coffee and taking in the unique art, she changed her mind.

Try the dirty whore.  It's a house-made horchata with a shot of espresso.  YEEEEES.
