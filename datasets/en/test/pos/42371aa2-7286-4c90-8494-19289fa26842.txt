Housed in an old storefront along Gilbert Road near the watertower, the Farmhouse delivers the best breakfast for miles around. The cinnamon bun - WOW. Best ever. The green chile chicken omelot is stunningly tasty. The all veg omelot - wonderful. The OJ is fresh squeezed, the coffee is excellent and the link sausages are like Mom used to make long ago. A classic place for breakfast and worth the drive to Gilbert - highly recommended and the BEST place for breakfast in the Valley. / We're still looking for a better place and haven't found it in Arizona.
