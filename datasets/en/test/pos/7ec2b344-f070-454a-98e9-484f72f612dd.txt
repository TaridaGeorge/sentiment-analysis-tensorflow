Similar to Trader Joe's or Whole Foods, but a lot more "gourmet" and even more helpful sales staff.  Wine selection is amazing with a staffed sommelier.  I used to live across the street from the Thompson Peak location, and loved the weeknight specials like stir-fry prepared in front of you.  It reminds me of similar dorm cafeteria specials...only good, and a helluva lot more expensive!
