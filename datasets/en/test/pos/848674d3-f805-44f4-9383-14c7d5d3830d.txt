I don't know why it took me so long to come here! A few girls and I got together to celebrate mine and another friends birthdays and Fez was the spot. OK... 3 words SWEET.POTATO.FRIES.  To die for! The hummus was also delish as was my sandwich. Being that we were there for a celebration, Thomas and staff went above and beyond to accommodate our group at lunch hour. Everyone enjoyed the food, the atmosphere is adorable and the service was impeccable. I can't wait to bring my husband here!
