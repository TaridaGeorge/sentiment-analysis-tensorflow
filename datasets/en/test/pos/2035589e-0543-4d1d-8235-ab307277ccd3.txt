I love Frozen Yogurt, Especially this place,
if you are in the mood for tart, they have, the blueberry pomegranate is the best. Not to mention the green tea, is really, really good. I don't see any other yogurt shops that actually have green tea.

At this location, they change out at least one flavor a month.
Which I like because I hate when other places get rid of a flavor that I love, after only having for a short while.

They offer stamp cards, you buy 8 and get the 9th one for free, up to 20 ounces which is a lot if you think about it.
and the minimum purchase is 3 dollars before tax.

They have fresh cut banana when you ask.
All sorts of goodies, reeces, fruity pebbles, cheescake bites, 3 different kinds of nuts, and a lot more.
