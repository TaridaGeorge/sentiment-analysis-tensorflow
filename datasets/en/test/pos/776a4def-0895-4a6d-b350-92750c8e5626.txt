Mama Java...often the highlight of my day! 

Ok, so i might be a bit of a caffeine addict and while i am sure that contributes to feeling good almost every time i walk in the door at Mama Java, it is also the coffee and the staff that make me smile.  Best coffee, truly!  Jensy and Billie (the baristas) are sweet, fun, friendly and truly coffee prodigies.  I am sure they will have their very own coffee shop someday soon but for now I am happy to give them my $4.06 everyday like clockwork!!
