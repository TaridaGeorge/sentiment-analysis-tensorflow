I find this place very unique and fun! Its a great place to take out of towners... Its colorful, has very unique and quality food, and you have to love a place that has a "Big Ass Burger" on its menu! Its a lively joint, far from romantic, if that's what you're looking for. Not the greatest location, as its almost hard to find if you've never been there before, as its in an office-like complex. But, those minor items aside, I really dig this place and the food is more than outstandng!
