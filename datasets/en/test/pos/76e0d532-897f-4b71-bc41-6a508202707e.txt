I placed an order online to pick-up before heading to a spring training game in the area, and when I went to eat my burrito I noticed a couple of requested items were missing.  I placed one very nice and well-meaning complaint (I still ate the burrito after all, just wishing I had some corn and rice!) and the manager of this location personally contacted me to apologize, and both he and the kitchen manager met my husband and I to apologize and replace our entire dinner.  I have never had such great customer service over a (fairly minor) mistake.  I wish more businesses had such a dedication to customer service!
