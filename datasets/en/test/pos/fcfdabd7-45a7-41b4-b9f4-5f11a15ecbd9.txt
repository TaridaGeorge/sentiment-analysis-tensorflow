So far, my favorite place I've hiked. Probably because it's been the easiest hike I've been on. It's very scenic, great views right from the start. Love the area, not too short, yet not to long. Gorgeous wild cacti that are amongst the tallest I've ever seen. 
No dogs on this trail-
Crowded on weekends
