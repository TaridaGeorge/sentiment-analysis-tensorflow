I love that this place is not a a large chain that destroys family run locally owned businesses. It is the opposite. It is a locally run family owned place and I love it. It's about time Mesa had more of these and less Starbucks taking over the place. The service is always wonderful. The prices are excellent. Plus they have student discounts! They have fair trade and organic products. The place just has a chill vibe to it and is perfect for relaxing or at least in my case lounging on the couch for a couple of minutes while I wait to grab a mocha to go. TRY the MOCHA Frapp! It is one of the best I have had in my life. The only sad thing is that it closes at 2pm. Luckily I get my dose in the morning.
