I could not find my local EWC which is in the Tempe Marketplace but since they are a chain and they hold a high standard of cleanliness and professionalism through out all thier stores.  All stores use a thick dark blue wax that is not as hot as regular wax and it does not require strips.  You see them throw the wax and sticks away immediately after use to ensure cleanliness.  I've been to three different women each time for my brazillian but all three were very professional and made me feel comfortable although I was panty-less and spread wide.  The prices are straight-forward and very reasonable.
