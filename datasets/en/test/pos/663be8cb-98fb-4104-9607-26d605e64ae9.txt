We live in Minnesota and try to visit Fez whenever we are in Phoenix.  This restaurant is the antidote to the awful Denny's Grand Slam!  The wait staff is welcoming and courteous and we LOVE the brunch on the weekend.  If you don't know it already, this place is special. The food is simple yet everything is done just a bit nicer than you would expect. Delicious!  We're coming back this month for more.
