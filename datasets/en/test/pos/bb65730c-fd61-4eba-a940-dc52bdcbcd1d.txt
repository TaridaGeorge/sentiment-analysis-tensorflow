Red Tomato is such a great pizzeria!! The pizza's are to die for! They have a nice deep crust, this out of the world sauce that is like no other and cheese that is sooo scrumptious! The other items like the salads are great too. 

The decor of the place is like an upscale bar/pizzeria. Very family friendly. I saw some kids rolling their own dough or pizza or dessert or something.. wish I was a kid again. They have a great long table in the middle of the restaurant that you can have a party. And the place is just one of my faves.. Its never too busy so no waiting for 45 mins for pizza is always a bonus. 

Totally recommend this place!!
