The patio could not be any more perfect. That alone is worth eating there. The food and service were great. Took mom there for her birthday lunch- she was looking forward to the French onion soup ( it's her favorite) but wasn't available - they were " transitioning"  into summer and that means no onion soup till the fall. Food was still fantastic AND when I told the server it was her birthday and asked for a candle or something at dessert, he brought out a tea light on our brûlée. Said he couldn't find any birthday candles but didn't want to dissapoint- so so so very sweet and appreciated. Nothing wrong with a little improvisation and creativity! Great place to take mom or ladies who lunch. Can't wait to try the Sunday brunch and dinner menu. Will be back for sure.
