YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM!!! 

I love it. And kinda wish I never found it! The ice cream sandwiches are to die for! The kitchen sink cookies are a spin off of what some might recognize as 'compost' cookies... basically the remenants of what a baker would typically have in their cabinet. Sometimes that will include chocolate chips, coffee grinds, pretzels, chips, butterscotch, nuts, etc. (on a side note, Momofuku in New York is the MAN when it comes to executing this to perfection). . . BUT I must say Churn does a great job on these cookies and everything else I have had there. I am a fan of the ice cream sandwiches with said cookie and madagascar vanillla and vietnamese coffee smooshed in between. 

I love it. And I will continue to piss off my diet by coming back.
