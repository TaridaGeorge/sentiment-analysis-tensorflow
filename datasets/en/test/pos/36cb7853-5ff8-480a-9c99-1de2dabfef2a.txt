Jeff, the manager, really knows his stuff. And unlike a lot of places that sell motorcycle gear, he doesn't treat women as second-class citizens. 

He knows the capabilities and limitations of each helmet and can explain why one helmet is $100 and another is justifiably priced at $500. And then he makes sure that you get the right size helmet for your head. Because a helmet doesn't do much good if it won't stay on your head!

They also sell jackets, gloves, coms, and cameras, etc. and he knows all about them too because he tests them out himself. He's not just the manager of a store, he's a true industry professional.
