Beautiful desert course. Perfect condiction. Friendly staff. Nothing have to complain about. Expensive green fee is justified. Casino and hotel is less than one mile away, in case you need a place to stay in and play. Casino itself is not as good as Talkingstick. But golf is at a higher class than Talkingstick. Check out the rating/slope of the course you will find out the course is not tough as a golf course but 'tough' amount all resort courses that are designed to please tourists.
