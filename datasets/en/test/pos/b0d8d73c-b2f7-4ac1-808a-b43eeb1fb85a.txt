I'm a sucker for good hummus...and Fez...Fez has great hummus.  Perhaps even better than the hummus, is the bread.  If I was trapped on a desert island and could only have two things to eat, one would be watermelon (which unfortunately is not on Fez's menu), but two would be Fez's bread.

Fez makes a pizza-like item on the menu with pesto and fresh mozzarella, which is quite tasty.

I've heard the fries are great, but I'm usually too full to eat them.  Someday I'm going to go to Fez just for the fries.

I used to go to this building when it was a Blue Burrito.  Every time I go to the building, now that it has changed, I'm always dumbfounded on how the ownership was able to convert a fast-food restaurant space into a hip sit down restaurant.
