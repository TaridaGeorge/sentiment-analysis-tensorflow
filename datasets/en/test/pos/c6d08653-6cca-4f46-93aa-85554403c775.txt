Authentic and delicious. The food was phenomenal and the service was attentive and quick. My boyfriend had his old stand by, bul go gi, and I had bi him bop (mostly so he could try it so I can broaden his Korean food horizons).. and they were both great. The ban chan (side dishes) were varied and had some authentic items that you don't regularly see in other Korean restaurants in the Valley. What I'm really excited about and can't wait to go back and try is the other menu items such as cha jjang myun (delicious noodles in black bean sauce) and cham pong (spicy seafood noodles)... These are also items rarely seen on a menu outside of k town.
