After a not so comfortable experience at a pediatrician's office, I decided to switch doctor's. I researched and read many reviews and was lead over and over to Mesa Pediatrics. I was instantly comfortable and loved our nurse Chrissy! She was very attentive and loving to my son. Our doctor, Dr. Jennifer Wallace was very sweet and answered all of our questions without making us feel rushed. I am definitely comfortable here and happy I made the switch.
