there are so many places around the valley that try to cater to the large chicago native population...but no other place brings me back to the good ol days of portillos greasy, juicy beef sandwhiches..and cheesey cheesey fries...and of course...the tamales! just how i remember them...

there is one person that complained how greasy the sandwhiches are -that's how theyre supposed to be! that's what makes tthem oh-so-delicious...

i live right down the street from this place and always like to splurge when i'm feeling in the mood for some good greasy grubby food. the guy that runs the place is always extremely friendly and i have never had a bad sandwhich here...
