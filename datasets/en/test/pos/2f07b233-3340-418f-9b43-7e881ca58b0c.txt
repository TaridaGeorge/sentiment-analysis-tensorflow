This place is awesome. I just saw High School Musical here, that Coach Bolton should win a Tony...
In all seriousness my daughter got into theatre here and has had a wonderful time. Great Children's theatre. Once you do a couple shows here, you know everyone and it's like family. My daughter and wife have made some great friendships here. Wonderful asset for the community.
Has adult shows also.
