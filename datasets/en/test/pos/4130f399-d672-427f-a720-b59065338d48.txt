Don't let the looks of the place deceive you.  The Meat Shop carries the best grass fed and local cuts of meat.  The butchers at this shop are super friendly and accommodating and will readily answer any questions you have.  You'll love all the meats here, but you have to try the bacon - it's like candy.
