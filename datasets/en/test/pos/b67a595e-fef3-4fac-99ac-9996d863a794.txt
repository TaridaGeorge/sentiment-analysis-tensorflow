I've been wanting to go to this burger joint for a while and last night I decided to give it a shot and boy am I happy!!!!! 

we each created our own burger, and while were eating our first reaction was..this are one of the best burgers in town and maybe anywhere..very good taste of the beef, all glutten free menu..

overall very impressed with this place and will be back soon..
