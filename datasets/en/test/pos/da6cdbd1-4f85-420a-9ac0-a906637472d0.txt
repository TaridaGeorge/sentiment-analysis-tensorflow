I didn't know Primebar was open for LUNCH!!! I was so excited to go there after a long day of shopping in the Scottsdale Quarter!  They have an amazing Fried Egg Burger...the bun was fresh and soft, and the burger was moist and juicy!  The fries were crispy and hot! YUM!!!  I'll definitely bring back my co-workers. We usually come for the fabulous Happy Hour and now we will be coming in for both!  They also have a special event menu, we might host our next corporate cocktail reception in the area with the couches!  What an awesome space!
