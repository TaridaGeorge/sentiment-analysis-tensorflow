This place is definitely at the top of my list for burger joints!! The smash burgers are outstanding, the smash fries are delicious and the Nutter Butter shakes are the perfect dessert to top it all off! The staff is friendly and patient. Most the time I go there the place is busy so seating can be difficult for bigger groups, but well worth any trouble.
