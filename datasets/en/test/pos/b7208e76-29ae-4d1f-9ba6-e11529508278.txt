Love the energy, fantastic vibe from the decor and neighborhood diners.  
The potato leek pizza is how do you say...Dee lectible, Dee Lite ful!  In fact I have enjoyed everything on the menu: salads, pizzas and OMG the deserts are innovative and fresh. Pizzeria Bianco has NOTHING on this place -  Bon appetite.
