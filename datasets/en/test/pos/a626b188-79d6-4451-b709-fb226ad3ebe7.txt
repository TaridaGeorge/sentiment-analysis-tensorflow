So i will soon be moving to the east part of town, so i am learning the stores that will be close by.   This Safeway is a good one. Clean , neat, and orderly! Lots of parking in the lot. Baskets are abundant which is a good thing.  I could quickly find everything i needed this day and love the bakery with all its lovely goodies. I will be back!!
