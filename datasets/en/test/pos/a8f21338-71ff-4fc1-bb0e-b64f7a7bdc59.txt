We love this place.  The resort is well designed and offers amenities for everyone.  The resort staff is genuine, friendly and helpful.  The executives, managers and staff at the property have managed to make a lavish destination resort feel very comfortable - not pretentious in the least.  While the resort offers countless amenities and dining options, if you do want to go "off campus" there is a retail shopping/dining center right next door with wonderful restaurants and shops.  The hotel offers a shuttle service to nearby destinations to make your stay care-free.
What a terrific get -a-way spot to help survive Milwaukee winters....we'll be back!
