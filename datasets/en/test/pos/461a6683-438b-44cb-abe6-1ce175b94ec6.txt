It's hot today. Not been too bad a summer til now.  Finished lunch at Lattitude 8 with the missus and stumbled onto Paletas Betty.  A memory tickle from growing up in Houston...Popsicles!!  Went in and got arroz con leche and missus got the mango. Price a little high (for a Popsicle) until you realize the thing is all fresh fruit or dessert!! Now price sounds just fine.  Betty is a cutey and my wife agrees! Get  your butt over there ASAP.  Plan to bring the Yorkies over next time.  If you eat over in downtown Chandler, skip dessert and go here.
