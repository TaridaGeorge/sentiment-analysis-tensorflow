This place is the absolute best. It's got such a great ambiance and it's a fun, homey little place to eat at. If you don't know where it is, it's easy to miss, but I'm sure that's part of its charm. I never deviate from the veggie quesadillas because they are the absolute best quesadillas I have ever had. I'm sure you can't go wrong with choosing anything on the menu. They have all-day happy hour on Saturdays which you just can't beat. The staff is really nice and will remember you if you go there enough! It's got a great vibe and I will always recommend it. I'll definitely be heading back soon!
