I needed to get some older computer games that are no longer sold in regular stores, and I didn't feel like ordering online so I came to Bookmans hoping they had used copies.

Not only did they have the two I wanted, but they were $8! That's awesome. Then on my way to the checkout line I noticed a decent vinyl section and found two great records for $15 total. I was on cloud 9.

Nothing negative to say, this Bookmans has it in the bag.
