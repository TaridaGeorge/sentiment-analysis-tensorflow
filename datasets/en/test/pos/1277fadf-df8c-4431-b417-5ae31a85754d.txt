I stopped into La Piazza Al Forno due to a traffic detour on my route home.  Nothing could have been more satisfying after a long day of work.  There was no wait, (it was Tuesday night)  my waitress was accommodating and friendly, and the Italian Stallion (pizza) was a fantastic piece of meatalicious goodness.  I will definitely be back if e'er I find myself in downtown Glendale again.
