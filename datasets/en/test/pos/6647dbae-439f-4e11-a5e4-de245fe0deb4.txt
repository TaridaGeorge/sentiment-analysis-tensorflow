Great hot dog place. It is almost always packed, which is a good thing. I love their unique charcoal cooking method that they stoke right in front of you. It's affordable and excellent taste, includes all the fixins you'd want. It's hard to find a good dog place. Sometimes you have to settle for the Shcnitz if you aren't close Ted's. Love it!
