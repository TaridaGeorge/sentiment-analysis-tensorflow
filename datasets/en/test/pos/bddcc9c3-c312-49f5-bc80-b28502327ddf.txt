I have been a fan of Ruth's Chris forever, but I must say our experience at BLT Steak  last Friday equaled or exceeded any steakhouse meal we have had before.  The popovers you get before the meal are wonderful, but resist the temptation to eat all of them as then you will either leave a lot of food behind or take a lot home.  The steaks we ordered (filet for my wife, bone-in rib eye for me) both were perfectly cooked with a nice outside char.  The various sauces available also are a nice touch.  What helps this place stand out however are all the great appetizers--we had German potato balls and poached green beans and both were wonderful.  Desserts too, were excellent.  It seems that Scottsdale supports an immense number of high end steakhouses, but if they are all this good, I can see why!
