I'm a big fan of FnB. I tried to drop in for for a quick dinner on a friday night with no reservations. No dice. While i was being turned away, the hostess let me know that Baratin was around the corner.

The final verdict is that Baratin is a nice, simpler compliment to FnB.  If you are looking for a nice cozy place to grab a bite to eat with a friend/SO you should give it a shot!  Baratin is now on my rotation of go-to restaurants when i'm around Scottsdale.
