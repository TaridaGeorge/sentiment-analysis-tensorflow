Could I have actually found a reason to update my Yogurtology review for a 3rd time?  Oh, yes... I have!

The recently updated their register system and replaced the old-school stamp cards with a handy-dandy key-fob tracker.  Now, if you are ridiculously unorganized like me, you won't lose your frequent yogurt-shopper card.  YAY!

I'm pretty sure I have found a new favorite flavor.  Key Lime Pie.  Oh, my... How have I missed this on previous visits?  It is phenomenal!  If only it could be served side-by-side in yogurt-heaven-swirlyness with coconut... then, I could die happy.  Please, oh, please make this happen, dear yogurt gods.

Only one *tiny* tip - can we please get a facebook thing going?  A daily flavor update would be so easy, and would make it much easier for me to plan my visits.
