Hipster coffee bar in the airport. 
Just ordered an iced coffee and it was on point. 
No frills, no other bullshit like Starbucks does. 
Customer service was uber friendly even when I looked like DEATH from waking up at 4 in the morning to pack and leave for my 6am flight. 

Love that they had the liquid sweetener for iced beverages too. 

yum!
