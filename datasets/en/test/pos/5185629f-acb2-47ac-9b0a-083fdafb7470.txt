I love this place. Interestingly, I've rarely used it has a Halloween-shopping go-to! I'm a teacher, and for me this is THE PLACE to go to get funny, off-beat, inexpensive treats and surprises for my students. Little dime-store goodies, etc. I also went to Easley's ten or twelve times when I was prop-shopping for a play I was directing. One of the best things about this place is the assortment of inexpensive hats! Engineer hats, captain's hats, straw hats, jester's hats ... you name it, and they range in price and quality from "cheap and only needs to 'read' from the stage" to "a little more expensive and something you might actually wear out!" The people who work here are really helpful, but they won't breathe down your neck. Don't be shy about asking them to help you brainstorm a bit--they're great with open-ended questions and problem-solving.
