I have probably been to SmashBurger on a biweekly basis since discovering it.  Can't say enough about how delicious all their options are.  My favorite is the Arizona Burger, by far.  And I love, love, love the Smash sauce.  Sweet potato fries and fried pickles are also pretty tasty.  Check this place out!
