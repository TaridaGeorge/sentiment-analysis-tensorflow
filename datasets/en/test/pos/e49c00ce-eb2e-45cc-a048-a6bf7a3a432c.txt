I Have been going to Romes for a year or so and it never ceases to amaze me. The menu has it all from Pizza to Salad. The Greek salad is my favorite made with very fresh ingredients. It is a family owned business and they will make special meals for you if you'd like. The thin crust pizza is amazing, especially the white pizza. My favorite meal on the menu is the Chicken Lasagna made with Alfredo sauce. There Alfredo sauce is very light and delicious. The staff is very helpful and friendly. Good good and good service.
