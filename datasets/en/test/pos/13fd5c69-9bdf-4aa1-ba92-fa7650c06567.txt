Poppa Maize Gourmet Popcorn is incredible!  Not only do they have a billion flavors to choose from, they are SO NICE!  I work in events and they have sponsored events for The Boys & Girls Clubs of the East Valley as well as The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.  I also know they do several charity events a month!  What a wonderful (and super tasty!) addition to our community!
