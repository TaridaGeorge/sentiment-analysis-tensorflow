Flemings is a perfect alternative to Mastros or Dominicks or any of the other places where you drop a mortgage payment on your meal. Flemings is certainly not cheap, but overall it's about 15% less per item (like $39 for a filet vs $46) at Ocean Club, etc.
The steak is every bit as good. The service is excellent there and the ambience is in the same category. Perhaps Ocean Club has better interior design, whatever. 
Add to that Flemings runs some really good promotions from time to time like bonuses on gift cards or prix fixe menus and I go there about once every month.
