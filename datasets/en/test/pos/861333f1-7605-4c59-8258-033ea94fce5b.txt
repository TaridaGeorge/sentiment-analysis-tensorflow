My wife and I went to the Gallo Blanco as we were staying in the Clarendon hotel for 2 nights and wanted a restaurant nearby (restaurant is in hotel , can't beat that !)
We found the food delicious : the ceviche was very good, the fish tacos excellent (very fresh fish) and the carnitas and beef taco very flavorful.

So good in fact, that we came back the next day (tuesday - they have an offer on margarita pitchers by the way) and ordered more tacos, equally delicious.

Only little issue is that service can be a bit slow when the place is crowded (which happened both nights) but the waitresses were very nice.
