I love this restaurant, and almost hate to review it because I want it to stay a secret.  It reminds me of many of the restaurants in Alaska, where I'm from.  It is small, not in a fancy building, yet it still has a simple, elegant feel to it.  They usually have a good band, and the food is excellent.  Amano's serves the best seafood I've had since Alaska.   Their dishes are always cooked well, and served with perfect sauces and vegetables.  The staff is lovely, helpful, attentive, but not overbearing.  I'd eat here every night if I could!
