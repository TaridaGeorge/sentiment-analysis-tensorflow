Third time's still a charm! 
This time I got the Luau pork sandwich which is sweet, shredded porn on a bun with coleslaw. I'm usually not a fan of slaws but this one was not too sweet and really complimented the pork. And, as before, the sweet potato fries were awesome with Hula's dressing dip. 
Super friendly server on the patio, too.
Also used Yelp to get $5 off when I checked in - so without a drink, it was just over $6! Awesome deal.
I'll finally give it that 5th star for service, taste, environment and prices.
