kelly from landis cyclery is the shidoobie shizznit. first off, it's awesome that a chick can work so well with bikes.  she really knows her cycles.  she special ordered me a beautiful globe bike, the roll 1, and put it together for the urban assault i'm about to unleash in phoenix. she also hooked me up with a kryptonite mini lock, the best of its kind, and a couple of simple yet stylish bike lights.  thanks to her i'm rolling around on one of the coolest bikes in town. it's a handsome fella. 

if you ever need your bike fixed or repaired, or looking into getting a new bike, or any bike parts, check out kelly at landis cyclery.
