Always friendly, always focused on YOU the customer. Efficient! And tasty too. Their hot beverages are great. Tried this seasons Pumpkin Latte last night and was surprised at how much it resembled Starbucks! I am a huge Starbucks fan and usually when I get a Pumpkin Latte anywhere else it's less flavorful and pretty watery. This was the bomb! And cheaper too ;)
