Went down the list of companies to steam clean a used sectional that we purchased.  Most of them have yet to call me back - 3 days later!  We didn't wan to bring it into our home until it was completely sanitized and stain free but didn't want it tying up space in our garage either.  After leaving a message with Campbell's Steam Pro,  the owner Scott promptly called back and he was able to open a spot for us the same day.... a Saturday no less!!!!  Sent his tech Johnny who did a very thorough and good job.  Price was very fair and I highly recommend this company.   Keep up the good work!
