The staff was soooooo nice! I was looking for something specific and inquired with one of the many associates working. She said that they had run out of their inventory, but thought one of the mannequins might have been wearing my size. Sure enough, that mannequin had my pants on:) To make a pleasant shopping experience short, I pretty much bought out the entire store and was extremely happy with my purchases. They are a bit pricey, but the quality of their clothing is worth every penny, plus my new perky butt looks amazing:) !!!
