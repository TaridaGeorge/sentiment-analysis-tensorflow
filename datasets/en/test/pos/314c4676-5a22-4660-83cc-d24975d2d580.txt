Their food is pretty darn good!  Everything I have ordered there has been perfectly made so far.  I've stuck to getting the double cheeseburger combo, and Culver's has been consistent so far.  

The cheese curds are a perfect side.  

People might complain a little about the prices, but I'm pretty sure the prices at Culver's are still cheaper that a place like Carl's Jr.'s.  

My daughters love that the kids meals come with frozen custard.

Culver's customer service is at the top of the food chain.  Go there and find out for yourself.  

I couldn't find a single reason to deduct a point.
