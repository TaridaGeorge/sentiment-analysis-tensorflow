So, I came here with my friends one weekend for dinner and I was pleasantly surprised with this place. From the outside it does not look like much and is not very impressive, but once you step inside and smell the food your mind is quickly changed. Here is the break down:

Pros:
1. Food was delicious and filling
2. Prices are fair for the amount of food given
3. Staff was very polite and very quick about making our food

Cons:
1. The only problem I had about this place was space. It does get cramped in there so be attentive about how to best confront this issue when you have large parties.

Over all the food was awesome and the prices were great! I would definetly return there very soon and with an empty stomach!
