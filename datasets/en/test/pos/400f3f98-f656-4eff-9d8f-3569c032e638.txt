My new favorite italian joint.  They had some minor problems when we went for lunch.  The air conditioning was on the fritz and the entrees didn't all come out at the same time, but the food & service was awesome.  I felt like I was in Italy, which was impressive considering I was on the west side next to a Circle K.

I ordered the veal cannelloni ($8.95).  By the way, everything is $8.95 for lunch.  The portion size was perfect.  The pasta and ingredients all tasted very fresh.  Delicious.  The focaccia bread we started with was also homemade and very yummy.

The other guys I went with ordered the pizza with sausage and broccoli and said it was awesome.  Sadly I didn't have enough room in my stomach having devoured my entire meal, but I will definitely try that next time.
