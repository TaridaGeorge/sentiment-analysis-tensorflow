Awesome place. I went in only knowing that I wanted to make a dark room. I walked out with everything to not only make my own dark room, But the confidence that I would do it right. Only going off of what I did in high school the guys there showed me all the equipment that I need and also told me how to use them to get the best results. I cant wait to go back in and learn about new stuff that I can do.
