I love this place. It is my go-to place when I am in the mood for the Italian. 

So far I've had the gnocchi with vodka sauce (my favorite), pizza, eggplant parm with spaghetti and the chicken parm sandwich. All four have been delicious. The portions are large so I always eat half at the restaurant and save the other half for lunch.

The service is also wonderful. Every server I've encountered in very polite and attentive.

If you are in the mood for some filling food, this is the place to go. I highly recommend it!
