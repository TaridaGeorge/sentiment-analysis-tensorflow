I've been to quite a few Pho places and so far this one is the best. I've lived in Cali, AZ, NV and now IN and nothing beats this place. I want me some Rare Beef Pho with the best broth I've ever had. 
I was introduce to this place by a friend a year before I left AZ, and I'm sad I didn't get to experience it the whole 4 years I lived there. Now I live in IN and I have a feeling I'll have to wait a long time before I get to slurp be up some good stuff.
