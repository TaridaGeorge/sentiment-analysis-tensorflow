I wear my sunglasses at night!

Think that's what I'll do next time I show up!  Minus the lenses so I can actually see haha! I totally dig Shady's!  The name is not literal.  A lot of hip and friendly young people around, and not that pretentious Jersey Shore - yo bro I'm like totally awesome and I'll get that girls number across that "baa".  You go do that --- In any case Shady's doesn't have any windows.  There's a pool table, fireplace, jukebox, and several comfortable couches; what can you ask for in a bar?

If you don't know I'm part of an AA group (Affordable Alcohol) - Shady's definitely has affordable alcohol!  8 drinks = $50 total, that's cheap in my opinion.  Usually, I've paid at least $10 a glass for the stuff we were drinking. - Enjoy!
