The next time I visit Kierland Commons, this will be the first store I go into!  I had such a fun time in this store.  They sell really cool, rock-inspired clothing that look absolutely AMAZING!  And unlike other rock-and-roll clothes brands such as Ed Hardy, this store sells one-of-a-kind clothes that you definitely won't see anyone else wearing.  The only regret I have is that I didn't have more money with me when I went in there, because I fell in love with so many things there.  It's a little more pricey than your average-Joe Aeropostale, Hollister shops, but I think it's worth it.  The two workers in there were also very nice and helpful to me, a big bonus!  I'm officially in love with this place and can only hope that it'll stay for many years to come! :)
