So the keys were acting hinky in the front door.  Working in some locks, not others.  Since the locks been acting hinky for awhile, we had a big collection of keys from depot, loews, ace, etc.  Since we got ripped off (welcome to central phoenix) we got a security door with a dead bolt and the front door has dead bolt and lock in the handle all on same key.  I read good reviews here, Todd is the man, he came out and fixed it all.  Not a lot to say, dude knows how to unhinkify a lock pretty fast and good, he is like Houdini.  Oh yeah, some keys work now, others don't, but Todd made some all new keys and all them work nice, turn the key it is like butter...just like butter.  Ahh...back in my happy place.
