The original review for Harmony House is outdated and inaccurate.  I found this place to be an absolutely excellent music store. These guys are helpful, friendly, offer honest advice (regardless of their cut in the deal).  

They keep a nice stock at reasonable prices and are authorized Fender and Gretsch dealers. They also have a nice stock of pianos, though I don't know too much about that.  No, I am not affiliated with them in any way, except for being a satisfied customer. I absolutely recommend.
