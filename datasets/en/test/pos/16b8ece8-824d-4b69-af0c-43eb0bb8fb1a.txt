This is by far one of most most favorite spots back in AZ.  Coming here always reminds me that I am home.  From the moment you step inside it is like a you are in another place.  The WILD Mushroom, Spinach and Leek Quiche is amazing and the Warm Brie with Caramelized Apples are phenomenal.  I can not wait to return.
