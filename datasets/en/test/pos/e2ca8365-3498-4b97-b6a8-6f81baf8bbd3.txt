This is my new place for sushi in the Valley.  Went for lunch on Tuesday and the place was busy but service was very prompt.  We ordered 3 different sushi rolls and a salad.  The portions were so large we took plenty home.  The ingredients were fresh and very flavorful.  Had the eel, spicy crab, and Mexican caliente rolls and all of them were absolutely DELISH!!!  If you're a sushi lover, you will not be disappointed!
