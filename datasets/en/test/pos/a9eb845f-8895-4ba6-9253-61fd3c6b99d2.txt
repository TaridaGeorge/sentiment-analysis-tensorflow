I recently moved just down the street from this new location, I am a big fan of the original one on Scottsdale road so I was pretty stoked!

Just like the Scottsdale location the food is great and the staff is very nice and friendly. I always get the California breakfast club and a large iced Americano. The Buzz is also a great drink but somewhat pricey. I think this location has a nicer outdoor seating area than the original but overall the service and quality are identical.
