I have been seeing Khristine since before I was officially Jewish, which is a long time ago now. But that's neither here nor there. She is amazing at creating color that complements your attitude and skin complexion. Basically, she's a magician. Every time I leave Khristine's salon, I feel good about myself. I also feel confident that I can somewhat recreate what she's made on a daily basis. So glad to have found her! P.S. Her new studio is a private space and it makes you feel VIP.
