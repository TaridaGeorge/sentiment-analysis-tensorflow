I have a daughter who has Celiacs Disease (no wheat or gluten allowed).  Shelly makes the Very Best Gluten Free deserts and bread!  She can transform any recipe into  a Gluten Free, Delicious Dessert.  I bought a GF cake from Shelly and you could NOT tell a difference!!!
If you love Caramel her homemade caramel sauce is to die for!!! And its also GF!
My daughters favorite is the Macaroons.  Two big chewy cookies filled with cream. My sons favorite are the Rose Water Macaroons.  DECADENT.
You don't have to have Celiacs to LOVE Shelly's GF desserts. Thank You Shelly for bringing SWEETS back into my daughters life!  She loves you for it!!!
