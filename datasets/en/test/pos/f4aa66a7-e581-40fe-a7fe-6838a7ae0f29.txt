This is our absolute favorite neighborhood sushi restaurant.  Their rolls are fantastic, always tasty and just the right size as well.  We've been to many other high end establishments, and while their sushi is typically very good their rolls are more than you can eat in one bite and tend to fall apart, not so at Shogun.  Perfect rolls every time.
