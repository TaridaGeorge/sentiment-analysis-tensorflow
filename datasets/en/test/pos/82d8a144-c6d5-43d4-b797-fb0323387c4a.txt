Talk about a well-run business.  This is the type of jewelry store that you walk into and just feel welcome.  Their staff is more than knowledgeable on every single product that they have available.

My parents have been customers for sometime now and I myself have now become a customer.  They will take care of you for years to come from the very minute that they walk in there.

My family always deals with Lyndell when we go there and what a pleasant guy to talk to.  He certainly knows his stuff and will be more than happy to answer any questions that you have.  He made certain to even do the simple things such as give me extra cleaning cloths so that my purchase always looks in tip-top shape.

This is a place where you certainly will be taken care of and nothing will be forgotten.
