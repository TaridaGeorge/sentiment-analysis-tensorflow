Delicious!  When I first discovered this place, I came thrice in a week.

However, how good your experience is depends hugely on the pasty you order.  The original Oggie and the Vindaloo are truly fantastic; the Oggie tastes just like (better?) than the pasties I've had in England, and the Vindaloo is like my uncle's curry stuffed into delicious flaky crust.  A-mazing... and these will keep you full all day.

The service is great; even today during lunch, my friend and I never went more than fifteen minutes without being asked if we needed a refill or anything else, which was refreshing.  

Highly recommended!
