We usually come to Brio for dinner and drinks, and this time we decided to stop in for brunch (and drinks, haha!)... so glad we did!

I ordered Berries & Cream French Toast and he ordered Eggs Oscar... um, well, I ended up eating half of his plate. 

The waiter was so friendly and incredibly patient with me, as I could not make up my mind and was ready to order three or four different items. He recommended his favorite and also whipped up fabulous for-the-morning drinks.

I also have to mention valet service, as this is usually a hit or miss for most restaurants. Brio's valet obviously figured it out because they're fast, friendly and go off of tips... with an ATM machine nearby if you don't have cash.

Definitely impressed with brunch selection and dinner was always five stars!
