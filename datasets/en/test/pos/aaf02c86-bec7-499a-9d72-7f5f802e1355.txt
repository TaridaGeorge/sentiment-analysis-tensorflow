Ground Control at Verrado just had their grand opening on Saturday. Decided to skip grand opening crowd and went on Sunday at noon for lunch. No crowd!

The new Gastropub was wonderful. Very clean and well staffed for lunch.

The shortened menu had a good selection, but cannot wait for the full menu to start.
With 15 craft beers on draft it was hard to decide.

We ordered the Chipotle Turkey and the Viper (hot pastrami) Paninis along with a beer.
The Panini was delicious, just the right amount of meat vs bread. Speaking of bread, the rosemary flatbread was awesome. 

This Gastropub is just what the area needed and we will defiantly be returning.
