OLIVES!!!!!

I am an olive snob. Olives in cans make me depressed. No joke. How anyone could abuse an olive by putting it in a can... shiver. Forget waterboarding. That shit is torture!

The olive bar is the best anywhere. They have about 20 different varieties. My office is now in the office park right behind Whole Foods, so I can walk there and eat some of the best olives I've ever had, whenever I head up there instead of working at home. Wow. My mouth is smiling. I just got back. The citrus stuffed olives were great. I love the wrinkly black dried olives. The cracked olives are fantastic. The giant kalamata's are incredible. The picholines are tiny and tasty. I wasn't kidding when I said I was an olive snob.

Oh, the rest of the store looks cool, too, I guess.
