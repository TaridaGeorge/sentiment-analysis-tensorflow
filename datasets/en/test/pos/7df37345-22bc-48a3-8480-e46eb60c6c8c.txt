I love this place.
Its a great, chill place to go. All the bartenders are super friendly and I never have to wait to get a drink, shot or food. Not only is the staff friendly, but so are all the customers.
The wineburgers are delicious and the baskets of onions rings and fries are huge, definitely share with someone!
