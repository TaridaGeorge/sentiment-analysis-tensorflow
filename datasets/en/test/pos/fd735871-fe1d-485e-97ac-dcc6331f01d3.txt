Great service, great food, great atmosphere. I come here all of the time for happy hour (which is fantastic, by the way) and for dinner and/or drinks. The owners are super nice and seem to really care about their customers. It's a great place to be any day of the week as a casual hangout, nice dinner, or a sweet first date.
