THE BEST BREAKFAST & BRUNCH you will ever find in the Phoenix area. My husband and I's fav spot, we've been back so many times I can't count. It's such a tragedy we moved to Tucson. The California Egg Benedict is THE Best, I tried replicating it at home, and it's just not the same, close but no cigar, hahaha. It came with yummy potatoes on the side, which was also had a home made taste. We also tried the french toast, soo scrumptiuos!! Its in an odd location but what a hidden gem! The deocr and ambiance was just perfect! And I love when food, ambiance and price is right! I think they just opened one in Tempe.. I can't wait to go again, when we drive up to visit friends!
