I wasn't sure what to expect, but I did not expect that kind of talent to come with warmth & graciousness. I was blown away by their voices & their charm :)
& I can't say enough about Maestro Joseph Rescigno (I believe that was his name), he was so knowledgeable, passionate, down to earth & entertaining that I could not have asked for anything more, lol. 
In a word, LOVE.
