Dear Flavors of Louisiana, 

I love you. 

- Kristen A. 

We had the crab landry and scrimp po'boy last night. Amazing as always! No matter what we get, I am never disappointed. No matter how slammed this place is, the service is stellar. They always make us feel like we are not only welcome, but family. I will see you soon flavors.
