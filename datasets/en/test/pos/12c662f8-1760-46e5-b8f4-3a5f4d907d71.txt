I love going to Loco Patron. Their food is the best kept secret in Old Town. The service and the entire staff are outstanding, especially Alicia. She gives exceptional customer service and pays very close attention to all of her customers. She has a heart of gold and will go out of her way to make sure that your Loco experience is memorable. Loco is a must visit, if you're looking for a place that gives you inexpensive drinks and food, with five star customer service.
