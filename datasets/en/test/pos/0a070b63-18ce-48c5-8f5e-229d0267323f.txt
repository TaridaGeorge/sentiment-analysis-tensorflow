I love this place. I don't splurge often on expensive food, but when I do I generally go to Modern Steak. The food is amazing, the bread is to die for and the service has always been great. 
Also the decor and inside is really beautiful. The manager told me it is French inspired, which may be the only good things the French did... I kid ;) 
A great place to eat!
