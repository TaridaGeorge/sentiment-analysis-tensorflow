Good espresso and a nice view of the fountain if it's cool enough to be outside.  They are pet-friendly.  The obvious highlight of my trip to Mountain View Coffee Co, however, were something like "flax seed bites"--I forget the actual name.  But they were cookie-type bakery items which had featuring a ton of flax seed, I'm guessing some almond and vanilla.  Tasted amazing!  And available for the low, low price of 75 cents!  Now THAT is a deal!
