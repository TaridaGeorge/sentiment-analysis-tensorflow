JAM...what a great and unique little gem.  Every time I am in Old Town I have to stop by.  There are always new things to discover.  The artists are all so diverse.  It's the best place to buy cute little gifts for birthdays, hostess gifts...or for me.  :) 

The owner, Shauna, even opened it up to me to host my annual holiday cookie exchange.  It was just precious.  Everyone loved it.  

You just feel so at-home there.  She's done a really great job at making a magical place where you feel so welcome and inspired.  Even if you've never stopped by before you must go in and say 'hi' to Shauna.  She will make you feel like you've been friends for forever.
