I worked here for quite sometime... I can honestly say this is one of the cleanest, tastiest, and most affordable "just past casual" dining you will ever encounter. There is literally no bad item on the menu; however, I can honestly say the Smokehouse Burger, BBQ Brisket, and Mac and Cheese outdoes the rest of the menu. The atmosphere can be a little dark, but creates a more private experience. Service is some of the best I have ever encountered.
