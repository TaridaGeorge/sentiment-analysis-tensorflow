Went in there for the first time today - Ben was really sweet and very knowledgeable...he helped me choose just the right food for my dog.  Lots of great suggestions - they also have some 'free samples' that are a wonderful way to try new things.

I've found the only pet store I need in Phoenix!  I'll be back soon.
