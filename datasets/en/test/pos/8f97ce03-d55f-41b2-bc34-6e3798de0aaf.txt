Based on Yelp reviews, I went to check this place out while I'm working on assignment in Phoenix. As promised the food was great, the service was great and I got to meet the venerable Thomas.

I sat at the bar and the boys took care of me. The Fez Kisra sounded good, but I should have listened to Russell's recommendations. I will definitely try those next time, which will be soon.

The wine selection was varied, but didn't blow my mind. I stuck with whites and found that the one that sounded the best wasn't nearly as good as the most popular (shockingly).

The place combines hip and tasteful decorating, good music, great food and a nightlife atmosphere. Definitely seems like a great place for a night out with the guys/girls if you don't want to be overly bothered.
