I have been seeing Scott and Mark at STS for all of 2012.  I had multiple goals.  Improve my fitness but to also rehab my knee where I had torn 2 ligaments.  I have achieved both goals.  My leg is the strongest it has been in 3 years and I have lost body fat and added muscle.  My wife also goes to Scott's group classes twice a week and she loves it.  Having played sports at college and beyond I am really picky about where I work out.  I think most trainers do a month long course and then it is the blind leading the blind but not at STS.  Everyone in there is so knowledgeable and great and I really enjoy going in there.  I highly recommend STS to anyone who wants professional help for any type of fitness goals.
