The best Mediterranean food in the valley and the best owner. I got turned onto the Flaming Kabob from a work colleague who used them for catering and suggested I give them a shot. 

Now I cater lunches for work daily and kind of expect to be let down when you order a mass of food...not here! 

I always order the chicken kabobs, rice salad and hummus and it is amazing everytime! Khalil the owner is one of the nicest most accommodating people I have met. He makes his orders on time and is fair priced. Plus the food is delicious! 

If you are looking to support a local business and are in the mood for Mediterranean make sure you even go out of your way to go to the Flaming Kabob!
