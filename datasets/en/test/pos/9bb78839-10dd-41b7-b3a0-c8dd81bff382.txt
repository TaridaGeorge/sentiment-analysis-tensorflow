There are only two reasons i would return to Arizona. 
1. To visit my cousin!! 
2. Momma's French Toast Breakfast 

OMG...this place is to die for! 

I came here for breakfast and ordered the Mommas French Toast. Seriously the best french toast I have ever had...even...SHHH don't tell grandma...but yes better than my grandmas! 
They use sourdough toast to make the french toast and omg just so good. I'm just sad they don't have them in California. 

Service was Excellent.. I think her name was Yesenia ...but yeah she was awesome! Our coffee and Ice tea was full at all times!! 

I am already planning my trip in December and Cracker Barrel is definitely one of my stops on my way!
