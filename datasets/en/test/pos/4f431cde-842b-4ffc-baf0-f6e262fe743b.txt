If you need a Gelato fix, this is the place to go. There are LOTS of flavors. We had mint chocolate chip (one of their nut-free flavors: check the little sign about which chocolate flavors have nuts) pumpkin pie, and chocolate. Coffee/decaf available for a dollar- saves you a trip to a coffee place! Charming interior with wall mural, indoor and outdoor seating, and little chairs for children. Parking is directly in front of the store. Take your pooch, sit outside, and then go next door to Petco!
