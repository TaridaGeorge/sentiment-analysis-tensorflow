I have not stayed here but have enjoyed the spa on a couple of occassions. One word...HEAVEN! I loved the quiet room which allows the opportunity to relax and begin to unwind before your service(s). The staff is indeed professional and the experience leaves you feeling rejuvenated and refreshed. 

Oh gosh, I just love this place and recommend it to anyone who loves spa-ing!
