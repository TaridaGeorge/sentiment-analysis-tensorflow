Soooooooooooooooo! Good! And the service was awesome as it should be since there is nothing cheap about this place ha! But it it is so worth every penny! My mother and I went for a celebratory lunch for me landing a new ridiculously awesome job with guess who...YELP! ha! 
 
We both got the lobster roll plate complete with a lobster bisque and french green beans! We were craving lobster good you tell!? Let me tell you they do not skimp out on the lob meat either the roll with out a doubt has what seems to be the whole lobster in it and the bisque is to die for! If you order it make sure you get it with the sherry that they offer with it. 

Best place for lobster and steak hands down...besides Ocean Club at Kierland lol
