Wonderful just Wonderful... I have been to Centurion Twice and have had a wonderful experience both times.  You get to say hello and talk to the chef owner and he is extremely helpful in picking out wines.  Next up the food is excellent quality and at a decent price.  Expect $15 to $25 per person.  Every time my family and I have gone we have left with all of our plates completely clean and no doggy bags.  That is saying a lot.    I will go back again.  This is exactly what we need in phoenix in order to make downtown thrive.
