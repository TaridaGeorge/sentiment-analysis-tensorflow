Great sandwiches on fresh bread.  I can't get enough of the Hub Deli.  Their friendly staff always greets me with a smile, and makes my sandwich just as I want it!  Even with my substitutions and modifications, they always get it right.  The fresh chocolate chip cookies are a great bonus!  

The garlic sauce is more like a pesto, heavy on parsley and garlic.  It adds a great kick to the sandwiches!  The pepper sauce is spicy, but good!  I suggest getting it on the side to control the level on your sandwich.  The Hub's sandwiches are generously sized... If you're not fee;ing super hungry you could definitely share one!  

The menu is simple but creative, and there's something for everyone.  If not, they'll adapt it for you.
