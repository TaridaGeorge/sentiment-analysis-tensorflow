SO YUMMY!!! An excellent laid back environment. All employees were nice. I think he was the manager/owner with the red beard was super friendly. Can't wait to try every pasty on the menu. We had the chicken Alfredo and lamb mint both excellent. Only weird thing was that we didn't know what door to enter from and didn't know that we just seat ourselves.
