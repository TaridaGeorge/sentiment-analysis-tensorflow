WoW!  Located in the weirdest strip mall on the west side of town, is this piece of asian food heaven.   There's a Japanese restaurant, Cafe Ga Hyang, tattoo parlor, Siamese Kitchen then what looks like a heavy metal/rock bar..so strange but great at the same time!  Gotta love it!

They have an array of Chinese and Korean dishes which range from $5 for appetizers to $16.95 for one of their Korean dishes.  I had Kalbi dish, and it was delicious!  And I didn't share, because it was so good! 

It's a small restaurant, however, friendly staff and just great food to enjoy with friends and family!
