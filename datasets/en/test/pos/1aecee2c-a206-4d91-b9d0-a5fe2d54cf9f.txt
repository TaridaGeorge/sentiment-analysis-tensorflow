The beer here is world class.  Despite being open for so little time, I can already say Phoenix Ale Brewery will be *huge* in short time.  There's a taste here for everyone, despite having a small selection.  George is super friendly, and is happy to shoot the shit, or show you around.

My only complaint has to do with the location / building.  It's clearly just a brewery, with a drinking area, which is fine.  I'm waiting for the tap-bar with food to open in a good location!
