Great sandwich place!  Nice combination of flavors on the "Godmother", a sweet and spicy type sauce.  For $10ish you get a large sandwich, drink, chips and a very tasty chocolate chip cookie.

The blonde (didn't catch her name) was great about service and chatting up the customers.  The guys behind the counter were excellent at well.

It's a locally owned place, which is important to me.  I look forward to trying out new combos at this place!
