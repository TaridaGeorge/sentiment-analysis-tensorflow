Food was great! Drinks we're great! Service was great! The overall experience was awesome! After having a horrible experience at Thee Pitts Again we had to find a new BBQ place and we are glad to have found this one! We went on a Saturday night around 6 -7 and we had a 15-20 min wait which was well worth it. One of the managers brought us a sample of the Macaroni and Cheese.... IT WAS AMAZING! Almost needed a glass of milk to wash it down with! We will be returning!
