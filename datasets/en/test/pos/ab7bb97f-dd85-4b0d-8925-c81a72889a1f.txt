our first visit back in many years and the service has taken a turn for the better. 

we were greeted upon arrival and were never left unattended for more than a few minutes. i'm not sure what his position was, but an extremely knowledgeable and friendly employee made suggestions, answered questions, and his love of wine was evident when interacting with the customers. 

we only had a couple of glasses of wine, taking advantage of their excellent happy hour. they passed the water glass test with flying colors. and although we had dinner plans elsewhere, my mouth was watering at the sights and smells of their food. would love to re-visit for food and more drinks!
