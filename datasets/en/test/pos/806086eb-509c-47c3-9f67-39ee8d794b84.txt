Loved the BBQ aroma & menu. The steak, brisket sandwich & "death by chocolate" dessert were equally great! Service was awesome, too. This was our first trip, but won't be our last. It's a nice place, with a non-chain atmosphere. It was nice to have sports on TV, but not the overwhelming, ear-piercing noise that makes a conversation difficult.
