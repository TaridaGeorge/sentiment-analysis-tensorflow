Ah-Fricken-Mazing..... My friend had mentioned to me that this pizza place called "Spinatos" made a baked spaghetti calzone... Being preggo this sounded like the best thing EVER MADE! Last week i ordered one for lunch as take out. The guy who took my order was so nice, not the usual "I can give a rat's @$$" college student worker. When I picked it up ALL of the employees were on their game as far as customer service goes. The food...  it was very good. The crust tasted fresh and perfectly cooked, the spaghetti inside was tender, and the sausage was sweet and full of flavor. I can not wait to try their pizza! I will be back... very very soon.
