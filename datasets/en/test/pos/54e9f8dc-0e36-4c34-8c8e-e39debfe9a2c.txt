I went stand up paddle boarding here yesterday with Sarah H, a class through the city of Tempe, and we had a ball.  I was a little worried at first but it turned out to be pretty easy and a lot of fun.  Just being in the marina with the smell of the water and the sail boats everywhere reminded me of San Diego.  I never realized a piece of home was so close!
