Visited today and what a treat. Kelly's is very warm and comfortable. Sofas, pool table and a man cave. It does not get any better. Service was excellent , drinks were great. Did not get a chance to eat, but will be back Very Soon!!!!  Meet Brad the manager, great guy made us feel welcome. Kelly's is a great addition to south bridge of Old Town Scottsdale.
