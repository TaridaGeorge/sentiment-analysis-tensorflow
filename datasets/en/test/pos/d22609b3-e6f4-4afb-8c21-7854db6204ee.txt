Great dive bar with a hometown feel!  It was the first bar we visited while on our vacation in Scotsdale and we couldn't have been happier.  Great bloody mary and they even let us order food from next door to eat inside their place!!  They have great deals most days of the week but we didn't get a chance to come back...wish we did!
