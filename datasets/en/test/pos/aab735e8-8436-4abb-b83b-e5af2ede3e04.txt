Lunch at Cibo. We sat outside on a cool early December day and I must say that CIBO has the best atmosphere of any outside dining establishment in downtown phoenix. The pizza isn't as good as Pizzaria Bianco (PB)but I'm more likely to return to Cibo over PB due to the outside atmosphere. If you want to skip the pizza go for it, but DON'T skip the Nutella Crepe. Service was on the slow side, but I would say normal for any restaurant serving tables outside. I think it stems from how far the servers have to go from the kitchen and bar to outside. I will return.
