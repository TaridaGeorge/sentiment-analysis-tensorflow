I have been eating here since '92 and I love their food.  They have made a few changes over the years that I don't agree with, but change is necessary.  The employees are courteous and the service is great.  It's amazing that the cook can remember all the orders he takes at one time without messing them up.  I would recommend to come before noon or between 1pm and 3pm on weekdays, or you will be waiting in a very long line.  Regardless, I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good hot dog or hamburger.
