I came here with a friend visiting from out of town in March (group of about 6).  I got the Natie Bomb which is basically a twist on a traditional turkey bacon sandwich.  The sandwich and side salad were beyond my expectations for this place (which was hard to do since I already had high hopes). 

The place was a little corky and unique.  It was pretty busy so we had to sit outside.  Living in AZ, most know this can kill an experience.  NCounter had fans and misters outside so it was actually really nice.

The only downside is it took a little long for the food considering it was all pretty much sandwiches we ordered, but it was worth the wait.  I would recommend this place in a HEART BEAT!

Keep in mind when going, it is only open until 3:00 pm.
