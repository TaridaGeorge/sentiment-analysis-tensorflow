Lori and Lynn have created an amazing atmosphere here that makes you feel welcome and as if you are their most important customer.  Everyone takes care of you, not just one server. The food is always fresh and they will easily make anything you request.  I dream about the yellowtail because it is so fresh and tasty.  Those other sushi places are affected in my opinion and spend their money on fixtures instead of fish and staff.  Go here, you will love them.
