LOVE the staff here.. LOVE the little black dresses that ALWAYS fit me.. hard to accomplish in this short petite body with a bit of curve.. I mean.. its a 2 on top and 4 in the middle.. Im a member of the club.. and they always have an incentive at checkout.. sometimes I like .. and sometimes I pass.. depends on my AmX bill that month.. I have a beautiful white trench coat from here.. too long in the arm.. but they offered to send it out for me.. Ill even drive out of my way to go to this particular store..Date dress central.. yay!
