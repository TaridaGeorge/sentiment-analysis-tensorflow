wow i gotta start saying that i had the best salmon i had for a very very long time, i usually dont order fish when is beef on the menu lol i am 100% beefy person but what it got my eye it was cause it was serve with cold couscous and some pickle veggies that made me very happy :) 

we had a pitcher of sangria n it was very tasty as well ..... 

p.s. i usually dont eat bread before my meal but theirs it was sensational ...
