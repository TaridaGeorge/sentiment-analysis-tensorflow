I had no idea that the Little Gem was in Scottsdale... My colleague and I were on sales calls in Scottsdale and lunch time came around.. of course with so many great choices-Karen said " Have you been to Arcadia Farms.. I said No I had hear great reviews but never went... WOW! The setting is something out of SOHO in NYC-- very trendy but authentic... Great service and I ordered the goat cheese, wild mushroom tart ( like a mini quiche without the egg...) so very buttery and gooey and tasty.. It was divine! Don't miss out on this sophisticated cafe.... Great food and the setting is like you are in an older home for the early 1900's.. patios and lace! Love it..
