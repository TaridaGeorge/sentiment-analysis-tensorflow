I've never walked into a store like Walgreens and been greeted with such enthusiasm and and warmth.  I only came in buy some water, but I was greeted once upon walking into the store, another time while walking down an aisle and the cashier was gushing with customer service and wished me well as I walked out the door.

Color me super impressed!
