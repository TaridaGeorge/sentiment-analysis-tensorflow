The food here is fantastic.  I have been here many times and am always impressed with the service and food.  Their patio is "dog friendly" which is important to me.  I recommend the fish dishes and the fried rice.  Also the hot and sour soup is the perfect food for a cold day.  The staff here is helpful and friendly and very professional.
