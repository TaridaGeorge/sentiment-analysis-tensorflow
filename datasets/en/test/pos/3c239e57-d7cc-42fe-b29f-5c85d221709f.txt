If you love delicious, unqiue bruscetta, all olives, and rich, smooth wine, this place is for you! Not to mention the atmosphere is perfect for a romantic date, girlfriend gossip session, or even an (adult) family gathering. I've been many, many times, and have always gotten top notch service even when they're a full house,which is basically every weekend...so get there early.
