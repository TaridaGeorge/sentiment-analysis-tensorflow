How is it possible that I have never been here before?  What's wrong with me?  I must be slipping.  Anyway, I finally made it to Lost Leaf for the first ever Phoenix Yelp event and totally feel in love.  This just may be my new favorite place for a mid-week beer.  It is cozily small without being claustrophobic thanks to the raised ceiling and it is perfectly lit.  The music is at exactly the right volume to permit easy conversation (perfect!).  I showed up solo and ended up having a long conversation with a random cool guy at the bar who plays guitar in a couple of local bands.  And then the Yelpers descended.  The variety of seating (bar, high tops, and tables in a lounge area) and open format of the room made it perfect for the group gathering.  Am I over-using the word perfect?  Perhaps.  Perfect.
