This update is long overdue.  I've been back many times since my first casual encounter with FEZ.

Somehow my relationship with FEZ has both deepened and at the same time maintained a casual air.

Since my first review of FEZ (which happened to be review #200 for FEZ, not by accident) I have been back many times for lunch, dinner, events, book launches...many happy returns.

FEZ has in some way become a bit of a bfwb.  Benefits with a slight middle eastern flair at that.
