Butters is the greatest restaurant ever.
Pancakes are to die for and the omelets and scramblers are unreal.
This cafe/restaurant is the best breakfast joint in all of Arizona.
Service is amazing.
The two owners are always there and the kindest and funniest two guys I know.
If you are looking for good food and amazing service go to butter I guarantee you won't be disappointed
