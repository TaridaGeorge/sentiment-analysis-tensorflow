My good friend Sage was in phoenix yesterday, so we decided to have lunch at SWITCH. We had a late lunch, so the place was fairly empty. It was my first time there, so I was glad that we didn't have to wait to get a table. 
The establishment has a very nice decor with a warm atmosphere and easily accessible to the light rail. 
Service was attentive and the food was pretty good. Sage ordered the Switch Burger and I chose the East Port Lobster Roll. We didn't order any cocktails and instead had the Blueberry Sage Tea. I'm now a fan and I'm definitely coming back to try their brunch.
