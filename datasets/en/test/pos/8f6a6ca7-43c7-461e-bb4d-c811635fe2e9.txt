I have been living in Arizona for 4 years and have yet to find a decent Italian Beef Sandwich, until now.  I even gave the same statement to the owner.  I had ordered an Italian Beef for carry out, and while I was waiting, I let him know my frustrations.  He gave me his card and told me to call him after I ate the sandwich because he wanted to know what I thought.  Well, it was FANTASTIC!  Of course, I called him back to let him know.  

The service, and the time and effort put into the food cannot be beat.  This is what you get for a mom and pops type place.  

There are plenty of other sandwiches and foods there too.  I can't wait to go back and try some more!
