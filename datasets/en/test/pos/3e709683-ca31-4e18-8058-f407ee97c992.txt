Stayed here on New Years Eve and it was awesome!
Believe or it not I got a room here for $79 using Hotwire.  Having used Hotwire before, I have learned that many hotels tend to put their Hotwire and Priceline guests in the not so nice rooms, however Fairmont gave us a huge room with a really private balcony.  

The pool is fabulous with really comfy lounge chairs. The grounds are beautiful, staff is really friendly, fitness center is huge, all around it is a great experience!  

For our NYE celebration we went to Stone Rose Lounge in the Fairmont and it is a really fun and classy bar that I would recommend as well!
