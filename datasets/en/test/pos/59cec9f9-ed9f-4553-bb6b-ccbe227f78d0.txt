We found this shop while lookin for funky places that have great, one of a kind home decor.  WOW! The best..and the prices can't be beat. Chris was working there and he was so friendly and helpful.  There was a fantastic dark green leather sofa, beautiful...for only $50. (and NOT the kind that looks like airplane seats!) We would have bought it but we can't fit it into our home.   They have vintage, antique and just plain great stuff.  I bought a metal letter for my living room and we found the best red glass light fixture.  If you want unique stuff at unbeatable prices, visit MadMaxx's for real treasures. I will definatley visit again.
