I've always loved the Ho. It's the epitome of hip. 

Their rooms are scattered around a rather large sized parcel and are all extremely comfortable and designed in very urban chic furniture. The bathrooms are super cool with blue mood lighting and sliding frosted glass doors. They have a restaurant in the lobby which I've never tried, but it looks like pretty standard American fare. The beds are very comfortable, and they feature all new LCD tvs with iPod plug ins.
