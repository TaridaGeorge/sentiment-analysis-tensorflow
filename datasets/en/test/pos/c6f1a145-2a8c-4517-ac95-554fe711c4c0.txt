I recently went to this See's to get a few Christmas presents. First of all, this place is awesome because right when you walk in they have free samples! The store was very clean and the people who work here are exceptionally nice. I wanted to buy a Bordeaux bar (for my mom - its her fave). The girl behind the candy counter gave me a few Bordeaux samples since they were all sold out of the prepackaged ones. They offer city employees, employees in Alhambra school district and a bunch of other companies a discount at this location.
