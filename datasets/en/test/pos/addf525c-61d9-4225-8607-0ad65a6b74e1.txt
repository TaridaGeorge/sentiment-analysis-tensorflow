!!!!!!!!!! The best asian food I have had in the valley, by far. Each and every noodle dish that I have tried has been STELLAR (Beef Chow Fun, Singapore Noodles, Shrimp LoMein) as well as the Hawaiian Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Spicy Chicken, and probably a few more that I am forgetting! The only thing that could possibly improve are the chairs, but with food this good, I'd sit on cinderblocks, and LIKE it. :D
Even the iced tea is fabulous! The staff members are very very nice too! This is a must try!
