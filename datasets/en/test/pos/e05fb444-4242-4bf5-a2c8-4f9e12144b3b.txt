Love TLC Pet Sitting! Rachel has been taking care of Jasmine for 4 years now and we couldn't be happier. It's such a relief to know that someone is checking in on our kitty while we're away. Rachel always leaves a note even letting us know what Jasmine was up to even when she mostly sleeps the whole time. It's also go to know that someone is looking after the house. Everyone at TLC is so nice and you can really tell that they are animal lovers. Pet sitting is a perfect "alternative to boarding" and I wouldn't have it any other way.
