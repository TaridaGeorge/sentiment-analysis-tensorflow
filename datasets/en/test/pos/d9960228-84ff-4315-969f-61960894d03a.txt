What a find! I went here expecting to order a salad and was pleasantly surprised by the GLUTEN FREE PIZZA sign on the door. Yippee!!

The pizza was excellent (and that is not easy to do with gluten free)! I also loved the fennel salad. 

It was so nice to have the shop right there, we bought a bottle of wine and they were happy to just add it to our dinner bill rather than making two payments. 

We had outstanding service and did not have to wait more than 5 minutes for a table. I am traveling to Phoenix again this fall and this will be a must visit restaurant.
