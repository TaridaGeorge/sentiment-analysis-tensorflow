China Chili is my favorite Chinese Restaurant in Phoenix. They prepare their food the way you would at home without the typical mystery meat. The menu is full of lot's of choices. One of my favorites is the Honey Walnut Prawns. The Pillow Tofu is good even if you don't like Tofu. One of the Vegetable dishes (sides) that they are known for is their Spicy Garlic Eggplant.  The servings are large though, so consider sharing and getting a couple of items. The Chicken Salad is a great summer lunch dish. It is great to go. The managers are some of the nicest people you will meet.
