Greta place to be on a Friday night. We sat in the lounge area, next to the bar, and danced to the sounds provided by the live band. The food was top notch however, I did order the house special ( Ono Fish) that came out way under cooked. The waiter claimed he put on the ticked that I had asked for it to be cooked medium, but he took the blame and said he wrote it in error.  I have ordered fish many times and have never ever order it medium.  Non the less the manager came out and took it off our bill. The rest of the food was AMAZING!

Crab mash potatoes
Rack of Lamb
Mac & Cheese
The butter cake with ice cream was to die for!!  

We are already planning our next visit.
