I. Love. This. Place. 

We stopped by last Saturday night without knowing much about it, and we were not disappointed. The staff was friendly (albeit just a little slow), the atmosphere was simple and warm, and the music selection was killer. 

The beer list is extensive and interesting, with a wide variety that pleased everyone in my 7 person party. 

We didn't do a whole lot of eating, but what we did have was phenomenal. The fish and chips were flavorful, light, and perfectly battered. The cuban was one of the best I've had, and the chicken and beet salad was delicious. 

Overall, I'm glad to see a new place in Old Town that has some character and some great food. I'll definitely be back. Frequently.
