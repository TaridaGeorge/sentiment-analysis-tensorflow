I've lived a stone's throw from this place for 3 years now, and just today got to check it out for the first time.  

It's a simple deli that had a good sized lunch crowd.  I had the "sack lunch" combo that included a small sandwich, chips, cookie and a drink for $5 (+tax)!  I had the classic italian and it hit the spot!  Perfect size for lunch, didn't leave the place painfully stuffed.  I'll be back for more!
