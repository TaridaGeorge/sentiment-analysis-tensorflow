Im giving this 5 stars because at this location and at the time we went, it was great.  Amber I believe was our waitress and she couldn't have been more welcoming.  We went for an early lunch on a Sunday and it was only three of us.  

My girlfriend and I split their Kobe beef burger and while she likes the burgers near mooing.. Im more of a medium person.  She won, and the burger was mooing.  Let me tell you though.. it was delicious!  Their fries were good and crunchy and before hand we all had Caesar salads that just fit perfect.

Loved this place and we're thinking of making it a regular for weekend lunches!
