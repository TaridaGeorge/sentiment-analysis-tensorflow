I haven't been here in a while but I can't believe I forgot to review it. 

This place is one of my favorite spots to get a burger. They're open till 2am everyday. Their burgers are so delicious and juicy. They also have my favorite beer Chimay, which not many restaurants carry. 

The staff was nice the last time I went and before that but I don't know how they are now I'm sure they're great because the owner is a smart guy! 

If you're willing to spend $12-15 on a good burger, then this is your spot!
