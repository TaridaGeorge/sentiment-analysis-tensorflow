I LOVE THIS PLACE. 

Make reservations or call and get your name on the list at least one hour early....the wait is often 1-2 hours.

Yes it is a chain.  WHO CARES.

The quality is always top notch.  The service is great.  The fish is ultra super fresh 10,000 (if you end anything with 10,000 it means it is the best.)

Most fish are flown in only in season.  Right now you can get a lb of crawfish or a dozen oysters on the half shell for $3.95 (Wednesday nights it he best because fresh shell fish come in that morning.)

PS- Awesome and economic happy hour.
