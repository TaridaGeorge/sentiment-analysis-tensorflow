What a nice little airport! Super clean and neat the parking lot was trash free and the price of parking....cheap! Always a plus! We had no problem finding this airport but we also printed off directions before we came here. It is very small but again clean and we picked up our friend who took Allegiant and it was right on time.
I recommend!
