This place is totally underrated.  I would give this place a 4.5  

I come here every time I visit Phoenix for work and it does not disappoint.  I've had their ribeye steak, their osso bucco ravioli, and their cioppino and they are all excellent.  My favorite of the three being the cioppino which I ask for a little spicy, sans the noodles.  A big plate of the seafood & tomato broth and some crusty bread is all I need.

Tomaso is still the head chef of this place and is always trying out new dishes.  The best ones make it onto their printed specials list in their menu.  The last night I ate there, he had just flown in from Italy and still went to work testing dishes.  Lots of respect for hard-workers like that.
