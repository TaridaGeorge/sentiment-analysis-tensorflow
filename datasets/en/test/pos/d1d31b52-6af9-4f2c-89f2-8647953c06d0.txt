I have been to the Black Angus numerous times. This is an outstanding restaurant. The staff is great. They are always friendly, doesn't matter who is working, all are great. The food is EXCELLENT! Does not matter what you get, you can not go wrong. The manager is also such a nice person. She makes everyone feel welcome and encourages you to return and visit again. This is something I will do. This is my favorite place. Check out this awesome restaurant and bring the family.
