This place has breakfast that is like your momma's kitchen (if your momma can cook :-)

I like Cracker Barrel, but in my opinion, Biscuits has them beat. The staff is really friendly.

I've eaten: Eggs, pancakes, turkey sausage, Chirozos w/scrambled eggs, steel-cut oatmeal, fried catfish, and of course biscuits - and will be back to try everything else on the menu!

The important thing that has to be done now, is that we keep eating here, so that they will stay open  -or-  the option will be: don't keep eating here and let it close down and be stuck eating corporatization food.
