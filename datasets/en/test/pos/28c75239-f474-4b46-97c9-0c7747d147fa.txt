We have searched for a good Thai restaurant in the Scottsdale area, and this is now the only place we will go!!  Everyone is so friendly and the food is excellent.

Our favorites are the pad thai and the spicy basil leaves with chicken.  We probably go at least once a week and always get the same thing!!  The fried tofu is amazing too!
