I am so fortunate to live near this 36 hole course. The Adobe is a more traditional course with forgiving fairways and greens. The Links course encircles the Biltmore homes and will give you a better challenge with awkward lies and elevated tees. The courses can play very slow so you may want to try playing later in the day. You can't beat the rate if you live in the valley and the course is always in great shape for the amount of play. 

Staff is extremely friendly and the restaurant offers great food at a reasonable price. I would stay clear of the course on the weekends in the morning. You will play a 5+ hour round.
