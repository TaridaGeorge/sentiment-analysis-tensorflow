Absolutely WONDERFUL! Gino, the manager working the morning we went COMPLETELY took care of us. We arrived with a cranky 1yr. old and he immediately recognized that we needed some help. He ran to the back and brought out an apple juice for our little girl... AWESOME! The wait was 30+ minutes and after 5-10 minutes or so he stepped in once again to sit us down at a table. The level of customer service at The Breakfast Club and indeed Gino's help was  all the way.

On to the food... Our meal came out faster than expected and was very tasty. I got the steak and eggs which was great. My wife got a Benedict which was also tasty. I will be recommending this place to everyone I know based off the experience we had today. As for Gino, the manager... You can't pay enough for great help.
