Soooo good!

I'm so sad that this is the only Lee's in the valley and that I live far away from it...I would go all the time otherwise.  I had the #5 Grilled Pork Sandwich, and it was so satisfying, and lets not forget that they are under $3....take that Subway.  The #5 comes with thin sliced, marinated, grilled pieces of pork, with carrots, cilantro, jalapeno, onion, and mayo...on a delicious, fresh baked baguette.  Also had a mango smoothie with boba, and it was really good.

Really don't understand how anyone could give this place a low rating.  You will not find food this tasty, for this cheap at very many places.  Only downside I can think of is cash only...
