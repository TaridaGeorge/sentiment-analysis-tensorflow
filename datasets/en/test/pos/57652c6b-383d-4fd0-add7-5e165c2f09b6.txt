I really love this place. I think the other reviewers have done a fantastic job of sharing what this place is all about. It's a little bit pricy, but that's no problem, just find yourself a groupon or one of the other many online deals this place offers. 

I saw lizards, owls, all sorts of birds and adorable bunnies. The butterfly garden when it's open is wonderful. I really enjoy going for a walk here at sunset, just bring a lot of water when roaming around the desert gardens.
