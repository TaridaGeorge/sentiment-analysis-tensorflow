Sakana is such a treasure!  They have the best sushi in Scottsdale as far as I'm concerned.  From the location and front of the building you'd never expect it to be as good as it is.  They display their daily special rolls in the front and they always are so tempting I have to try at least one.  My favorite thing on the menu is the baked scallop roll.  If you've never had one, you MUST try it here!!!!  Seems like other people love it too because they get busy every evening and usually have a wait.  If you don't like to wait, avoid the prime times.  They also have great happy hour and customer appreciation nights.
