I was raised in the south and moved to Los Angeles. After eating soul food in the south, I wanted to try my taste buds to something differ. I feel in love for the Korean style BBQ. I went to the Phoenix to shoot a film and came across this restaurant.  This is bar none to any Korean or Japanese food i have ever eaten. The  Shrimp Tempura 5pcs and the Beef Ribs was my favorites. And the young waiter/cashier was very professional in help me with my order. I hope to visit Phoenix again soon.
