If you are looking for the best coffee and pastries in Phx look no further. The honey latte here is by far my favorite as well as any cookie, or the salted caramel bar. The staff here really know their coffee, not to mention they are all really cool people as well. If you are in downtown make it a point to stop in !!!!
