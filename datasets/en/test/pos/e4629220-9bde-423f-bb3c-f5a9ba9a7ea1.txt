If you know downtown/central Phoenix then you know there is no shortage of great coffee shops. Songbird offers a hip new option for coffee, tea, breakfast, and other eats on the quickly transforming Roosevelt Row. The owners are super friendly and are passionate about what they do. I've tried a number of menu items, including the pour over coffee, iced mocha and chai latte, all were very flavorful. I really like that you can have your drinks served in reusable glasses and ceramic mugs. There are a lot of outlets and free wi-fi in the dining room. I'm excited for the future of Songbird!
