I really loved this place.  Went for their ribbon cutting and grand opening.  Went back that night with my family for dinner.  It was great.  This is the first place my daughter, who is 10, would eat a hamburger.  She loved it.  I would recommend it to anyone.  We will be back.  Staff was great.  Everyone was very friendly and helpful.
