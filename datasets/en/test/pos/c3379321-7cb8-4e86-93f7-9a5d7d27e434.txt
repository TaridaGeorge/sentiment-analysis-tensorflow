Was on the way to Houston from CA, and stopped by to eat here at the CPC, and damn it was really really good! I think it's a sin if you pass up this place when in Arizona.

Kinda confused cause when I walked in, but you can either sit at the bar or tables w/ the menus already on there.

Think about it this way. You'll have the best hot pocket ever. and only in Arizona!
