This remains my favorite restaurant in the valley.  It is expensive and you'll be here quite a while so be prepared for both.  The tasting menu is the way to go and it's fun to go with a group so you get to try even more things.  We go there several times a year and they know us which is pretty impressive.  The staff and service are always excellent.  If you're looking for a special experience, this is it.
