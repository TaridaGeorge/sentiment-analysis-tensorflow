These guys are great!I  Even though they specialize in Mercedes, they never have a problem with my BMW X5. The owner, Charles, knows what he is doing and never tries to up-sell you on unnecessary work.  Mary (Charles' wife) is a really sweet lady who always gives me a ride home and picks me up when the car is ready.  While Aurohaus doesn't have loaner cars like the dealership, they are extremely competent, trustworthy, and charge reasonable prices for their services.
