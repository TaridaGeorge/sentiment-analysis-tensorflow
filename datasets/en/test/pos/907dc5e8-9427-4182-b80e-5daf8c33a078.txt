Stayed at the hotel from 11/18 till 11/23/12. Excellent hotel and the stuff was great. Originally was supposed to come during Hurricane Sandy and couldn't fly out as I was affected by the storm.. The hotel staff had no problem changing my reservation and didn't even change the price. Everything was great. The room was clean. The pool was excellent.
