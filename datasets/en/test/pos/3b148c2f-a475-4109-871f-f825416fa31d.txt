With 4 kids always clamoring for dessert, take my word for it when I say we've sampled just about every yogurt place in the Scottsdale area.

Our family verdict is unanimous: Yogurtology is the best! Best flavors, best quality, best consistency, etc. etc.  (BTW, it's not often that you get our 4 kids to agree on ANYTHING)

We event went "Scottsdale" and brought our dog this last time to sample their doggie yogurt.  She never looked up until it was gone.  And, much to our delight, she had no issues afterwards (don't want to get too graphic, but I think you all probably know what can happen when you give a dog something that doesn't agree with his/her system : )

The Oatmeal Cookie flavor rocks! Get some raisins from one of the granola canisters to complete the recipe.
