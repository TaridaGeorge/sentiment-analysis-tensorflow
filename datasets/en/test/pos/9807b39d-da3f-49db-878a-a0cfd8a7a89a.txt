Found out this place finally open so some friends and I here at the office decided to give it a try.... Ordered online... very quick and easy.... Order was ready when requested.... just to add... I had an order of 11 sandwiches.... As there where packing all the sandwiches in a single large bag, I was going to order a drink, and the kind gentleman offered it to me for free.. nice!!.... Got back to the office and everyone was happy... all sandwiches where made to perfection and as requested... nothing missing nothing extra... The Philly was perfect, but I would suggest that you order extra cheese on it if you like'em cheesy.... we will definitely be returning in the near future..
