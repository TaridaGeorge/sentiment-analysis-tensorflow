They used to be a bit better, the portion sizes were smaller and just perfect. Their soups are really good, the scramblers are better, the sandwiches are amazing, I love that you can have a healthy breakfast here. The Ravioli is to die for!!! Overall, I love it and I go again and again and again. :)
