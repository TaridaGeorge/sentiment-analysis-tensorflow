This review is purely for the Banana Cream Pie.....as I am from Australia I had never had Banana Cream Pie....so my husband ( who had a major craving for one)...phoned around some restaurants to find where they served them....The White Chocolate Grill delivered!...It was awesome and made on site. Our waiter was very friendly and didn't mind that we were taking up a table in a very full restaurant just to share a piece of pie. The atmosphere was very nice too and next time we will go before we eat dinner and order a little more! The menu looks very good.
