We just love the Phoenix City Grill!  So, for years now a bunch of people from our church would just bombard the Phoenix City Grill on Sunday night for a late dinner....sometimes we had up to 20 people with us and the Grill always accommodated us with great food and service.  Now, I just have to tell you this story:  Friday night we had our son's high school graduation and we invited our family and friends with us to the grill afterwards.  It was 9:45pm when we showed up with 17 people and the Grill closes at 10pm...they stayed open for us!  That's what a GREAT restaurant does!  We had a lovely time having an impromptu celebration and the Grill served wonderful appetizers - highly recommend the cheese dip, tacos, and sliders!  Thank you for being accommodating Phoenix City Grill!  We will be back!  Cindy
