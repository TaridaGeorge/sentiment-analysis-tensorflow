I consider myself a tough critic. When people tell me to try something new and "it's the best", I say to myself, "yeah right... I'll see about that". But no, Cheba hut is that good. Granted I *HAVE* had some poor sandwiches here, but jesus christ, nothing touches the afghani. Nothing! I've tried tons of different subs shops, and this is my favorite. 

Staff is always super chill (obviously) and the inside definitely does need to be remodeled, but I can't knock it. It's so good.
