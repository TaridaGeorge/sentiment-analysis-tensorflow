Love F&E!!! I can't buy everything I need there but they had the majority of what I need. I really like the discount section (it may be disorderly but it is a discount section)...always stock up on meat and freeze it. 

Also, I like that I can bring my grocery bags there and they recycle them because we cannot recycle them through our service at home. 

Make sure you sign up for the Friends card. You receive an email that always has an $8 off $40 coupon plus they are now sending you coupons based off of your purchases. I bought $72 worth of food (meat), mostly from the discount section, and with that coupon and a couple others I only paid $32. Can't beat that!!
