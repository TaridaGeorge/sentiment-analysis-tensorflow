Amazing customer service.  A day ago I picked up 4 cupcakes for a birthday.   As I entered my house, the box broke due to a lack of adhesive.  I called and they had no problem giving me replacement cupcakes.  They were ready as soon as I came into the store.   Just great!   Thanks again!  Not sure if any other cupcake bakery would do the same, thats why I'll continue to come to Sprinkles!
