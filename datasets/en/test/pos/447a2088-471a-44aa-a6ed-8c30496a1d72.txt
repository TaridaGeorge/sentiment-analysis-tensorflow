Awesome, awesome, awesome park that has a one mile loop for walking/jogging, but also links up with the canal if you want to go for a longer jaunt.  Tons of play equipment for itty bitty kids as well as bigger ones.  Frisbee golf, dog park, archery range.  Other amenities include tons of parking and restroom facilities.
