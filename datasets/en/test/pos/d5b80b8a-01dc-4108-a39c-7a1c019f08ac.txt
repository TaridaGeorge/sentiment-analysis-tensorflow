I was so happy to see them at the City North Farmer's Market.  I bought the Bbq Pork single pies and the Steak Fajita.  I had a taste of the apple one. YUM!  These are awesome options when the hubby is out of town or if you have people show up suddenly.  Quick salad and a little pie, ta da! lunch.
As a matter of fact, I am going to cook a few for a brunch am throwing next week.  They are so flaky and buttery delicious.  Can't wait to try other flavors.
