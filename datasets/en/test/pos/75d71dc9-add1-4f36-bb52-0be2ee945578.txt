Mmmm... Double char burger is excellent.  Tastes like a char-grilled burger.  I also love their fries, they're long and skinny, and bigger than In & Out Burger's.  Habit Burger has an interesting look to them, they look like little houses or something.  They look like they have a little tower or top story, there is a window up there anyways.  Inside they are clean and cozy.  The food is great and I love how they give you the pager so you can wait for your order and then know immediately when it's ready.  Service is top notch here as well. Did I mention the prices are great too?  Way cheaper than Smashburger and Five Guys.
