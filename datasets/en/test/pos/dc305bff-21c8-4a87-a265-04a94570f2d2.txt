Well, it ain't cheap here.  I paid $3.25 for two flavors in a small cup (bigger than the normal cup size, tho, you get at frozen food stands), but I have to say that this is THE BEST gelato I've ever had...and, frankly, you do get enough--and it is rich enough--to totally satisfy you with this one cup holding two flavors of your choice. 
Lots of choices and some of them are offbeat, so the place is a veritable wonderland of fattening icy treats.  Frankly, my thighs don't want to thank this place but my taste buds do.
Go to this place.  It really is worth it.
