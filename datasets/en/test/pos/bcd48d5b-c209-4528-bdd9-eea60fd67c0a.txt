I was never one to go to a chiropractor, but in a desperate attempt to get some pain relief one day I went to The Joint, and now I am hooked!  I love that you don't need an appointment, and I have never had to wait more than 10 minutes to be seen.  Dr. Lees is awesome!!!  I don't have a monthly membership because I don't go that often, but I did buy a package and it is a great deal!!

Being in alignment is good for so many reasons health wise, so go see Dr. Lees and get straightened out!
