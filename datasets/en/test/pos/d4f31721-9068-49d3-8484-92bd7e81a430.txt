I have been a customer at Big O Tires for years.  Been to many different store through out the country and this is one of the best ones that I have been to.  The service was fast.  The prices where fair and they informed me of online coupons that I could use for the future.  I compared tire prices with Discount and Big O is right in line with comparable tires.  The nice thing about Big O is they can do alignments when they put on the new tires unlike Discount Tire.  I would highly rec. you go and see them for all your automotive needs.  Again great service and prices and a great group of guys that work the front counter.
