You can drive by this place forever and not know they have the best sandwiches in Phoenix!!  All of the ingredients are super fresh.  Biting in the bread is like biting into a little heaven cloud.  So soft and delicious it's almost not fair that other places have to compete.  I'm not a big fan of deli sides (potato salad, macaroni salad) but the ol lady says the macaroni salad is some of the best she's ever had.  The menu is a little hard to see as it is scattered but have no fear, if you don't find one you like, they'll make you one however you want it.  Family run and the owners are very nice.
