I heart Essence.  Oh the food just speaks for itself.  If you're looking for a casual yet delectable breakfast experience, I would definitely recommend this place.  I've been looking for a good restaurant with French influence and the food really brings me back to Paris.  I'm in love with the pastries here, especially the pecan cookies (is that browned butter I taste?) and the croissants.  This place is a gem!
