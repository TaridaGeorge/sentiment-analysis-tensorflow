Very quaint coffee spot, that also serves breakfast and lunch. Their coffee is consistently good and they have almond and soy options for lactards like me. I've had both their breakfast sandwich and tartine which they were able to make lactose free (sans butter) for me, both were made using fresh veggies and herbs. I now crave these dishes on a regular basis.
