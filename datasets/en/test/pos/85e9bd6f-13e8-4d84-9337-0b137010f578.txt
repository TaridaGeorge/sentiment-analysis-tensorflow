My family and I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Arrivederci! Every dish we've had has been excellent. I love the eggplant so much, I can't bear to get anything else! The wait staff is SUPERB! They make us feel like family there. When my grown kids come back to town, they absolutely must go to Arrivederci! The atmosphere is so quaint and comfortable.  I could go on and on. We will be a party of 9 there tonight and I just can't wait! :) Arrivederci.....here we come!
