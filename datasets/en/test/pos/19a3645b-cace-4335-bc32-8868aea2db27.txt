I live in Portland OR now, so it's been about 5 years since Ive been here. 

Phoenix has many restaurants with so much fast food and mediocre chain food places. But there are also some really great places to eat. You just have to know where to go. 

This is not traditional Italian, but I'm cool with that. Chicken Parmesan with garlic mashed potatoes? great! Hook me up with that chicken sampler: stuffed chicken with the marsala is soo good. 

The desserts I have tried were amazing. Inventive menu, consistently great and a pleasant escape from the suburban grind. This was easily my favorite place to eat in the Phoenix, Glendale area. Other than the Italian festival. I miss some good Italian.
