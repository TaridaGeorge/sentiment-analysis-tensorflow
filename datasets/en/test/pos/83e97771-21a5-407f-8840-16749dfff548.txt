I usually have a Teriyaki or sweet and sour chicken bowl.  The price is good and the food is even better.  I've been going to Blue Fin since 2005.  The personable and quick customer service makes the experience all the better.  It's easily accessible by the lightrail and north from the Central Library.  Love this place.
