What a great experience. I went with my wife and friends last weekend. We have been going to the Biltmore resort for years and never went to this restaurant. Having managed at the top two restaurants in Phoenix, I went in with some pretty high standards. We were really impressed with not only the taste of the food, but the presentation of the food as well. The service was friendly, detailed, professional and they did not rush us. We shared the seafood platter and the Foie Gras terrine. Both were fresh and the flavors were fabolous. We all got our own entrees, but the presentation on the lamb rack was fantastic. Everthing live up to the hype. We can't wait to go back again.
