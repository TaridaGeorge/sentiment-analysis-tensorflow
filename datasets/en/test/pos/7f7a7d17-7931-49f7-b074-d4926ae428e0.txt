Had lunch here yeasterday and it was fantastic as usual.  It does not seem to matter what you order the meats are all fantastic.  If you are not sure what you want they will let you sample a few things first.  I do have to say that so far I have not found a side item that is any were near as good as the meats.  I have tried the coleslaw, potato salid, cream corn and corn on the cob, all just ok.  But who cares the meats are so good you wont want to waist a single bite on anything else.  So skip them and get more meat you can't go wrong.  The Bannana puddings is very good though.
