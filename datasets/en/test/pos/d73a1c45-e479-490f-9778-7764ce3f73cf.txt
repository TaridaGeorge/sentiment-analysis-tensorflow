Love love love! This is the go-to place when my boyfriend and I want sushi. And we are sushi lovers.

The prices are ridiculously low for the quality and location. Regardless of pricing, the sushi is still the best in the Valley (in my opinion). This is also coming from a Japanese girl :)

In our most recent visit, my boyfriend and I sat at the sushi bar and asked the chef for a recommendation. We ordered the Hawaiian Ono sashimi because of it, and it was tasty! We love our standard selection, but it's nice to order new things every now and then.

When you go for lunch, the specials are even cheaper in price and just as delicious. I have no complaints about this place.
