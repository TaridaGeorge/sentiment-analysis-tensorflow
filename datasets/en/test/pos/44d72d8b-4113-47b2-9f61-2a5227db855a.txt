If you are a Gyro connoisseur your journey will not be complete without trying this wonderful Afghani restaurant. Sliced thick, not at all greasy, and very few fillers. The accompanying salad was incredibly refreshing: mixed greens, tomato, red pepper, cucumber etc. with a delicate lemon vinegar dressing sprinkled with herbs. The tzatziki was made with sour cream, I think. The basmati rice was phenomenal.  Generous portions. Hearty flatbread, grilled and thick enough to be torn up and used as a utensil for scooping up these delectable foods. Served with a side of an addictive green sauce (cilantro, garlic, chilis)  $23 for two. The brothers working that evening were extremely personable, very knowledgeable and attentive.  Decorated with beautiful Afghani paintings & prints on the walls. We'll be back soon. Take out & 2 mile radius delivery.
