Friendly, helpful staff... The people who work here actually know where things are (in contrast with big grocery stores, you can be sent on a wild goose chase!!). Love the fruits&veggies-- always fresh. Only place I'll buy meat and they have a good selection. Look through the different dips/salsas/hummus that they have... Big selection and tasty options. You can find unusual things here (one of my favs is the COOKIE BUTTER, yup... Like a peanut butter substance, but absolutely delicious taste of gingerbread!!!). Love the wine and beer selection and all their unusual desserts and snacks they carry!
