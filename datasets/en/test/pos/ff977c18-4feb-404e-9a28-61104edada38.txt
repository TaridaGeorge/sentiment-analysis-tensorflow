I LOVE QT...this is the best place to buy a soda, energy drinks, gas and sometimes beer. Their prices are usually better than the local grocery store and I don't have to drive as far. It's kind of weird that a case of beer would be cheaper at a gas station, but I'm not complaining. Stores are always spotless with clean bathrooms, building and outside are well lit and inviting, staff is super friendly (always rated one of the best places to work in Phoenix) and everything is decently priced. There is a reason these places are always busy.
