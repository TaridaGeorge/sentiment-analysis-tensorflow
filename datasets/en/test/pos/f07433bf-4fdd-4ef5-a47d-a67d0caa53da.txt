I think you can tell a lot about Mexican restaurant from they're enchiladas sauce. 
And the beef enchiladas were delightful! 
The sauce has a little hint of heat, that makes you come back for more. 
You can't go wrong with over 150 different types of tequila! 
Wish it was closer to my place. 

If you ever in the area def have to stop by
