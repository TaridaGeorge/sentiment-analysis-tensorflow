Riazzi's is what I picture when I think of a small, family owned Italian restaurant. Completely unpretentious, yet has an almost elegant feel. From the moment you walk through the patio of twinkle lights and in the front door you're waited on hand and foot, like a true guest in their "house". I don't think my water glass got below 1" from the rim because the waiter was so attentive! The fresh bread was delicious, and my lasagna was incredible. I'll definitely be back soon.
