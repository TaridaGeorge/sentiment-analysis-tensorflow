I am always looking for something original in the Phoenix area, and Joe's BBQ is definitely one of those few places. The food is really great (I'm generally not much of a red meat eater, but I love the brisket sandwich). The atmosphere is pleasant too, with plenty of booths and tables and outside picnic tables (or you can get takeout at the window on the south side of the building). Don't let the line scare you; it moves quickly, and if you go off hours (1 or 2 PM, even on weekends), you can find an indoor table immediately.
