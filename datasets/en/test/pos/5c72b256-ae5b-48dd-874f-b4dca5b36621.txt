Love the salads, the thin crust pizzas, and the pizookie!!! All of the salads and thin crust pizzas are delicious, I cannot recommend one pizza or salad over another. Just go with whatever strikes you at the moment. I'm happy I live right by here so I can go often. I love walking by and smelling all the deliciousness wafting from the restaurant. I like sitting outdoors here. I can't comment on the Chicago style pizza because I personally do not like thick pizzas.
