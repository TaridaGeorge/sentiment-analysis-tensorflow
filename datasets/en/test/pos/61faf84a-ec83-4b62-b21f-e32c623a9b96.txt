I hate to be unoriginal, but what I've read before was true yesterday. Ambiance is wonderful, the place couldn't be better for a date (I was, however, there with my dissertation chair - not so romantic - lol). The lunch special was wonderful, a variation on a steak sandwich second to none I've had. The servers were all pleasant and mellow, which is a nice change of pace from the hustle and bustle of usual lunch rushes. Highly recommend!
