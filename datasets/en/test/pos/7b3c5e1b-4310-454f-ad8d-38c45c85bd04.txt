I went to Papaya to pick up a takeout order today. The service here is always friendly and fast.  We ordered spring rolls, lemon grass soup and the pineapple curry with beef.  The pineapple curry is our favorite but ALL the curries are mouth watering good.  The food was delicious and fresh.  The prices are fair for quality of what you are getting which is always good and at least 2 or more servings. My fianc√© and I have been going to Papaya Thai for almost  2 years and have always had great food.
