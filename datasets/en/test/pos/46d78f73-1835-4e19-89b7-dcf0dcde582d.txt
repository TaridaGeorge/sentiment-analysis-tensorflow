I never wanted to wait in the long lines in Brooklyn to try this infamous pizza.  Now I know the reason for the lines under the venerable Brooklyn Bridge - it isn't just a tourist thing - as far as NY pizza goes, this is as good as I have had.  Everything was fresh and outstanding - the pizza, the salad and the desserts (cheesecake, tiramasu & cannoli).
