So glad this place is in my neighborhood.....My husband, and 3.5 year old son walk here about once sometimes twice a week.  They are kid friendly, laid back and have just the best service.  We love the bruschetta , and the "pub board" and the kid's MIX AND MATCH.  The wine never disappoints and the atmosphere is lovely.  How did we survive without them?  Once they found out that we live in the hood...they slipped us a drink or 2....how cool is that??  I shall cry tears if they ever leave!
