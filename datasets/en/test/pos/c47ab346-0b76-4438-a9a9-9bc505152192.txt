Don't ask me about anything on the menu except the bruschetta, I've never been able to get past it.  Many different inventive delicious toppings on perfectly toasted slices of rustic bread, served on a narrow wooden platter.  Each and every bite is to die for, and they have a good glass wine.

The only thing I don't like is the loud techno music.  Everyone yells to be heard above it.  Which means I have to, too.
