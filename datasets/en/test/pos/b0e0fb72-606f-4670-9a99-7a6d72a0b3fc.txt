I love this spot and hike it at least once a week.  There are lots of different trails and few people.  The views are great, hence the name Lookout Mountain.  There are also good mountain biking trails.  It is a short trail to the summit, but steep.  Depending on the trails you take you can make it short and sweet (20-30minutes) or a few hours.
