I love Jeannie & Spatini!!  I have been going to Spatini for a year and a half now and Jeannie is the best gel manicurist around!  She is licensed to teach other people how to do Gelish manicures so she really is the best of the best.  She has tons of colors and is always getting new ones.  She is open to doing fun designs all for a very low price!  Once you go to Spatini you will never want to go anywhere else!  She is by appointment only but she has an online booking option that is super easy and convenient.  

My latest "matte" manicure may just be my favorite one yet... good luck topping this one Jeannie! :)
