Insanely good! Their cupcakes are the most delicious cupcakes I have ever had. Their buttercream frosting reminds me of my grandmothers. We had the pleasure of meeting the owner the last time my friend and I stopped in, and she was so very sweet. The store is pretty and bright, and has parking right in front if you are just running in. 
You also can get six cupcakes for about $22 which is not bad at all. I usually grab these for a treat on the weekends and they rarely make it past the first day. 

If you stop by- definitely try the signature chocolate and the birthday cake. You won't be sorry :-)
