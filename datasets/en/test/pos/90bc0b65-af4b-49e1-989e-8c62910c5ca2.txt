This place offers great happy hour discounts and the rolls, as the other reviews state, are fresh, well made and most importantly delicious! I know some people like to go for the 'cheapest' most basic rolls for sushi like spicy tuna/california, but I would highly recommend their specialty rolls (What the Heck is my fav) as they are really creative/unique, and very, very tasty. It's definitely worth stopping by if you are close by if you are a fan of good sushi. Fantastic customer service too!
