As a frequent business traveler, I can easily say that the clarendon is one of the few hotels I would want to return to on my own dime.  The staff is lovely, the pool is wonderful.  Great colors & artwork everywhere around the hotel.  The food at the C4 restaurant below is absolutely worth checking out (try the chop salad!).  The rooms themselves are definitely a notch above what you would normally find.  And really... the place just has incredible character.  Looking forward to my next trip to Phoenix, just to stay there.
