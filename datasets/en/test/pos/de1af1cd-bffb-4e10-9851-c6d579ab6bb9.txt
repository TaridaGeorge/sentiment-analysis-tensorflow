I loved Uncle Sal's!  I was visiting and rented a condo down the street.  Everywhere I went people recommended it.  We sat in the bar and the staff was awesome, the wine was great, the food was delicious and affordable.  About a week later we went to The Side Door, a little pub attached to Uncle Sal's and same owner.  I had an excellent Chicago hot dog and my friend had the best mac and cheese.  Then we went into Uncle Sal's and had tiramasu for desert.  SO good!
