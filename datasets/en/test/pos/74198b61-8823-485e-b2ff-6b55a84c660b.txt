unPhogettable was a great restaurant! I was particularly happy to see that they have three vegetarian dishes under a separate vegetarian menu heading. They can also make vegetarian pho with vegetable stock. They have vegetarian spring rolls and crispy spring rolls. I ordered the vegetarian flat noodles, my mother ordered the vegetarian pho, and my husband ordered the vermicelli noodles with shrimp. We got an order of vegetarian spring rolls to share. Everything was excellent! The owners were super friendly and the service was fast and courteous. I love the fact that they have various sauces and utensils at the table so that you can experiment with flavors without having to keep asking the waiter to bring you over some more sauce. We will definitely be back!
