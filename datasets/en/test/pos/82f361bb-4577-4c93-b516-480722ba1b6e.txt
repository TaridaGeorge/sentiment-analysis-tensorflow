Thankfully the poor service we experienced shortly after this place opened seems to have been addressed.  We have been back twice since and both times were fantastic.  a little bit slow, but with the atmosphere and music that plays, we didnt mind taking our time to enjoy the wonderful food that is served here.  I am happy to report that while we miss Sens, we very much enjoy Sochu and will go back again!
