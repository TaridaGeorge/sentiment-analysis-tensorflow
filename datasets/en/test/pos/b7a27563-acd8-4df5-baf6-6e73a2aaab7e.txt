I went to see "Saving Tania's Privates" on 10/09/10. The Phoenix Little Theatre was a perfect venue for this event. Since the show had some delicate and poignant scenes, the small stage was perfect for showcasings these gems. Tania  Katan is deserving of a purple heart for courage for her role as sole writer and performer of this fact based phenomenon. The theatre is small and intimate, ensuring there are no "bad seats" in the house.
