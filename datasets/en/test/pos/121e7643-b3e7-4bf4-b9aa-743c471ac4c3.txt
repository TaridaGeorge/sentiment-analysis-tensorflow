Shauna's still jammin' and as amazing as ever! I love the events she's started to put on such as Picket Fences. I visited Picket Fences last week and giggled in delight at the site of the amazing vendors out selling their products. One lady was selling seasoned sugars, another was selling beautiful glass bottles and yet another was selling homemade biscottis. JAM is all about supporting local and they do an amazing job of doing this by hosting an event like this and housing products that are perfect gifts and timeless pieces.
