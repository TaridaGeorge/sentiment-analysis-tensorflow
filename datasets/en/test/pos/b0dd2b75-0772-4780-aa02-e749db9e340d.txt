This. Place. Is. GOOD. Very good! My husband had been nagging me to try this little place, but we are late dinner people when we're out, so the "earlier than most restaurant closing hours" didn't mesh with our schedule for a few weeks. It was worth the hassle to coordinate!! The Dirty Rice was incredible, and may just be my new favorite order out comfort food. We also had fried oyster Po' Boys, and oh my heck, they were THE most incredible sandwiches EVER. Give this tiny lil place a try, family and locally owned!!!!
