oh pita jungle. how do i love thee? let me count the ways...

PJ is one of the only places I can bring my parents (Hearty Midwestern Carnivores) and still eat healthy/veg. They love the art. 

The food is incredible.   Whether you get a salad, combo plate or Philly Chix Pita... it all rocks. (Except the chix tikka masala special - no good)

Plus, being in the PJ atmosphere just makes you feeeeeel cool. 

I witnessed a funny/classic PJ situation when a mom ordered her son decaf coffee (why? i dont know...) and they only had regular. the server poured a cup of regular, handed it to the kid and said to the mom - "Welcome to The Jungle."

You have to have a sense of humor and a laid back personality to really appreciate the greatness of such a quirky, honest little joint.  Enjoy yourself!
