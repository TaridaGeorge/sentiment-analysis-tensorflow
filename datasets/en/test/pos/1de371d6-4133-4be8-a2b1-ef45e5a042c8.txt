My family has been going here for many years.  It is consistently a great place for good tasting authentic Chinese food at reasonable prices, with generous portion sizes and very courteous service.  I would also like to add that the ceilings and walls are covered in very beautiful Chinese decorations.  The background music is soft and soothing.  It's a very peaceful place.  

They also have a take out menu, and their food is quite delcious.
