Love this location!! My friend and I come here all the time to catch up on work stuff. We always sit in the bar and have THE best service. Eric is awesome. He's our favorite waiter, but there are four or five other servers who work the bar that are just as phenomenal. We are usually here between 3 and 5 and have never had an issue with seating or service. 
They have a great happy hour, too!!
