I lived here for about 1 year back in 2009.  I loved it!  Great location, the 1 bed/1bath was perfect for my first place by myself. I liked the wood style floor in the kitchen and big bathroom with full sized washer and dryer in it.   I used the workout room every day.  Never got a chance to use the pool, but it looked nice enough.  Maintenance was responsive and fixed my garbage disposal the same day I called.  Loved having a parking garage and the trash boxes are right outside your door and emptied daily so you don't have to lug your trash to a far away dumpster!!  Staff was friendly.  Felt very safe in a gated community.
