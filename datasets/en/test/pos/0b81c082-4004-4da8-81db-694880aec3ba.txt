Lucky Star was recommended to me by a female friend who described them as honest, knowledgeable and willing to communicate openly with a customer about the work they suggest. I have been here for my A/C and for new tires and each experience has been very pleasant and FAR less expensive than anticipated. The staff are authentic and kind people. It is family owned and operated and you can tell they strive to do good work.
