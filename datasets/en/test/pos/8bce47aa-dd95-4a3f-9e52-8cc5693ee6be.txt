Hands down, the best Pho in Arizona.  Do I dare say that it's better than my mom's???? (dodging lightning strikes now)

My friends and I call it Taco Bell Pho, since it looks like an old taco bell.  The food is amazing, the service is horrible, and the prices are awesome.  I've been going here, since I moved from Chicago ten years ago.  

What to order?  Look at the Pho list and pick the most expensive thing, and you'll know your pho will have every thing and more in it.  If you're afraid of tripe or some other ingredients, go with the Bo Vien.

The true test was when my parents came here to visit me, and she also told me this was the best pho she's had in AZ.
