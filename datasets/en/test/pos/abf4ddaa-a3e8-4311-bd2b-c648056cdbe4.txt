I loved the food at Los Reyes de la Torta. The service was no good, but the food more than made up for it.

I had Alambre de res which was very good. My only complaint was the small portion of rice and the beans- I was not sure what was going on with the beans. My husband had la torta de rey which he enjoyed. The torta is definitely something to share with another person. 

Although the food is not better than the Mexican food I or my mom make, this is definitely the place to go for me when I don't feel like cooking my own Mexican dinner.

P.S. Try the Fresas  con Crema sold in the refrigerator behind the front counter. They are the best I have had!
