The very italian owner is so nice and apparently uses a family  recipe.  It's incredible! you get three flavors with a medium.  FYI, the Whisky cream is amazing.  I also had peanut butter and a chocolate chip.  All were very good! My wife had biscotti, cappucino, and dulche latte.  All were delicious.  We are only in phoenix for 5 days, but we plan to go again while we are here!
