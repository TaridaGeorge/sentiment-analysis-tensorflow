Today was the second time that I have gone to Red Mango and both times I was really satisfied with their products and their service. Their smoothies are wonderful! You can taste the fruit and not the sugar as you get in some other places. Their frozen yogurt is also great, my favorite is the pomegranate frozen yogurt, amazing!! Today I also tried their pumpkin yogurt which must be a seasonal flavor and  was also great, like frozen pumpkin pie.  This is definitely my new favorite frozen yogurt place.
