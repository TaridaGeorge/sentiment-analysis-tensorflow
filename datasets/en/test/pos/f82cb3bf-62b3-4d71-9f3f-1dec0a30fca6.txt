Probably the best tasting food in Tempe. Its like mouth watering delicious. I haven't been there in a long time, and I forgot how damn good it is... Its like every bite you
are in heaven. 

I dont go here often because I tell myself $10 is too much for just one item, I wish it would come with a side. But thinking about it, its like $2 more than you would pay for something else at like say Chipotle. So its totally worth the extra $2 to get something you cant get anywhere else, that tastes 10 times better than anywhere else.

The beer menu is nice to, and with the expanded patio, I will go there again for happy hour, or a late night on the patio for a Lagunitas.
