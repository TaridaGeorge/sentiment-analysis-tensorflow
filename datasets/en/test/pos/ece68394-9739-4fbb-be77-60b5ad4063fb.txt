If you are from Chi-Town and you like your Chicago dogs, then this place is a must!! The beef is just like home, the dogs are bomb and they even have pizza puffs. If your not from Chicago, pizza puffs are no big deal and the tamales are for the palate of a Chicagoan with no sense of Mexican food so dont order that unless you grew up on crappy rolled tamales. Order the dog with everything, but NO ketchup! That is a no no! Yes to sport peppers, very unique to Chicago dogs, get them.
