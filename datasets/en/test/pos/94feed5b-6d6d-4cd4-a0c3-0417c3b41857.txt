Went in to pick up something to go because I heard the food was great. Boy were they right! The staff was very friendly and helpful and the place was really cool. You would never know you were in the middle of a parking lot of a strip mall. So cool!  Best roast beef sandwich ever. Can't wait to go back and try the coffee and other menu items. Thanks 32 Shea!!
