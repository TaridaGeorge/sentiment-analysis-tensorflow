Io have been here3 times now and will continue to go back! I go in with my 20 month old son and they always give me the warmest welcome. Clean bathrooms and clean dining room every time I go in. Usually get the eggs Benedict and the holendaise sauce is super flavorful. Bacon iOS more crispy than I prefer but love that they offer a bacon flight. The apple cider bacon is my favorite. Being in the area my whole life, I have seen many places come and go from this location, I'm hoping this sticks around for a long time.
