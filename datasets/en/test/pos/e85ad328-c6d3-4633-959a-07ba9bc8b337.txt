This Outback Location is absolutely on top of everything.  From the moment you walk in, the place is so clean. The service is always excellent.  I was there yesterday and was just so amazed at how attentive the wait staff was.  The Manager, I believe his name is Jim, is always at the Restaurant.  Numerous times he has come up our table and made sure our meal was excellent.  Yesterday, my friend didn't like the tea he ordered, the waiter could tell from a distance and came right over and asked if there was a different drink he could get him.  Now I am the first one to be critical of an establishment but this place definitely deserves 5 stars.  They go above and beyond in every aspect.  I live in Far West Valley but it is worth the drive to go to this location.
