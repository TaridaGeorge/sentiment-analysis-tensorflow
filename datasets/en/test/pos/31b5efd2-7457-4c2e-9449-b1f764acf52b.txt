We go here at lease once a week; The portions and prices are fantastic as is the quality; Wherever we go the place is packed and it is about 75% non-vietnamese because the word has gotten out with the rest of us! I get the XL bowl which is a $6.50 Pho bowl that my husband and I split; We also get cuon spring rolls (the non-fried ones with shrimp) and a bahn mi all for $13! I can't say enough great things about this place, and you can just call in advance and get it to go as well. We have recently started trying an entree as well and have never had anything bad. Try this place and it will be a go to when you are too tired/hot to cook
