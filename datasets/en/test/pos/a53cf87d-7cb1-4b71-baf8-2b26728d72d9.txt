I agree with Sage J. This is also where I take my uniform pieces.
I have entrusted my clothes to  American Cleaners, and I have never had any issues with this place.  
The ladies that work here are courteous and always provide excellent customer service. 
I can always count on their expertly trained staff to carefully inspect everything before dry cleaning.
My ensemble always comes out fresh, crisp and pristine!
It is also near the light rail on Melrose District, so it is extremely convenient to those who don't own a car.
