this place is a staple. its real no frills gyros are the best. Im from nyc originally and this is what i want when i think gyro. other places are popping up across the valley, but so far georges has the most meat for the cheapest. the rice is lacking, so stick to the fries or just salad. they have a chicken gyro which is good and a chicken ceasar pita. those r what id stick to. I eat there at least 3 times a month. the gyro and eiether fries or salad is 6.25 and its never that crowded in the lot or the restaurant b/c most people order to go. they also get a lot of cops from the police station and theyre orginally from michigan. finally if your into sports, they tend to play them on their big screen.
