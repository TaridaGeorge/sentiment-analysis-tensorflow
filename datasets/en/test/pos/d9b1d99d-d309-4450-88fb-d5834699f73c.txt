UMMM AMAZING! The bruschetta is to die for! Not from Arizona but when I last visited the first place I had to go to after I landed was La Bocca. I was dreaming about the amazingness of all the bruschetta options. My FAV probably the one with goat cheese and roasted garlic! After that maybe the goat cheese and honey then the smoked prosciutto!! The wine is also amazing all the workers there are totally down to earth and really want you to have a good time. My BF and I are pretty easy going customers and don't ask for too much and the workers really seemed to appreciate that especially having some difficult tables, it was nice to know our chillness was appreciated. Will always go to this place every time I visit!!!
