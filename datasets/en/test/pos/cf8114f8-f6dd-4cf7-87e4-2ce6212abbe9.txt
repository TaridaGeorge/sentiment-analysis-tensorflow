Came all the way from Gilbert due to the proximity to the Talking Stick Casino/Wandering Horse Buffet that I wanted to visit another time as it was so..damn..goood...

  Came ridin in on my motorcycle with some crazy ass long scraggly helmet hair - Phil was tied up so I was taken care of by a very friendly woman who has been cuttin and stylin since she was 14!

  Very pleased with my new, clean style - and may keep makin the long ass trip for an excuse to frequent that freakin delicious buffet down the street!
