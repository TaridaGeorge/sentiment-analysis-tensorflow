Some of the best service I have experienced.  Arrived at the restaurant and there wasn't a table available, because they were busy.  The manager bought my group a round of drinks and by the time the drinks were ready so was a table. 

Dinner was great and then much to our surprise the manager had sent a free desert for our very brief wait.  They know how to take care of their customers.  I can't wait to go back.
