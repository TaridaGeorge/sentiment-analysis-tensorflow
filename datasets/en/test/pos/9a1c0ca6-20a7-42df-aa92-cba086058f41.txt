I worked an event here for my company. It's a nice place to window shop (too rich for my blood), but even nicer place to people watch.

The management and security are first class all the way. If I hit the Mega Millions jackpot tonight, I'll fly back here and go on a shopping spree (and do some more people watching).

UPDATE: Out of three Mega Lotto tickets, I hit one number. Maybe next week Kierland Commons.
