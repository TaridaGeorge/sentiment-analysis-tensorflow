This is by far my favorite Chinese restaurant in the valley. I am not a particular fan of egg rolls, but theirs are certainly the best I have ever had. Their lunch specials are great and you can get out of there for under 7 dollars during lunch.

The only thing that could be better is the location, but to be quite honest I would rather it be where its at with the current prices.
