This was my first time ever going to a yogurt bar and I'm hooked! I had the strawberry lemonade and added fresh fruit to it; awesome for a summer evening; not too sweet and nice and tart! 
My daughter had the perfect amount of dulce de leche caramel and added the perfect amount of sweets to it, very good and not super sweet.
The atmosphere was fun, but not childish-good for adults and children.
The staff was very patient and let us try plenty of samples before we made our selections. I also noticed that they have free WI-FI; nice touch.
We'll be back!
