Had a fantastic tasting and juicy bunless turkey burger!  The traditional red basket my burger came in, was overflowing with a wonderful fresh house salad, that was a standard option in lieu of fries. Appreciated having such healthy and tasty options!  

My friends elected to sit inside, but that patio outside looked so inviting.  Next time!
