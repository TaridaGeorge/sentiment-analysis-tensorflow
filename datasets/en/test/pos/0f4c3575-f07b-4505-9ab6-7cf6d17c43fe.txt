AWESOME GYROS!!!! Finally, was wondering where to go for a good gyro in this town........

The hummus is good too...just ask for extra pita bread if you get the large hummus. 

This is a small, walk-up-to-the counter, restaurant. But, BIG flavors coming from the kitchen. The owner, a woman from Iraq, certainly knows what she's doing.
