OK. So, Basha's doesn't strike up images of red checkered table cloths and brick-oven pizzas. Hell, Basha is a name of Lebanese origin. But take in a slice or two of their pizza and you'll believe you stumbled into Little Italy right here in South Scottsdale (or locations around the Valley).

The folks over at Basha's Pizza Kitchen craft a hearty cheese pizza for less than $10. They usually have it baked up and ready to go in 15-20 minutes. Call ahead for take out or place an order before doing a little shopping. It's great and I think you'll like it, too.
