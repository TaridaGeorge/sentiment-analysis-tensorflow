I've been going to this location for a few years now and have always been satisfied. Over the last year my regular therapist left and I've found a new one. Christine is absolutely amazing in comparison to anyone else I've ever seen there. I have a genetic back condition and a number of other ongoing issues and she's always able to make things so much better for me.
