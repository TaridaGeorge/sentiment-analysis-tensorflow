Love Love Love a Hava Java! Their coffee is so good and it is always such a treat to enjoy a latte with my favorite girls! By far my favorite coffee in AZ!

The staff is super friendly and it is a great neighborhood atmosphere! Also, love the punch cards especially when I get a free one!!

Can't say enough good things about Hava!
