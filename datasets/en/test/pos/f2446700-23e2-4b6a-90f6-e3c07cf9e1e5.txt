Even if the decor is from Ikea the food is anything but Ikea. Really eclectic mix of scandavian, polish and canadian food. Desserts are wonderful. Huge portions and dirt cheap prices. Shhh, don't tell them they can easily charge more. If they were in a real sit down restaurant and not a strip mall fast food locale they could charge twice as much and still be considered cheap.  All food is handmade and should remind you of what Grandma used to make for you from the old country.
