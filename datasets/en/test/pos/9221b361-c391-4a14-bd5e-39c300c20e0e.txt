This place is really as good as it gets!  All their food is good and their beer makes it the best brewery in metro Phoenix.  Try their seasonal beer selections or their beer sampler if its your 1st time visiting.  

My favorite part about this place is that you can get a 24 pack of bottled beers to go for only $24.  Now if only they allowed me to bring my dog...
