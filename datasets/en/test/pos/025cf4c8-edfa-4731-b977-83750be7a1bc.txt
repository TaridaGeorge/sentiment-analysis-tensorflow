Absolutely LOVE going for this Sushi. Fresh Wasabi HAS to be the Best Sushi in Phoenix, hands down.  Every time I visit, I always start with the Lobster Bake Roll. Oh My, So GOOD. The staff is always friendly & ready to answer any questions you may have. The atmosphere is very pleasant. I never have to yell to talk to my co sushi lovers like some other sushi joints around town.
