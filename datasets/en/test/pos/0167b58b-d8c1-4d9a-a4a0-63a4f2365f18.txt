the lady who does the eyebrow waxing is awesome!! most places will just just wax the top and bottom quick and will leave strands of hair all over the place, but here they will actually take time with your eyebrows! they wax, pluck and if your eyebrows are long she will even trim them! it takes about 15 minutes. she is very thorough which i loved. she is only done when your eyebrows are absolutely perfect and look great. and for only $8! i used to get them done for 16 and i was never satisfied. you are taken care of quickly so there isnt much of a wait there. im never going anywhere else from now on!
