Ok, I'll say this up front, I don't like chains.  There are just far too many awesome restaurants in Phoenix/Scottsdale to go to a chain.

That being said, this place is amazing and the quality and consistency here is unreal.  Yes, it "seems" expensive but once you've eaten here you'll realize that you are absolutely getting your moneys worth.

So much awesome unlimited red meat.

Don't let them trick you with the salad bar!  It's killer but don't fill up!  And don't be ashamed to leave your flipper thing on GREEN, the sign of meat greed. hahahahaha.

Lastly, try the Tres Leches and the Key Lime Pie, out of this world.
