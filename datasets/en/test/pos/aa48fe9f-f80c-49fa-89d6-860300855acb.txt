My husband and I are not golfers, so I cannot comment on the course; however, we had our wedding reception here in June, and the staff could not have been more wonderful. We looked at other locations, but loved the outdoor pavilion which was great to entertain our guests. LeAnn made sure everything was in place, and it all looked amazing with the coo.  The menu created by Anders was awesome, and he has such a gift; we look forward to attending one of the dinners soon.
