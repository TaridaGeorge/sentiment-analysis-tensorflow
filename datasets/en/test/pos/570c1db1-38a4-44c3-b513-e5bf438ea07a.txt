I go there at least 2 times a month, mainly if I'm in the mood of a quick treat. I love their selection and I have tried all their main options. I like their italian, their polish, the bratwurst!!! and they even have a special mustard to complement all. YEs during Fri or Sat you can run into a big line...but that's part of their quality! if you want to go faster stop any other day!
