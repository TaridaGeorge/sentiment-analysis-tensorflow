So mid-day yesterday I was craving something sweet and thought a cupcake would do the trick:).  Sprinkles is pretty close to my office so a co-worker and myself went to go check it out.  The store is nothing fancy... the interesting thing to me was the amount of counter help... We were the only 2 people in the store and when we walked in there was a wall of people staring at us.  I guess this place gets crazy that they need that many people on hand to help out:).  I picked out 4 cupcakes so I could take some home to share with Michael... I got the Peanut Butter Chocolate, 2 Lemon Coconut and 1 Black & White.  These cupcakes were sooo good!  I find myself right now at mid-day again wishing I had that last Lemon Coconut cupcake sitting on the counter at my house:).
