We LOVE this place! We went on a Saturday night during the dinner rush, were promptly seated and greeted.  Our kids came with us and they were given a cute little boat with rice balls and won ton chips! So nice! My kids gobbled those up quickly :) We ordered nigiri sushi and a couple of rolls.  The portions are always so plentiful and yummy! My 7 year old loves the miso soup and my 5 year old loves plain, cold tofu which isn't on the menu but they happily brought some out to us.  I always get the iced green tea which comes in a can, its very good.  The servers are so friendly and so nice to our kids. Thank you, Hana!   We will be back!
