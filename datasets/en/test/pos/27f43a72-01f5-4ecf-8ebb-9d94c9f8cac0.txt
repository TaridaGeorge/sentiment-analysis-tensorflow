Oh my gosh, what is there not to love about Target? Then there's SUPER Target! I love this place. I have gotten groceries, toys, clothes... you name it. And last time I went in, I was asked 2 times if I was finding everything okay. Yes, Mr. Customer Service, I am, thank you :) Always clean, always friendly, never any crackhead employees. Gives me another reason to never have to step foot in to another WalMart (my life long mission). Thank you Super Target, you rock!
