I like Rock Bottom. Been to several different ones between CA, AZ, and MN. The beer is good. Food is good. Service at the bar here in AZ has always been top notch! Best micro brew I've found so far. Wish there were more places here like in ABQ. Turtle Mountain, Il Vicino, Chama River... Rock Bottom will do just fine tho. Like this place.
