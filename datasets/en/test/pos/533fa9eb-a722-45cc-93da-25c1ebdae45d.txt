We arrived in Scottsdale EXHAUSTED, and on very short fuses. The Saguaro saved us- with its whiskey bar, comfortable bed, terrific bath products, friendly staff and delicious breakfast. It was the best "free breakfast with stay" I've ever stumbled accross.There wasn't a single false step. The decor is resourceful, bold, fun and creative. I appreciated the decor risks- they could have gone very wrong- but it just all came together. I was so happy to have a shady spot to self-park. The walkability is a plus. I wished I had a bathing suit for the pools. I was impressed with every single staff interaction- especially with the ladies at front desk. It was a real bargain at the price.
