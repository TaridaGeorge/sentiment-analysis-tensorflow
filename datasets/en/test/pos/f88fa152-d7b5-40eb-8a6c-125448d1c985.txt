A delicious place for breakfast! I had the trifecta which included a perfect belgian waffle, eggs, and bacon. There are a few combinations you can make. I'm a woman so I do like my options :)! Their menu is great, lots of healthy options to choose from and a lot of the egg breakfasts allows you to switch to egg whites at no additional charge!
