So everyone says they wish they could give 6 stars for certain places, and I am having the same dilemma. My solution is that because atlas bistro was so good I am actually downgrading every review I have done by one level. Both my date and I could not name a better meal we have ever eaten (and she is way more of a foodie than I). All the negative reviews are for people who book large parties, ummmm guys this place is smaller than my bedroom, maybe this isnt the place to go for dinner with a dozen people. 4 should be the max. I definitely had a foodgasm at the table after the meal, my moaning was so loud I am sure I disturbed the other customers.
