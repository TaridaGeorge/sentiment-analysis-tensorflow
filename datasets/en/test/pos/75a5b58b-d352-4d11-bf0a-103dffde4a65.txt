I love this place. I have had at least 8 screws in my tires over the past 6 months and they have patched them all for me for free! I did have one instance where my tire was beyond repair and not only did they offer me a credit for the old tire, they match a competitors price for a new tire that was similar and I ended up with a new tire for only 20 dollars! 
They are fast, understanding of my time, and reliable. I will never go anywhere else because of how great they have always been!
