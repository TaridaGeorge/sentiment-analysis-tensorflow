Despite my reservations about their thin crust, Oregano's really is a great Italian restaurant.  Took my girlfriend there the other day, and at the end she asked/accused "Why have you never taken me here before!?!"  Needless to say she liked it.  She loved the food, liked that they didn't hesitate when she special ordered her Rigatoni with a different sauce, she liked the atmosphere, the mixed drink was potent, my lasagna was very good and we loved the side of meatballs we both ordered.

We might just be back for drinks and meatballs sometime . . .
