i love coming here each night after a club. its always a great time. and the music never stops. you just keep going and going. best way to end your night. its small and the outside is large and great smoking area. the crowd is chill and comfortable. i always feel great when i get there and leave. it can get crowded on the dance floor and really hot. thats when i step out for a few and go back to dancing. and the taco stand is realy good. dont leave till you have tried both.
