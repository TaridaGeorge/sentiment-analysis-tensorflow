Yeah 100th Review!!!!


Saved this one for 100 because it is special me thinks.

If you are not a music lover, or are disgusted by hippies and people who enjoy live music you will hate this place.

I love it. It is really great to see bands that can rip on their instruments You don't see too many bands here with guys who play shitty.

Nice outdoor patio and usually people are pretty friendly at least when they stop spinning and twirling.

Anyway, the place is not for everyone.. but I think it is one of the most needed and essential live music venues in Phoenix and the whole valley.
