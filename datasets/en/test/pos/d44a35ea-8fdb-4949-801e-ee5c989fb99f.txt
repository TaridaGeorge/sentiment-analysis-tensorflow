I have lived in Los Angeles for over 20 years, and visited Phoenix on a house-hunting trip.  I made the mistake of eating at Ra (Gilbert, AZ) the night prior, and was having second thoughts of moving to the area...

... that is, until I ate at Hiro.  What a relief!  Real Japanese sushi in the middle of the desert!  Where other Scottsdale sushi places distract you with unnecessary sauces or overly loud music, at Hiro the fish speak for themselves.

Recommend: yellow tail and salmon nigiri / spicy ribbon roll

Try: Orion beer (did you know the US versions of Kirin/Sapporo/Asahi are all NOT brewed in Japan?  Don't believe me?  Read the label.)

Plan to try next: Arizona roll / Okinawa Noodles

I will be moving to Chandler, but will gladly make the drive here for all my sushi needs.
