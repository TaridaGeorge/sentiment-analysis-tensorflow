Always so good, so fresh and great service. I have tried many menu items and they are always incredible. The Mediterranean Roasted Chicken Pita, Garlic Potatoes, Garlic Mushrooms and Caramelized Cauliflower with Tahini are my favorites. Plus, the art here is great, constantly changing and I'm pretty certain it is for sale. The furniture is so cute, the couch in the front adds to the welcoming atmosphere and not only is their staff good, but it seems like they are genuinely happy to work there. Plus, you can eat until you are full and feel good when you walk out ... even if you do indulge in the Carrot Cake. One of our favorites after our first 6 months in the city.
