I have been going to Cartel for 4-5 years now (thanks to a college friend).  It is my absolute favorite place for coffee and espresso... they really know what they're doing!  I love their drinks, the environment is cool, and everyone that works there is always really friendly.  My boyfriend and I always buy their beans to use at home.  Every time we travel, we like to check out local coffee places, but Cartel is still by far our favorite.  We are lucky it's at home!

Congrats on expanding, and thank you for showing people what coffee is really about!
