This place... is EXCELLENT. I am generally not all that impressed with steak houses - I feel like I can make a mean steak at home and sides are all pretty similar (au-gratin potatoes, mashed potatoes, creamed spinach...) So... what made this place so cool to me? I usually order crab cakes as an appetizer and am nearly always disappointed (I have been to Maryland... nothing compares!) This place was different though! Sure it wasn't as good as a Baltimore, but it was better then everything else I have had outside of there!!!
