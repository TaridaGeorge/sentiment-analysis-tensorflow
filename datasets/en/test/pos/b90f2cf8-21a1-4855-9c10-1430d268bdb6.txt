Q and Brew is another Tempe institution, and for good reason. While everything and everyone else changes, they stick to the same old thing, and in this case it's good. 

This is a large pool hall with a well stocked bar, and lots of room. Drinks are cheap and the pour is always strong! Bartenders are amazing and pleasant to chat with. They have some random snacks but nothing too substantial. Also, there are pool league nights and free pool from 3 to 6pm. 

This is a great place to spend a weeknight with some friends or shoot pool on a Saturday night, definitely include Q and Brew on your bar hopping list!
