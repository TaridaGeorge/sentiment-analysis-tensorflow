One of the best experiences at a hotel. The staff were never-seen-before FAAAABULOUS!  Incredibly friendly AND helpful.  The restaurant, while said to be one of the best, provided a meal that I wasn't overly impressed with, but again the wait staff were so wonderfully friendly and accommodating the food didn't really matter so much. They didn't want you to rush, and they wanted you to enjoy your time there.  It's a beautiful hotel, and the rooms are nicely appointed.  The Fairmont Princess in Scottsdale certainly knows how to treat their guests well, and barely an ounce of snob-factor was felt.  Enjoy yourself by the beautiful pool areas day and night, and if they still have movies at the pool in the evening...partake!!!
