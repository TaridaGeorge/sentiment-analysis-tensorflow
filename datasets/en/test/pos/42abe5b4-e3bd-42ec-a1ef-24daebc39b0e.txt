Went here after reading the two previous reviews. Colorful Nails was such an amazing experience, very pleasant staff and a perfect pedicure at a good price. 

Tia did a wonderful job on my mom and I and is really funny and sweet. I have nothing but good things to say about this salon. I will definitely be back! :)
