I have used Phoenix Dent Repair on a few occasions over the past four years for my SUV and they have always done a great job! Mark has always been the one to work on my car and is always thorough and on time. 

I have had offers to fix dents whenever ive taken my car in to get it serviced at the dealership, but they often charge way too much compared to Phoenix Dent and use national companies. I would rather support my local business and I know that Phoenix Dent will always take care of my auto body needs.
