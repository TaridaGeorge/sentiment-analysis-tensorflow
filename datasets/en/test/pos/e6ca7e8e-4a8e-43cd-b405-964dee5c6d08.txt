They have the best selection and quality curries i've had, the pumpkin curry with chicken is so dang delicious, the mango and masaman as well, and they make you feel very welcome. If you had a bad experience i would urge you to give this place another try because i've been there on an occasion or two where the service wasn't perfect, but the FOOOD was!

overall, out of all the thai spots in the valley, and i've been to everyone i have found, this place comes out way on top.

crab wontons+any of there curries+thai iced tea= SHIZZZAMMM!!!
