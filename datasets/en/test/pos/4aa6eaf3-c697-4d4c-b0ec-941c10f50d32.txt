I've been taking my dogs to Banfield at 90th Street and Shea for 19 years! I love them. The staff is incredible. I think they just keep getting better and better too. Dr. Blackman and Dr. Cherico are phenomenal and my dogs have recently seen Dr. Stokka too. Norman is the manager at this Banfield and he great. So personable and helpful. My dogs and I are always greeted by Norman by name. The entire staff is quite busy but always gives me the time I need to discuss my pet's needs. I never hesitate to refer my friends to Banfield. Kramer, Mika and Sholoh love Banfield!
