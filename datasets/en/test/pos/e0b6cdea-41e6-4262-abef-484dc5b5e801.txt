I hate going to the post office, but going to Green Planet Postal isn't at all the same thing. It is small, the longest line tends to be 3 people long, they have songbirds to amuse you, and they are very friendly. They do USPS, UPS, FED-ex; they have a photocopier; they offer P.O. boxes, and they sell some "envelope stuffer" kind of things including organic soap and greeting cards. And if you ride your bike there and wheel it inside with you, instead of looking at you like you're crazy, they tell you what a cool cruiser you have.  I know I'm going to sound cheesy when I say this, but this place really makes my life better.
