Lobster mashed potatoes?  Yes, they mix a whole lobster with mashed potatoes.  Crazy good.

I had the Chilean Sea Bass.  It was ok.  I've had better.  BUT everyone else at the table was very pleased with their steaks.  Other sides, including the gorgonzola macaroni and brussel sprouts were awesome.  Raw oysters were also nice.  

Ambiance was great. The restaurant is divided into several dining rooms separated by glass walls ... very cool.  And, the bar area is even better.  The bar is huge, with great lighting, live piano and vocals. 

Great dinner.  I would definitely return.
