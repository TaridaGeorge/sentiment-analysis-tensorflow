Having been here really makes it difficult to go anywhere else.  The Cinema Suites are so comfortable and were the only way I'd be able to watch The Dark Knight Rises (it breaks my 2 hour movie rule).  The wait staff is great and they actually have decent food.  It's a little pricey but hey, you're at a movie!  Our waiter last night was wonderful about accommodating my request that my fries be in a separate bowl from my sandwich.  Love this place.
