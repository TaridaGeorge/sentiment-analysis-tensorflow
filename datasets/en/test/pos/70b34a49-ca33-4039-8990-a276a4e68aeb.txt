Dr. Johansen is WONDERFUL. I can't say enough great things about him. 

He is awesome with children even though he is not specifically a pediatric dentist. 

I used to dread going to see a dentist, but Dr. Johansen's chairside manner has helped me overcome the irrational fears I once had. He has a witty sense of humor and is very good at explaining everything. 

I do wish that he as well as other dentists didn't quite charge as much as they do, but I'm not going to knock him too hard for that, since that could just be a market rate for his services.
