I am glad I stumbled across this place after going to a business appointment years ago.  This place has great Hong Kong/Canton-style food in a place that looks like it came from there - crappy tables and old lame dishes and those 70's style brown plastic glasses.  But the food is cheap and awesome.

Main dishes to get are the spicy chicken, Singapore-style fried noodles, Mongolian beef, any of the lo-mein, wonton soup noodle, and ask about any of the daily chinese veggies they pick up from the market.  The spicy-salted spareribs and 5-spice chicken wings are good for appetizers too.

If any of you have been to Gourmet House of Hong Kong, this is Michael Leung's new place in Mesa.
