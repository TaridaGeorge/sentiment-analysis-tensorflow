This is the craziest, smelliest, scariest, busiest, creepiest and closest Circle K to me. 

This is where the homeless come to pee, the disable crazies come to run into walls with their wheelchairs and all the druggies come to buy rolling papers.

This place could seriously be its own reality show. I'd watch it 24-7.
