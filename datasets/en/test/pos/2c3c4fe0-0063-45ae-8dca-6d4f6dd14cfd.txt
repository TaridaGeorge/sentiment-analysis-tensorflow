I should be able to come up with a better expression of the culinary delights that I experienced at Essence Bakery and Cafe.  But really,  "Yum" is all I could say all through my lunch of a Mediterranean Veggie Sandwich with Dijon dill potato salad and bites of my hubby's, Spanikopita.  I kept repeating it like a mantra all weekend after we got a whole Tiramisu to go.  We have made a pact to try everything on the menu.  Yum!!
