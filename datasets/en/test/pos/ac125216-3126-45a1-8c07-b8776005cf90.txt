Great customer service and a good selection of mid-range bikes in the store make this a great bike shop.

Compared to other bike shops in the area this one is solid.

Bought a bike from this guys and before buying they let me ride several bikes on the road behind their shop (encouraged me to, actually).  Very low pressure sales.  They took time to understand what I wanted in a bike (including price range) and consistently showed me several bikes that met that criteria.

Very pleased with the whole experience.
