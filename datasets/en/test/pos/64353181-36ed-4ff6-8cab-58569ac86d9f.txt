yaaayyyy!!!! A completely dairy-free dessert zone!!! EVERYTHING here is vegan, even the insanely delicious truffles! (I had rocky road....I almost melted and went to chocolate heaven right there!) 

The Tsoynami's are outrageous! I haven't had 'soft serve ice cream' in a looooooong time...(figured out I was allergic to dairy like 8 years ago..it's been a while!) ...I had coffee coco loco, mmmmm......(writing this review is going to make me leave out the door right now for some more....)...My family ordered the clunky monkey and LOVED it (they are all dairy eaters, so, I think that says a lot!)  

I can't wait to go back and try some cupcakes, and get me some more of those truffles.....SO GLAD there is another location near me!!! (or AM I???)
