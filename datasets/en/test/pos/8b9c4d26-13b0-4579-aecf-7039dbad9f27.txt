I've been anticipating the grand opening of Milagro Grill for a few weeks now; it definitely was worth the wait! The ambiance was great and the staff was very friendly and attentive. Most importantly, the food was very flavorful and a refreshing spin on the standard "Arizona Mexican Food." I left feeling comfortably full from all of the fresh ingredients instead of feeling like I had a bean and cheese brick in my stomach. I could tell that there was a lot of thought put into the menu which really caters to the active Arcadia neighborhood. Come fall, the patio will be my go-to spot in the neighborhood.

PB&J with pork belly - a must try!
