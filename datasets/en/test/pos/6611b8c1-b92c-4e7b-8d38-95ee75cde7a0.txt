Having lived in Chicago I can tell you..this place is the real deal..they even have Pizza Poofs!  I had the gyro platter.. gi-normous..very good!  I really wanted to try their baklava (it's double the size of other places)...but will have to wait until next time.  Reasonable prices, clean establishment, good customer service.  I recommend all around.
