What a great place to eat! My brother and I have had lunch here a couple of times and the food has been excellent both times.

We tried the alligator bits. As cliche' as it may sound, it "tastes like chicken".

Although people always make fun of me for it, I like catfish. I ordered the blackened catfish with dirty rice and it was excellent. Portions are very large and I couldn't finish my meal (although not for lack of trying). My brother had the tilapia on one occasion and a mixed seafood dish on another. Both were great.

The seafood tastes fresh, the location is great and the service staff is friendly. Also, I love the patio in the entrance area. Highly recommended.
