A gem of a park in Chandler! This park features an urban fishing lake, an Environmental Education Center, several trails, bird observation blinds, picnic ramadas, and water recharge areas that return reclaimed water back to the ground for future use. Recharge of water is done through several basins in the landscape which in turn support the development of riparian and wetland areas that attract wildlife. This makes the park a great place for nature lovers and bird watchers. Come here and hike, jog, ride your bike, go fishing (you must get a permit first, of course), observe native flora and wildlife, or have a picnic - all in a scenic, environmentally friendly urban park.
