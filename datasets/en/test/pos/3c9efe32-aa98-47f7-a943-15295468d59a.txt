This is a month late. 

Well, I love this Fresh and Easy. The workers, products, and the cleanliness. I like doing my own checking out too. 

Well, I had a coupon problem with a new one that came out online. Buy one get one Artisan bread. It would not go through. So one of the guys helped me and he could not get it to work. So he had one of the managers' (I believe it was Mike.) help me and he asked me where I got the coupon and told him online. He said they hadn't had the shipment in for that coupon yet, but he gave me the deal anyways. 

On top of that, he gave me back the coupon to use again on my next visit! How awesome is that?
