Shoes, and purses, and make-up - o my!

Your sales totally RAWK guys!  I mean, seriously - 50-70% off (gotta catch it just right, people) and then, an extra 30% off that?!  I feel like a wild thing, you make my heart sing.

OK, now today, the most I found was 40% off - B U T - then there's MAC!  Oooooooo, ya baby.  All that glitters is NOT gold.  (ok, it's the small things...)

It was still fun to look at all the purses.... And mark some for future reference.  Hey, I am a patient person.... I stop for red - tags, that is.
