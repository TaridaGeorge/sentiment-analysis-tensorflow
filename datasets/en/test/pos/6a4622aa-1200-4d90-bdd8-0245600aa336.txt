Great group of folks, very helpful, seemed to enjoy their environment. Happy to support a local shop, wish the one closest to my house in MN had the same cushy mushy feelings when I walked in the door.....but, I'm glad I found just that here while on vacay  :)
2 bikes tuned & cleaned up including 1/2 inch layer of salt from traveling across country on the back of the Land Rover, 2 flats fixed, 1 gear replaced......and we, just like Willie Nelson, are ON THE ROAD AGAIN!
