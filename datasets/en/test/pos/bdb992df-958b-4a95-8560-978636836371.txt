One of the best frozen yogurt places! They always have a good selection of frozen yogurt and the flavors don't taste artificial like some of the places. Favorite flavors are the Snowflake Mint, Yo Frappe, Pistachio, Mango Mixer, Dutch Chocolate, Kona Coffee Blend, Milk Chocolate Hazelnut, Pumpkin Pie, Taro, & Vanilla Wafer. They also have a great selection of toppings!!!!
