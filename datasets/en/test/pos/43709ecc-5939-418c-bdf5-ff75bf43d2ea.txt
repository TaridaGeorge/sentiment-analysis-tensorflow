I happened to drive by this place on my way back from the cleaners. I looked it up on Yelp and saw that it had good reviews so I thought I'd give it a chance. The place is clean and the people who were there were very nice. The woman who did my pedi/mani did such a wonderful job. I had gone to another establishment when I first moved here a couple of months ago and I paid twice as much which I will never do again. This place is just as good if not a bit better. As mentioned by one of the other reviewers it almost feels as though you have to give a larger tip for how inexpensive they are and with the quality of the job done. I will definitely be coming back. They havec one more satisfied customer :)
