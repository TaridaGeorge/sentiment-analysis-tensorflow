I've been working some straight to the point reviews lately so I'm going to keep up with my current trend. Heres the 1,2,3.

The beer is on point! The Imperial IPA was the super star tonight. Just an amazing beer. All of the beer offerings were well made. Good stuff all the way around.

The pizza is MONEY!!! Wood fired, thin crust, fresh ingredients. This is what all other pizza wants to grow up to be! Possibly....the best pizza in Phoenix.Yeah, I effin said it! Loved it. We had a salad too. Great but completely overshadowed by the pizza.

Nice build out, comfortable atmosphere and friendly service. This is a great place. Check it out!
