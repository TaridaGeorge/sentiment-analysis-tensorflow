Stayed at the Valley Ho again; same deal as last year...post-conference at another Phoenix property that I rightly savaged elsewhere. This visit to the HO had me experience encounters with many more of the property's extraordinary staff including Judy, the concierge's concierge and with the attentive but not obsequious pool staff. Textbook service all around which I understand it attributable in part to the low turnover in staff since the hotel reopened.

Though I am not one, but from judging by the books people were reading poolside,  this is the perfect Bobo hangout (see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobos_in_Paradise) . 

For me the elegance of the hotel comes from its simplicity and let's all agree that " simplicity marks the end of a process of refining, while complexity marks a primitive stage"
