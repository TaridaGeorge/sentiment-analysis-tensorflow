Great selection of wine at a good price. They also have an okay selection of boutique beers in the back. The reason I gave this place 5 stars is I love the little bar they have. The beers on tap are rare craft beers that I have NEVER seen on tap. 120 Minute IPA by Dogfish Head (19% alcohol), Sierra Nevada's Estate, and Deschutes Hop in the Dark to name a few. They also have rotating wine flights of all kinds. Just a cool little place to bring the lady, have a drink, engage conversation.
