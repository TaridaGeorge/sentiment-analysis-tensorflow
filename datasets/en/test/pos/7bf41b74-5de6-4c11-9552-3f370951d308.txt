INCREDIBLE pizza. Customer service is spotty- sometimes fantastic, sometimes a little deficient. But the pizza makes up for it. This is the place to get adventurous with your pies- last time I tried some sort of corn pizza (i think it was a seasonal special) and it was to die for! Also, their specials on Monday and Tuesdays are fantastic. See below: 

"Pitcher and a Pie, Bottle and a Bowl" special  every Monday and Tuesday. Enjoy a 12 inch Parlor Pizza with a pitcher of beer for $25 or a large pasta bowl with a select bottle of wine for $35
