I live, work, eat, in San Diego however I happen to hail from the Grand Canyon State and happened upon Cowboy Ciao on a brief biz trip. I think this place has some of the most delicious food I've ever had and makes me miss Arizona! My parents took me there- they loved it and they even whipped up a special BBQ sauce ON THE SPOT for my Mom because she had a food allergy. Oh, AZ how I miss thee... Fancy Cowboy food included. I recommend the meat- of course!!!
