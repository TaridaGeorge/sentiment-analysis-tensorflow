I can't stress how quick the trip was.  It literally took the estimated 15 minutes for an oil change with some typical car checks.  It was nice that they vacuumed the front seats and cleared the desert crust off my windows.  Fair price with a nice smile.  My only complaint is that I'm not a women to take advantage of their $5 off Ladies Wednesday.  Maybe in another life.
