If you accept the fact that this restaurant is extremely high end for steak houses (price-wise) then you can just sit back and enjoy the experience because the food here is fantastic.

Service is also wonderful but the food here is simply awesome. I had the 12oz filet mignon and asked for medium rare to rare (to which the waitress advised me they have a medium rare plus or something like that which is what I want) and it was beautiful how perfectly this was cooked. My mouth is watering just thinking about it!!!!!!!

For sides we had several including the potatoes au gratin and cauliflower au gratin (I actually preferred the cauliflower) but both were fantastic.
