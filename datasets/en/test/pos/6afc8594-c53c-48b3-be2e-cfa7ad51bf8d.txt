Ok, I"m not saying I'm a wine-o or anything, but IF I were a wine-o, I'd be here all the time. Oh, yeah, I AM here all the time! 
Seriously, this is THE BEST liquor/wine/beer store in the Valley. 
The staff really knows their stuff, and consistently offers very good advice on wines that fit my palate. The only exception was one gentleman that told me that Cakebread doesn't sell their chardonnay retail (yes they do! They didn't used to, but they do now! Trust me! I DRINK it!). 
Excellent prices, excellent inventory, excellent EVERYTHING!
Don't waste your time going anywhere else...this place has it all (except Cakebread Chardonnay...you'll have to go to Bev Mo for that).
