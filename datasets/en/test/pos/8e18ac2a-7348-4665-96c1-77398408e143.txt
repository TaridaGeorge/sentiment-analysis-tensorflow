This place is worth it. This is the only place my mom ever wants her birthday cake from (tiramisu with fruit and chocolate shavings on top) and the only place I think I'll ever buy a cinnamon roll ever again (no but seriously, they are the absolute best). Whenever I go in their shop I see all the beautiful wedding cakes and have already decided they'll be making my wedding cake if ever that day should come :). I don't really know what else to say about HoneyMoon Sweets. They always treat me right whether it's customizing my order to the smallest detail, offering me new selections and varieties, or simply greeting me with a smile at 7am on a Saturday morning. I've become a loyal customer and think you should too!
