Absolutely love this place. We come for happy hour -- their $2.95 Tuscan tasters are fantastic, especially the spicy shrimp and eggplant, which is probably one of my favorite restaurant foods of all time, and their sliders (hint -- dip the sliders in the sauce from the spicy shrimp and eggplant for a real treat). I also love their steaks on the regular menu. They get it right every time. 

Love the staff, too. They always remember us.
