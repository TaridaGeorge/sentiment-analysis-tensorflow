My husband and I stumbled upon this place while looking for a place to eat one evening. I'm more adventurous than he is about food, but even he was thrilled with the food and the service. 
A couple of times, we have been served by the owner who is wonderfully hospitable and charming. 
My husband consistently orders the daily special and has never once been disappointed. I usually order the gyro, which is truly the best gyro I have ever had. I just can't help myself - I crave it now. 
We have been back half a dozen times already and I was also inspired to try their other location when I was in the neighborhood recently. 
So thankful to have something that is not a chain restaurant to chose from in the area. We'll be back many times.
