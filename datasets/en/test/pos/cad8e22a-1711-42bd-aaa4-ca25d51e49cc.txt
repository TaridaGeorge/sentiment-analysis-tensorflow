I'm usually picky when it comes to pizza.... Most nights $5 is good enough, lil ceasars, quick, cheap and edible,,

But then there's Nellos !! The best pizza i have ever eaten!! I have been in many a country, many a state, and nothing compares yet.. Pizza Bianco ,, naw,, not worth the wait,, 

I would recommend this to anyone, and if they didn't like it, i would pay their bill "for close friends who i personally know" don't think this is a free coupon to go there n try hit me up with a refund  hahahaha


The price is a little up there, but we go here for Kids bdays, good grades, special achievements, etc...
