Quirky distinctive exterior and movies you can't find elsewhere make Harkins 5 a valuable community resource. Plus it's just a good night out. The interior's a little bit shabby yester-chic, not unpleasant to be in but clearly not built recently. The movie-going crowd here makes up for it, though. There's nothing more obnoxious than going to see a movie that other people are using for a hang-out or baby-sitting service, but this Harkins has audiences composed of viewers who actually want to watch the movies they've paid to see.
