This is my second visit to Green.  The food is off the chain.  I love the decor!  Its framework is a garage.  This place is just as good as Red Bamboo (my fave vegan spot in NYC).  The first time I came to Green was in October.  I had the Spicy Buffalo Wings (they sure are spicy and SALTY!) and the Sweet and Sour bowl.  The bowl was very fresh, love the variety of veggies.  My friend had the Thai Peanut Bowl and loved it.  This time around I had the Secret BBQ Chicken Sandwich with the Thyme fries - amazing!  The Vimto is the TRUTH!  I seriously need to go back and try more things!
