Great food and wonderful environment. Sat outside on patio; very enjoyable. I had the chorizo brizza, breakfast parfait and OJ. (Yes, way too much food. I'm eating the rest of my brizza and parfait for dinner right now!) Highly recommend the brizza. So good!

Customer service was wonderful, too. I went inside to get a to go box, and was looking around for about 10 seconds. Before I had the opportunity to ask for one, I was approached by someone who worked there inquiring how he could help me.
