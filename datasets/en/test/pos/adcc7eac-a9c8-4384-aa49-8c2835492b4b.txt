I gave this location 5 stars because I ordered a chicken teriyaki bowl with no veggies, and they gave me all white meat. Usually they charge like $1.50 extra, but I thought that was cool of them. Also, they have extra teriyaki sauce dispensers next to the drinks, usually you need to ask for them and they give you like .25oz of it.
