Randalls has been around for a long time and the guys that work there are great. Being a woman walking into a store full of gun loving men can be a little intimidating but I've always been made to feel welcome. Their selection is on the smller side but quality. I traded in my last gun to them and they gave me more than I was expecting for it. They have good prices on ammo and always have the sizes I need in stock.
