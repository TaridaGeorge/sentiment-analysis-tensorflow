My husband and I love this place! We go at least once a week!!! come on how can you not? on tuesdays its $4.50 for two movies and the rest of the weekdays it's only $6.50. you have privacy, you can talk without feeling horrible, and to my husband's delight he can smoke! i should probably check in more often but in any case ill be going tonight! :)
