Let me just say that the most important part of a Greek salad (besides the Feta) is the dressing.  Crazy Jim's knocks that out of the water.  When I first started coming here I'd order the grilled chicken Feta salad.  Excellent - and huge.  Their pita is awesome.  Then I discovered the calamari Feta salad.  OMG.  I'm addicted.

I always get the same waitress and she's as friendly as she is beautiful.

As long as I work in the area I'll be there over and over again.  Even if I change locations I'll probably drive.
