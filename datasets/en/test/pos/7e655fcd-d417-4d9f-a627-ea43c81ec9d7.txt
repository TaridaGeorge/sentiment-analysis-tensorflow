Organ Stop Pizza is truly a family oriented establishment.  Long, large tables end-to-end everywhere, and (2) stories to boot.  The pizza was better than expected - traditional, not greasy, plenty of toppings built out so that there isn't even a bone.  Our group which had ages 1-60+, didn't have a single complaint and we had over (10) pies served of varying types.

Above all else, the music is great.  I've never experienced anything like this, and if you enjoy good wholesome family fun, I highly recommend Organ Stop Pizza.
