I remember a couple years ago when there were four Philly cheesesteak places on Mill Ave. Corleone's drove them all out of business. You can't compete with these guys. And hailing from the city of brotherly love, I like to think I know a thing or two when it comes to the perfect cheesesteak. 

I usually order a cheesesteak with mushrooms and whiz (Cheese Whiz). Corleone's packs their cheesesteaks with savory meat and drizzles the steaks with the Whiz, which glistens on the sandwich. For you Philly peeps who like Pat or Geno's, you're sure to like Corleone's.  You can even order a Tasty Kake for dessert.

If you live in the Mill Ave. area, the restaurant delivers.
