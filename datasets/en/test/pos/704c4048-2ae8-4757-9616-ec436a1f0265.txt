I work nearby here, decided to stroll in for a solo lunch. I've had my share of pho, but I have a phobia of orderng things that are difficult to eat. I apologize that was corny. Get used to it.

Anyway, the atmosphere and food are why I keep coming back. Nice and relaxing, sounds of running water abound, and attentive service. 

Only tried a few things here, but the pork vermicelli duo is outstanding. Fresh, feel good food that leaves you feeling rejuvenated, not bloated. Great for when you need to actually get some work done in the afternoon. Also try the iced tea with whipped cream, SUPER delish. Addictive! 

I will need to try their happy hour which seems solid also.
