i did a double dip at thai hut in one week. i couldn't help myself. extremely generous portions (enough for two people) at reasonable prices, fast, efficient service, and just enough tacky asian feel to suck me in.

the coconut curry chicken was amazing. not too sweet either (as it can be made). came with a large plate of rice. pad ped with chicken could have be a notch spicier (ask for thai hot when you order so you can feel your intestines burn) but the red curry paste it came in was extremely tasty. this also came with rice.  my next visit (to go, ready in just 10 minutes) was an order of their spicy fried rice with chicken. it came with sliced peppers (hold the onions) and was just spicy enough for me. delicious.
