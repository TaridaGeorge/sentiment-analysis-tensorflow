I loved this place. The people here were so knowledgable and the beers on tap were amazing. Perhaps, the best part was getting the tasters where you could choose anything you wanted to for one price. It was a great way to try beers I've never had before. Even the back cooler was filled with beers that I was surprised to see. This is the perfect place to hang out with friends and really take down some excellent beers!
