Love the hungry monk! They have a great beer selection and  I love all their food. And I love places that do daily specials. We always sit at the bar and tiffany, martese and heather are all super nice and make sure to take care of us. There's one older guy that bar tends who is pretty rude so if we see he's working we just go somewhere else. So maybe I'd give the place four and a half stars because of him. But overall we love it.
