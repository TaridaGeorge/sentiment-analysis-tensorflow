Yay Eddie!! Love that this is a family-owned business, where the staff remembers you and what you like and can offer good suggestions. If they don't carry what you're looking for, they quickly offer to order it, and the item is usually there within a week. They have a good selection of independent (not the best, but no one really does---well, maybe Ash Comics), toys, and shirts.
