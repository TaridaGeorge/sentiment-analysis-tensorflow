Though the menu may seem intimidating and eclectic, the food itself could not be more simple and classic. I ordered the macaroni and cheese, which was anything but ordinary with herbed bread crumbs and crispy prosciutto. Even their bread sticks have a twist with a bit of paprika and cinnamon in the accompanying roasted red pepper dip. The portions are perfect to fill you up without making you full - one starter and one shared are the perfect size for two people. The servers are friendly and very knowledgeable of the menu - which comes in handy when trying to decide what to order. The atmosphere is homey and inviting, with the noise level staying manageable. Can't wait to get back here and try their BBQ pulled pork and classic strawberry shortcake!
