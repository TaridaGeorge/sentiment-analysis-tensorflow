I was very amazed by this place. Came to town thinking big deal, watching a game in a dome. Boy was I wrong, besides low prices for parking, game tickets and food. Stadium is beautifully and a fun place to watch a game. I recommend you to schedule a tour before the game, especially if you have kids! Too bad the local fans do not support their team. There were only 24,000 at the game, maybe 12,000 were angels fans. I will come back again!!
