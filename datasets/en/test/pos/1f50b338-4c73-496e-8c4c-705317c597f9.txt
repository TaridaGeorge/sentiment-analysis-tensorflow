OK I am fully sold on this place in every way! As a recent transplant from Ohio I am completely taken by every aspect of this gem of a market! Staff is friendly and informative of not just what is sold here and what activities they sponsor but also what is going on in the downtown Phoenix area and the arts districts happenings. A very community minded feel as well as the greatest healthy food selections is what you will find here. 5 stars!!!!!
