I was really excited to see this place being from Detroit.  It's like a mom and pop back east!  The food was great!  Loved the food selections.  Waitress was a nice lady.  All the stuff behind the deli counter looked delish!  I will come back for bagels next time my work has an event.  They looked really good!  I had the pastrami, coleslaw and a pickle.  Sooo good!  Not super salty like cheap pastrami!  Go here!
