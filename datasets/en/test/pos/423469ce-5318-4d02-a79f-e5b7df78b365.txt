Ed and the team at The Drummond group were great to work with throughout the entire home-buying experience. They were there from beginning to end and we couldn't have asked for a more smooth process. They are extremely knowledgeable and made sure all our questions were answered and we felt confident with our purchase decision. Communication was constant so we never felt like we were left alone. I would absolutely recommend them whether you want to buy or sell. They are complete professionals from top to bottom and they made buying a home a positive experience. If I ever needed a realty group I would have no hesitation on where I would go!
