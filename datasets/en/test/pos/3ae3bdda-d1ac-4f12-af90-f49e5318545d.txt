A recent trip to Biltmore Fashion Park has renewed my love for it.  It's such a fun place to go and the open air aspect to this 'mall' is great (until it gets too hot).

They have tons of great shops, and though some are high-end (like Gucci and Sak's), you'll find some of the basics here too that you'll find at any mall, like MAC, Origins, Brookstone, Tommy Bahama, Pottery Barn etc..

But it's the shops like Lilies and Ladybugs and Betsey Johnson that make coming here even better.  You can't find them just anywhere and they're always worth the trip.

Plus, you have TONS of surrounding restaurants to eat lunch at, from CPK to Cheesecake Factory and the walkways are lined with grass and flowers.  It's the perfect shopping experience if you ask me!
