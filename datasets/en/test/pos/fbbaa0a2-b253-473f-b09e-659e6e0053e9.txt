I took the pole dance aerobics class last night, and man am i feeling it today! everyone there was really welcoming and had great advice for me, as ive never tried this kind of thing before. it's tucked away, and at first i had no clue where it was, but its worth the search! had a blast, got a great work out, and felt great afterwards, im definitely going back for more!!!
