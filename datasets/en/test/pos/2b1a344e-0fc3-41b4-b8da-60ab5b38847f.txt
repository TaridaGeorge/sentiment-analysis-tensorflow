This review would be for the lounge only.

I found out they offer Taco Tuesday here and I was in like so fast. For $2 I got a tostada thing with shredded tenderloin that was oh so tender with a deep fried egg and some jalapeno sauce.

the service was spot on, they have the most delicious iced tea ever, and it's a beautiful place.
