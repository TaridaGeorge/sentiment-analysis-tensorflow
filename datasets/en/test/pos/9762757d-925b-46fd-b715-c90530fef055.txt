I used to love coming here as a child and still do. I love the location that it's in also, it's more secluded and exclusive. The restaurant's also very nice on the inside, with comfy booths and pictures of French locales on the walls, there's also a view of the the lake. Their fried zucchini with ranch is delicious and so is their New England clam chowder. The also give you free zucchini bread, which is also quite good. I definately recommend this place if you like more quiet and quaint dining establishments.
