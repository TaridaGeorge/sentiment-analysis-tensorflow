My husband and I went here for our 5th anniversary after longingly passing it by it every time we were in the Santan area. 

We're very happy we did because it was a great date. The service was wonderful, our waiter was fast with the drinks and bread, great for suggestions (I ask even when I know what I'm getting to test staff), and above all he was friendly the whole time.

The food was perfect. I had the lobster and shrimp fettuccine, it was everything I hoped for and more. I honestly can't remember much after that because it was all I could think about.

We sat outside during the middle of summer but the misters made it very nice still.

I definitely recommend Brio as a lovely date spot
