5 stars for a few reasons: 1) the staff was nice, 2) the shiraz was great, 3) the meal was for this type of place, 4) the music was characteristic of this style of restaurant but not too loud as is typical, 5) the chef came out to ask what I thought of the steak & his passion for the food was really evident.
