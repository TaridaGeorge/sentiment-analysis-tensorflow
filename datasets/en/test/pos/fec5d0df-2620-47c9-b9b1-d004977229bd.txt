Back East, most grocery stores have a bulk section.  Not so in Phoenix.  That's why I love Sprouts so much.
The bulk section has a HUGE selection of whatever you need to buy in bulk!  I always get a huge bag of banana chips, pumpkin seeds, oatmeal (I like the kind that's chewy and takes more than a minute to cook :P), rice and chocolate-covered pretzels.  
Their ethnic selection is decent, too.
Always clean, staff loves to chat while ringing stuff up.
