Can haz romance?

This is a serious date venue.  Spanish fly is an ingredient in everything on the menu so do your stretching before getting into your hottiewear so you'll be ready for later.

Lovely craft cocktails, low lighting which will make your date even more attractive (if possible), and fine dining at a fair price.

Tough to go wrong here.
