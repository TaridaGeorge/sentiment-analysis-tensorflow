Just stopped here during work as this is located in the Esplanade, near my office b/c I needed a quick watch repair. The staff was friendly and my watch was fixed in a matter of minutes. And, as they said it was a simple repair, they did not charge me! I offered to pay, but they refused. 

Excellent, old fashioned service. Also, though I was only there for a few minutes, I did note that they had a wide selection of cute fashion jewelry as well as some lovely, higher end pieces.
