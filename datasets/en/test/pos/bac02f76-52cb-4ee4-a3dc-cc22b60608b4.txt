I've eaten here a lot, and it always delivers quality food. I think it's interesting that I can't find better middleeastern /mediterranean food at any price than this dirt-cheap half-grocery store. I rate all other falafels, gyros, shawarmas, etc. against Haji-Baba, and they never stack up. I frequently find myself saying, "it's good, but it's not Haji good".
