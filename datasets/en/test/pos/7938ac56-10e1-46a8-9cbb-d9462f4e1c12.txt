I was first turned onto this restaurant when I was 12 (I am now in my late 20's) or so and I have been in love ever since. My favorite dish off the menu is the Bun.. So light and cool and YUMMY! perfect for the hot summer months when a steaming hot plate of food makes you want to run away screaming.  The fresh herbs that accompany the dish are grown in the owners garden... i think they make a world of difference. This place is a dive, but is oh so worth it.
