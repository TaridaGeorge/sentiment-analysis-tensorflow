Chodang is definitely the best Korean restaurant on the East side.  I just wish they didn't situate themselves in the middle of nowhere. 

Chodang serves the kind of food that you can only find in Los Angeles.  Not only is their food delicious, they're open 24/7!    The decor of the place is really nice and it's a nice clean place.  

Definitely give this place a try!
