I'm a guy, so I don't do the mani-pedi thing too often unless I am on a daddy daughter date and my kid makes me do it.  So, I've done it 3 times.  The first 2 were terrible.  One lady bruised my shins from massaging the bone so hard.  Then I went to Estrella.  I walked out of there feeling like I was walking on air.  I don't know the girl's name who did mine, but I'm going to go in there again and find that same girl.  She was amazing!
