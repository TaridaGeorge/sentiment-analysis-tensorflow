My favorite gallery to go to on First Friday.  Eye Lounge showcases a few different artists and they're all very talented.  Of course, you will be packed in there super tightly with all the other people if you go on First Friday, so it might be better to wait to go on a less busy evening.  If you do go on FF, be prepared for how warm it gets in there.  It was sweltering!  All those bodies, plus the high temperatures outside made it more than uncomfortable in Eye Lounge.  But the cool art is  worth it- check it out!
