We LOVE Malee's on Main.  We go there every weekend.  We got my parents addicted, too.  My dad loves the Crab Rangoon.  My husband likes the Crispy Basil Chicken and Exotic Fried Rice.  I always get the Arizona Heatwave (made vegan), but I also like the Cashew Chicken made vegetarian.  They're incredibly accommodating.  The mango sticky rice is WONDERFUL!!!
