They really make travel easy.  Not only is it cheaper to park at Pre-Flight than to park at the airport, it is also more convenient.  When you arrive, they give you a section to park in.  Within a matter of minutes a van picks you up from you car and a friendly drive loads your luggage into the van.  When you arrive at the airport, the same friendly driver take care of your bags again.  Upon returning, you go to the designated curb and a van is never more than 10 minutes away.  They take you right to your car and will even load your luggage into your trunk.

Excellent service!
