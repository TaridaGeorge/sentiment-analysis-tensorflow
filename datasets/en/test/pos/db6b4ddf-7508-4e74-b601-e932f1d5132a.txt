Troy and all of his instructors do an excellent job teaching to all ranges of students ranging from the beginning student looking for basic self defense training and including those who have vast experience. When I began my training over a year ago I had zero self defense training. Today I'm extremely confident in my abilities and feel that I am constantly improving in my skills and fitness levels. I plan on continuing my education with Troy and his staff well into the future, and I highly recommend Reality Defense Training.
