I love this place! Way better than Desert Swirl. They always have eight different flavors on tap, and they change a couple out every month. Their newest one is Red Velvet Cake, which tastes EXACTLY like cake. They are a welcome treat in the summer and are open late when I need them. I usually don't get the toppings since their flavors are sooo good the way they are, but they have a nice selection.
