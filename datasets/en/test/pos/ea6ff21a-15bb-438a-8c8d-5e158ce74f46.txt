Sola is near my office which is hardly the only reason I visit this wonderful coffee shop, it is the process by which the Sola staff makes the coffee.  The beans are ground right before the coffee is made which makes for a delicious cup of joe.  The staff is friendly, the beans are fresh and the pastries are quite good.  Free wifi is available too!
