Remember that time you knew what a Dirty Chai was, Lux?  Remember how it was perfectly mixed, chilled, sweet and delicious every single time?

.... remember that time that I couldn't find a place in NY with a decent Dirty Chai (assuming the barista knew what I was talking about)?

Oh Lux, I promise that I will sit doing nothing with my Macbook, a trusty Pane sandwich, and the deliciousness that is your Dirty Chai come December.
