I found my favorite place to eat! This place is so gorgeous with beautiful settings and you can see the sunset through the mountain view at the patio. Wonderful dining experience. I love their Seared Ahi Tuna with Guacamole and Pepita crackers, Fondue with Lamb Chops, Green Chili Pork Tacos and Spitfire Rotisserie Chicken! Excellent! Their happy hour is until 7pm which gives you much time to drive all away here and enjoy the lovely dinner. I'm most impressed with the service! My waitress was very friendly and thoughtful. I forgot my card and she was running to the parking lot to find me. I definitely will come back soon to this place! ;D
