Although, this is my first review on yelp, I can say that Pink Spot is great place in the downtown Phoenix area.  My girlfriend and I came on a Saturday late morning and had breakfast, which is served all day!  I had the the Clucker bagel sandwich and she had that Burrito.  Their coffee was pretty good, but ask for a syrup to sweeten.  We stayed for a few hours doing work on their free wifi and the staff was very accommodating.  There was a relaxed feeling and some pretty good music playing over their sound system.  We'll defiantly be back and update when we come back for the Ice Cream.
