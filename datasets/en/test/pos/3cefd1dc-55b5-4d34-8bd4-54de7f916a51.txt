We went on a TravelZoo coupon and were treated royally.  I had been here several years ago and remember the amazing massage I received.  Tammi was my masseuse  this time around and she did an amazing job.

I love the Eucalyptus room and the waterfall massage.  The spa lunch was tasty and felt so fresh and healthy.  The service was good, the spa was clean and the cabana rooftop pool was the icing on the cake.
