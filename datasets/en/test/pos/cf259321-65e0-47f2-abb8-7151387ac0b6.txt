Hi all! Went to Matt's last night for the PJ's and Eggs! Matt was great a bunch of the guys from Hickman farms were there having breakfast too! The special was steak and eggs, while I originally had my little heart set on a butter burger I had to try the Steak and eggs. I was not disappointed it was fantastic! Just as I suspected. I think I am becoming a Matt's groupie! lol. I can't help it between the cozy atmosphere, the friendly staff, fresh delicious menu choices and given that I am supporting a family business I am hooked! Now I will say last night we waited about an hour and there were 5 of us but all agreed it was so worth the wait. PS I had to get a butter burger to go I had it for lunch today YUM! Thanks Erenia and Matt!
