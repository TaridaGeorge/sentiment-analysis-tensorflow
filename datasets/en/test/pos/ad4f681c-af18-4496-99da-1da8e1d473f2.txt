This review is directly for Joe that works at this specific location. From the first time I entered the store with my boyfriend, I can't explain how much of a help Joe has been. Not only is he knowledgeable about every product in the store, his warm character makes it an absolute pleasure to shop there. If it were up to me.... Joe would be a regional manager!
