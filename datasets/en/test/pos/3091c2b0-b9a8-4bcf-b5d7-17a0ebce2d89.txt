Tried Crackers & Co. for the first time after trying TC Eggingtons the weekend before, and I'd have to say Crackers & Co wins by a star.  

Had the Oscar Crabby Omelet which is a Saturday special, and it was perfect, light yet satisfying.  BF had the Vatican Skillet and didn't finish b/c he got full off of the several bites he took of my appetizing omelet.

Their menu makes you want to come back for more.  Can't wait till next weekend when I can try  the California Benny or Blintzes (crepes).
