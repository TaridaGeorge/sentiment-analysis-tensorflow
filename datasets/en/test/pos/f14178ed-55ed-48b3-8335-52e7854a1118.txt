Friendly staff and always consistent chicken bowls. A great part about this store is they give you bottles of spicy and regular teriyaki sauce to add to your bowls. Some stores charge 25 cents for an extra little container of sauce. This one also has a TV which I like to watch while inhaling the brown rice no veggie white chicken bowls. :) Yum! Keep up the great work Sammy Sam.
