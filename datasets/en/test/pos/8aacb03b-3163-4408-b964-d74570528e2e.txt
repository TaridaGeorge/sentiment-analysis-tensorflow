All time favorite lunch spot!  Best cookies you'll find anywhere!  Also fantastic lunches, such as Chicken Walnut and Turkey Cranberry sandwiches.  The salads are excellent too.  I usually create my own, but all of their Signature Salads are delicious. Go here for lunch if you haven't yet, I am sure you'll be pleased.
