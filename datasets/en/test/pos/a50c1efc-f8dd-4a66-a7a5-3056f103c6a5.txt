Heidi and Doug not only helped furnish a third of my house with distinct, mid-century pieces, they also continue to infuse 7th Ave. (and all of Central Phoenix) with community-minded events, lectures, and parties.

They are very knowledgeable in Danish Modern especially, and they offered fair deals (when compared with Red Modern).

I went to the kickoff party for Modern Phoenix Week, and Doug and Heidi let us carry on well past the posted party hours.  What a great space to linger and luxuriate with Bertoia, Eames, Sottsass, Saarinen, Jacobsen, and others.

The house cat's harness is precious, too.

With Modern Manor next door, this may be a one-stop mid-century plop.
