We had an awesome meal here.  The pretzel balls are so good - you need to try them! We also had the rock shrimp which was amazing. I don't even like shrimp!  We also shared the fish & chips and they did not disappoint us either.  

I tried the Peppers & Peaches martini and it sounds weird but was strangely good - I wouldn't drink a lot of them but 1-2 is fine.  

Now I wish Fox would open one in Tucson so we don't have to drive all the way to Phoenix to eat here!!!
