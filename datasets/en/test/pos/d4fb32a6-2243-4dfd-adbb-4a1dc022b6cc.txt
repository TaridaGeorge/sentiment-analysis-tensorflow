I absolutely love this place! It's like fine dining without such a stuffy feeling.  I can go here dressed up in heels for a date or in flip flops and jeans for a lunch with friends. I've gotten something different every time and I have yet to be disappointed. I recommend trying whatever the special might be at the time because I've had fantastic luck with them. I've never sat inside but I'm not sure why you would want to because the patio is beautiful! A big tree, fireplace, flowers, and even a little koi pond really make a lovely dining setting. I've heard there are sometimes stray cats around? I haven't ever encountered them yet but I wouldn't mind. Kitties are cute! One of my favorite restaurants ever. If you haven't tried it you really must!
