This place is one of my favorites for breakfast.  They are always busy though, and the dining room is small, so be prepared to wait outside for a table.  Not a big deal unless you're pressed for time or its summer.

The service is friendly and fast, and I've been recognized by the servers even after not being in for many months... and they wanted to know where we'd been! :)

I usually get some kind of scramble/omelet and have never been disappointed.  Potatoes and toast are delicious, too! When I bring my daughter, they make her a Mickey Mouse shaped pancake and she loves it. I've been wanting to try the cinnamon roll for a long time, but I'm always too stuffed by the end of breakfast to order it. Bring your appetite and you won't be disappointed here!
