Love this place!  It's definitely not fine dining ... it's just a mom 'n pop that serves great food.  Best part of the decor is the framed pictures of scenes in Greece.  But the food!  Fresh, great quality ingredients, great sized portions, reasonable prices.  I'm originally from Chicago, and I think the owners are, too ... going to George's reminds me of being back home.  Great gyros served with a yummy and substantial Greek salad is my fave!
