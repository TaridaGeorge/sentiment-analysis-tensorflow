D'lish is such a godsend! I used drive around looking for something fast, with a drive thru, that is good for me and I'd just wind up making bad decisions! Here, I can get healthy things like quinoa oatmeal or an egg white burrito on the fly. If I have time, I go in and eat. I love the staff there, such a refreshing change of pace from boring chains and stuffy coffee-snobs. All I know is this is MY spot and if you get it, you'll love it!
