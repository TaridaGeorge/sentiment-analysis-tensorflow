The classics are always better especially when a professional does them. The chocolate cake with a vanilla buttercream was visually appetizing - the cupcake was rich and moist, and the simple buttercream frosting was sweet and fluffy  - a perfect marriage for anyone who has a sweet tooth.

Ordering was easy, the delivery was on time, and the service was as good as it gets.
