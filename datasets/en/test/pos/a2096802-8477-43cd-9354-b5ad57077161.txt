For what it is, a neighborhood sports bar and grill, the AG exceeds on all counts.  Off track betting, usually friendly service, amazing drink deals, and surprisingly great food - their Armadillo Gold wings may very well be the best in town.  

What you won't get here is hipster pretension - but if you're looking for an unassuming place to grab a drink and budget friendly nosh and maybe bet on a horse race - this, ladies and germs, should be your stopping place.
