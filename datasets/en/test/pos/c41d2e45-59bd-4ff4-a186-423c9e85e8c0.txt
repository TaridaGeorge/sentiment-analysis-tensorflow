On the event of Julia Child's 100th birthday, Peg and I visited one of our favorite places. Duc and Noelle Liao 's expression of French cuisine has been a delight since they opened. His Le Cordon Bleu (Paris) training is apparent in everything he does. The lamb loin curry dish to the pepper cream rib eye entrees were better than they sound. French onion soup and gazpacho were equally yummy. Our server was attentive and, of course, Chef Duc came out on several occasions to make sure that all was wonderful. Desserts here are phenomenal as you would imagine.  Julia would be so proud!!!  Dr. B
