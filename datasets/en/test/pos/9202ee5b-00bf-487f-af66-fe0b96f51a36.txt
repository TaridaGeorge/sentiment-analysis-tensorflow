My favorite coffee shop in phx,  their espresso is incredible.  Great mid-century decor, friendly staff, great music.  A way better cup of coffee then you'll find at lux.  My only complaint is that they close on Sunday really early, they need to extend their hours.  This place is still one of my favorite coffee spots in Phoenix and I highly recommend it.
