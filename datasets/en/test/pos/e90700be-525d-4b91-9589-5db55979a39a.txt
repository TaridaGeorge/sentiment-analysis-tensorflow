Mallory, thanks for making this trip special for me and my guest!! Yes, it was Christmas Eve. Yes, it was kinda late and I'm sure you wanted to go home and yes, we were indecisive at times, but you gave us comfortable space to let us mull over the menu. You gave us great suggestions for drink pairings, and you were friendly, helpful and attentive when we needed you!

Most of all, thanks for reminding me why I love this steakhouse so much. The steak was tender and juicey, the lobster had a great firm texture and was flavorful. Our cesaer saled wasn't drenched in dressing and of course the complimentary bread was warm and soft.
