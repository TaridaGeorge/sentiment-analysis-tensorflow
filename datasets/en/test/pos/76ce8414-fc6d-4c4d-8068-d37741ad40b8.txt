Our AC had died and been repaired by one AC company but never felt like it was working properly, I decided to have another AC company come out and perform a check up. The second AC company gave me a list of problems that need to be fixed so I contacted my home warranty company and thankfully they sent Brian from Sorensen out. He was friendly, HONEST, and very knowledgeable. He didn't mind me hovering around him as he worked and he pointed out problems and explained them to me as he found them. The home warranty company decided to replace our AC and I was thankful that they used Sorensen once again to install the new unit. 

BY FAR THE BEST AC COMPANY I HAVE EVER DEALT WITH!
