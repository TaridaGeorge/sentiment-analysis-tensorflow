It's as good as it gets for Scottsdale Espresso but watch your "barista" if it doesn't take 11-18 seconds for an espresso pull it's coming out too fast. I am not a snob, I just know espresso and it's not because I worked at a Starbucks how DARE you!... oh damn, I am a snob. That's good for you, because you can trust me. So if you like gelato- it rocks, if you like espresso and feel a little " hip " go there and have a nice espresso or espresso drink. Another tip ? okay glad you asked- It should take about 10 seconds for the sprinkled sugar to break through the crema on top of the espresso ( that brownish head on top) if it doesn't - It's not the best it can be. 
Yes I make them at home that well.
