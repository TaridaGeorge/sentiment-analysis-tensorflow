I LOVE this place! I miss it. I used to live on Ash so I would get it all the time but now that I live in Mesa I never go there, it's just too far. And even though I work in Tempe it would be a pretty heavy lunch, well at least what I always get, the calzones! 
They're sooo good, and worth the price. The ingredients seem really fresh and the dad and daughters that are the staff are so sweet. 
I wish there was one of these by my house in Mesa!
