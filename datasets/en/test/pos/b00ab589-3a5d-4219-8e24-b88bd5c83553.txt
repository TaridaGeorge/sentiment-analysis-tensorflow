If you are near the airport (coming or going) this place is worth a stop, morning noon or night.
There was a large group from a nearby convention in the restaurant while we were there for a late morning brunch on a Sunday, and Carly and crew handled it all in stride.
The food was excellent, chorizo breakfast burrito and chicken panini. I also had the bloody Mary and it was spicy and tasty!
