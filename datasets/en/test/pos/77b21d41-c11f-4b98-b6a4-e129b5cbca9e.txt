I cannot say enough good things about D'lish! My fiance and I have never had a bad meal here and we've tried nearly everything on the menu! The services is friendly and fun. The atmosphere is laid back and relaxing. And, the food out of this world!!! My favorite is the Man Salad and California Club - hits the spot every time. For a guaranteed good meal, check out D'lish!
