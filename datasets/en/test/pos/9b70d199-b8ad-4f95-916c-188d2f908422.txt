I love this coffee shop. The owners are friendly, the atmosphere is just so comfortable - something you don't get out here in the 'burbs too much. 

The bakery items are actually delicious. Just have them warmed up, along with a nice cappuccino, and your morning will be complete!

Do yourself a favor and try it.
