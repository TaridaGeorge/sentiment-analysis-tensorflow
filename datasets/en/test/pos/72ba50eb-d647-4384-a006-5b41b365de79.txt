Oh man... I swear they sprinkle magic on their sandwiches. That's the only explanation I have for for craving Cheba Hut at least once a day. I've tried a handful of items and they're all delicious and unique. My favorite is the Griefo with bacon- yes a veggie sandwich WITH bacon. The hemp cream cheese is super duper! 

The staff is friendly and they don't speed through the orders even when there is a line and I mean that as a compliment. There's nothing worse than getting food home to find that it was thrown together in a hurry. I want to taste that love! Cheba Hut puts it in there. 

The decor is a bit over-the-top hippie tacky but it's a small price to pay for kool-aid and tang on tap. YUM.
