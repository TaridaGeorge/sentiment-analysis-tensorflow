I have been returning to this particular store for 5 yrs now. What a knowledgeable, patient , helpful, fun bunch of people. As I have moved from a "dumb' phone to a "smart " phone recently, and given my age and my lack of savvy when it comes to gadgets, there have been a couple bumps in the road. These young folks have been ever so patient & helpful to me. Derek in particular is a joy to learn & interact with. I go completely out of my way to return to this store for all my mobile needs
