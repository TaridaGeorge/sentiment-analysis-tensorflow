I've now been here a handful of times and each time I am impressed by the tremendous level of service I receive. The food is always great (who doesn't love fondue?) but the service is the stand-out.

This time I had the pulled porkwich and I have to admit, with all the hype I was prepared to be disappointed. Well just like a good Girl Scout, I was prepared for the worst but luckily experienced the best. It rocked. The mustard sauce, the coleslaw (which normally I scrap off), the bacon....I mean how on earth could they make this any better.

Previous visits I've had the Crabcake BLT (A-mazing), the Burger, Windsor-style, and the Waldorf Salad. All great. Honestly, although this is not exactly a health food stop, you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.
