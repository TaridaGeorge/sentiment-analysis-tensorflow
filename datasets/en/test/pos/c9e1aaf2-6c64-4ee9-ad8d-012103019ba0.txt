Officemax has been my office store of choice for years until my bad experience the other day ( Read My Review ).

Staples is as good as it gets !

I have never had bad service at Staples and they always have what I need when I need it.  They have great prices and great selections.

I was in and out of the store the other day in less than two minutes.

Woohoo ! Staples is my new office store !
