I love scallops, and the scallops at The Breadfruit were simply the best. On the weekend, The Breadfruit is open till 11pm and its Rum Bar is open till midnight, which makes this a great late-night haunt: pick your favorite rum drink and share a scallop appetizer for the perfect lite end to the evening. The servers were excellent and handled my gluten allergy easily, offering suggestions and slight modifications to the dishes. The Breadfruit is located at 108 East Pierce, which is south of Roosevelt and just east of First Street. Put this place as a must on your late-night hit list.
