Garlic, Black Olives & tomatoes and it's AWESOME!
Dough dosn't taste frozen and has a sweet/salty combo, very good. They bake it so it's never over or under done. I frequent Tessio's aka "Pizza" (next to Tempe Bicycle and Top's Liquors) about once a month for their xl pizza and 24 wings special (21$).

I like to call ahead, because their waiting area isn't so much fun. Sometimes I just go next door to Tops and pick out some crazy imported beer or wine to go with my pizza while I wait.

Tessio's is always good, never a disappointment and the people who work there remind me of the odd balls you'd meet in SF.
