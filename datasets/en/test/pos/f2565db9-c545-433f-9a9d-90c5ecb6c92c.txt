LOVE having a DRIVE-THRU Starbucks close to home and close to the 202. However, in the AM it can get a bit hairy since the drive-thru section can interfere with drivers pulling into the parking lot.

It's located right next to 2 of my other favorite spots in town - In N Out & Yogurtland.

So far I haven't had any problems with my drinks and the service is fairly quick both in-house & via the drive-thru. 

Seats can be limited especially since there are a lot of students studying here during the afternoon. They have patio seating outside with a couple of tables and a long sofa.

Bathrooms here are clean too!
