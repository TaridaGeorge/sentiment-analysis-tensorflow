I'm shamefully guilty of not yelping Veneto sooner, for I've been frequently over the years and they are always consistently excellent.  Handmade, mouth-watering pastas.  Service is always simple and superb in a quaint atmosphere.  My absolute first choice for Italian in the area.   I really can't pick just one favorite dish, but a few stars are gnocchi with busty Bolognese, the orecchiette with spicy broccoli rapini & sausage, and the tagliatelle with luscious speck in a light cream sauce.
