I have been to Soi 4 twice now!  Very excited that this place in in the valley, as it is always hard to find good Thai food once you leave either of the coasts.  This place has very tasty food and the restaurant is beautiful, chic and romantic, but not so much so that you're intimidated by it.  It has a good mix of casual flare.  Check it out!  The fried bananas with coconut ice cream and honey are especially memorable.
