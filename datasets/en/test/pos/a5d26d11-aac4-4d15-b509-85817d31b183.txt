While I lived in Charlotte, NC, Concord Mills (same company) passed the Blue Ridge Parkway as the #1 tourist attraction in the state. Arizona Mills blows that one away! 

This location is bigger -- at least it seemed that way while walking it. My sister and I had a red-eye back to NC and blew the afternoon in this place. We scored so many deals in various shops that we had to stop in TJ Maxx for an extra bag (we'd only brought carry-ons). We stuffed all our shopping in that one bag to check at the airport so we could get our goodies home!
