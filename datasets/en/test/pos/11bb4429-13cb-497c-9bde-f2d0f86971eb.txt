This place is ALWAYS busy and packed!!  Be prepared for a long wait for a table.

But once you get in and get seated, they've TVs galore. All of their food is massive, and everything I've had here is really good.  My first trip to Four Peaks was to quell a burger craving. Craving quenched - great variety of burgers. Subsequent trips have all been good - nachos, chicken fingers, wraps.  My most recent trip this past weekend, I had their margherita pizza - their version has white sauce and garlic, thin crust, one size, about 10" - and, as usual, Four Peaks came through, it was damn good. 

Of course, it's a brewery, and they have great beer. If you're a beer fan, you'll love their beers from amber to stout.
