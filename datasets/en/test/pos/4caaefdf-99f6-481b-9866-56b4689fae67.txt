Talk about getting my butt kicked.  I consider myself in shape but if you don't hike a lot it can catch up to you right away.  All the reviews I've read are true...Don't do this if you're gonna "try it out"  Get yourself a pack or something to carry your water.  I would this say is one of the more fun hikes within the city.  Another thing I notice; it's an international affair!  Seems like people from all over the world hike this mountain.  When I got to the top I hear Chinese, German, French, etc... amazing!
