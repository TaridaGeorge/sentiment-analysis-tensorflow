Since I am Navajo and Born and Raised on the Navajo Reservation I miss home at times, and this place provides the comfort of Rez LIfe. Ive been a fan and an admirer of this business.  since I first found them at First Fridays.  They used to be in Mesa and Now are in Central Phoenix.  Their food of course is what keeps me coming back!  I miss home sometimes and whenever I experience this resturaunt it Always provides me the comfort food and hospitality of home on the Rez!!  I definetly recommend this place for everyone.  Not only does it provide authentic Native American food but also the ambience of the Reservation at its purest..even down to the cheap soda in the side fridge....I LOVE IT! its great!!
