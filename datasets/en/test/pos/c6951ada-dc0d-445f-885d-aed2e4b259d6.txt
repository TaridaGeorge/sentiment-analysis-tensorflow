This place didn't just move.  It is under new ownership and actually the atmosphere is really awesome here.  They do play Arabic music on most days but because it is located in Old Town Scottsdale they are smart business owners and choose to cater to the people who come in here...which would be the younger crowds.  You know the crowd that comes in after being in a club and is not ready to go home just yet.  You should come in again and give them a try because their indoor seating is comfy and the outdoor seating is what it is considering the location that they are in.  Buckboard Trail isn't exactly the easiest street to have a huge patio.  Give them a break.  They are a small business just trying to be smart about the crowd they cater to.
