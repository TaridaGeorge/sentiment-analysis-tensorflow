My microfiber couch looks as new as the day we purchased it after having it cleaned yesterday. The owner was very informative, very professional, and most importantly did a superior job in less than an hour! The cleaning agents did not affect my rather sensitive asthma, so I can have piece of mind that I'm relaxing on my sofa without all the harsh chemicals that most other companies use. I will use this company for all of my rug and upholstery needs in the future! Oh and the cost is teacher salary budget friendly which helps immensely :-).
