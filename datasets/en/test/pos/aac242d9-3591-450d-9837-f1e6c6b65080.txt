I ate at BLD for the first time today and I loved it!!! The atmosphere and ambiance was very modern and inviting. The food was amazing. My boyfriend got the daily special of fried chicken on a biscuit sandwich, it was a huge portion first of all and tasted delicious. The service was great, and a very friendly staff altogether. I would definitely recommend trying BLD!
