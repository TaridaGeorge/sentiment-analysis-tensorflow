My steak was barely warm and yet it was still the best I've had in years!  Drenched in it's own juices, my mouth is watering just thinking about it (and this was four days ago now!).

And I can not say enough about the vibe of this place!  It' s seriously more energetic than most nightclubs.  Hell, if your a complete bore your date will probably think you're vibrant just for sitting across from you while you're in this place.

Also worthy to note, while I was waiting for my drink, I was standing near the wait station and a waiter, just out of the blue, goes "How are you doing?" ... To which I thought,  Hold it!  Are you being nice to me and NOT fishing for a tip!?  How DARE you!!!! 

So they seem to treat their employee's well and it shows!  

I'm in Love.
