We had our wedding dinner at La Torretta and it was a perfect evening.  They accommodated our 21 person group wonderfully and made adjustments for dietary (vegetarian) and cultural (Kosher) eating habits with grace and aplomb.  We were advised in the beginning that any change to an existing dish would be done if they could possibly manage it and they followed through with that promise.  
Everything was delicious and they timed the courses according to when we were ready for them since everyone was socializing and taking their time.  We never felt rushed and never felt hungry or thirsty.  
The wine selection was great and they gifted us with a complimentary bottle as we left.  We will certainly return and highly recommend it to everyone.
