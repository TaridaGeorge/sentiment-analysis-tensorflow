Part of this high review is just having a wonderful place to walk to in downtown Phoenix - finally - but part of it is also that it genuinely is good.  The pizzas are excellent, the atmosphere fun, the elevator shaft astonishing, and the fact that there's a cool lounge starting the redevelopment of downtown Phoenix - walking distance to the Dodge Theater, stadiums, and light rail - earns it a star just by itself.
