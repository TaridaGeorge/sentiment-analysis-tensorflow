YAY! I love when I get to write a good positive update on a place! My second trip to Mabels on Main was perfect! We arrived early enough to grab a booth and stayed until the late night crowd showed up so we got to feel the complete vibe of this place and I have to say I loved it ! Service was great and we enjoyed everything we ordered as well. We shared the cheese platter, chicken lollipops and also the mac n cheese which was heaven!

So glad I did not write Mabels off my list and gave it another go around cause this is a very cool upscale lounge and can't wait to take some out of town visitors here during a night out!

p.s their VIP room is pretty legit and affordable.. nice secluded room behind a secret wall :)
