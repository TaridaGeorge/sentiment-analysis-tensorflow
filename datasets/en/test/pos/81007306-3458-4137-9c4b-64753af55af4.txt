Gotta love this place no matter the location.  It's a must that you get a double because patties are thin.  Order it like they serve it...stop being picky anyway!  The fries are amazing...thin shoe string fries!  Order an extra basket of fries to share with your table.  May as well order a cone to go for the ride home.  In PHX you gotta eat that fast...frozen custard to go in 110 degrees.  Love it!
