My favorite place to go for special occasions!  My family's favorite place as well.  Flat Iron steak is wonderful.  Love their asparagus too.  The bread they serve, freshly made by a local bakery, is wonderful.  Make sure you order the chocolate souffle with your dinner since they make them to order, which takes 30 minutes (mmmm chocolate goodness). Ambiance is very elegant, white table clothes, dim lighting, and wonderful tables in the courtyard.
