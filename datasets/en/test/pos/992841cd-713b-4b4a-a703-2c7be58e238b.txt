We used to eat here regularly. Unfortunately we moved. This is one of the few places where I've liked essentially everything I've ordered which is most of the menu here. The food is light, exquisitely spiced, yet ample and quite filling. The flavors are so good it really doesn't matter to me whether a dish is vegetarian or not, all are equally satisfying. Everything is so different from food we've had elsewhere so it makes a great change of pace. We haven't lived in Phoenix in a few years now and we're still dreaming about it and I'm writing a review. It was that good. Yusef's, thanks for the memories, we miss you.
