I must say that I truly enjoy this new Dunkin Donuts location.  The food is fresh, the restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly.

The place is open from 4:00 a.m. into the evening.  It is business friendly with free wifi.  It is id friendly with a small play area and coloring books.

Moreover, the bathrooms are clean!

A true oasis.
