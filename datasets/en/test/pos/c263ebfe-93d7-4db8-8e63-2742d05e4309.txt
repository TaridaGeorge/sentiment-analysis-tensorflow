My girlfriend and I ventured out to Arizona for a weekend. We came across Tonto and decided to give it a go for lunch (looked beautiful from the outside, set in a country-club setting with amazing vistas). 

We began our meal with the 3 sisters salsas and chips. The chips were homemade and absolutely incredible. The accompanying salsas were also delicious. 

I ordered a burger and it was incredible. Without question, one of the top 10 I have ever eaten in my lifetime. I'd detail it all, but pretty much every aspect was good. 

One of the better meals I have ever had.
