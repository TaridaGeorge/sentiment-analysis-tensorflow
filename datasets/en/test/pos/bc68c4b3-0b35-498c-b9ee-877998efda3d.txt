Yum  Yum and Yum ! Churn makes you feel like your in a old-fashioned ice cream shop with all the sweet treats and the perfect variety of ice cream flavors. I always need to sneak by for a taste test after having dinner at Windsor . I finally had my first full cone of Strawberry Ice Cream on a pretzel cone. My concept sounded good because I love the salty sweet combo , but the cone was too salty for the strawberry. I think a chocolate or peanut butter would be better. The Strawberry Ice Cream was fresh and the perfect consistency , but too rich and had the perfect balance of sweetness.
