This is the perfect hotel for the business traveler or someone wanting a nice hotel in a great location downtown!

The entire hotel is new and very clean.   All of the staff have been very friendly.  I ordered the grilled cheese and tomato soup off the kids menu and I am certain it was the best grilled cheese I have ever eaten in my entire life!

They offer self parking which I have used all four stays in the last two months and it is very convenient for a business traveler who is coming and going.  You can't go wrong with the Sheraton in downtown Phoenix!
