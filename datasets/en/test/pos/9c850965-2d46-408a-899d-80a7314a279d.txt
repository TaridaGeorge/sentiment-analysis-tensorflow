AMAZING.  I was turned on to Bosa by a co worker an I have never looked back.  Located in what use to be fast food place Bosa ROCKS.  They remind me of the place I use to go to as a kid.  Perfect fluff and crispy-ness.  I highly recommend Bosa to anyone.  The only problem is that it is going to equal extra time at the gym, because I have yet to eat just one when I get them.  Which one is your favorite???????? :)
