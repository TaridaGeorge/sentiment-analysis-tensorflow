Wow, this is the nicest Outback i have ever been to. We came in for a late lunch. I cannot remember our servers name but, he was great.  Wine is only 2.95 a glass all the time and it is fantastic!                                  My friend and i got the soup and salad (all you can eat) and it was only 5.99. There are a few different salads to choose from and a few different soups. Really good on all levels.       Had no idea how cool this place was, decorated very nicely and the bathrooms were nice and clean as well. We actually cannot wait to go back there. I highly recommend!!
