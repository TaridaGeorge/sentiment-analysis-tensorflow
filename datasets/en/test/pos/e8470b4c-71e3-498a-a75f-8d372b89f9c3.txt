Has this place changed! "Mable Murphy's" meet "Mable's on Main"...

We both had a wonderful experience here last night. We showed up around 8:30pm grabbed a table and started sampling - First we tried the butter lettuce salad with golden beets, then the lollipop chicken, and finally the fillet bites with horseradish sauce (amazing). After our splendid meal we enjoyed a cocktail at the bar.

The atmosphere here is like a retro speakeasy. It's really dark, they have lots of exposed brick, plush couches, crystal chandeliers, and a tin ceiling. Service was impeccable and everyone was very friendly. I'd tell you about the secret room too... but it's a secret!

*Late night the place turns into more of a club.
