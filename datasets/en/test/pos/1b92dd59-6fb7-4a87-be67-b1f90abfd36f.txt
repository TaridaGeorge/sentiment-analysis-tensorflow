Simply no bullshit good Chicago-style pizza.
Not the deep-dish heart-attack but the nice crisp crust, square-cut, cheesy goodness. Although deep and double-dough variations are tastily available.
The beef steak sandwiches and stuffed peppers are awesome as well.
Great prices, no need to order extra cheese here, they don't skimp.
Good stuff.
Highly recommended!
Shit. Now I'm hungry for it!
Go get some!
