This place is a hidden gem!! Seriously, one of the best thing if not THE best thing about Phoenix. The old-fashioned soda fountain is complete with adjacent thrift store which has the best finds. The staff are super sweet and they can make a mean sundae, where the chocolate sauce is literally dripping down the side of the sundae glass. I love this place and if I ever have to go back to Phoenix, this would be the first place I would visit.
