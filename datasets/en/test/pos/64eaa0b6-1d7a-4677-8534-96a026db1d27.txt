I love LGO! Everything that I have had here is always very fresh tasting and delish!  My favorite lunch salad is the smoked salmon salad.  You can also take your dog here and sit on the patio which is very nice since there are not a ton of places in Phoenix to bring your pup!
The Tammie Coe desserts are also to die for!  The last time I went I got the coconut cupcake, I thought I made good cupcakes, but then I tried this one!  Very moist and the cream cheese frosting was amazing!
