Going out for a birthday dinner is always fun. Wanting to try a new place this year, my boyfriend took it upon himself to seek out the best place. We decided on Le Chalet.. which has so far been the best birthday dinner in a very long time! All of the food was delicious...the environment was fun but quiet.. the staff was all very friendly and we had one of the best waitresses ever! And one of the best parts... it was totally 2 year old friendly. Can't wait to go again!
