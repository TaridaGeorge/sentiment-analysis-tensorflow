One of the premier hotels around the valley. 

For me, it is three-way tie between the Camelback Inn, Sanctuary, and the Phoenician for the best hotels arond Phoenix. Once you enter the gates it is like a city, full of casitas and swimming pools and golf courses. 

It and the Camelback Inn both capture the more classical, pre-modern Phoenix. It is a true resort in every sense of the word and effectively captures my favorite things about our city . . .
