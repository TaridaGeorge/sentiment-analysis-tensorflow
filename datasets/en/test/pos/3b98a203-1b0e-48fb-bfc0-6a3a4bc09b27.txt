My guy and I LOVE this place.  We left so happy with our experience that we couldn't stop talking about it for days!  The tapas is gourmet and absolutely fabulous!  The drinks were wonderful as well.  The decor is AWESOME!  The staff was great.  We had a reservation on a Friday night and we needed it.  

Honestly, the only thing that we did not like about this restaurant is that it was EXPENSIVE!  Everything else is kick-ass!
