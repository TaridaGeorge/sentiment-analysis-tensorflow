I've been in the restaurant business for 45 years. The Wife & I had the opportunity to go to Ciao recently. We sat @ the bar where George and Luis were slinging drinks & food. GREAT choice! I had the Puerco Lento, my wife had the Korean-Style BBQ Short Ribs. Both were amazing!! It's really nice having a staff stocked w/true professionals! Service @ the bar was outstanding! Do yourself a favor, go NOW, sit @ the bar & let these guys work their magic...!
