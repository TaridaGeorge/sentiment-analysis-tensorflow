Fantastic beer list, really good service, and live music.

You really can't go wrong here.  From a packed first Friday to a desolate random Wednesday, this place has it.  Meet up with friends, take a date, I really love this place.

They have random art on the walls, open poem readings.  I guess the only downside is there are no beer on tap and no food.  If there was, I don't know if I would leave.
