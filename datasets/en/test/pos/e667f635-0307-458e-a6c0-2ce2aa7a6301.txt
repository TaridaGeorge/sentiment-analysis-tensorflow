Come here for lunch (but not too late because they close at 2pm). Then, get the Butter Burger. Even the memory of this burger makes me giddy with excitement. It's freakin' huge too. A hand formed patty, and fresh & fluffy bun. Wow, this burger will knock your socks off. Amazing quality and flavor. One of the best burgers in the entire Valley.
