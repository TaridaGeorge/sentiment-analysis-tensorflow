Lux is, without a doubt, my favorite coffee shop in Arizona.  Their drinks are a perfect balance of well-roasted beans and milk, served in smaller European-style ceramic cups.  Both the small and medium have two shots; pick the small for an intense coffee flavor, or the medium if you like more milk.  I don't think Lux has flavored syrups, but their mocha and velvet add a wonderfully smooth chocolate base. So, my dear friends in Phoenix, enjoy your Lux because when you move you're not likely to find anything as good!
