Movies not in the main Harkins Theatres are shown here. Most are great & meaningful. As of today, I have seen every movie playing at Camelview until Friday:
500 Days of Summer
The Cove
Food Inc.
The Hurt Locker
Paper Heart
All these movies left me feeling great because I know the time I spent watching the movie was worthwhile. I have learned a lot with each movie and have decided to become a vegetarian as a result of seeing Food Inc. and The Cove.
You can't beat the free Medium popcorn ($4) everytime you go to Harkins as long as you wear or bring your $24.25 Harkins T-Shirt in the wrapping as well as the $1 refill on a large souvenir cup. This really differentiates Harkins from AMC for the loyal moviegoer. I only go to AMC when it is unavoidable.
