I had heard about Ritas and decided to try it. I had also read on Yelp and on a friends FB about this place. This place is sooooo good and very clean inside.
I understand there will be additional Ritas opening up over the next few months but not in my area. In North Central Phoenix, we need a good frozen treat shop and this place I think would do well. If you decide on opening more locations, think about the folks in good olde North Central Phoenix!
