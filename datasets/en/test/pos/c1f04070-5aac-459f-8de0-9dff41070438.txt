Al's Beef lived up to its billing.

I've been a Luke's fan while living here - it's the closest beef sandwich experience I've had to get close to my Chicago growin' up days. But Al's was super perfect today - my first visit and everything was right.

I only had a regular beef and small fries, but the beef was tasty and juicy. It also had a bit of a spice thing happening that I don;t remember tasting in beef sandwiches before.

The fries were awesome. Literally awesome. Next time a medium Fries.

Hungry? Hit Al's next time up near 101 and Raintree.
