I have been getting facials and laser hair removal treatments for several years now. Dr. Leber's office is very welcoming and the staff are friendly. The laser technician at his office is professional, caring, knowledgeable,  and experienced. I have followed her from a previous Dr's office to continue my services of facials and laser treatments.
I have a darker skin tone that makes it harder to treat, so I am told. I trust the technician fully to appropriately handle my skin type.
I have never encountered and problems. I would highly recommend this office if you are looking for treatment.
