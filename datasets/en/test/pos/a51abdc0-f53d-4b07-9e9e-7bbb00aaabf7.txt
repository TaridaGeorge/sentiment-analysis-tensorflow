I've purchased all of my pets' medications from Diamondback Drugs for a number of years and I can't say enough good things about them.  I am in another state so all of our meds are shipped for a small charge and I get it within a day or two.  I have special needs dogs that are on very expensive life time medications and Diamondback has saved me a ton of money.  Roy and Mike, the owners are available to anybody that has a question and their service is exemplary.  I would suggest to Heather that if she doesn't like to deal with crowds or standing in line, ask if your medications can be shipped.
