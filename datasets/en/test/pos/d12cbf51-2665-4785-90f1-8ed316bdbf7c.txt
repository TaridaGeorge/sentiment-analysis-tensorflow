A lot of friends and family have been raving about this place for a while... my boyfriend and I normally have Sunday off together and they are closed sundays,so after almost a year of wanting to go there for lunch or dinner we finally went. I am not a huge sandwich person ...so I ordered the Margherita Pizza. It was awesome...their mozzarella cheese is Homemade and the pizza had the right amount of crisp to it. My bf ordered the sandwich with Pastrami w/ House Made Sauerkraut, Swiss Cheese & Thousand Island Dressing on Rye. He liked it a lot and he thought their pickles were very good. We were too full to try the homemade Ice-cream but they sounded wonderful! will def. be back!
