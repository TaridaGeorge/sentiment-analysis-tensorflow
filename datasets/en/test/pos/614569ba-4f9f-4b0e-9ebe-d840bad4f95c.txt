I think At One Yoga is awesome.  They specialize in different types of yoga and the teachers give personalized instruction.  You can take yoga in a heated room, couples yoga, hip hop yoga and much, much more. 

They also have a boutique where you can buy really cute yoga clothes and they also offer massage services.

I would still go to At One Yoga if I could, but I can't afford it.  When I did go, I really liked the teacher named Ian.  He was cool.

If you have the money, I recommend going to At One Yoga. Don't be intimidated by the girls that can do every yoga move perfectly- they usually sit right up front, so if you're a beginner, you can hide in the back until you feel more comfortable.
