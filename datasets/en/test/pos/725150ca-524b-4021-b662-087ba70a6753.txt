Went here yesterday for a fun lunch with a group of people I work with.  We tried SO many things on the menu it was unreal.  I was full for like 8 hours after.  Anyways, I HIGHLY recommend Stingray Sushi.  

When you try it for yourself, I personally recommend the Shrimp Shumai and potsticker appetizers, the Lava Roll, the Stingray Special Roll (both have a little spicy kick to them), the caterpillar roll (can't go wrong with avocado), and we also sampled the cheesecake, this delicious chocolate cake and the ice cream wrapped in tapioca.

Wow, re-reading what we all ate makes me feel full again!!  One of my friends insisted that we try EVERYTHING we wanted... so there you have it!  I love Stingray Sushi... Not a fan of Tyger L's review... Just sayin'
