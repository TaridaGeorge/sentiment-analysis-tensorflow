Ok, now HERE is some serious BBQ!!  Robyn N., Mike C. & I dropped in here for lunch today & I thought the food was so terrific that it soared right up to top favorite BBQ in the whole Valley for me, except for the monthly BBQ Buffet at The Barbecue Company.  The Moist Brisket was super good & moist without being fatty, their (hotter version) Rudy's BBQ Sauce was my favorite of all the local BBQ places I have tried, the Green Chili Stew was awesome & the potato salad excellent!

1/2 Lb. Moist Brisket:  $6.49
Bread & various condiments including peppers, tomatillos, onions, pickles etc:  Free
Green Chili Stew:  $2.19
Potato Salad:  $1.99

Woohoo!     :-))
