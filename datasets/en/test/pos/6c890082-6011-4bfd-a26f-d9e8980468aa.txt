I noticed the big BOOKS sign last week and have been meaning to get in there - one thing we desperately need downtown is an independent bookstore, so happy to have them here!  This morning I had a bit of time to stop in and check them out...what a great store, very inviting and comfortable, nice seating area, good lighting, clean and well organized, super helpful staff/owners and excellent prices!  I bought four books for $18! They will definitely be my new bookstore - forget B&N or Borders! Yea! (plus, the owner said she was more than willing to host book clubs...what a great idea!)
