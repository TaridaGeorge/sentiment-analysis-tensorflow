My husband & I love going to eat here!!! We usually get a green olive and sausage pizza, ravioli and cannoli's.  Their food consistently tastes the same!!! I absolutely hate eating out where the food tastes different every time I eat there. Great customer service too and super friendly!!! They always stop to chat and seem very genuine!!! 
We would recommend this you try it...you won't be dissappointed!!! Thank you for the special offer on YELP it was so appreciated!!! :)
