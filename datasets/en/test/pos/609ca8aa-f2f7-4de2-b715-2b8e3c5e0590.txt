I've eaten at YC's over the years and was so excited when this location opened.

This location has a great bright dining area.  The manager is REALLY friendly and helpful and the place is always clean.

If you have not eaten here, you are in for a surprise.  First, just get into it and have some fun.  You need to SMASH the meat down ALOT because it cooks down.  Have some fun with the sauces!

Now that I've moved to SoCal I do miss this place.  YC's is MUCH better than the mongolian grills in SoCal.
