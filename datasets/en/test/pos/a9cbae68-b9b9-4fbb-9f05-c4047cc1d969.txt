Vegan Mexican food....whaaaaaaaaat!?!  Believe it people!  It's NOT to good to be true...it IS true!  

Chile Relleno was SO delicious.  No Whey Jose nachos and the taco special of the day were also very good.  

Everything was VERY spicy!  Be sure to tone it down and order it "gringo style."  

I can't wait to go back!
