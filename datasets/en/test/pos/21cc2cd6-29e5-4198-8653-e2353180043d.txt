Oh.My.God.  I consider cakes (regular, cup, pan) to be their own food group, and it is my favorite.  I have an addiction.  I happened to drive past OllieCake today and saw their sign outside: "We Won Cupcake Wars".  Again, I have an addiction.  I had to stop--cupcakes are my drug of choice..  The inside is cute and tiny.  I managed to control myself and only get 4 (and a cookie).  So far I've only had the vanilla (as I've said in my review for Sprinkles--how hard is it to screw up a vanilla), and it was UH-MAZING.  The frosting wasn't too sweet and the cake was perfectly moist, and they are cheaper than the "other" cupcake shop.  You should just go there right now.
