My mom, two sisters, two nieces and I went in to find a wig for my little sister, who is fighting stage 4 small cell cancer.

The lady who helped us was great about finding different wigs to try based on what my sister said she liked.  She was very kind, encouraging and sensitive.

The shop itself has ALL KINDS of wigs and hair do-dads to choose from!

Wether you're shopping for a costume party, some fun hair accessories or if you or a loved one is looking to feel beautiful in the midst of cancer, Wigs Amor is a great place to shop!
