Amazingly large portion sizes!  I'm so spoiled by the portion sizes at Sakana that I don't want to eat sushi anywhere else.  The fish is always fresh.  Be sure to check the specials on the board - you could try something new!

The staff is fantastic and efficient.  Sit at the bar and you'll see how friendly the chefs are.  Buy them a shot of sake and you'll have friends all night.  Plus a lot of attention from the entire restaurant.

For dinner there's typically a wait for a seat.  But Sakana is always worth the wait.  If you really can't wait, make a to-go order.  You'll keep coming back.
