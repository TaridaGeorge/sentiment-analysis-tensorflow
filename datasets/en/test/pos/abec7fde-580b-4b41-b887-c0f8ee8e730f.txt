Really like this place.  Went on Tues. evening around 8.  Free valet.  Fresh squeezed juices.  Warehouse...Other reviewers who have rated it high have said it all.  I just wanted to add that if you go during the summer months, it is HOT!  They have swamp coolers that work hard, but don't quite make it cool everywhere.  Neat that on this night, they had a huge line up of bands and there were two stages.  While one band played, the other set up so there was literally no downtime.  Would like to go back.
