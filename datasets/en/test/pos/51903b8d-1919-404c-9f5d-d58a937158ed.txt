My husband and I travel quite a bit, and we've been to many spas and resorts.  Gotta say, we were really impressed with this place.  The facials we got from Krystal were very thorough (we're glowing) and the deep tissue massages from Eric and Isabel got our chakras in line for sure.  The spa is well appointed, rooms are large, cool, unstuffy, and comfortable.  Queen Creek is a little off the main drag, but prices are very competitive, and a this is a great value.  We visit Phx often, and I'm definitely coming back.
