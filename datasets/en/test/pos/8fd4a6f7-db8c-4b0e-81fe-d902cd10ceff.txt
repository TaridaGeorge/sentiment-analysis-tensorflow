Don't deny yourself the chance to eat here - the food is amazing. As a 5 star description says, "As good as it gets!" is the truth here. Great vegetarian options! Note to first-timers: just grab a table, it's kind of a casual system. Good beer, good music, great prices. Tony helped with the recommendations, and was spot on. Tell him "Hi!".
