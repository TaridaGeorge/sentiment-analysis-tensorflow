A review from an Island Girl! 

My family and I moved to the Valley from Kahalu'u on Oahu 4 years ago and have been searching ever since to find a good Korean Island Style BBQ . 

We found it right here in Tempe AZ. Paradise Hawaiian BBQ is the bomb! Korean/Hawaiian BBQ meat with 2 scoop rice and 4 sides complete your plate. The mac salad is ONO! 

The restaurant is family owned (by a local Korean ohana) and the service is great. Eh, they carry Hawaiian Sun Juice and make a mean SPAM Musubi too. 

If you are missing some good Island food this is the best place we have found to get our fix!
