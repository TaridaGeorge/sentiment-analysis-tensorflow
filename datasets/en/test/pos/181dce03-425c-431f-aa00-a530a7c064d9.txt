Great food, great service, great beer. What more could you ask for? This is by far my favorite place to eat/drink in Tempe. Their Italian beef beer bread is awesome. Surprisingly so is the chicken salad pita along with the pasta salad. As far as beer goes, hop knot is my favorite, but its all awesome. I would recommend getting the beer sampler at first to see what you prefer.
