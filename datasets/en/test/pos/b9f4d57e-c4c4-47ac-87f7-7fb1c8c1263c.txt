The food here is great, but I'm inspired to review the place because of the service.  Last weekend my wife and I were in town for just a couple days.  We were hungry late one night and Grazie had been recommended by a friend.  As we arrived we realized they were nearing closing time and asked if we should come back another day.  The staff insisted, "No, no.  Come in."  I'd had a bad experience in a similar situation at another restaurant in the past, so I was still a bit hesitant.  But, decided to give it a shot anyway.  The staff at Grazie was top notch.  My wife and I received great service, the hour being completely irrelevant.  Heck, our server even broke out his smartphone and looked up a nearby late night frozen yogurt shop for us.

Five stars for service, Grazie!
