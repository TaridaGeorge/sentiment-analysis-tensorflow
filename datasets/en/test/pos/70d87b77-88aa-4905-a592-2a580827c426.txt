I've been going to this location for over 8 months now. Usually at night, when there is limited staff. They have always been helpful, prompt and the store kept clean. They have been able to assist me at hours that I could not have done any other place. Even when busy they acknowledge that they will be right with you. 

Best FedEx Office I've used in town.
