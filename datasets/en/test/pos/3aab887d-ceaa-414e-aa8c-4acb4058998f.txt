This place is wonderful!  Great portions, great prices, great service, great food.  Defintiely plan on going back again and again!  Fortunately, we live close by.  Be sure to try the fried banana rolls with ice cream for dessert.  It's heaven!  My husband and I tried the pork belly and bbq pork.  Both excellent!
