OMG - Kung Pao Chicken!!! SO damn good!
Never order the small, you get Bang for the buck! on food here with the large. The lady handed my amazing Kung Pao Chicken, and my arm literally dropped, had to weigh it, 3.5 lbs of food for under $10.
General Tsao's chicken is also amazing! Not a bog fan of chinese food night, but always williing to go for some Li's Bowl!
