QT know how to do gas stations right. They are always clean, Staffed, well mannered, good knowledgeable people. I always try to go here if I can. 

They also have some pretty awesome sandwiches and taquitos that always pretty fresh and hot. I like there breakfast sandwiches too. AND of course the 69 cent fountain drinks.
