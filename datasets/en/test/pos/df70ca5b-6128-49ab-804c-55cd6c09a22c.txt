We all know the brand "Victoria's Secret."  How could you miss the adverts of women in their underwear with wings?  They have a great product.  What is awesome about the Scottsdale Fashion Square location is the customer service and level of attention to detail.  It can be awkward for a man to walk into a lingerie store to shop for his significant other.  However, the staff here are always super friendly, extremely helpful and definitely above all else, professional.  I appreciate their help and will definitely go back.
