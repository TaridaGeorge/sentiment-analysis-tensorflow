This is the place. If you are from Utah like me, that phrase has some significance to you. 

Anywho, I walked into Kazimierz for a friend's birthday celebration (once I found it), and I was treated to a place that had the ambiance of a bar/lounge that you see in movies.

Lights low, plush couches. Wines. Olives. Cheeses. Canoodling. Fun live music.

This is a classy establishment. Leave your JV friends at home or at some of the other establishments around Scottsdale like Pattie's, Mulligans, etc. And for Godssake, wear something nice!

I know very little about wine. I'm more of a craft beer guy, but the staff had no problem explaining different wines to me. No attitude. I like that.

Bring a date here. Bring a good friend. Most importantly, bring someone you care about. It's worthy.
