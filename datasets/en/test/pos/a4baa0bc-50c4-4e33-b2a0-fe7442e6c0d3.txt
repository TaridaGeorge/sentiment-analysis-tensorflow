This is the ONLY place I would buy my fruits and veggies when I was living in Chandler.  The prices are amazing and they have a great selection of produce, bulk items, organic products, and other vegetarian/vegan items.  There were a few times where I had loaded up the cart with a ton of veggies and fruit and thought "crap, I think I went over my grocery limit this time" and was pleasantly surprised that a buttload of natural goodness only dented my wallet no more than $30.

Let me also mention that everyone in this place from customers to staff are always in a good mood.  Maybe it's the good food vibes?

Ha, try walking into an Albertson's and have someone apologize for grabbing the bunch of asparagus you were looking at and then put it back and smile.  Yeah, not gunna happen partner.

Fresh veggies ftw.
