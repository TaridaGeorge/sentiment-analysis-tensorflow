I love this place. The teas are awesome! They have 3 tasting teas of the day and are a family run local business. The employees are knowledgeable and friendly. I attended one of their tea classes and it was interesting and very informative. Their product is always fresh. They have a reward program,you can order and send as gifts online. They have an infuser that has a pressure plate on the bottom to drain the tea into your cup that rocks! Try this place you will not regret it... My only complaint is they close before I get off work so I only get to go on weekends. Five stars all the way!
