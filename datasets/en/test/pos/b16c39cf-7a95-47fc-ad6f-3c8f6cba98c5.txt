B&L Pools & Spa rocks!  Great customer service over the phone and in person. After cancelling pool service from a company because the guy was an ass over the phone, I decided to care for my pool on my own. Called a few places to find out the hours and what not, and B&L was the friendliest.  When I walked in, I was greeted and helped by Donna. She is great! Being a first time pool owner I knew my questions were pretty elementary, but Donna answered all my questions and didn't make me feel awkward about it. After testing my water, rather than just telling me what products I needed, she explained why and what they do.
