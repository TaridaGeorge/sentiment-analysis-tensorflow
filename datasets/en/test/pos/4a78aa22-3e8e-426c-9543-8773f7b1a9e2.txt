What a great and educated bunch of employees!!! I went in somewhat clueless about iMacs and walked out feeling extremely confident with my newly purchase.  Everyone is so inviting & helpful.  They all seem very passionate about their jobs & products.  No one works on commission so you know they are not going to oversell you.  Overall great experience!
