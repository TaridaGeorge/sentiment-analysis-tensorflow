One of my top places in the Valley.  Great food and drinks - try the sangria.  Good service and a really nice ambience in the place.  Mixed crowd which always seems to get along well.  A communal dining area, nice for singles or small parties.  The cookie dessert is very decadent.   Open and serving late too which is a plus since most every decent eatery shuts down by 9 or 10 in this town.
