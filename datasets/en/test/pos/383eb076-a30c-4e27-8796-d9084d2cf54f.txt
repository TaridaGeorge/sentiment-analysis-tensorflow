The fiance surprised me for a weekend getaway to celebrate our engagement a few days after he proposed :). This place is amazing! They drive you around in golf carts (although you can walk the resort in about 5 minutes). There's an amazing spa and fitness center (we took a morning yoga class, got a couples massage, and used the spa facilities). They have so many different pools (even semi-private ones near each section of rooms). Would def go back!
