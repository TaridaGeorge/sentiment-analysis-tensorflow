I never use the beds - only spray tans - (instant gratification)

Their Versa Spa Spray Tan Booth is awesome - i've tried quite a few - {they've all cloed down!}
It does 6 passses, and after each time there's a dry pass - blow drys the spray on (ie: no getting on your clothes - well, i would suggest to still wear black to the salon).  OH, try the extra moisture mist on as the 7 & 8 pass - it really makes a difference!
