Finally brought the Wife here for lunch. I had the Bulgogi Special. And wife had a Tofu Soup that she loved.. She is usually very picky when it comes to Asian cuisine. We will definitely be back. All the food we have tried so far has been consistent and Very good quality. Prices are a tad bit high, but well worth the quality of food. Each time I have been there, the service is great as well.
