This place is actually a new fancy Mc Cafe. Inside looks like a starbucks with wood finishes, pendant lights and wood flooring. VERY NICE for a McDonalds. We just ventured in for a Free Mc Flurry. So, there may be just a little bias on this one. We won coupons at the ballgame. They were, of course, delicious, and the price was right!!!!
