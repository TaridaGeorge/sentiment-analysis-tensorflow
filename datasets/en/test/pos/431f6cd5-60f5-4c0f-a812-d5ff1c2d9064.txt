Ate there the other night, visiting rom Colorado. I don't know if Scottsdale realizes what a gem it has in its midst! Pizza was excellent, the beer over the top, but the atmosphere was so comfortable and open. These guys know what they are doing and that can be a rare thing. If you like hops the Pale ale is it, if not try their Irish!!
