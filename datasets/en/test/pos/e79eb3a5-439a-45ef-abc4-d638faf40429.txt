Came here with friends on a Friday night.  The place was packed and there was a waitlist started.  Good thing part of our group was inside already eating and had reserved our seats.  The food was pretty tasty and the portions were big.  My friend I split a chicken bowl.  It filled us both up.  Our friends got other items on the menu and most of us finished our food.  Just by the looks of the crowd, it doesn't look like this place would be a disappointment.  You should try this place out if you're in the area.
