I frequent Nordstrom cafe for lunch almost once a week.  Although the food is outstanding, the service is what keeps me loyal.  Each time I go, an employee named Rick recognizes me and immediately takes care of me and my guests like a 5 star dining establishment.  He is attentive and always remembers what we drink etc.  I have never seen such a dedicated employee who clealry cares about his customers and takes the upmost pride in his job,  He always makes our dining experience remarkable.  I highly recomend visiting this wonderful cafe and if you are lucky, Rick will be your server.  He really is a gem!!!!
