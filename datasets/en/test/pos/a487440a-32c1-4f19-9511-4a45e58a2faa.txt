Let's get one thing straight: I love candy. I *heart* it. We have a long storied past. A kind of "push me, pull you" sort of relationship. 

But I was on vacation. And there are no calories on vacation. Everyone knows that, right?

My personal favorite thing about the Candy Addict is the bulk section. Not only are there the usual suspects (Smarties, Tootsie Rolls), but you can mix and match the cool stuff, too! Coconut Longboys, Slo Pokes, Chic-O-Sticks, Mini Charleston Chews, Zotz. I like variety and I appreciate that I could get it with the good stuff. 

CA's also got some international candy (I can get behind Crunchie and Aerobar availability) and a huge selection of taffy.

You can bet you bulk candy bags I'll be back here next time I'm in town!!
