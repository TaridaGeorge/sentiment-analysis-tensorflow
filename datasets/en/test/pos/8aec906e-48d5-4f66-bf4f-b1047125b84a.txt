2nd best pizza int he valley (1st is Piazza al Forno, but it's more expensive.)  I'm a n New Yorker and the pizza here is awesome - thin crust with a curious cheese combination.  Careful..the wings are deadly addicting...watch out!  I would have to say the cherry on top though is the outstanding owner/service: these are the nicest people you'll meet in a pizza joint, and they remember repeat customers.   They always smile, ask if I want a beer, etc.  This is why I keep coming back.
