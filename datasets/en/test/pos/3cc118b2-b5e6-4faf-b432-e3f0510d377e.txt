We absolutely love Delux - especially the sweet potato fries and the Delux Burger.  It's not uncommon for us to compare other places to what Delux offers.  We enjoy sitting at the bar, ordering a basket of the sweet potato fries and splitting a Delux Burger (cooked medium).  We also order more of the southwestern-style sauce (I always forget the name of it though).   Add a Sunbru beer or wine flight and 'heaven'!   :)
