This place is very clean. I have been to alot of nail salons in the past. This one is now my favorite. They use a new clean liner in the spa car everytime. I hadn't been here in over a year and the guy at the front desk recognized me. Very friendly. I got the Relax pedicure which includes spa pedicure plus callus remover, sea salt scrub hot lotion and hot towel. The guy working on me said I didn't have calluses and gave me a cucumber massage instead no additional charge. The best foot massage ever!!!!
