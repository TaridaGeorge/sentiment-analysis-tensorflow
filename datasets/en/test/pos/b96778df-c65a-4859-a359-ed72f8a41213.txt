This place is a MUST!  We had NYE reservations and Carol, the owner, went ABOVE and BEYOND to help me get engaged to my now bride to be!  Carol and her staff could not have done more and Sandy, our favorite waitress from Michigan, was table side too!  Carol arranged to have the ring brought to the table inside a unique clear pedestal mini cake plate with a large clear cover and the ring nestled inside a bed of pink carnations. Outstanding and my future wife was both surprised and blown away...Oh Yeah, she said YES!  I should also mention that, as always, the food and service was OUTSTANDING and I suspect we will spend many anniversaries at Durant's going forward!  THANK YOU Carol, Sandy and the entire staff!
