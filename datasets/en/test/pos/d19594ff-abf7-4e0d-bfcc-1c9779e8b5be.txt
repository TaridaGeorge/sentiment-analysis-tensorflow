This is our theater of choice. It's clean, short lines for everything from tickets to refreshments. You can always find a seat. And  those seats are comfortable.  Covered parking. They validate and there is food nearby that is tasty.  They also have $5 dollar movies until 12 PM. So basically matinees are cheap. I enjoy that.
