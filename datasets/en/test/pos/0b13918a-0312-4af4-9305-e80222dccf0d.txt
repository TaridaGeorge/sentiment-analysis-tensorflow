Finally got over here for breakfast on my staycation and mmmmm, I have a new favorite. I'm going to quit work and just eat breakfast at great restaurants every day, who's with me? Occupy Brunch! I had the berry pancakes and my friend had the veggie hash, neither of which sounds all that dramatic but they were both delicious. Mimosas and coffee finished off a perfect meal.
