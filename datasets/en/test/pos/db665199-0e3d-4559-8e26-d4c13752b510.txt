True Food was a truly unique dining experience. I loved the idea of going to a restaurant where you could feel good about everything on the menu in terms of its healthfulness.

I loved the vibe and decor of the restaurant. Natural. Fresh. Healthy. Colorful. Happy. 

In my party we enjoyed the following selections:
- Shaved turkey, provolone, tomato, cucumbers... warm pita
- Grilled Salmon sandwich
- Half chicken with farro
- Wild shrimp pizza
- Apple Crumble (do not have the exact menu name)
- Chocolate cake (do not have the exact menu name)
- Blood orange and olive oil cake (do not have the exact menu name)

They were all delicious. I only wish we could have tried more items from the menu. 

I highly recommend you try True Food. It seems like a perfect lunch choice, but would also be good for dinner.
