This has to be one of the best pet stores I have been to in years! The owners are so incredibly kind and helpful. My fianc√© and I have a dog we rescued recently (so he is a bit shy sometimes) and the owners were wonderful about meeting him, getting to know him, and giving him treats. They helped us find great, premium food (which he adores) and treats! We will be fulfilling all our doggie needs with the help of this store from here on out. If you have not been here and you have a dog this store really is a must. You can tell they really love animals which makes this place a joy to visit and support. Thank you Tempe Feed & Tack!
