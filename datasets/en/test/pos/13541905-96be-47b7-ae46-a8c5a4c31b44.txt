One of the most extensive wine lists I've ever seen!  This place has a great atmosphere and has some great live music (with some of my fellow New Orleans folks often playing).  

I go to the Phoenix area around twice a year for work and a friend of mine brought me here for the first time and we had a great time and I've returned ever since.  They have some tasty food and all of the wines I had were great and all of the many many others looked fantastic as well.  The servers are very knowledgeable and know when some things on the list are out but then there are other things not on this list they often recommended.  

It has always been a fun place, great ambiance, with a great crowd every time I've visited.
