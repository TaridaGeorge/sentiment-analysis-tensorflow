pretty cool mall. had a bunch of outlets shops... i wanted to stop by the cactus candy store before leaving Arizona, but we couldn't because of the time. so i was very excited when i spotted a candy store in the mall and made a mad dash to get the goods. i was so elated that i bought three boxes of cactus candy. the lady there was helpful in explaining the various types of cactus candy. after gabbing with her, she even recommend several places that served authentic indigenous Arizona/Phoenix cuisine to grab dinner...

ya have to try cactus candy if given an opportunity. it's an interesting treat!
