Is it possible to be in love with a fish sandwich?

I highly recommend the Banh Mi White Fish Sandwich paired with the chopped kale salad. If I could give this place 10 stars I would. My husband got the porkwich. I guess if you're gonna get pork then go all out with this one. It was good, but it was no Banh Mi White Fish Sandwich.

Go next door to Churn when you're done and support local businesses.

The only cons I have is the parking situation and the loud music. There are so few parking spots and they go quickly. I assume staff takes most of the spots which leaves valet. I have no problem paying for parking, but I don't feel like I have a choice.
