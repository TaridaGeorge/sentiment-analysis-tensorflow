My 5 Series BMW recently came down with a bad case of "Twisted Seat".  It was UGLY !  Not knowing what to do, I started researching car repair places and found that German Car Service had great reviews.  Well deserved!  Kenny and Mike were by far the most honest auto repair professionals I have ever encountered.  They stuck to their original estimate even though my driver seat was severely disfigured and it took longer than we had expected to get her normal look back.  Thank you so much for your help !   I HIGHLY recommend German Car Service.  Karen H.
