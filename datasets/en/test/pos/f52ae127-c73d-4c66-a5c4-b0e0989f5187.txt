I just wanted to add... The brunch is fantastic. The french toast and farm scramble were delicious. All of their brunches are about $7-10, but all look like hearty meals. There options are not the run of the mill bacon and eggs. They have put together some very delicious unique dishes. I will definitely be coming back to try different dishes. 

I have also been back several times for lunch and dinner and the food still rocks!
