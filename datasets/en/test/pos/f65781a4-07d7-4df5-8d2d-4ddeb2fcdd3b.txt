This place has the best greek food I've tried this far in Phoenix.  I'm originally from a city that has a fabulous greek town so I know my greek!  The owner is from Greece.  
If you're looking for something fancy, then you should go elsewhere, it's more of a fast food type restaurant.  But you will not be dissappointed in the food!  Delicious large servings, decent prices, great service. They even have a drive through, but better to call ahead to place your order as it could take a while to prepare (well worth the wait).
