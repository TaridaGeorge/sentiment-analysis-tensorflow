My husband and I stopped by to see and taste what this place is all about. He had a large Blue raspberry and Vanilla Gelati and I had the large Passion fruit and Chocolate Gelati. A Gelati has frozen custard on the bottom, then flavored slushy-like ice, then topped with custard again. Both came out to under $9 but the portions were quite big. They were both yummy but I think mine was a little better (his was a bit too sweet). We got large because it was like twice the size of reg but around 30 cents more. Makes sense to go large right? Anyhow, they were both very unique to our tastebuds but very refreshing and delicious... Especially in this Az heat. I am def bringing my kids here...
