I had been wanting to stay at the Sanctuary for a while now, and we decided on a quick 3 night vacation last week.  I must say we were extremely impressed with the resort, and cannot wait to go back!  The resort is a quiet paradise; it's in top-notch condition, with beautiful grounds, rooms, and amazing service.  The spa was a great experience; we both had reflexology treatments, and were able to spend time in the whirlpool and eucalyptus steam room as well.  The $ we spent on this vacation was well worth it!
