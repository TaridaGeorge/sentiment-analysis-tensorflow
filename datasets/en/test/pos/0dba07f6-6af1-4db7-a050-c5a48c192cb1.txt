I am a 100% Italian and have lived in the Valley since 93 and today was my first visit to Romanelli's.  Even though I live in North Scottsdale - I will now be a regular for the rest of my life!

I was hoping that they would have Easter Bread & Zeppole - I walked in and asked Robert and he quickly gave me the tour and the treats I was looking for.  I even added a sfogliatelle for tomorrow morning.  

The meats, the sausage, the bread, the pastry, the cookies, the pasta the Italian baccalla, the fact that they told me to call ahead if I want anything special - this place is an Italian Food Lovers paradise!

I felt like I was back on the Hill in Providence!  My kids even had the Italian Ice and some cookies!

Buona Pasqua!
