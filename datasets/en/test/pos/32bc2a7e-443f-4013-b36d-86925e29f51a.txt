Since I started running 3 years ago, I found this store online, by accident. Once I found out they had 2 stores here in the valley, I was sold. The way they custom fit you for the right running shoe for you, your feet and your sport, is truly TOP-NOTCH!! I am now on my 5th pair of running shoes, all bought from them. Between their store, their staff, and the education their website gives you, there truly is no other reason to shop elsewhere!! I get periodic emails with sales all the time and that can really save you money!! This truly is an amazing store, with great prices and a 5-Star Staff!!
