This is NOT a cookie cutter hotel. Don't show up expecting a Holiday Inn or Best Western. It isn't a Hilton or the Ritz. What it is is fun, fabulous and funky. A kitchy little hotel, locally owned, that provides you with clean, comfortable rooms, a pretty water wall in the central pool/spa area, a roof deck and free snackies from 10pm to 7am! The staff were all friendly and helpful. Eclectic decor. Lively and fun. We will definitely stay again!
