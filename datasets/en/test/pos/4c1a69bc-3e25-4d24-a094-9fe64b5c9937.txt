I am excited to write the first review for Jodi Lynn - the owner of Le Boudoir Studio. Her work is amazing and the pictures she took of me took my breath away. When we first viewed them I looked at her and said I am beautiful, and she said yes you are That is what she wants everyone to feel like. Amazingly beautiful! She does other pictures as well, of expectant mothers, babies, couples, weddings. I have viewed most of them and again, just absolutely stunning work. I am in awe. She takes the time to give you a work of art and memories that will last a lifetime. Please check her out, I promise you... you will not be disappointed.
