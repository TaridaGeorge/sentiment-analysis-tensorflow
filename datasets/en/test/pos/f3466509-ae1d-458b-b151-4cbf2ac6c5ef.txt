Ben avery is always a great place to go shooting, it does get busy on the weekend when all the 9-5ers come out to shoot. If i can i go during the week heck i was their yesterday 5/26/10. Its a bit of a drive but they open at 7am during the summer months so you can be out shooting while its not 100. 

If its your first visit you'll have to watch the safty video, its only a few minutes long.

I guess the worst thing about this place is the morons who can't follow range commands.
