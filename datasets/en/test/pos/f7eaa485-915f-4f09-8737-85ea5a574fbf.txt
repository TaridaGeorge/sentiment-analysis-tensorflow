Just after the first of the year my other half found our she has a ton of food allergies. Beef, dairy, gluten, egg whites being some of the big ones. She loves sweets and with all those allergies it is very tough to find any desserts to fit the criteria. GFC handled it nicely as I got her some gluten/dairy/egg free chocolate cupcakes for her birthday and she loved them. Thanks for the great cupcakes fitting the stringent requirements GFC!
