For several years I have lived only a short distance away from this park and would find myself here all the time.  I still come here just not as much as I would like.

Let's see at Papago Park you can:
---Watch fireworks all over the valley, on the 4th of July
---Hike, bike, nature walk
---Feed the turtles and Koi near the zoo
---Look into the zoo for free and watch the giraffes
---Have a picnic
---Have out-of-towners take their pictures with a cactus
---Climb through a hole in a rock
---Go to the DBG.
---Ride your bike along the canal

Lots to do right in the center of the Phoenix metro area.
