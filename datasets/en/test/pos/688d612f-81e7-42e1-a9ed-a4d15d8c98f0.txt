LUUUUV this place. Happy hour is great...servers are great!! I have frequented both locations and never had a problem. No, it may not be a "new, fun, hip place" but it is a nice/casual place. I have gotten the coconut shrimp and I thought it was great...it comes with this super yummy orange marmalade sauce...not sure what happened with the other Yelper. I always see more than one manager walking around and I'm sure if there was an issue they'd be quick to fix it.
