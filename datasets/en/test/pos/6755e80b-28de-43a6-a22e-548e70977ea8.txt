Ever go to those places where it TASTES like it's non-fat, all icey and 'aspartamey'? This is NOT that place! If you're a frozen yogurt junkie like me, this is the place to be.  The texture and flavor of this is so rich, you wouldn't think it's non fat or no sugar added (depending).  They have options and varieties for everyone out there.  They yogurt even has 'good for you' active cultures.  That makes it all the better if you top it with peanut butter cups like me! I would drive out of the way to go to this place ANY DAY! Luckily it's nearby...which i dont know if that's a good thing!! LOL
