When it comes to fine hotdoggary, look no further.  UNIX has the philosophy of: "Do One Thing and Do It Well."  I guarantee you they stole that from Ted's as Ted's has been doing that since 1927, and UNIX only since '69.  They charcoal broil their dogs, which gives them an awesome flavour.  I have never been disappointed by a trip to Ted's, and I bet you won't be either.  They have plenty of parking, lots of seating, and several options and variations for you.  I brought my little nephew when they visited from out of town...he loved a place devoted to the hot dog.
