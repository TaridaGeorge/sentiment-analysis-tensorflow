After six months of eating sushi at different places around Phoenix, I just happened to stumble on this gem.  The hamachi and salmon were amazing!  The Dec 29 roll as well, almost like eating dessert.  I'm really surprised how reviewers have not picked up on this great little sushi bar inside a Japanese restaurant.  What is also amazing is that it is maybe 0.2 mi away from a terribly overpriced trendy sushi only place that I found had terrible service and sushi that was not nearly as good as Shogun!  Nice job!
