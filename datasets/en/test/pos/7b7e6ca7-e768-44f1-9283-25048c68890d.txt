I'm originally from New York, and spend my summers in Vegas.  Needless to say this has made me very picky when it comes to Asian cuisine.  This is easily the best inexpensive Chinese food I have ever had.  I normally get the same thing, but I have branched out here and there and have never been disappointed.  

It's very unassuming and unfortunately not visible from Grand, so I am worried about it's survival.  That's why I decided to write my very first review singing it's praises.

The waitstaff is friendly and attentive, and as I've said the food is fantastic.

Almost everytime I go in I get the House Chicken lunch special and an order of potstickers.  Both are incredible and I highly recommend them.  Please try this place out as soon as possible, you won't be disappointed!
