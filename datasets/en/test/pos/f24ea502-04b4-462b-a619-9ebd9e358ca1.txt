I travel to my condo in Phoenix usually once a month and every trip I always go to Carrabbas. The food is excellent as well as the service. The meatballs with Riccotta cheese are my favorite appetizer. Serving portions are very generous and I usually have enough leftovers to take home. Nothing better than a hugh bowl of Carrabbas pasta and a jug of wine to make a man happy. Try it out, you won't be disappointed.
