Low prices, good food with good selection, reasonably priced and served at all seats, reserved seats if you want them, good servers who work at staying out of the way, clean, new and nice but unpretentious. But maybe best of all, they took out about half the seats in every theater and replaced them with large, comfortable seats and "snack bar" seats with rolling chairs (also more comfortable than standard theater seats). Not a bad seat in the house. The kids love it, I love it, and my pocketbook is happy.
