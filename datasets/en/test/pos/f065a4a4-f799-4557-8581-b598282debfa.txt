I went here twice since then and the workers were much nicer, no bratty attitudes, still teenagers but thats fine with me. Now I'm obsessed with this place, the food is sooo good! I love their bread and the ton of lettuce they put on your sandwich. My favorite so far is the warm roast beef, try it, it's great!
