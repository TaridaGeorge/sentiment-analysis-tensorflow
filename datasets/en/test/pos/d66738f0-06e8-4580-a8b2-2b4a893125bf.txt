This spa was amazing. It was busy the day I was there because it was monday and they have a spa "happy hour" all day on Mondays. I got a 145 dollar facial for 85! It was by far the BEST facial I have ever had. The esthetician, Lisa O. was amazing! 

I highly suggesting having lunch on the terrace there after your service. It's beautiful, relaxing, and you'll continue to be pampered while you are there!
