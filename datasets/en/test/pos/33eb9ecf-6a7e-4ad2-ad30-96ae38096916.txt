I was heading to Coffee Buzz in Awahtukee and found it closed, but I did find a jewel that opened next door. Zaytoon Kabob Bistro is a Mediterranean mecca of flavor.  I had the special today Barberry Rice and Chicken with a tomato Saffron sauce.  It was fantastic, the Pita bread was so soft and fresh I think they made it when I walked in the door.  They boast their Kabob and Wraps are the best, I will be back for sure.  If you have not been here yet you are missing the boat load of flavor.
