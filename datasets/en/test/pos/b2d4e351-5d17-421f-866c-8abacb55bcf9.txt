Was here again last night and both the service and the food were amazing. The waiter so so kind and had perfect timing on drinks, bread, etc. I think my experience written up in the last review was likely just an off-night for the restaurant or server.

Last night was a totally different experience and it was the dinner rush, we stopped in at 7:30PM. 

I ordered the carbonara with chicken instead of lobster -- just not a fan of seafood and pasta -- and it was amazingly delicious. 

I also really love their bread and butter. The bread is soft and fresh and the butter is room temperature (it's kind of a pet peeve of mine when butter is served cold). 

Yummy Italian food!
