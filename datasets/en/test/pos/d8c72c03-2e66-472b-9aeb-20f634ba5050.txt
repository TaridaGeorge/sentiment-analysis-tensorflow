Ok, found a new place to eat Chinese food in the QC.  This place was the best Chinese I have had here in the area.  I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for some good Chinese food.  I had the sesame chicken, and we also got the sweet & sour chicken and veggie order.  Everyone was happy and each "single" serving can easily feed two big sized people.
