I loved everything about this place except the location.  I was a little drunk from a wedding when I visited & all I could remember about the location was that it was in a strip mall next to a Safeway supermarket. No Bueno!  

Get past that & there's no turning back.  The atmosphere draws you in like a moth to a flame & then curiousity strikes....it looks like a bar so will their food taste like 'bar food'?? Nope, not at all!!  I had a delux burger, sweet potato fries, a red velvet cupcake for dessert & a martini (I forget what's it's called) to wash it all down. 

Ahh...that's the stuff [food] dreams are made of.
