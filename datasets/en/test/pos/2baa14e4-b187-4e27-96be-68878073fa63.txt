Sure it's a chain, but Kona Grill is a step above the rest, IMHO.  I always start with the Tuna Wasabi appetizer.  Their fried rice is just awesome, some of the best I've had.  This appetizer combines sushi (sort of) and fried rice.  I could stop there...it's so yummy.  I've had their pizza, sushi, and desserts as well and I can't say I'm ever disappointed.  

If you are looking for an authentic sushi experience, you won't find it here.  Most of the sushi is pretty mainstream.  But it you want to get a great meal and look at a ton of hotties, you can't beat it.  Go for happy hour!  Most cost effective and pretty generous.
