Five solid stars for the best meatballs I can remember eating in a LONG time!!!  YUM!

It also didn't hurt that my Husband and I were able to enjoy a couple of beers in frosty mugs (frosty mugs alone = 5 stars) out on the patio while Freddy whipped up a couple of fresh slices of pizza for us.

Fabulous meatballs, frosty mugs and fresh slices of pizza = 5 Stars in my book!
