Coolest place I've ever stumbled into. In less than five minutes, I had a beer in hand and was fist pumping to a Queen sing-a-long with a rowdy crowd. There was ample room to sit or stand, and I'm convinced Big Bang is a great bar for any audience.

I would take a date here.
I would take my parents here.
I would take the guys here.
I would even go here for a company/team meeting.

Someone who doesn't drink would even have fun. Anyone between the ages of 21 and 100 needs to get underground for guaranteed good times!
