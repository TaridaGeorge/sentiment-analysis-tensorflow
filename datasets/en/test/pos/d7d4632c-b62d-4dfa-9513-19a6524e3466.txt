From a band's perspective:

Chasers is an excellent medium sized venue.

Reasonable rental fee, if you're nice to the owner.

Great sound system if you have the right sound guy.  Enough low end to get the job done, and decent enough monitors. 

Standard lighting.  A few par cans with a good selection of colors.

All ages, Bar W/ID.

I think the capacity is around 400 realistically.  You'll need at least 100 to make the place look happening.

Our band has played Chasers at least 5 times, and every show was a lot of fun, and relatively painless.
