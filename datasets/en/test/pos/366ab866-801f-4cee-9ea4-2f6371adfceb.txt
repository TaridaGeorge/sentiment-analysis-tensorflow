I adore Glen Lakes. I have been just playing golf for a little over a year and love meeting up with my father here for a fun nine holes. The price for nine holes is a bargain! (Winter or Summer - it's always a steal) Dave the golf pro is fantastic, I took several private lessons with him and he has helped me improve greatly. He also organizes a monthly scrabble, which is always fun to participate in. Overall, this is my go to executive course for price and fun. This place really is a gem.
