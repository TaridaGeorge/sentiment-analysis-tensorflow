What a great day! We started out in the classroom (have you ever seen a size of a cow's aspirin?!) and moved on to the milk bar.   The milk was great and there were lots to choose from.  We tried strawberry, raspberry and chocolate - yum!
The hay ride was informative and we got to see over 1000 cows and one of them was even giving birth! Yeeck, hope she is ok now. 
After feeding the animals at the Petting Zoo we got to try ice cream and check out the store.  The people at the register were nice and the farm is well organized.   
Great way to spend time with your little one, educational and fun.
