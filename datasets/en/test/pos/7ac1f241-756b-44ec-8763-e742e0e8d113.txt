Oregano's is one of those few things that I truly miss about Arizona.  I wish I could teleport it off of Dobson St and over to the East Coast.

The Vino Bambino Salad is to die for - fresh greens, pasta, some kind of beans, and this wine-treated shredded chicken that I've tried my darnedest to replicate, but haven't even come close.  This thing is huge, delicious, and only costs like $7.  It's amazing.

Then there's the chocolate chip cookie dessert, soft and doughy and warm and served a la mode.  It's like hey, I just had an incredible salad, what do I need to make this experience complete?  The cookie is the answer.

Wonderful food, great service, can't recommend it highly enough.  If misfortune finds you in Desert Hell, USA, soothe your misery with a trip to Oregano!
