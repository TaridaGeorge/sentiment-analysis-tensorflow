Very nice, clean, modern facility

During a trip with the family, one of my kids came down with a bad cold.  Base on my relative's recommendation I took my son to this facility.

Dr Cohen did a thorough examination to ensure the symptoms were not serious, prescribed some medicine and made some recommendations to ensure his coughing would not worsen.

All in all a very pleasant experience, no one expects to get sick during a vacation/trip but when it happens, it's good to know that facilities & staff like Healthy Outlook are there to help & understand
