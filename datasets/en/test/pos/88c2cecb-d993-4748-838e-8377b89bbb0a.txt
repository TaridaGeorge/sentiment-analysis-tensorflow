I go here for the 3-D movies.  They are in REAL3D.  Better than any other Cinema.  I also like going in to see a movie in the evening and coming out to see all these old school cars lined up in the street.  I get my movie date and my husband gets his car fix.  This place is great for family, singles, and dates.

The seats are comfy and large for my big booty and easy to snuggle up to my hubby.  The place is always clean and has great quality picture and sound.

IMPORTANT NOTE:  They take Harkins Cups for refills!
