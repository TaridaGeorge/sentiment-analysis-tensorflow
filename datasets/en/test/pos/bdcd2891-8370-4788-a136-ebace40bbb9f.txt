My boyfriend and I love this whole foods! It is bigger with a bigger selection than the one in tempe. The cafe area is huge and so is the deli area. The employees are nice, it seems to have more products and it is like hard to choose which ones you want because it's all organic!

The problem is it is expensive, but I would pay more if I had the money and I do believe in good quality products within a reasonable price. We usually go there if we stay in Phoenix and not go to Tempe.
