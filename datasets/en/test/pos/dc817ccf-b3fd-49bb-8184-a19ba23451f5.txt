The wine list is diverse and "user-friendly."  To date, I have had many good experiences here.  I love the lounge area and to sit outside and people watch.  The bar is also a great place to plop down and enjoy wine and a great dish.  I really love the bruschetta and recently had the NYC grilled cheese with pesto.  

Great place for a first date.
