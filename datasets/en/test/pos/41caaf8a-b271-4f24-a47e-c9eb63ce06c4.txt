I have dreams about the potato onion pancakes here. I love Udupi. All vegetarian and a healthy understanding of 'vegan'. The helpful waitstaff carefully made sure I didn't eat the wrong sauce when dining with friends. 

Their pancakes are huge (actually much bigger than the filling inside) and there is a large selection of food to choose from.
