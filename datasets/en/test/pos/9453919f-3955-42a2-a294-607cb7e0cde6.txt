You have to love this place! Who doesnt love Gelato...it is so funny because in the past 4 years gelato has become very popular...a few years ago you would ask someone what gelato was and people would say "what is that?"  I used to live in Italy and my sister and I loved and lived on gelato...so when my mom and my sister found this place we were so excited!  They have such a variety of flavors and they are all delicious...there is something for everyone!  They have all fruit ones and they have more decadent flavors too...This will always be my go to gelato spot in Phoenix!  ITS THE BEST!!!!
