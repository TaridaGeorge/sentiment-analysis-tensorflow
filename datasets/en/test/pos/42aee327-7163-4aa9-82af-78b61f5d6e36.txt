I ABSOLUTELY LOVE Postino's!  Ask me any night of the week where I'd like to dine, and this place would be on my top three list.  The rotating wine menu, the bruschetta, the fantastic house salad, the delectable desserts, the bruschetta, the fantastically crafted sandwiches - did I mention the bruschetta?  Definitely try the prosciutto with figs and mascarpone!  The service here is very good as well, and their hours are fairly accommodating for late evening diners.  On Monday nights there is also the added bonus of being able to order pizza from the pizzeria across the parking lot, and there are a few nights you can find a DJ there mixing it up if that's your thing.  My only (small) issues with this place?  Parking absolutely stinks, and the acoustics leave a lot to be desired.
