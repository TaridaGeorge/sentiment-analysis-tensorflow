Great music and atmosphere! I hadn't been to a piano bar since Beale St. in Memphis and Bourbon St. in New Orleans, and this place did not disappoint. It was fun singing along with the crowd to the eclectic selection of songs (eg, favorites like "Sweet Caroline" and "Jessie's Girl" to "Jane Fonda," a lot of current Top 40 hits, country and alternative music.) They really do a good job of engaging the whole audience. This was a nice change of pace from standing around in the typical crowded bars in the area. It's best if you're able to get a table, and our waitress was very attentive.
