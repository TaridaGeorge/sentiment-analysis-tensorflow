Dr. Brenke is amazing. He always is very friendly with kids and makes sure they are comfortable and happy. My one year old fell and knocked his tooth wiggly he drove 40 min. On his day off (Sunday )) to meet me at his office to check him. With no charge at all just wanted to make sure he was fine. I would never go anywhere else. He is amazing.
