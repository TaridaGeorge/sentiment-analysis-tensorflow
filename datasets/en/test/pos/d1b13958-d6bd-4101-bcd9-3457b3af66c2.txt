I have been going to Bookmans since I think middle school. As far as used CD/DVD/Video Games, this place beats all.  Even though I no longer buy hard copies of CDs, I still go here looking for video games and DVDs for real cheap. They have an awesome selection of everything. I also collect vinyl records and Bookmans has tons of vinyl. My wife likes looking through their huge selection of magazines. They even have toys and stuff that would interest the kids. Oh yeah and the endless amount of books. Reading is not my bag of chips so I know nothing about their book collection. Reading is lame. They also have a 18 yr. + closet for all you perverts out there.
