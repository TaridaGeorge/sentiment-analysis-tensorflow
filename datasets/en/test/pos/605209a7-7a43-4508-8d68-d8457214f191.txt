Just came from Yoli's. OMG it is a gem!!! You would NEVER find it unless you looked up places in downtown Chandler.  GPS takes you to what seems like front...and you probably would not go in (looks like house).  Main entrance is actually on other side.  It serves breakfast and lunch, small, but nice, inside, and outside has a beautiful courtyard...big surprise!  Many plantings, trees, benches, parakeets, birds, cockatiels singing their hearts out!  Only 54 outside but sat at table in the sun and had to take off jacket.  Great breakfast with super friendly staff.  We will be going there once a week while we are here! Pictures they have posted DO NOT do them justice!
