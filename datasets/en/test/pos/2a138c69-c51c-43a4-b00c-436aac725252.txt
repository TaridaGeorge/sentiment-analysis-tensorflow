What an awesome place for a private dinner!

I recently had the pleasure of attending an engagement party at Arcadia Room. Not only does the setting provide the perfect ambiance for such an event, but the room comfortably fit about 80 people, with some room to spear.  The food was just decent, but words cannot describe how friendly and accommodating the staff went out of its way to be.

If you're planning something along the lines of a rehearsal dinner, or looking for a spot for a company christmas party, I highly recommend the Arcadia Room.
