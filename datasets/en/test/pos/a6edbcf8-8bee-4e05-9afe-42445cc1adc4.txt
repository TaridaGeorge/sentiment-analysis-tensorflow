I have been here 2x since moving down here from cali bay area. I am a coffee snob and I really fit in here. The staff is very cute and helpful.
The people in the shop remind me of the bay area.
I drink americanos and the beans being used are very robust and smooth.
The menu selection is nice for the food fair and I really enjoy the general atmosphere.

I strongly recommend this cafe!!!
