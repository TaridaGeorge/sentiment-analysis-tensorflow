A group of four came here for dessert and drinks on a Saturday night after dinner elsewhere. This bar is one of the best place for people watching. The butter cake is the most amazing dessert ever. Our tab for 4 cocktails and 4 desserts was about $120, not including tip.  Little pricy, but worth doing once a quarter.

On a side note, I have been to this location multiple times.  The food and service have never disappointed.  The filet and lobster mash are my favorite.  They do a nice presentation if you tell them it is your birthday.
