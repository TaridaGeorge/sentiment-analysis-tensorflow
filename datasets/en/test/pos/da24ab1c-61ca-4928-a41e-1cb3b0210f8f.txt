As a registered dietitian, I am constantly searching for restaurants that offer wholesome, healthy and delicious options. We started off with the elixirs which were all uniquely tasty and refreshing. We followed the drinks with the hummus which was as good as it gets. I got the curry dish but substituted chicken with tofu. I never wanted my plate to end! The flavors were exceptional but not overpowering. Our waiter was knowledgeable, curteous, and pleasant. Dessert was the blood orange cake. One bite was enough to satisfy the obligatory after dinner sweet craving. I recommend this restaurant to ANYONE! YUM!!
