Grand opening today.  I could not wait and am so happy to have it so close to my home. I was not the first 100 but the in the 1st 500 people today.  It was a crazy grand opening.  They did an excellent job getting people through the line.  Large bright aisles large selection of fresh fruit and flowers.  Organic and affordable.  I will never have to step foot in the Fresh and Easy on 48th and Warner ever again. Yeah!
