Whenever I review someone's wedding registry and see things like "insulated cookie sheets" at $10 a pop, I want to take the couple to Standard Restaurant Supply to show them what a real cookie sheet for half the price looks like.

The staff there is incredibly friendly and they have everything you can think of, including stuff you have no idea what it does.  I have to resist the urge to buy the 30 gallon stock pot, simply because I want to own a 30 gallon stock pot ( who wouldn't!?)
