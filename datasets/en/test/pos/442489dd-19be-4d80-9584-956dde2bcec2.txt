I have been searching for a good Cheesesteak, and I have found it.  These guys are living my dream.  The owner and his wife started with a food truck and are now running a nice little spot.  They do so with a smile and friendly Hello when you come through the door.  Really glad they are close to the house and work.  

P.S.  Park in back
