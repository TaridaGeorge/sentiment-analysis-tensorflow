This place is great!  I'm originally from the Chicago area, where Gyros places are a dime a dozen and I had been missing it until I found George's.  Just like the places back home.  Good food, good prices, the staff is as friendly as can be and they even have a small bar if you want a drink with dinner.    I reccomend a shot of Ouzo.  Cheers!
