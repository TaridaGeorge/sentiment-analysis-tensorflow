Very nice dining experience.  We had dinner on a Thursday night and started with the small order of the escargot cassoulet, I don't normally like escargot, but this was amazing and I wished we'd ordered the large.  Then we split a large Waldorf salad, it is made table side and it's a generous portion.  For entree's, I had the veal and crab, which was delicious while my boyfriend had the crispy redfish and he really enjoyed that.  We were too full to order dessert, but they did box up their cotton candy for us to enjoy later as well as two boxes of their delicious fresh baked bread.  We had the garlic focaccia and the chocolate cherry.
