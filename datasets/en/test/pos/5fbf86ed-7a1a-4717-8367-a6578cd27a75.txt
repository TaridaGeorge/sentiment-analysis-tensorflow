Love it!!! Having taken a recent mini vacay with the bf to Arizona, we decided we wanted to try out the local breweries. We stumbled upon Four Peaks from the suggestion of our kayaking tour guide. He def made an excellent suggestion. The place is huge and is super accommodating for all of its patrons. We tried the Raj IPA and the PEach beer. Both were amazing, especially the Peach beer. It totally hit the spot on such a blazing hot day. Later, we shared the beer sampler, beer battered fries, and clam chowder. I know we're crazy for having clam chowder when its like 110 degrees outside and there's not AC inside, but it was really good. The beer battered fries were great. The serving is huge too and is perfect for sharing. I would totally come back here if I'm ever in Arizona again.
