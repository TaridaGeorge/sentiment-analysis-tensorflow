I took my first yoga course at Second Heart Yoga. It was wonderful! Nan was very sweet and helpful. The environment is very relaxing and I felt comfortable trying something new in the company of such warm people.

I've also enjoyed the Sunday morning Yoga for charity. Nan led a class outside. Enjoying the nature and the relaxed flow of the course was a wonderful feeling.
