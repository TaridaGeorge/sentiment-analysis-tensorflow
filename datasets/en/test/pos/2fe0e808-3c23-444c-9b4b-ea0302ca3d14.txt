Lush, where have you been my whole life? I was killing some time walking around the Scottsdale mall when I got called in to try some foot treatment. Not only was it nice and soothing, but all the people working there were super friendly and knowledgable. So, after just walking in to smell some pretty soaps, I ended up walking out with a small bag of treasures. They have these amazing fresh masks they make weekly, I took the Honey one home and have used it twice so far and LOVE it. Definitely worth a visit!
