Felt so bad, walked into this place with a huge group right when they were doing last call. But what did they do? The staff made it happen! The waitress treated us wonderfully and immedietly told us the specials. I'm not a huge rum person at all, but the signature drink she offered me was delicious! The astmosphere was great, very cute spot. 

 Rum bar is definitely worth checking out! I'm all about new hot spots in downtown Phoenix!
