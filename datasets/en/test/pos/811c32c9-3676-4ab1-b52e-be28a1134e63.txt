You want a great Cheese Steak? Philly's Famous is the place!    A small shop with a dozen tables and a real family running the place.  Three generations working together and being together just like the neighbor shops back east.  This is the kinda character we are missing in Arizona.  What odors that have to do with a good cheese steak? Everything!  The daughter takes your order the mother runs the grill this shop is their lives and it just takes one bite of the steaming hot steak to know they care.  The bread is right, it's filled right and the red sauce is excellent.  Enjoy.
