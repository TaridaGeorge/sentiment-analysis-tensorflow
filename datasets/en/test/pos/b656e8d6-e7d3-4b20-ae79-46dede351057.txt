Went here with a friend when I was in Phoenix on business.  I had the Roasted chicken with green garlic whipped potatoes,
confit tomatoes and mushroom sauce.  It was very tasty!  I would definitely go here again.  The decor was modern, and a little noisy with the high ceilings, but it was fine.  They had a full bar, a good wine list, wonderful food and complimentary valet parking.  The music was very good as well..  They get 5 stars for playing DeVotchka while I was in there :D and serving wonderful food.
