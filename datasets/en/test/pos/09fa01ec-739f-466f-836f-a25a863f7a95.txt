My favorite Friday night! I always look forward to the end of work each week to note the 40 hours have been put in and it is time to start the weekend.  I can't say enough how I absolutely love The Watering Hole draft beer and wine bar.  At happy hour prices you can't beat, choice of any bottle to open off the beer wall or $5.00 for a beer sampling, what's not to love.
I appreciate the camaraderie of all the patrons who purchase their pizzas and share it too!  So much fun deliciousness, must thank James for designing such a wonderful hang out!
