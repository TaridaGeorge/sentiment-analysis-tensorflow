My windows were cleaned on Wednesday. I feel like the whole world is brighter now! I also had shower glass and chandeliers cleaned. The owner of the company also does delivery (i.e. picking up large items at Costco, etc.). That could come in handy over the holidays. He is very entrepreneurial and is a very hard worker. I'm so glad I called and had this glass project taken care of!
