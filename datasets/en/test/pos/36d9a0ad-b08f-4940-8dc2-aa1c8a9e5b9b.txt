I love this restaurant.  Every time I've been there, the owner has treated me well.  This is a great place to get some dessert.  They are little more expensive than your average grocery store, but they are better than anything you would get at a restaurant.  It is really fantastic.  So many choice, so little time.  I would recommend trying this out whenever you have the chance.  

Also, the location belies the greatness of the food sold at this place.  I would highly recommend supporting a local business such as this.  ;)
