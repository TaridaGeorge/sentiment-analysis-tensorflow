I attended the 2008 Christmas party of SYNERGY HomeCare of the East Valley and was introduced to the wonderful food from Joe's. Since then we've been back for take-out and have started a long-term relationship with this real BBQ. Oh so good, and that pecan-wood smoky flavor! We particularly love the chicken breast and turkey barbeque. It's well worth the extra drive to Gilbert, and the take-out window is a lot quicker than the line inside. Joe's Real BBQ is one of the top 5 'must visit' restaurants in the area. Highly recommended.
