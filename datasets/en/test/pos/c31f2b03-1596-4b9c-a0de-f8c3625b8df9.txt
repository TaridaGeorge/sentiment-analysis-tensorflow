We gave Big Buddha a try when they first opened years ago. We were really unimpressed... But we recently decided to give them another go since most other Asian restaurants in Surprise are chains and, for the most part, nasty (I have to exempt Fresh Wasabi and SK as they are both great). Our minds have been changed, BB is really good food!

We have been a few times and everything has been very good! Favorites are the chow fun, house fried rice, happy family, and garlic chicken... For a very healthy twist, try the snow white chicken and skip the rice. Best egg rolls anywhere!
