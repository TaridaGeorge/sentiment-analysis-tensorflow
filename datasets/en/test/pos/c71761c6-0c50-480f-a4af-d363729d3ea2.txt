Forgot the straw... but still five stars!

I was in Scottsdale for work, and wanted to relax in my hotel room after a long day of meetings.  Not being from the area, I googled delivery, and Rome's Pizza came up.  Friendly woman on the phone, and from previous reviews, she must be in the family of this self-owned and run business.  My bolognese and fettuccine came within the promised half hour, and the food was fresh.  Delivery guy was nice and friendly.  Probably the most delicious delivery pasta I've ever had.  Even the salad was fresh and I don't think it was prepackaged, as many pizza places do.  Yes they forgot the straw for my drink, but I definitely recommend... for both in- and out-of-towners!
