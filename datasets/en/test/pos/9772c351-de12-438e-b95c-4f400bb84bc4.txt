Excellent restaurant. Impeccable cuisine and a well trained staff. My glass was never empty. The courses were brought out in a timely fashion. Not rushed just perfectly timed so that the next item appeared just as we were finishing the last. Ian was gracious and knew the menu and how everything was made. All this served in a beautifully room. Very romantic
