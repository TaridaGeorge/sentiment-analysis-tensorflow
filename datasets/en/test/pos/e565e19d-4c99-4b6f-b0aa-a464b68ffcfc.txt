I came here Saturday at noon with my girl Brooke. I've been here once before, but over 5 years ago. It's a smaller nail salon, with about 5 or 6 pedi spa chairs & about 5 or 6 nail stations. I usually bring my own polish but this time I didn't because I wanted green & didn't have that color. Selection was decent but a lot of the bottles looked old, still found the color I was looking for though! My pedi was awesome & a good deal at $19 (plus $5 for colored tips & $5 for flowers, so $29 total). Brooke got a full set of acrylics with pretty, pink glitter tips for I believe $30-35. Wish I took a pic of her nails. FYI- If you're paying with a card you have to tip in cash. I'd definitely come here again!
