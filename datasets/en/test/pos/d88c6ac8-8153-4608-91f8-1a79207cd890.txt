This Lowe's is a big, beautiful example of a home improvement and gardening store!  I love walking around the aisles... it's nostalgic for me since my dad was a shop teacher when I was a kid and I was practically raised in a hardware store. haha   

Anyway, on my visit last week, I went specifically for paint samples and ideas on an upcoming bathroom renovation.  Lowes' provided both, although the looks I was interested in came from their bathroom improvement books rather than their floor models.  At least they have floor displays set-up.  Some other stores (no names here) like Lowe's don't even have that!  

So with the help of the super friendly and attentive staff, I ended up leaving with a bunch of new ideas in my head and I'll definitely be back!

See ya there!
