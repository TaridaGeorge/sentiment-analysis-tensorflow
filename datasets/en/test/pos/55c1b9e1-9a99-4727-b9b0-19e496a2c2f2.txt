look for it, look for it... wait turn around.... you found it.  Now go in and enjoy... THANK YOU Tucker, Kevin - drinks were great! First timer here and already have plans to come back on Saturday. Walls are lined with cross-sectioned logs, place has an over all rustic feel. Glowing red bar adds some fun.  Definitely deserves a few returns.
