Great views. This place will be 5 stars as soon as the kitchen renovation is completed and the chef's table is up and running. Make reservations NOW. Beau MacMillan is a Iron chef champ, and he cooks American cusines with an Asian flaire. The wine list is possibly the best in town, with hard to find bottles and great wines by the glass.
