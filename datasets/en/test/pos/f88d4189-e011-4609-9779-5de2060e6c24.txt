This is a bar. I have never ordered raw oysters here, but the Oysters Rockafeller, though they take some time to arrive, are well worth the wait. The bartenders and servers are all super cool, they have a nice selection of draught beer and single malt whisky too.
The crowd ranges from incredibly down to earth and musically inclined, to yuppy gay hipster, with a liberal smattering of Tempe Locals Faculty  and Students. 
I don't really think that anyone plans to come to Casey's to eat. You eat at Casey's because you have been drinking!!! 
This place has a really beautiful grounds. The beer garden and victorian really are a lovely setting in which to soak in your friend's story while. Lot's of eye contact and flirting seem to go down here!
