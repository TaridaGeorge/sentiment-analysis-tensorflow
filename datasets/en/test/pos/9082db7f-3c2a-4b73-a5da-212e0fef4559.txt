The facility is beautiful.  Even the cheapest seats give a decent view of the stage and the place has a great atmosphere.  The staff is helpful and it's in a great location.

The very best thing about the place?  The quiet room.  Off to the side of the stage is a soundproof box with a speaker piping in the audio.  If you kid gets restless, you can head off to the quiet room and help soothe the kid without disturbing anyone else in the audience. 

Sometimes it just takes a few minutes of quiet time and life is back on track.

Brilliant, brilliant concept.
