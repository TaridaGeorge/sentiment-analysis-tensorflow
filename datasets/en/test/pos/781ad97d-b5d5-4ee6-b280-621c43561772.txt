I had written my original review after the first time I went here.  Since then, I have probably been about 20 more times.  This place is totally a 5 star, bombastic breakfast diner.  The waitress is amazingly quick and on top of things.  I really appreciate that attentiveness in the morning.  The kitchen kicks out food just as quickly and it sure is good.  I've tried the sausage and eggs (which is a giant polish sausage that has been grilled) and "The Bus" (which is a huge piece of ham).  The food is always great and the bill is always under $20 for both of us.  This is our fallback for breakfast now.  No more Denny's or IHOP - ALWAYS JERRY'S.  We even went Christmas morning while waiting for the family to wake up.  This place is top notch.
