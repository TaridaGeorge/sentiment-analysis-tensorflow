Great customer service! Just went to gate C and tried this cafe. At first, I thought it was panera and it basically is (it is owned by the same company). I was greeted with a free cookie, which is always good in my book. I ordered my panera usual, and it was great! Only a little over $7 for half sandwich, half soup! And, to my surprise, it came with a complimentary piece of bread and a cookie! Well worth the walk from Gate D ;)
