This is a Great park! We go often to play disc golf. Its a challenging course, especially if its windy! Great views of the entire East Valley from up there. Gotta get the dogs over to check out this dog park. Looks like a lot of fun.

4-23-11. Hit up the dog park this weekend with all three of the doggies. Great park with plenty of playful, well behaved dogs. Love this park.
