OK guys and gals - this is it, number one in the valley
Nothing compares, we have eaten the menu from top to bottom - its all 100% quality food.
But thats not the best part - in fact its all about the customer service.. OK so we are not snowbirds so we have a small advantage but show me another resturant (chinese or any other) where the staff greet you and then remember what your favorite drink is.. OK to be fair its Dave the waiter who has the mastermind memory bank but everyone is so polite - in fact they make you feel like part of the family..

Go on - try it - you will not be let down
