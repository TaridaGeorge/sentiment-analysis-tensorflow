I dropped in here because they were the newest business in the Sprouts plaza that I shop at pretty regularly. I've bought several things here already: leash, harness, paleo cat food, catnip spray, and carriers. Whew! All the employees that I have interacted with have been really nice. 

My latest purchase was the carrier and they only had one in stock, but I wanted two. So the manager/owner ordered one right away for me. She even gave me a coupon to use for 25% off for the grand opening celebration which was really nice of her to do for such a big ticket item.

They also have a self service dog wash room in the back which would be pretty cool if I had dogs.
