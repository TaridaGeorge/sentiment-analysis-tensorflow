NCounter might be my favorite new lunch spot. There, I said it. This Mill Avenue spot is tucked away on the quieter North end of Mill, but it deserves a visit. With a large outdoor patio, a beautiful atmosphere and DELICIOUS food, this gem is definitely worth paying for parking. 

The Cobb Sandwich is one of the best lunch picks I've ever made. With a side salad, it's the perfect meal. All the sandwiches are tasty, so you can't go wrong. And with a case of sparkly baked goods, you can round off your day with a delicious cupcake or cookie. 

Stop by. You'll be so glad you did.
