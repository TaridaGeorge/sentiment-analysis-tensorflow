I moved here from Maryland. I needed to find a house to rent.  I talked to Patty Walberer from Property AZ. I gave her the parameters of my needs of a house and my preference to live in Surprise. She had me looking at houses the next day. I had many options to choose and was able to easily make a decision.  Patty is very knowledgeable, efficient  and fun to work with.  I would recommend her to anyone in needs of renting out a property or trying to get a property to rent.
