Soo good! I loved the feel of this restaurant and the food was so good.  I got the Ground Beef Sliders with their in-house made mozzarella on top and I was most certainly not disappointed.  It was recommended to me by Matt S, who I must say never leads me in the wrong direction when it comes to food.  Anyway it was so good, the service was great, I think I have told everyone I talk to about them.  Too bad everyone out here in QC seems to look at me like...um yeah...I go there all the time...where have you been?  In conclusion it has now been added by the wifey and I as one of our favorites, we can't wait to try out other menu items.
