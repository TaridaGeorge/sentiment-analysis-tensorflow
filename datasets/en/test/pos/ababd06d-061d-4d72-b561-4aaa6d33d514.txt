It is places like this that make me wish I lived downtown or at least closer to downtown. 

I don't know if I can write anything that has not yet been written about the Roosevelt. The decor, concept, menu, and atmosphere are incredible. It is the perfect low key drinking spot. The bartenders were slammed but still accommodating the server gave us the heads up on open seating in the front room and checked on us frequently despite the crowd. I don't know if we just picked the right night to go but we didn't encounter to many undesirable characters and they seemed to keep to themselves. I am anxious to go back and try some food and explore the beer menu.
