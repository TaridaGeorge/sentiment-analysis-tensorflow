I've been a Discount Tire fan for many years and my visit today exemplified why: I arrived at 10:00 am today, for  balance & rotation,  and was glad to see they were not very busy. The service manager that wrote my ticket up was very friendly and professional, and promised the work would be done in 30-35 minutes. Boy was he wrong, as it only took 15 minutes! The technician that brought the car around, summarized the work they'd done and was also very professional - and I was on my way home with a bottle of their cold complementary water!!

Excellent!
