I have been a patient of Dr. Johnson's since 2000.  I have three kids - 10,3,2 that have all seen him since they were babies.  Occasionally we see Lindsey Michaud or Dr. Crawford if it is a last minute appointment.

They are all AWESOME!!!  Their nurses are very kid-friendly as well.  It is very convenient that my whole family uses the same doctor's office, which has kid-themed "murals" in some rooms.

I have referred several people I work with to these doctors - one has special needs - and they have all been happy.
