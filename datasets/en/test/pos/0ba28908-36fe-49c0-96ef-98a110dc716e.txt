I ate dinner here with some Chinese friends.  It definitely helped that they spoke the language.  The food was terrific - we shared, beef w/fungus, fish in a delicious ginger sauce, BBQ pork, duck and the soup of the day.    It was a Saturday night, and the place was packed, but we received excellent service.  My friend simply put her arm up in the air, and a server appeared right away.    They gave us an opportunity to cancel our duck order, as it would take about 30 minutes to prepapre.  It was well worth the wait.  

It will be interesting to go back, without my Chinese friends, and see if I can get good service myself.
