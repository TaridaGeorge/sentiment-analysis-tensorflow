Loved the All American hot dog with tater tots meal!!! By far one of the best hot dog joints out there! 

My fiancé had the Jalapeño burger with tots and we both loved it!! Way better than McDonalds in Alaska. 

Strawberry Banana smoothie was absolutely delicious as well!

No complaints here for Sonics. :-)
