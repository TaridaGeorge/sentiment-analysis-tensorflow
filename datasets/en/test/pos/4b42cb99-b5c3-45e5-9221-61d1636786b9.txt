I love this hotel! I've been staying at the Clarendon exclusively for the past 5+ years every time I work in the Phoenix area. Whenever I DJ at parties out here I always insist the promoters book me here at the Clarendon. I love the fact that this hotel is an old apartment building that looks like it was built in the 1960's, the retro decadent look is so cool. The swimming pool and jacuzzi are definitely the highlight here especially in the evening when the bottom of the pool is sparkling with fiber optic lighting. Every year I visit here the hotel is changing and improving it's look and amenities. I'm looking forward to the newly remodeled rooftop with plush seating and bar and a wonderful view of the city skyline
