I LOVE CPK. 

They've added new items to the menu. The only bad side is their lunch prices are the same as dinner prices which is a bit disappointing. 

Average entree is $13-14. Add a drink & an appetizer .. you end up spending over $40 easily between 2 people.

This location accepts 20% ASU discounts for Dine-In/Take-Out!!

Plenty of parking since its shared with other business in the Tempe Marketplace but can be more difficult to find a close spot on the weekends.
