I randomly walked passed a pizza place and told my wife that we should try it out. Coming from Chicago, we are always looking for a great pizza place in the valley. We took the pizza home and were shocked how good it was. We tried it again and I actually watched the nice man take his time on each pizza, as we ordered 2. He is a perfectionist and it comes through from the quality of the food. My family of 4 now goes there every week and it's truly our favorite place in the valley..Piza Pizza!!
