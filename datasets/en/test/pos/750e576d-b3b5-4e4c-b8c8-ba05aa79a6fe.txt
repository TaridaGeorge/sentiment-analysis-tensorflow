One of the few places where I can justify splurging a hefty chunk of my paycheck. Besides what they usually have on display, their sales rack is also really impressive. I picked up two shirts, a pair of jeans, a vest, and a sweater all for around $70. Another element that really makes this store is their accessory offerings. Lomo cameras, USB turntables, Mighty Muggs, Chuck Klosterman books, etc.. As far as shopping goes, you'll definitely find this spot to be a breath of fresh air when it comes to Scottsdale Mall or Oldtown. It seems like this place has figured out a way to capitalize on hipster culture and managed to not make it as cheesy as expected.
