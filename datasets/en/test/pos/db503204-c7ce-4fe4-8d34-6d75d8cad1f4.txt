I adore the Lululemon Athletica Biltmore store and each of their lovely team members! It feels like "Cheers" when I walk into the store. Everyone knows my name! They are very knowledgeable about the clothing and seem genuinely enthusiastic when I find something I love. Their involvement in the local community brings about lots of fun activities that bond the community together and don't dig at your wallet. I feel like every dime I spend at Lulu is well worth it- not only because I'm purchasing a quality product, I'm supporting an ethically sound company, and contributing to a positive community movement. If you haven't found Lululemon Athletica yet, try it! You won't look back!
