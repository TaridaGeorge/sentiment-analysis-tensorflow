My office gets dozens of cupcakes every year from different places around Christmas time and every year I'm disappointed. When another grateful vendor came in with a new box of cupcakes today, I yawned. "Great," I said. "Another dry, over-frosted piece of cake." So, of course I took one because, hey it's free and I like stuffing my face. 

This was not just another cupcake. This was heaven in folded baking paper. 

Quickly nomming through the moist vanilla cake and rich, but not overpowering, chocolate ganache frosting, I was already planning my trip to wherever these delicacies were borne. Because I need more. A lot more.
