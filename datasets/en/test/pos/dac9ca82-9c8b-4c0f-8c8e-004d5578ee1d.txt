This place is a gem!  This was my 3rd time here, first time for lunch.  The food and service was spectacular!!! The fish and chips, the best I've ever had, including some places in London!! The Blackened Chicken Sandwich on TOASTED chibatta, done perfectly.  They also have amazing happy hour specials from 4-7 and I recommend the crab cakes.  This place is all around perfect, I just wish I would have found it sooner.  They also do a recurring Tuesday night trivia night, which packs the place and is great entertainment. 

Top notch all around!
