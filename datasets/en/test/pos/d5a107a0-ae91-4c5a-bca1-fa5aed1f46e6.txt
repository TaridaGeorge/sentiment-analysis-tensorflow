In a sea of restaurant possibilities, La Grande Orange stands out. When I think of the ONE THING I want to eat after breaking a diet, running a half marathon or just sitting on my computer all day, it has to be the Commuter Sandwich with Smoked Salmon paired with an LGO Arnold Palmer. The Commuter is so simple but perfectly executed with their amazing ingredients. 

If I'm feeling really saucy, I'll add their Green Chile Mac n' Cheese. It is the creamiest Mac n' Cheese I've ever eaten and has a subtle kick from the chilies. 

Besides the food, I love checking out their collection of nick-nacks and the old school candy collection. It's also a great place to bring my dogs and sit in their shady garden area. 

LGO Grocery is just a fun, laid back place to get some great food.
