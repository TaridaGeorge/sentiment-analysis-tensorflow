Pineapple upsidedown pancakes and pecan-smoked bacon. Did I sell you yet? Do you even need to hear more than that? Oh my goodness. The PB & J french toast is something extra special too. Excellent coffee, pretty much just a perfect breakfast location. I like the look of their lunch menu, I'll definitely be back to try some of that.
