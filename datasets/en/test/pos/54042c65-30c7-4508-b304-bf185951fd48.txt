What a wonderful dining experience! From the moment we walked in we were treated like special guests by the owner. Best yet, the food totally lived up to the impeccable service, culminating in a perfect evening. Even the all AZ wine list - which caused me concern - measured up to the exceptional high quality of the food. We wil be back  - this place is a foodie's dream!
