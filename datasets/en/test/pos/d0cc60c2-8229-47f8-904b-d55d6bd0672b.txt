Typical Review follows:

Service:  Excellent, it appears the server we had tonight is also an owner to some degree.  He knew everything necessary to answer any questions and supplement with additional ideas. 
Food:  I have had good French food in the past and this met or exceeded my expectations.  For the money...cant be beat.
Location: No complaints here.  Lighting was very nice and the bar tiling had a great color.
