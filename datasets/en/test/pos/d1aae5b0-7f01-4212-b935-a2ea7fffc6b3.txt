Went in here on a whim since its close to home to get some dog food. After asking me questions about my dogs and our lifestyle they recommended a food and WOW! What a difference in my labs! Their coats are nicer, have gotten leaner muscle mass and definitely a lot less poop to clean up (yay!). The prices are competitive with the large box stores, which honestly, surprised me. I get my cat food here now as well and I swear, my cat has gotten bigger. Not fatter, just bigger. And she's 5. The staff are super friendly and knowledgable and I love supporting a small local business when it deserves to have my money.
