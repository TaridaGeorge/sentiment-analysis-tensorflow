Four Peaks is awesome.  Its a definitive Tempe establishment and represents all the best things of the area.  This was a favorite lunch spot when I used to work in Tempe, and its still a great place for dinner or happy hour.  For beer, I recommend trying the Kiltlifer.  They brew it there, and its excellent.  All their food is beyond good--not just for bar food, but better than most sit-down restaurants.  Its usually crowded, but good food and beer tend to do that to a restaurant, and the wait is comparatively short for a table.  They're also open late, which is convenient especially now that that the light rail runs until 2am on weekends (its near Dorsey station).
