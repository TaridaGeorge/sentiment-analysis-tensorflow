This is absolutely the best shoe store for people with wide feet. Like the other reviewer, I could never find shoes that fit and was wrecking my feet by wearing shoes that were too large. The salesman at Otherwides measured my feet and it turned out I was actually a size six! At times I was buying shoes as large as size nine because my feet are so wide. Needless to say, Otherwides is the only place I will buy shoes now. Everything I have bought at Otherwides has fit perfectly. In several cases, I have worn the shoes until they wear out, then replaced them with the exact same shoe. My feet feel great and I love the shoes I buy at this shop.
