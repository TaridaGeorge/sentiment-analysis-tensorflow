Can't believe it is still open after 40 years...

If there ever is a fire, everyone is dead...Seriously...Only the stairs up will get you out....Yes folks, it is a Cellar....

More of a novelty than a good restaurant...Seafood in Arizona isn't very good. You can't get Mexican in Charleston...so there is the trade off.
