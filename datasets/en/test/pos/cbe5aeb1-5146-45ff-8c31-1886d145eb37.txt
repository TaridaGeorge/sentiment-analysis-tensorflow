Hungry Monk is the newest addition to my "I wish it were in the city" list. 

This place features craft beers on draft, and it's not like that range of places that offer whatever keg is going to sell the best because they want the money. This guy stocks beers that are actually interesting, hard to find, and really worth the trip. I had a Lost Abbey Judgement Day and my girlfriend had the Dead Bastard, which is basically just an Arrogant Bastard and a Rogue Dead Guy mix, not a complitation between the two breweries. I found this a bit odd but whatever. 

I didn't have any food, but this place definitely gets it when it comes to beers.
