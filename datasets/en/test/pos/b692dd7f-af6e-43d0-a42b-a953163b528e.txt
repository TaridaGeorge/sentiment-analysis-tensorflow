I was so excited for Green to finally open a location -- right across the street from my house. Everything I've tried, I loved. Their "burgers" are delish (try the Mexicali, Green burger, spicy 'g'), the rice/noodle bowls (drunken mushroom, mongolian, curry bowl, earlobe pasta) are awesome and their fresh-made limeade and lemonade and basilade are to die for. 

I brought my mom and 13 year old brother here, and they were satisfied. You ever tried feeding a picky 13-year-old? He loved the spicy 'g' sandwich. Oh, and don't forget to try one of their pizzas. YAY.

And now, they sell daiya cheese for the veggie/vegans -- which is really convenient since many places don't have it. Five stars!
