**BYOB**

Ristorante Giuseppe is a tiny little restaurant that's only open for a few hours - and if you're lucky enough to beat the rush and get a table you will never forget it.  

The staff really treats you like family, without all the bickering... The food is FABULOUS and the specials are special for a reason.  The price isn't really bad for the quality of food you're getting. 

Oh, did I mention their desserts?  OMG - don't leave this place without ordering at least two items from the dessert menu.
