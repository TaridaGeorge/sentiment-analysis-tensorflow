So I finally checked it out over the weekend, great customer service. One of the associates took the time to tell me all about yoga and the classes that they have. Leaned something new, Not only are there yoga classes on Sundays in the park, but there are also other classes available Monday and Tuesday ( not Yoga ) I think it is amazing for them to do such a courtesy!  

I've only tried yoga once in my life time, it was some kind of sweat box yoga, which I felt like I was dying!  I'm excited to check out yoga in the park!
