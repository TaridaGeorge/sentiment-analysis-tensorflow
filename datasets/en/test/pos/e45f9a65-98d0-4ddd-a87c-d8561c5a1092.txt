Just had some FANTASTIC pizza at Papa Christos. It's PACKED for lunch every day of the week. There's a reason why locals keep coming back. 

My wife and I had pepperoni and the vegie pizza with spinach, feta and mushrooms. 

Excellent! Very fresh ingredients. Hot out of the oven. Served fast.

Met the owner (Horatio). He's very friendly. From Romania. Family owned.
