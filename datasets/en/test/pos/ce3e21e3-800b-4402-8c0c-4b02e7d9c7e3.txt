Sometimes it's difficult to really feel satisfied with a raw vegan diet , but every time I go to Pomegranate's I leave more than satisfied.   The atmosphere is welcoming and delightful, although very busy during the lunch rush. I did have to share a table with a stranger last time I was there but the stranger turned out to be a great lunch companion.  This is a must for anyone who is considering (or already is) a raw and/or vegan diet.  Everything is so yummy you won't know it is good for you!
