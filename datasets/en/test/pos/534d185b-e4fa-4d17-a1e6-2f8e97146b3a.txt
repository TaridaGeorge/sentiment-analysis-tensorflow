I brought my mom to the Phoenician's Spa for her brithday in March and we couldn't have enjoyed it more.  We hung around the pool all afternoon, then enjoyed treatments.  I did the reflexology, which was very relaxing.  My mom enjoyed her massage also.  The entire experience was very nice, but as we didn't ACUTALLY stay there, I have nothing to say about the rooms.  If they were taken care of as well as the grounds, this would be a wonderful hotel to stay.
