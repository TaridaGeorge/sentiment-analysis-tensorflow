I've had Vietnamese at a handful of places in the valley and most places felt a little sketchy, the meat a little rubbery. However, this strip mall place is a step up from the average local Pho joint. The Crazy Noodle and Pho are both winners. The Vietnamese iced coffee is fantastic. Service is always great, prices are very reasonable.
