BOO-MOTHERFUCKIN-YA! Found out about this place and the first thing I thought was, "why have I not been there yet?". Made it over last night and had an awesome time. They've done a really excellent job with the indoor and outdoor spaces, and the restaurant is really well put together. Great concept start to finish. 

The brats were excellent. We had the spicy, the beer, and the duck. All great. But the most impressive thing in my view was the beer selection. Great belgian and german  beers to choose from, and some excellent USofA selections as well. Great beers, great price point. 

DId I mention that they serve a freaking boot of beer too? AWESOME! I will most definitely be coming back here to get loaded on huge Spaten's and great house made brats.
