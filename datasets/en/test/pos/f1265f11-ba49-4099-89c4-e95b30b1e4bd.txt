I have found that when I shop at Whole Foods I shop with a purpose. I am much more careful and far less frivolous about what I buy because of the slightly higher cost. 

I also love the fact that I have never met a rude worker at this store. I feel comfortable asking random or stupid questions and have always gotten a straight answer back. 

Every once in a while they sell this pre-made salmon en croute in the seafood section... I crave this about twice a day!
