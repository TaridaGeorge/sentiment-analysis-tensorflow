Holy smokes!  I ate here tonight and wow.  It has been several years since I have been to TEXAZ and now I wonder why I don't go at least once a year.  My poor heart is working hard tonight.  I had the chicken fried steak and split a shrimp cocktail.  

The shrimp was fresh and huge.  The steak was delicious and I love their mashed potatoes and country gravy.  The portions are gigantic and very affordable.  I will have to visit at least once a year. I think that is all my poor heart and arteries can handle.
