This is the best customer service I have ever had at a dry cleaners. 

I was in a bind, needing my dry cleaning finished the next morning (about 12 hours later). Despite coming in late in the afternoon, the owner understood my particular situation and guaranteed my items would be ready the next morning at 9. Sticking to her word, she had my items ready on time -- they even finished early and called me beforehand! 

On top of this, they did a fantastic job. Highly recommended
