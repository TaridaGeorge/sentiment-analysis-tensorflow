If you are tired of the clean you don't get from your service provider, then let Joe at Service Master hook you up.  He has followed our (Landlords) janitorial service three times to clean our carpets and floors, they stay clean after Joe at Service Master gets them that way. I tried to get my Landlord to get a quote from Joe, but I think he owns a part of their cleaning service so he said no. Don't let your office get dirty, call Joe he will clean your office the way it should be clean!
