This place is rightfully in Paradise Valley. The 125-acre sprawling resort located on Mummy mountain is a little piece of paradise on Earth. Their customer service is stellar and the suites are grander than anything I have experienced before. It is an experience to just hang around the property. Nothing like playing a game of golf, getting a spa treatment in the lap of luxury and eating a light lunch at 'Sprouts'. Since we all know that luxury comes at a price it is advisable to visit this place on a special occasion or get someone to fund your visit. I've been to Camelback Inn on several occasions for business so in a way it is a "free lunch" for me everytime!
