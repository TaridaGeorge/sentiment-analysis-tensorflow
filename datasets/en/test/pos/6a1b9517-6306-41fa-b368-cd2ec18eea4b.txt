I finally lost my Lucky Boy Burger virginity! It reminded me of a small town burger joint. Great burgers and hot dogs. Can't say enough about the fries and onion rings. Wow! Prices are great. Pure freshness. I loved most that the service was excellent. This is definitely one of my fave burger joints. *CHEERS*
