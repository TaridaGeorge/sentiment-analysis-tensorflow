I was doing a lil shopping at Norterra & saw this cute store while I was down the way at Victoria's Secret & Bath & Body Works, I knew I had to take a peek. When I 1st walked in I was a little overwhelmed with all the merchandise. But as I walked around & looked at everything I was able to take it all in & had a lot of fun! I love that everything is color coordinated, every OCD persons dream! I had my hubby with me so I tried not to take too long, but I could seriously spend a couple hours in there. I didn't get much but I know I'll be back frequently. Picked up some cute, black chandelier earrings with a chunky necklace to match. Such great prices too, both items were less than $20. Can't wait to return!
