How I didn't review this as 5 stars the first time around is beyond me. Bad, Bath and Beyond me!

So FIVE stars to Shamrock Foods. Course it doesn't hurt I'm going on an all expense luxury 5 day vacation to Washington DC, with digs at the Ritz Carlton, a gala ball at the Mellon Auditorium, a private dinner at the National American History Museum...the list goes on!

Thank you Shamrock. You rock. You Sham! And you rock!
