We went to Culinary Dropout to celebrate a friend's birthday and had a wonderful time!  We started out with the pretzels with cheese.  Everyone in the group enjoyed them immensely.  Our server was Michael, and he did an excellent job providing our group with recommendations for entrees and drinks.  I ordered the fried chicken which turned out to be fantastic!  Everyone in our group was impressed by the quality and taste of the food.  This place has a cool atmosphere and the professionalism of the staff was impressive.  The manager came over to check on us and thanked us for coming in.  If you are looking for a fun place to feast, I highly recommend checking out the Culinary Dropout!
