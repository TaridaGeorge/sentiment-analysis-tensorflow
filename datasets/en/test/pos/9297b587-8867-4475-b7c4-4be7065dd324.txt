Oh Cartel. I've had quite the love affair with their iced agave latte ever since a friend of mine introduced it to me. It's always been a great place to go and work when you need to get out of the office, I feel like everytime I'm there I see a few people I know. If you haven't tried this place definitely give it a shot. I know I'll miss it.
