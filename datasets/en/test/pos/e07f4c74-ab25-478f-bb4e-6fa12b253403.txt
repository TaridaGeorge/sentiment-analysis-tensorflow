call me old fashioned but no matter how many of my friends have e-readers, i cannot, CANNOT forego a real book. sure, they're bulky and heavy, but if i leave one outside or spill my drink on it, it's not ruined....and i don't have to recharge it. 

i shop this store quite a bit, often buying up to 10 books at a time. there's plenty of selection and new titles come out quickly. there's a starbucks inside of course. the counter assistance has always been friendly.

stay literate my friend.....
