I can't say enough good things about this place! The shoe department is my favorite department followed by tbd. I didn't think I could love a store as much as I loved Marshall Field's in Chicago! In fact I had to have a moment of silence when Marshall Field's closed! However, Nordstrom's is a close second! Also, Fashion Square Mall rocks!
