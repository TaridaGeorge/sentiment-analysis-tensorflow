Loved every minute of my stay here...even though it was 108 degrees (yes, I realize I was in Phoenix in the summer...)

The room was clean, the bed was very comfortable, and there was a cool song mix playing on the radio.  

The pool was fantastic, drinks poolside served quickly and with a smile!  I wish I would have tried the hot tub out, but like I said 108 was a bit too warm to get into hot water....

Can't wait to go back to Phoenix and stay here again!
