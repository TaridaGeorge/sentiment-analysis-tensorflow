I can never get enough farmhouse.. everything is to die for. Their scrambles are amazing, wonderful biscuits and gravy and home fries you'll sell secrets for.. try the papa stack sandwich! Oh la la.. the service is always pleasurable and the atmosphere is nice, clean, tidy AND homey...I would eat here daily if given the chance..
