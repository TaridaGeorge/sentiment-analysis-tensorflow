My first time at The Roosevelt over last week's First Friday shenanigans, and even though it was pretty crowded, I loved it. Friendly folks, great beer, cool vibes, and lots of opportunities to strike up conversations. A patron there even offered me the house pretzel for a few bites (it was excellent). I'd love to go back on a less crowded night to hang out. Cool place.
