We didn't have one dish that wasn't a party for your mouth. We had four sceptics at the table making fun of the portions, but after one taste, it was a free for all of ordering. The flavors and textures were at once delicate and intricate. The only disappointment was that we didn't order a second Soft  Shell Crab Salad. Unforgettable. Don't be afraid to try anything; unused parts of your brain will thank you. I don't think it should be classified as Japanese or a tea house, but if that's why we could still get in, I guess it's good. p.s. drink sizes were generous
