Stopped for lunch on Sunday after a visit to the Apple Store next door. My wife and I opted for the special, mahi-mahi with rice and asparagus. The rice was fluffy ( not sticky) and the fresh asparagus was a delight! Not overdone, but nice, fresh, and loaded with natural sugars and cooked in olive oil! The mahi-mahi was topped with a bruschetta of tomato, olives, seasonings, with a base of olive oil. Deeeeelicious! My wife had the Czech micro brew but I did a diet Coke as I was the driver. Pricing moderate, atmosphere casual and quiet. Service excellent.
