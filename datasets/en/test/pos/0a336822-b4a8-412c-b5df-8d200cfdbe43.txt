Their cheese pizza is so good we order it every Friday night for dinner, and trust me, my husband is some kind of cheese pizza connoisseur.  I think he would live off of it if he could.  Anyway, rain or shine he's calling them to get 2 cheese pizzas every single weekend.  They are cheap (like $6), hot, cheesy, the good kind of melty, salty, heavenly mozzarella deliciousness that comes off in big gooey strings.  The sauce is flavorful and the crust is DELICIOUS.  I am not a huge fan or pizza and I even like their cheese pizza.   Yummy!
