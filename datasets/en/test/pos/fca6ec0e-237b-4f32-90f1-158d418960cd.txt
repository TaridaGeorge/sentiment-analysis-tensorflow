Awesome Mongolian beef and shrimp lo mein!! The shrimp were big and juicy not those little things they give you at other Chinese places. We have dined in a few times and had some other things that were really good as well. Being from NY where the Chinese food is amazing I would have to rate this as one of the best in AZ.
