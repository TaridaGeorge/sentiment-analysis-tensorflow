I had a friend recommend this place and decided to check it out and it was flat out the Best Chili Relleno I've ever tasted!!!  It came with some spanish sauce that I put over my rice and i Loved it!!!  I book marked this place on my GPS and iPhone and I shall return!!!

Also, the service was amazing too.  I tipped 30 percent and I still think it came out to less than 20.00!!!  This dish was huge and I couldn't eat it all.  I wish they had this place in Los Angeles.  I will return for sure on my next business trip to Phoenix!!!
