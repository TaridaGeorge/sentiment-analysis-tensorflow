A group of us came here for my sister's bachelorette party. The prices were great, food was tasty, the service was excellent, and they even treated us to some complimentary desserts! We came here for breakfast the next morning with a smaller group and really enjoyed it as well. 

I would recommend coming to Talking Stick for a small get-together with friends, and coming to Blue Coyote Cafe is a good idea for those not wanting to spend too much money yet still have a tasty meal.
