We were married at this resort in May 2012 and it was amazing. Beautiful resort, great staff, Sally Hilow made everything perfect, she was very helpful!! Our Sunday afternoon wedding had a really fair price. The lunch served by the catering department was amazing (phyllo dough chicken with lemongrass mushroom sauce, and vanilla cake with strawberry cream filling!) The Rainmakers ballroom where we had our wedding was outdated a bit 70's looking with bright orange carpeting but the views were beautiful, and with our decor it helped. The overall resort is updated other than that carpeting and was a perfect wedding spot! They also have awesome pools, and a pool bar and our Memorial Weekend wedding felt like a destination wedding.
