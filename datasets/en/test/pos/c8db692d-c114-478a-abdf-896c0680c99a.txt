I have always wanted to check this place out but the timing never worked out.  I stumbled upon a google coupon deal and  jumped at the chance.  I had brownie ice cream which was good but the peppermint ice cream was bliss.  Yep,  I got  two scoops of this devine peppermint ice cream.   Soooo worth it.
