This place is one of those neighborhood gems.  They've been there forever and the owner (Tri) or his family is most always there.  They are friendly, honest and kind.  They care about doing quality work and gaining repeat business.  Im sure if the reviewer below (Kristin S) had gone back in and asked to speak to the owner about the poor manicure she received, they would have absolutely re-done it and made it right because they care about your business.  Great place, great location.
