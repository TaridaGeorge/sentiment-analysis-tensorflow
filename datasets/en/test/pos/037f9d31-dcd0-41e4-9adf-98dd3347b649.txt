WOW. That is what I have to say about Malee's.  They know what they are doing and they did a great job at it.  We have cooked and eaten lots of Thai food and Malee's is right up there with some of the best.  

From the Curry sauces, to the simplest of spring rolls, it was excellent.  We went on a Thursday and came back for take-out the following night.  Even the take out was AWESOME, they didn't miss a beat and everything was perfect.  

We ordered the following, in order of our favorites:

Burma Gai
Tropical Pineapple
Thai Basil Margarita (tasty)
Drunken Dragon wraps (a little bit salty)
Malee's Roasted Duck
Spicy Cashew Beer (tasted like it was a crocpot meal)

Hope you enjoy it as much as we did.  When we come back to visit Scottsdale, Malee's will be one of the first meals.
