Japanese cuisine is by far one of our absolute favorites and it has been a challenge finding tasty and authentic variations of it in Arizona. We have been disappointed far too many times, so were cautiously optimistic about Shin Bay. It blew our minds! The chef took our likes and dislikes into consideration creating a truly enjoyable experience from start to finish.  Every course was masterfully prepared and presented. The excellent selection of japanese beers, including a japanese pale ale, and delicious chilled sake help to elevate the meal. Our experience was so good we went back the next week to celebrate our anniversary! Yes, it is not cheap, but well worth it. Shin Bay is a gem to be found in the desert. We will for sure be regulars.
