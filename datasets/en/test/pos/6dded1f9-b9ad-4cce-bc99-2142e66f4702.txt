Woof did a great job with my Akita. Her undercoat had been shedding everywhere in the house and leaving a big mess. Anyway, they're located in Sunnyslope on Central Ave, just South of Dunlap (next to Corbin's). Their hours are 8-5 every day except Sunday and Mondays.

It took about 80-90 minutes. I highly recommend Woof!
