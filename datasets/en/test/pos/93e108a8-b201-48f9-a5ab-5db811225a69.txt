The food here is very good. I ordered the monkey cakes and figured there would be bananas and almonds on top of pancakes. To my surprise the bananas and almonds were actually baked into the pancakes. The same for the fruit cakes my husband got. Super cute place and nice atmosphere. However, the service wasn't great, but the food made up for it. The other waiters seemed to be good, but our specific one just kind of sucked.
