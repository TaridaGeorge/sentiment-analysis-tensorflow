If you're willing to try different varieties of burgers, this is the place.  I love their selections of burgers.  I'm a healthy burger eater, so I always order the Lettuce Wrap Your Burger - order any burger without the buns.  Just wrapped in lettuce.  Their fries are delicious and they just keep coming.
They are also getting better in their gluten free menu.  Which is an A+ for us.
