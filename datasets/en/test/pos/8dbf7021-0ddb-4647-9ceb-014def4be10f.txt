Awesome, excellent food. Been twice, great both times.
Happy hour was great the first time. Table service the second time was phenomenal.
I love, love the lobster bisque, truffle Mac and cheese and crab fried rice. I've had appetizer plates both times as entrees...lobster tacos first time- good. Calamari with a spicy ginger type sauce the second time...superbly tasty!
During happy hour, sit at the bar to get the deal on drinks and a few appetizers. The lemon drops are really good. Oh and the birthday dessert selections are to die for. Love the pineapple upside down cake.
