In the new world of gourmet burger places Lobby's was one of the first and they set the bar high. I love a good burger and I was very enthused to see all the positive revues of a burger place so close to where I live. The patties are a little on the small size so for you guys who can eat more I definitely recommend the double cheese burger over the single. Their fries were perfectly cooked not soggy or too crispy, but tender on the inside with a golden crisp on the outside. With fresh crisp veggies that accented the beef perfectly it was everything a good burger should be. I will definitely be coming back to Lobby's.
