I'd never had the pleasure of visiting Aiello's until last night. As a dining destination for New Year's Eve with a very dear friend I hadn't seen for years, it was superb. I agree with all the positive reviews which already reside here. The food (calamari...lobster ravioli...linguini fradiavolo...) was all terrific, and the Cabernet was just right. Kudos to the hostess - we had reservations and were seated immediately. Our waiter was attentive but not intrusive. It was a little noisy in the dining room (NYE, after all), but not obnoxiously so. And Joe? He's a card and a genuinely nice guy.

Two snaps up and I can't wait to go back!
