Genghis Grill is an awesome spot for the authentic Mongolian grill experience. Fresh meats, seafood and vegetables make this new chain far superior to YC's.. The biggest difference is that they suggest to put the sauce on last, which gives the food a far better flavor. 
(it burns off any other way) you would think YC's would have figured that out over the years.
Genghis also features a full bar with include a daily sake bomber special. Definitely worth checking out!
