I live down the street and have been going to Joe's Farm Grill since Its been open.  I have never had an item on the menu that wasn't great.   This place is organized, comfortable and very family friendly, with plenty of outside seating. It can be super busy at times but it always worth the wait.  My favorites are:  Pepperoni Pizza or any of their pizzas, Grilled Cheese, Fried zucchini, sweet potato fries or any of their fries. Breakfast is awesome as well. I always get the Monte Cristo fritters with boysenberry syrup. Its worth a drive out there for those that live far way.
