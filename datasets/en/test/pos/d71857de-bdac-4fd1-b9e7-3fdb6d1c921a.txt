This restaurant is beautiful inside, very interesting decor and nice photos and neat inside bar too. My friends and I had the Happy Hour prices on tacos and on beer but were so sad when it ended at 6 since we had to rush from work. Manager--please extend your great happy hour til 630 or 7pm. We want to come back and enjoy those delicous beers and delicious tacos a bit longer!!! Our waitress Megan was GREAT.
