Huge fan of Jersey Mikes. This location opened a few months ago and is always booming! The bread is fresh, the meat and cheese it cut to order and the vegetables are crisp and perfect. The service has been great every time I've been. I always order my sammy Mike's way: lettuce, tomato, onion, oil, vinegar and seasoning. Just a killer sandwich shop....I'm a believer!
