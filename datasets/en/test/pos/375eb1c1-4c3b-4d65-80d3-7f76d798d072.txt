I adore this tiny, yet charming, family run spot!  It is just a speck on the road and doesn't look like much, but there are treasures to be discovered inside.  You can't go wrong with the beef taco, rice and beans combo plate or try the more traditional tio pancho pork items.  They're always super busy on weekend mornings.  Try their huevos rancheros with green sauce . . . you'll be licking the plate.  I have had pretty much everything on the menu and they haven't disappointed yet.  Oh and they seriously make the best margs in town.  No sweet and sour mix here, just fresh squeezed citrus deliciousness and their sangria is mighty fine too!
