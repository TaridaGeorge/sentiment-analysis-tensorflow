Never wore glasses before in my life until about 3 months ago... Found I couldn't read the fine print on a coupon! So, off to the eye Doc, and then off to get some "readers." Gotta' say, the staff at this joint is overwhelmingly friendly, but not in a cheesy way- Very professional and well put together! Excellent selection of frames to choose from, albeit a little high end. But, that's the way I like it (uh huh uh huh)!
