I finally went to this place after hearing so much about it.  Thanks to all the Yelp reviewers on how to find this place, because it is definitely a "hideaway".  It's very easy to pass up if you don't know it's there (which is right next to Luci's Market).  

The food at Dick's is so deliciously good!  But if definitely has kick, so if you don't like spicy foods, you might want to mention it to them.  The rice and beans alone, which are just sides to the main dish, are incredibly good.  And the enchiladas were perfectly cooked (other than maybe a little heavy handed on the cheese).  I definitely want to go back and try different items on the menu.

The staff is also very welcoming and warm, which is always appreciated.
