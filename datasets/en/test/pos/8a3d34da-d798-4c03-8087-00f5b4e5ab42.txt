to celebrate my gals completion of the 3-day, we headed over to geisha for some happy hour goodness. such a good deal! it was chilly outside and there weren't many patrons, so we siddled up inside. '''

our waitress was friendly and attentive. the happy hour selections are quite extensive and we eventually settled on 2 half price apps, and 2 sushi rolls. only the house maki is on happy hour specials, but there are plenty of options. 

the tuna sliders we had were a meal in itself, so we felt as though we got a good deal. 20 bucks for two. but no drinks...they do run about 4.50 for happy hour. 

very cool decor and karaoke....i hear william hung is coming there in december!
