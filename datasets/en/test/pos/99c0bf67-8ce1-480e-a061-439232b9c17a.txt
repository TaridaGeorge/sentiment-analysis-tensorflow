Why am I trying to hide my love...

I'm at Gallo Blanco Cafe at least three times a week.  Yes, it's totally convenient.  But then again, so is that Rice Stick in a Bowl place around the corner and I'm never there!  

I'm trading in my four stars for five stars.  I never get tired of the food (which is totally delish), the drinks, the jolt in the coffee, the servers...and THE HOTEL!!  

You guys always treat me well, and I can see you treat everyone else like a rock star too.

Thanks for being a great 'light rail convenient' local business!
