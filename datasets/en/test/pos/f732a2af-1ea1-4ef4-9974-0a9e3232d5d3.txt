Great time today with friends for breakfast at the Orange Table.  Omlettes, French Toast, Bacon, Egg Sandwich, Scrambled Eggs, you name it, we liked it all!  We sat out on the patio because we all brought dogs.  They greeted us with dog water bowls and made the dogs feel very welcome on their nice shady patio.  We will definitely be back.
