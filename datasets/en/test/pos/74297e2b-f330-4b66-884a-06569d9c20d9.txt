Came here again yesterday with my family and since my son is sensitive to many things the manager came out and asked us exactly what he was allergic to in order to make something custom just for my son.  He was so accommodating that I just had to write another review on it.  I had to order my usual Talapia and it was fantastic as well.  I also did not know that they ship in new seafood daily and everything here is homemade, which is probably why this place is full of awesomeness!
