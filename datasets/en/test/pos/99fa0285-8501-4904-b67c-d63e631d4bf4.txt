Loved every bit of my Spa Day at Kierland. You get to take advantage of the whole facility, gym and pool (unlike some other fancy shmancy resorts).

The massage by Tera was amazing and I utilized every inch of the spa. Started with a great work out, went for my 2 treatments then on to the sauna, jacuzzi and out by the pool to order lunch. Ahhh! 
Thanks for a great day Agave staff.
