This is a great place to for lunch. Of course since everyone knows this you have to plan accordingly (it can take a while to be seated if you come in the middle of lunch). I usually go early or take a late lunch to avoid the lines. 

Once seated, expect the best. The service is always awesome and the food is spot on. Never over/under cooked or too bland or over seasoned.

It is a great place to go and relax during middle of the work day.
