Noca well deserves their reputation as one of Phoenix's best restaurants. Their menu is constantly evolving with the season, always providing fresh and delicious menu items that are easy to fall in love with. The wine list is well thought out and full of big players and beautiful boutique-y treasures. The room is intimate and clean, be sure to sit at the counter so you can watch the chef's labors!
