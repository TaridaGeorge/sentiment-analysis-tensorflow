I can't say enough positive things about this place. If you live in the EV, and are tired of Chili's, Applebee's, etc, you owe it to yourself to try Pastis. 

Although this is my first review, I use Yelp religiously on my iPhone to find great dining, no matter where I am. Try the Madrid sandwich or one of their stuffed burgers. The crepes will hit your waistline, but are some of the best I've had (I've eaten crepes at probably 10 places in Paris)
