Such great service, atmosphere, and food! I went on a Saturday night. Thank goodness I made a reservation. The place is popular. My date and I ordered the number 42 and 44. Both were soooo yum. Their choice of side salads are great! The food was light and fresh. The cream sauce on my dish would be so good on a pasta lol. The service was great and they seemed to genuinely care about their customers. Can't wait to go back!
