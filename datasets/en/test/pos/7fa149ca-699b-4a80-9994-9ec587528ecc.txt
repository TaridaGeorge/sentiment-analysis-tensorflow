I have the best physical therapist, tech and intern in the world who have been assisting me through a shoulder injury.  Sean, Carlos and Mari (respectively) really help me through every move, make sure I am executing them accurately, and swiftly move me through my sets.  I am really happy with the treatment I receive at this clinic and how well I am improving.  They are also very patient with me as I tend to have to cancel a lot for various reasons.  

The best part of my one and a half session is the massage by Sean or Mari!
