Check this out we had a meal with 7 and lord did we dig the food. Our expectations were maybe the food will be ok we heard it was a byob AND bobby next door said give it a try. We brought 4 bottles of wine and just hade had  a great experience. We had bone marrow, beautiful pork tenderloin, sweetbreads, salad cheese plates and more. Really was surprised the owners are caring and the ecperice was wonderful . I will be back within a month or two and WILL be back
