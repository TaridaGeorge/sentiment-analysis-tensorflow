Ted's is AWESOME.

From the way they cook their dogs to the quality of their ingredients, you cant go wrong eating at Ted's. We always take people from out of town here and they all wish they had a Ted's in their town.

I always get an all beef w/ (my version of) Chicago style fixings. They have celery salt! Just ask!

I love their onion rings. As an onion enthuiest, Im never impressed w/ onion rings that are all batter. Ted's has the perfect amount. My hubby, being an onion hater, always goes for the cheese fries.

How can you NOT love Ted's?!
