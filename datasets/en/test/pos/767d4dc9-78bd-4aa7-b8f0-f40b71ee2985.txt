My husband and I have been going to Cowboy Ciao for years. We moved away from Phoenix nearly 10 years ago, but still go back when we can. The menu and the service is amazing! There are so many unique dishes, I recommend the risotto (the one of the lamb chop is spectacular!) also the mushroom pan fry cannot be missed! Recently we had a wonderful dinner, and when they didn't have the wine we wanted, the manager made a great recommendation and let us try it first to make sure we liked it. I would highly recommend Cowboy Ciao, but make your reservations well in advance! Depending on the time of year, its hard to get in - they are so popular! Also, try Kazimerz around the corner for pre-dinner drinks and fabulous appetizers!
