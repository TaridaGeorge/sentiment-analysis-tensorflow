I love total wine! I could  spend hours in here (and okay maybe I have) They offer an amazing selection and great prices. Good to buy other alcohol too, usually around $4 less a bottle than what you pay at the grocery store.  They also offer wine tasting daily which ends up with me buying more wine than I should. The people who work there seem to love there jobs, and are more than happy to help you find a great bottle.
