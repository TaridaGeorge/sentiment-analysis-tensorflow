We stopped here for dessert this weekend. THE CHOCOLATE CAKE!!! It was unreal, the three people in our party who tried it, all agreed it was the best chocolate cake we've ever had!! Moist, fluffy, not too sweet, perfect amount of chocolate, and the icing was delicious too. And bonus - it comes with a glass of milk. Ambiance was warm and cozy, the owner was friendly and the bartender was very helpful with the menu. We will definitely be back for dinner to try the award-winning meatballs. Can't wait!
