Best Thai place not only in Tempe, but in the Phoenix area.

For an appetizer, I have never encountered Siam Wraps at any other Thai restaurant, but the minced chicken wrapped in lettuce is reason enough to visit. 

For a soup, their Tom Yum is perfect. I'll just leave it at that. 

Their Drunken Noodles and Pad Thai are exactly what they should be with fresh meat and vegetables. I'm not a huge curry fan, so I can't speak to that, but if you love noodle dishes, you're going to the right place.

Their levels of spiciness are fair. If you want spicy food, order it Thai hot. I like food that's considered spicy by the most and it's perfect for me. However, if you want VERY spicy food, have a conversation with your waiter and they'll surely accommodate you.
