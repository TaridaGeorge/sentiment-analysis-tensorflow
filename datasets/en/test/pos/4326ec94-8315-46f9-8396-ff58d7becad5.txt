Great reason to go to Downtown Mesa.  Was there on Saturday and loved the shop.  The designs are interesting and the displays are inspirational.   You are certain to love the shopping experience here.   Don't be intimidated by the LightRail construction that will begin shortly.  Keep supporting the businesses along this stretch.
