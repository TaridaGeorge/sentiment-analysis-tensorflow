This is a nice change from the strip mall chain restaurants of Phoenix and Scottsdale. Postino's attracts a mix of people and races and I find that very refreshing. The food is lovely. The bruschetta is visually appealling and layered with flavor. You can't go wrong with the artichoke dip and hummus. Garlicky...yes! The tuna sandwich was layered with flavors. Oh yeah, I am a fan.
