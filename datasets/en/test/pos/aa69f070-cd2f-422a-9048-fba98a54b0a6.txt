If you frequent Bourbon Steak you will probably see me there at least twice per week. The management and entire staff are so incredibly hospitable. Not only are the drinks PERFECT their food is rather tasty! 
I love the french fries w/dipping sauces, and beef tartare is my favorite anywhere. Lobster grilled cheese & tomato soup- how could you go wrong with that ever?!  Their burgers are killer and Kobe burger is definitely one to try. I suggest sitting in the bar versus the dining room- top notch bar service and attentive bar staff.
