Paprika absolutely rocks. The shawarma is incredible, especially with a bit of shug over it.. and on the hummus. Plenty of food if you order a plate. Order a lafa and you will need to split it. Kosher, so the quality is extremely high. And the pricing is dead on, as well. Just a little bit northwest of the Scottsdale/Shea intersection, you cannot go wrong with Paprika. Haven't tried the ribeye, but it looked fantastic. Israeli salad, eggplant, baba ghanoush are all here. You should be too!
