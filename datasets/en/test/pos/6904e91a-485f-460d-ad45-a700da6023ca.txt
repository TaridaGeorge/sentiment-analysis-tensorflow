I have tried the majority of the Korean restaurants in this area and this one by far is the most authentic and the most pleasant on several levels.

The food is delicious and the serving sizes are decent - not huge, not small, but just right. The decor is very entertaining, with tables literally made from trees. The menu includes food made to order or you can also grill. Either way I love it. The service is good and the people are always pleasant. The two best parts about this place, however, are the fact that they frequently have groupons, and they have a tv in the corner which is always playing Korean tv. 

I would recommend this place to anyone!
