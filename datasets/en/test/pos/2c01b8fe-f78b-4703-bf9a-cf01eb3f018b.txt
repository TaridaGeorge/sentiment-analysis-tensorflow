We love the daily dose! The atmosphere is always casual and welcoming.  We had brunch this morning, and our service from Brenna was wonderful, as always. The service is great, and the food is divine.  I recommend anything off the "Health Nut" menu for breakfast... healthy AND delicious. And, don't forget dinner... Green Chili Chicken Enchiladas -- yum!
