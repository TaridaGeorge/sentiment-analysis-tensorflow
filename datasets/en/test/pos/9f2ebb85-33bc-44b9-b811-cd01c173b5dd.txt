This is a great place to eat! The food here has never disappointed. I had stopped here for lunch a few times, but today I went for breakfast, and I was totally impressed with my food. I had the French Toast- it was great! You can't go wrong with any of the food or coffee here. This place is somewhat like La Grande Orange- but without the huge, swarming crowds.
