so I started cosmetology school and each month we can go to the art museum and get extra hours for school and we now have officially incorporated cibo into our monthly art museum visit for school.  WE LOVE CIBO!!!!!  Everytime we go in everyone is amazing.  This last time in particular was just amazing, we got Matt as our server-he's amazing, he takes such great care of his guests and I was so excited to get to have him again, he's like a celebrity and doesn't eve know it.  Now that the weather is cooling off we sat outside, drank some wine, enjoyed lots of yummy food.  I love the funghi with salami and one of my friends got the calzone... bombdotcom :) of course we got dessert and again mind blowing!  See you all next month for some amazing food, service and atmosphere.  xxoo
