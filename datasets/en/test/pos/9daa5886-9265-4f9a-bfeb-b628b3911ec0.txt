It doesn't get much better than this!  If you've never had Cambodian food, it's similar to Vietnamese cuisine.  The spring rolls are amazingly huge and come stuffed with shrimp and chicken, in addition to all the regular goodies.  The seafood noodle soup was delish!  The broth was rich in flavor and the noodles were perfectly tender.  All at a good price!

The restaurant's decor is very cool!  They tried and succeeded to make it look authentic.  Plus, I think it's so adorable and clever that there are books about Cambodia on each table, just in case you want a quick geography/history lesson while you wait for your food.  

This is one of my new favorite places, so I'll definitely be back!
