I just got back from doing their Lava Challenge and it was amazing! As Scott D said, I read about this in New Times and I wanted to give it a go. Let me tell you that it is hot, but I accomplished it! 

I know that a challenge is a great way to lure new customers, but don't just eat the wings and nothing else because the food here is delish! I got to try some of the fried chicken and the mac and cheese and both were extremely legit! 

I really hope this place gets the business it deserves! The chef and waitress were fantastic and both were very welcoming. I will be back!
