The service, staff, food and drink are fantastic. We rarely make it out of the bar into the dining room since Chase, Susie & Kate take such good care of their customers. If you don't see it on the menu Chef Jeff will do what he can to whip it up for you.  
The Happy Hour rocks and everything else on the menu will blow you away.
