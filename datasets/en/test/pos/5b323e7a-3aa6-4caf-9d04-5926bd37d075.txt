I get nervous for this location every time I'm in there because it's usually very quiet . I don't understand why. This place is AMAZING for lunch. It's kept very clean, the staff is friendly, and the food is DELICIOUS!!!! I would hate to see this location close. So many of my favorite places have closed in this tough economy. If you're looking for a new place to have a delicious sandwich....YOU MUST try Honey Baked Ham Co. Worth it!!!!
