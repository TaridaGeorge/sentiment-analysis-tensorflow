My fiance and I stayed at the Fairmont in Scottsdale to celebrate our engagement, and we had our first meal here. It was great! We had a nice view of the 18th hole (well, it was already dark, but supposedly we were looking out at the 18th hole :)). Our server was really nice, talkative, and informative. We told him we were going to T Cooks for dinner the next night, and he recommended certain dishes and gave us more info about that restaurant/hotel. 

For apps, we ordered the mussels that came with the most amazing garlic bread! I ordered the halibut (super soft) that came with little pieces of pork belly on top of tiny corn pancakes!! How cute is that? The fiance ordered the special of the day, which was some type of pork, that he really enjoyed.

Overall - great experience and would definitely go back!
