Can't go wrong. Great atmosphere, wonderful food and great service. Really fun outdoor area and a large comfortable indoor space. Food is not overly spicy (which unfortunately seems par for most "Cajun" restaurants). 

Very tasty and while not exactly cheap, it's more reasonable than you might expect given the quality and amount of food you get.  Nice bar area too.
