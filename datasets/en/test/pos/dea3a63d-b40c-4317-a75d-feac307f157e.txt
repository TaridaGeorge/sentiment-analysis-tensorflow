Whoa momma! I am deathly afraid of heights so this one gave me a run for my money. The workout itself is FANTASTIC as long as you look at your feet going up and crab walk on some parts going down. Seriously!!!  I had a fantastic time and I know that I will be back again soon, that is as soon as I get over my fear of heights!
