$10 for a mimosa and brunch. Breakfast sandwich: bacon cooked perfectly crispy, the blend of guacamole and applewood smoked bacon is a true pleasure. The perfect breakfast treat!  The steak and eggs was a larger portion than expected and the chimichurri sauce was the perfect accompaniment. I'm surprised it was not more busy! They have a dog friendly back patio. Honestly, how amazing is that? The service was attentive and the options of beers is impressive. You must try as many as you can before you commit to one. 

It's a must try. If I lived in town if be here every Sunday.
