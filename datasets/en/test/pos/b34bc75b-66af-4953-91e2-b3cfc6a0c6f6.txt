If you know good beer you know that it is hard to find in the bud light / tecate mecca of the world. Phoenix is not a hot spot for craft beer. Papago is one of the few places you can go and not find a majority of shwill. I love the selection and it is always changing. The food I will give 3 stars but the beer and what they represent gets 5. I love the feel of this place and if you go solo you are bound to meet someone that if anything can offer a good conversation. Not to mention its nice to support the little guy!
