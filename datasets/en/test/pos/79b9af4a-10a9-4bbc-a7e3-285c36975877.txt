I'm writing an update because I came for Trivia Night last night and had a BLAST!!!!!!!!! Every seat in the house was full, but the service was on spot and the vibe was killer.. 

I also found that that they have quite a few flavored vodkas, including pomegranate, so I was excited to try something new.

Again, the Mac and Cheese was SO good... I had two bowls. That's right, TWO bowls. What a pig. 

I think I will become a Tuesday night regular!
