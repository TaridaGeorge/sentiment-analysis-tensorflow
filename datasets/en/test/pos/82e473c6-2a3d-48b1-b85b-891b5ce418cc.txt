In town to visit some family.  This spot is great!  very small seat area.  The food is amazing.  I had the pork chop, Yum! Kids had the waffles.  Honestly the best things i tasted were the bacon and the pancake.  Staff was very helpful considering my family put them through their paces ( not taking them again - they don't deserve it).
