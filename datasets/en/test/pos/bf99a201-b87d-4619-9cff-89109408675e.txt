So unexpected, so fun, so yummy!

The venue is a huge space.  Retro w/o being trying too hard.  Loved having a DJ spinning motown.  I'm struggling to think of a place in town with drinks as terrific as these.  All are made from scratch as each drink is made.  Fruit cut, oranges squeezed on a per drink basis.  And the sliders are a treat, especially the brisket.  

We were there on a slower night and still had a blast.  I'd love to see what it is like when it is really hopping.  Can't think of a better place to take a big crew.
