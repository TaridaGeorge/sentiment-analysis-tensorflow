There are so many fro-yo places, so you begin to think everything is just the same!
This place is entirely different, becaue the oatmeal cookie yogurt really tastes like oatmeal cookies! The tiramisu, spicy banana mango, and birthday cake are more unique flavors that you don't see all that often. They have a deal going on right now if you check into Facebook and show them, they will give you 20% off your yogurt!
They've won me over all too easily! Go here, you won't regret it!
