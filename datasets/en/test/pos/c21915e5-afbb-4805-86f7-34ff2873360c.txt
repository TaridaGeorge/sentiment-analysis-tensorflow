This is absolutely my favorite sushi restaurant in the Phoenix area!  The food is delicious!  The prices are very reasonable and discounted on weekdays.  They recently expanded the dining room to accommodate a larger crowd.  The servers provide excellent recommendations and they have an unbelievable variety of rolls to choose from!
