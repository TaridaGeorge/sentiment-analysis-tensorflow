Absolutely love this place. I took my boyfriend here last weekend and he already wants to go back again. Delicious Pho and he really likes the noodles with beef. Clean, relaxed atmosphere and the people that work there are very nice. Tip- look online for their menu (the URL begins with "redfork") to see the full menu. The one at the restaurant is abbreviated for whatever reason
