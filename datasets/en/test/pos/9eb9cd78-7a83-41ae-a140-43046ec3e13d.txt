Never a bad experience here.  Everything we've had has been good, including the service.  Good drink selection, tasty salads, flavorful pizza (and I'm usually not a thin-crust fan, coming from Chicago), and friendly service.  It's always seemed busy in there, which I guess is a good thing which shows that others think highly of them as well, but we've never had to wait long to be seated.  We'll be back again soon.
