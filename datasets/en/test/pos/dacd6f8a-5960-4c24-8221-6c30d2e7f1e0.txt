I have vistied this locastion a bit more than the other lately. Good selections of many items. Still sometimes hard to find what you are looking for. 
The produce and meat are very fresh. Parking is still a bit tricky , but what can you do. It is a good place to shop for quick fresh food. Plus, now they have a rewards card. Youget points every time you shop and it adds up to free products. So you cannot bet that!
