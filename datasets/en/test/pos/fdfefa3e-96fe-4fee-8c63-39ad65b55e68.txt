This is the perfect spot to go to with a few friends. Great wine and great food. 

The bruschettas they have are so so good, as well as the sandwiches.

They have a large selection of wine and each glass is only $5.00 each until 5pm -- The staff I have interacted with have all been really nice and helpful.

Some of the people that go there are wannabe foodies and snobs though, use caution. lol
