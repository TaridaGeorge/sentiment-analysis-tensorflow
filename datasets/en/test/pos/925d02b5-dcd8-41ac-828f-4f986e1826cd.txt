I was at the Fujiya Market (which is next door) and saw this place and decided to stop in.
The place smells amazing!
We got the strawberry cake and a flan.
The flan was my absolute favorite. It's not like the traditional mexican flan you are thinking of. They take a smaller version of that and stick it on top of what seems to be a few layers of custard and soft pound cake. They then top it off with fresh strawberries, blueberries and kiwi along with a few dollops of whip cream. It's seriously to die for!!
The staff was nice and helpful too...very patient while we tried to figure out what to get!!
I'll be coming back here for sure!!
