Been coming here for 15 years.

Pro's
- rolls and sweet breads (have to ask) are fantastic 
- meals all good portion size and high quality!
- atmosphere good on bar side (tv's for games)
- atmosphere on other side quiet but very nice
- has a couple large rooms for bigger groups

Con's
- bar side service tends to be slower than expectation; only one server covers that area.


So happy this restaurant remains given the market space for dining is so competitive.
