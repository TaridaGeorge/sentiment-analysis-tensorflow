Just had lunch here and was impressed. Great vegan menu, which is much needed in the Phoenix Area. Service and atmosphere were both nice. I enjoyed the ceasar salad (not the best vegan dressing i've ever had but still good) and a wonderful BLT on foccacia. I've been hoping for a place with a simple good BLT for a long time in this area and they've definately got it. I had a taste of the chips and salsa which was also excellent and comes with a great vegan sour cream
