Postinos is nothing less than F-A-N-T-A-S-T-I-C. I've only been here twice and as a matter of fact, this is as good as it gets!

My first time was a few months back. We ordered a bottle of wine, the bruschetta and some paninis. Everything was great. The service is a little slow but the food/ambience definitely makes up for it. The next time, I took a few friends along for the $20 wine+bruschetta Tuesday and we had a blast. We also noticed that the place is packed on the deal days so get there earlier than 8pm if you don't wanna wait in line.
This place is awesome, can't wait to go back!
