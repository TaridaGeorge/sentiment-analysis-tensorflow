I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE

just try everything, especially the cheese platter and the bruschetta platter. seriously, you will be pleased.

Their champaigne and sparkling wine selection is pretty fine too. This place is SO cute! and SO delicious. The waiter is pretty knowledgeable about all the foods and makes really great recommendations as well!

LOVE LOVE

can't wait to go back!
