We tried 2 of the spring rolls and then each got the Beef Pho- we loved it! From the ambiance, to the crowd, to the friendly owners who frequently (but not obnoxiously) checked in on us throughout the meal- this place was awesome. We are always looking for new, fun independent places to grab a bite, and this is a new favorite of ours. We would take friends from out of town here in a heart beat- which speaks volumes! While their prices weren't cheap, I believe the quality of the food was well worth it. Looking forward to going back!
