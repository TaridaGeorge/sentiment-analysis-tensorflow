Pff, pleasantly surprised!  Went with a group not to especially sample the restaurant or anything - met the owner, met the chef, randomly ordered the polenta with mascarpone and truffled mushrooms as it caught my eye but then thought, hmm, will i really like it?  LOVED IT!!  (finishing the last of it this morning, actually).  Enjoyed my drinks in the relaxed, pleasant atmosphere with fresh air coming in and service always at hand.  Agree with everyone else -  its own parking lot, great service, great menu, great ambience.  Very cool.  Stayed hours later than i planned.  I want to go back and Eat!
