Things I like about the Roosevelt:

- You can park right in front of it, and have rockstar parking!
- They have hard cider. (I'm not too big on beer.)
- Great service
- Clean bathrooms - This is impressive being that it is a bar/tavern. 
- Good place to sit and chat with friends even though its not a "lounge" - We went on a Wednesday night
- Laid back vibe
- Food was actually quite tasty

What is there not to like?
