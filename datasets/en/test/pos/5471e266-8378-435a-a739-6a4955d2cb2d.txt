All the food is AMAZING.  The flatbreads/pizzas, bruschettas and platters are great balance for the wine selection they have.  Sundays and Mondays are prime days to check this place out for conversation and a nice bottle.  I jump in here because the location and finding parking are great.  I really like the antipasta platter and always find it a treat to venture to any of the food selections they have available.  The service and staff are always great and I am a return diner always!
