Breakfast here was so great... I had the jalepeno biscuits with sausage gravy, 2 scrambled eggs, fresh fruit and home fries - soooo good. Add the chipotle hot sauce they bring to the table and it is an absoultely perfect breakfast! We may even go back again before we leave Scottsdale! This is a must for anyone wanting a tasty southwestern breakfast in Scottsdale. Food and service were great - but the creativity and execution of the menu was oustanding.
