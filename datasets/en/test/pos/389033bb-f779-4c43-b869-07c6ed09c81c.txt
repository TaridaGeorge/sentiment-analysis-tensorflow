Love this bar! I used to go here when it was a super-dive a couple of years back. It's amazing what they have done with the place!

Went there on a Saturday night - wasn't too busy but had a good amount of people there. Was very happy to see at least one awesome bar that has reasonably priced cocktails. Definitely going back :)
