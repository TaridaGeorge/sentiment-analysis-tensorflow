I absolutely love this place.  It is the best for brunch in my opinion.  I am always favoring cheese plates, so if you come here, GET IT!  Cheese plate, Bloody Mary or Mimosa and your day is off to a great start.  The sandwiches are very good as well, it is a laid back atmosphere and has a very modern trendy artsy feel to it on the inside.  Quaint and quiet, a Sunday spent here is well worth it.  I would recommend adults only here, as it is more of a hobnobbing or chit chat place, kids may not be able to sit still and may annoy other patrons.
