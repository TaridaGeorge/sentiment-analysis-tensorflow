Go late at night, get Marshall (?...skinny, long dark haired kid) as your server and order a big ass cheeseburger. I don't remember the name of it, as it was on a menu insert and not a regular menu item...a cheeeburger with a fried egg, hashbrowns and cheese sauce on it. My God, one of the best cheeseburgers I've ever had. 

My friend's food was delicious as well, service was attentive and FAST...it was a packed house and everyone was having a blast. 

Having survived many after-club, overflowing and understaffed Denny's during my lifetime this one was a revelation (well, as much of a revelation as a Denny's can be).
