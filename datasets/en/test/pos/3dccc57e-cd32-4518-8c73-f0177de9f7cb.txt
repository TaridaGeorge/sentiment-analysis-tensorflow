First let me say I hate getting pictures taken of me. But I love artistic photography. I was raised in a family that appreciated art and can say Jason's work is awesome. You are not hiring a wedding photographer per se, you are hiring a photo journalist, an artist to document your life. You may start with wedding picture but like us you will want more. I'm still trying to get some of his art shots.
