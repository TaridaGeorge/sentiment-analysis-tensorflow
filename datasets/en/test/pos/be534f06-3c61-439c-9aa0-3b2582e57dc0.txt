Five Guys is doing everything right at its Scottsdale location. I've eaten here three times now, and each time gets better than the last. 

Whether busy or slow, the staff is friendly and helpful. On one visit, they forgot to put on the toppings on my burger, and when I returned to the front desk, they said right away that they'd make another one fresh with the toppings. And they said keep the un-topped burger. So it's was a pretty sweet 2-for-1 deal. 

The whole family loves the burgers and fries. Great eating!
