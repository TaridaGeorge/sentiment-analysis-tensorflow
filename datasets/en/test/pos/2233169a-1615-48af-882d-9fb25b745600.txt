I've driven by this place numerous times and finally decided to stop in and see what the heck was going on in there.  I had heard they had food to go or something like that.  I discovered they had a few tables and I could eat in so I ordered the turkey meatloaf with side of mashed sweet potatoes and a side of garlic kale.  Faithful Companion had a salmon cake with a side of garlic kale and a side of butternut squash chunks.
The food was very fresh and well prepared.  All the veggies were al dente and seasoned just enough.  The two entrees were also very well done and neither left any oily residual on our plates.  And all of that for 12 bucks and change.. Wow.. I'm going back as soon as I get hungry again.. maybe tonight about 3AM!
