With the little amounts of Japanese people in Arizona I am surprised there is a bakery. I am glad there is. I have seen this bakery for year as I frequent the neighboring businesses. On one such occasion I decided to give them a shot and ordered a sandwich and some pastries. 

I have to say, as good as it gets here in Arizona. From what I can tell they are very consistent and the staff have been here for a very long time so you know they know what they are doing. 

A hidden gem in the valley!
