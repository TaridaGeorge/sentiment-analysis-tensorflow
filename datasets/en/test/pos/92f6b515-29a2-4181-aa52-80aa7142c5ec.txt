Campus Flowers loves, loves, loves the chocolate croissants!! Bought 2 while out delivering flowers and had them both eaten in a matter of minutes.... been there once for lunch and had a great sandwich too.  Only drawback is that it gets so busy during lunch that the line is usually to the door (and then they run out of those awesome choc. croissants)!!
