Best dentist, ever.  Maybe it is just because my old dentist in IL used stone tools to clean my teeth, but it is more likely due to the fact that Dr. Tran and all of her staff are super cool, and left me feeling like my teeth might outlast the rest of my body.  She administered shots (because I had to have like a zillion cavities redone) with me barely feeling them.  She took inventory of the condition of my gums, and even took clear pictures of all dental work that needed to be done so she could show me exactly how godawful my teeth look up close.
Super professional, very high-tech, and as pain free as possible.  Plus Bicky rides her bike to work too, how cool is that?
