My boyfriend surprised me with dinner at Café Monarch last night. What a surprise! Chef/Owner Chris takes you on a unique and innovative culinary journey. The atmosphere and world he has created is whimsical and romantic.  Smart concept - prix fixe menu and BYOB. This allows you to enjoy his inventive cuisine and a special bottle of wine in a gorgeous and intimate environment. I highly recommend this restaurant. I eagerly look forward to my next dining experience at Café Monarch.
