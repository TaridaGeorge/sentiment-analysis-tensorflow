This is a favorite destination dining experience. The extensive gardens on the grounds and the pastoral picnic picuresque arboretum are worth the slightly expensive bakery treats and sandwiches.
They have a really delicious sweet potato salad and a good chicken salad sandwich. Pies and cookies are good as well.
It has always been uncrowded when I have come here.
This is a good place for a romantic stroll after a romantic picnic.
