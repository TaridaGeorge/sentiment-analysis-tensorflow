This place rocks, and rolls, and bagels.  The deli sandwiches are huge and fantastic.  Especially the Italian Sub and the triple decker club on an everything bagel.  Sides are pretty good too.  Cucumber salad is a good choice becasue the sandwiches are huge.  This place is a real gem for FH- especially if you don't feel like rolling all the way down to Chompies.
