I had my lashes done by Layla, and it was an overall great experience!  I've seen bad extensions from other places so I was nervous, but she DEFINITELY knows what she's doing.

The application was totally comfortable- Layla came to my house with a comfy service table- I listened to the TV as she painstakingly attached silk lashes to each of my natural ones with a special glue- it took a few hours but was SO worth it.

There is nothing like having fabulous fake lashes on, and extensions basically feel like that, 24/7! The lashes she uses are are super long, dark and semi-permanent- mine lasted for about two months before they naturally fell out (like they would have anyway). You don't need to curl them, you don't need mascara- you just look awesome all the time!
