Time to give this place a nice update.

I was kind of an asshole in my last review. Maybe I was a bit too harsh. The Asian section IS a bit weak, but this store does come through for me in every way.

--The best craft beer selection within a stone's throw of my home.
--Fantastic and fresh produce!
--Delicious soups
--An amazing butcher block
--A lovely supplement selection 

Yes, everything about this place rocks. I am sorry for giving such a weak review last time around. Sunflower, if we were a sandwich and I were the peanut butter....you know your place...the jam.
