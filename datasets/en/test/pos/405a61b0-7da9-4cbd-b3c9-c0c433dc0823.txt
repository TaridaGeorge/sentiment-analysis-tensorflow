I love this place!  I don't live near it, but when I am in the area I have to stop by.  They have a great wine selection, the food is great (Cheese plate!), and the staff is very friendly and is well versed in the wines they carry.  It can get pricey if you start drinking more wine than you ought to be if you are driving, so be wary of that, but they do have a good happy hour price on wines and such.  I highly recommend this place.
