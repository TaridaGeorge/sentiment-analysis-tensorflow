I am overall very impressed with the Cracker Barrel brand, but what makes any one location better than another is the service.  We've never had bad service here, and I've been here more times than my check-ins would indicate.  The breakfast is as good as most higher priced places.  The only set-back is how crowded it gets, but that's just part of going to Cracker Barrel.  Everyone loves it.  Their servers are usually top notch.  I've got nothing bad to say about this location.
