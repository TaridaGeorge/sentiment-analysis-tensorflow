A local favorite.  Baker family owned.  Anything you need to know, they grow.  If you wonder if a plant grows in full sun, that's where they stock.  Amazing selection of plants and trees.  5 star staff.  I have brought in a plant clipping and they will tell you EXACTLY what you have.  6 stars if possible for this place.
