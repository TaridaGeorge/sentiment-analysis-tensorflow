I started going here about a month ago and this has been one of the best workout experiences of my life.  This is as close to one-on-one personal training as you can get.  If you are more advanced, you will be pushed more, and if you are just getting started, it will be scaled to your ability.  I also like how we always stretch as a group and do a good warm up before jumping in to the workout.  Lastly, from the trainers to the other members, everyone is great.  Come join us!
