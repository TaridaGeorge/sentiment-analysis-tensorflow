Chase Field is an excellent ballpark venue and the perfect place to go to escape the summer heat.  The surrounding area is very inviting and all about the dbacks, it makes it very easy to get in the spirit of baseball. 

In my opnion, nearly every seat in the house is a good seat.  You are likely to be cool, have a good view, and be enveloped in the baseball spirit.  

The main concourse has a large variety of food selection, from your typical game day staples to panda express, macayo's mexican kitchen, and cold stone creamery.  The upper concourse also has vareity just not as much.

Overall any experience at Chase Field is likely to be a great one!
