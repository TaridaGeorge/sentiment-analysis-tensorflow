The owners are amazing and if you become a regular they will quickly remember you. They make everything fresh and it is truly evident in the taste. I love their chicken salad, so yummy!

Definitely take the time to try their specials of the day. A lot of my co-workers love them. I tend to stick to the same thing since I'm gluten free and my options are limited.  I would definitely suggest this place for breakfast or lunch. :)
