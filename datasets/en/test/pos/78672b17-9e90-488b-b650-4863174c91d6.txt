Anytime the wife and I crave for a good comforting breakfast, we always end up here.  When we go on the weekends right before noon, the place is usually busy.  With being only a party of two, we normally get seated pretty quickly.  

The staff here are always very friendly and on top of their game.  Never had bad service during the times we've went.  

The food is always good.  The wifes favorite is the roast beef dinner which is a MUST try!!  I like ordering from their breakfast menu.  The country fried steak breakfast is delicious!!
