The view was amazing, the drinks were wicked expensive (albeit tasty), the food was fantastical and the ambiance on the patio was pretty darn romantic. My water glass was very small but was NEVER empty as we seemed to have a team of people tending to our table (party of 7). Also, the cheesecake lollipops at the end of the meal were an added bonus and I'll be making the hour long treck up there again just for those little suckers!! 

Worth the drive, worth the money! Loved it!!!
