Me and my "bestest friend" went in for a cup of coffee, of course a muffin and a chat.  The latte was delicious. The strawberry muffin...YUM! 
I love it that the owner named the place after his mama.   
I'm all about supporting the local businesses. 
We'll be passing on a good word, hope it does well!
