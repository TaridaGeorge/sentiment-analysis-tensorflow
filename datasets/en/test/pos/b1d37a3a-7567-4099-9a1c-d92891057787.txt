If you're looking for a cheap, quick Mexican meal this is the place.  It's a no-frills kind of joint that has tacos that are to die for.  The tortillas are homemade by the little old ladies in the back and they are amazing.  I've never had anything like it.  They are known for their tortillas so you can actually come in and purchase them if you'd like.
