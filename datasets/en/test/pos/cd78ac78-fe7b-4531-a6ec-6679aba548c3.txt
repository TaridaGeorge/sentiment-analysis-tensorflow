Going on Yelp's suggestion, we stopped in on a Friday night to find a pretty hefty wait, but we listened to the mariachi band and sipped on margs while we did. The fanciful furniture, painted in bright colors, makes the joint feel smaller than it already is.  There are only three seats at the bar.  The crowded and busy atmosphere is the restaurant's only ambiance.

But then - the food!  Oysters on the half shell.  HUGE seafood cocktails.  But, my oh my, the Molcajete was phenomenal.  A big, molten concoction of beans and cheese and verde sauce, served in a larger than life molcajete cast iron bowl, with fish, shrimp, steak, and chicken all sticking out of the top and around the sides.

The margaritas were a bit too sweet and light on tequila, but you go to Mariscos Playa Hermosa for the food.
