OMG! This Cajun Kitchen ROCKED! I have spent plenty of time in New Orleans, LA and the thing I miss most is the food!
This Cajun food is simply the best in AZ!
Everything was authentic and oh sooo good!
Not to mention, live music the Saturday night we were there.
The service was top notch! Efficient, laid back, and she never missed a beat! Typical of NOLA service!
The Etouffee & the bread pudding was the best!
You could taste the bourbon sauce in the bread pudding, which melts in your mouth! It did have coconut in it which was a bit different for me.
ALL in ALL I wish this place had a brunch.
I definitely will be back
