There was nothing I didn't like!  I was totally the annoying customer that tried all 50 flavors!!!  I couldn't help myself though - each one was more distinct and unique than the one before.  

I just wish you could get half scoops or something so you could get more flavors in one cone!

Just a tip: they even heated up my boyfriend's cookie so it was warm and the chocolate chips were all melty!
