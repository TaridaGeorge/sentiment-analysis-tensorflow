Joe and William are just awesome.  They've done work on the wheels for my 1965 Cobra and its perfect.  We just took my wife's Mustang in cause it was shaking at 50 mph. Turns out to be a quick balance correction, they also found a nail on the rear tire and repaired it free of charge. 

We will only buy our tires from these guys!
