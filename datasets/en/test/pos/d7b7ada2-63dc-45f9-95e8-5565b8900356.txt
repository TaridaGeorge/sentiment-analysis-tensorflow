I've seen some poor reviews here and I was pretty surprised. I've been here many times and have always had an excellent experience. Whether sitting at a table or at the bar, the service has always been great and the food...forget about it. Topping the charts would be the Stetson Chopped Salad - you honestly can't beat it, my mouth is salivating just thinking about it and the Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry - can I please get this recipe? kthanks.

I will admit that the wait can get lengthy on a busy night but lunch is almost always a breeze and is a perfect location right in the center of Old Town. Oh...and how could I forget the wine list...uhm, yeah - it puts all others to shame. That is all.
