University Of Phoenix Stadium ( Stupid Name ) is as good as it gets !

This stadium is huge and real nice inside.  I was inside for the first time for Wrestlemania back in 2010.  Very impressed !

I still have not caught an Cardinals football game at this stadium yet but I am sure the game experience is awesome !

The exterior of the stadium looks lame and generic but once inside its as good as it gets !
