Joe's was recommended to use by my fathers friend who hadnt been there in 10 years, but still remembered the name and everything about it!  The place was perfect.  Great decor, awesome and friendly staff and amazing BBQ smoked with Pecan wood.  I got the sampler and took half home.  If you like BBQ this is the only place you need to go.
