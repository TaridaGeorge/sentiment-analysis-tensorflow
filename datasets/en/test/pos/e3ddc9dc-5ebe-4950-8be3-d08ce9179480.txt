Anothing five star from me, two in one day is pretty rare, however Total Wine is my home away from home.  Although their prices are the lowest I've seen (eat their dust Bevmo!), I'm still planning for putting up nearly as much in booze as I do in rent due to the fact that I live a block from this place.  

Highlights:

Wine tasting
Near limitless section of tequila (and easily the cheapest)
Staff picks and top rated wines on the left immediately after entering
Helpful staff that won't make you feel like an idiot the first time you buy wine
Tons of micro-brews, even the biggest alky could go weeks without having to pick up the same sixer twice.

I'm fortunate to live under a half mile from this place, because there's nowhere I'd rather spend the last $75 in my checking account.
