Great Service . . waitress was very nice . . the chiefs interacted but the food was terrible.   I sent the spicy tuna role back because it tasted old.   The rest of the food had bad flavor.   They need to get some senior sushi chiefs before you go . . these guys are not good.   I love sushi and I have eaten a lot of it . . all over the .world including Japan .. this place you would be better off going to the grocery store.
