ASU used to be just a shitty school with too many students and lots of partying. Now it's a shitty school with even more students and slightly less partying with delusions of being an Ivy League institution. ASU is alright if you recognize it for what it is: a school for people not able to get in anywhere else or for Arizonans who don't want to leave our beautiful state for their education. If you go expecting anything more than that, you'll be extremely disappointed. It's definitely not worth the price and if I didn't have a merit scholarship, I wouldn't go.
