I gave a company for my colleague and though I already had a lunch. I ordered a "Burger and Chicken patty" listed in the menu at the entrance. The menu listed "Burger and Chicken Patty" and the cook did not understand. As she was not able to understand, I told her that I will get a "Chicken Sandwich". I was surprised what I got for $4.28. Its a bun and chicken patty for $4.28. Its a JOKE. Actually to me the value must be $1. BUT this sandwich doesn't have any sauce, nothing!. VERY DISAPPOINTED. FOR $4.28 just a small bun and a patty ha ha..Check it for yourself.

 The only think I can see valuable its the wheat pizza.
