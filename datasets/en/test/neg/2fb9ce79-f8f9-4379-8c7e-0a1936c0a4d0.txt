The last time we dined at Beckett's was about a month ago, and the last. We have been big fans of the place since it opened, and have been there several times. The food is always good, and we found one server we liked a lot (sorry but her name escapes me) but the last time we were there, our server lied to us to cover up for the huge ego in the kitchen that would not accomodate a special request my husband had for his dessert - which was to add another scoop of ice cream to it. That's it. Game over.
