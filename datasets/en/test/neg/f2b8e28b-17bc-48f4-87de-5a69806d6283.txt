I not a foodie and I don't watch the Food Network. But my job takes me all over the valley so I have to grab lunch on the run whenever I can. I stopped by Taste of Chicago this week and chose the Italian Beef. Never made it to my next appointment. 20 minutes later I ended up in the mens room of a fast food joint a few miles south on Scottsdale Road with an acute case of the runs.

I pride myself on my cast iron stomach and can't remember when I last had a case of the runs. But I shouldn't have been surprised. Environmental Services last inspected Taste of Chicago in August 2012 and found that the temperature in their walk in refrigerator was not cold enough. The inspector made them throw out all their ground beef. Coincidence? I think not.
