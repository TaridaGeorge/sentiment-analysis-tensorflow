This place should be called tragic.  We lasted only one drink before we knew it was time to go and it was only midnight? The music was your run of the mill dance remixes and I was not feeling the crowd. The place misses the mark by a lot and you can feel it immediately. I was thinking about giving it a second chance the following night, but I listened to my intuition and ended up at Charlie's instead.....and I hate to say it, but it wasn't that much better either. Waaah...waaah...waaah.....
