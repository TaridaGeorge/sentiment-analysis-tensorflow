This place is a pit in the sketchy part of town.  The first "suite" we checked into had hair on the bed and all over the bathroom floor.  They moved us into another room that had a filthy toilet.  To fix this, the poor lady at the front desk had to come clean it herself.  Yes...she was the only person working.  The place is outdated, run down, and obviously the maids are not doing their job.  Marriott needs to check in on this place.
