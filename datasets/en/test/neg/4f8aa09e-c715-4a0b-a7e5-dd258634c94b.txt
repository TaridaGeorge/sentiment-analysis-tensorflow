Horrible experience.  Contrary to others' reviews, I was not greeted at all when I walked in.  When I ordered chicken nachos to go, this confused them to no end as if I was the first person to ever to have ordered nachos to go, even calling the manager over.  The manager was impatient, unfriendly and unapologetic when I asked if there was a problem.  I walked out before my order was complete, as I will not reward a business for poor customer service.  There are too many other options.  I hope your experience is better, I won't be back.
