Me and the Mrs were looking for a place to kill some time while waiting to catch a plane home from Az. So we figured we would look on Yelp for a mall to stroll through. We came across the Arizona Center an saw it was near the airport so we figured we would give it a shot. What a let down! This place is far from what I consider a mall or even a strip mall. A few whack ass stores and some meager restaurants. To top it off we had to pay to park there. Lame! Won't be wasting our time here again.
