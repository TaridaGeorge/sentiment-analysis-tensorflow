I was excited to find a sushi place near our home in Glendale, but the excitement faded as soon as I walked in to the place. It has a very cheap feel to it. Fake plants everywhere, bad lighting, you get the point. We sat and ordered a few different rolls...none of which were good. The fish was not very fresh and the presentation was lacking.  If you are really craving sushi and there is nothing else, this will do-but don't get your hopes up!
