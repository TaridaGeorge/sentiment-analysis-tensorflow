I love Brighton Jewelry and this is the worst Brighton store I have  ever been in. They never have the latest styles. The staff are very rude and don't want to assist anyone. I have ordered two different items from them and never received either item nor a call back about the items. I will never step foot in this store again. Looking forward to the new Gilbert- San Tan Brighton store. This one should at Chandler mall should just close their doors and go out of business.
