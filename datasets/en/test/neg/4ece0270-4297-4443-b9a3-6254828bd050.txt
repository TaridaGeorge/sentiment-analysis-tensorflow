I'm not sure how, but after going back, it was even worse.  I should have stuck to my guns and not given them a second chance.  The service was empty and the rolls were just full of rice.  The fish is not fresh- that's kind of important in Sushi.  AVOID THIS PLACE.  I also heard the owner is pumping up some of these good reviews???
NOW IT DOESN'T MATTER- THEY CLOSED
