Not cool... and Jessica is never going back.

So I went home that night and searched for my receipt.  Nope... I remember her asking me if I wanted a receipt and all they do is clutter my already overflowing purse, so I said no... trusting they did my hair right.

I walk in receiptless.

And get rejected because I don't have my receipt.

Nope.

Bye bye now... that wasn't cool... and now neither is my hair because I had to go to Target and buy friggen shears to fix it myself... it was THAT bad.
