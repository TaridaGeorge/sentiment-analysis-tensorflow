The name of this church has changed to City of Grace church. 
I am sorry to have to write this regarding a church but this church is not  a good place to go. They are very closed minded (and have hurt lots of people), and their young adults group is just a dating service! That is all I will share publicly, if you would like to know more of my feelings you can send me an email.
