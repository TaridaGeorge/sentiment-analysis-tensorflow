If you are not past 70, or a yuppy hippy this store is not for you. 

Completely overpriced, most sandals for women were over $100 and looked like something my granny donated to goodwill. They carry all sorts of birkenstockesque kinda shoes.

They boast "comfort" shoes, but who cares where you are walking when your feet look that ugly. I'll sacrifice a bit of comfort for a hot pair of wedges any day.
