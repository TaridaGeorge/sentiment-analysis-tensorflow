The waffles are like sponge and the chicken was over-fried and the service is bad. The owners are very arrogant, unprofessional and rude. Before I patronized the restaurant I heard things that were not good and boy did I experience what I heard and then some. ROSCOE's Chicken and Waffles from California would put them out of business if they don't do it themselves. Enough said!
