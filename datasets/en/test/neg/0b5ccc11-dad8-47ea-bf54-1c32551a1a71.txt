I am so sick after eating here today. The plates and silverware were dirty. I tried to ignore it and just eat the food. The tomatoes were brown. I asked our server if they were meant to be that color and she replied surely yes. It is now 5 hours later and I am puking my meal up and have no appetite.  My boyfriend is just as sick and we will never go back.
