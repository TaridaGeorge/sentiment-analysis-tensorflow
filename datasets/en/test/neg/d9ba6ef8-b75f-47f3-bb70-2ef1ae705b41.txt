My husband and I wanted a simple staycation. There is no poolside service so all drinks must be ordered at the bar. So, with the order of bloody Mary's the bartender reached into olive jar with fingers, wiped hands on jeans, reached into spicy green bean jar with fingers then wiped hands on his jeans again and put these garnishes in our drinks. GROSS!!! So, I drove to Safeway to get our own bloody Mary mix and vodka. However, we had forgotten this disgust as we proceeded to enjoy our time in pool with our drinks. Then, this employee comes by to confiscate our drinks. When I explained why we bought our own drinks ( the disgust) he didn't seem one iota interested. The employees need to take some customer service and hygiene classes.  The Clarendon deserves a grade  D or F dept of health grade.
