I forgot my bike lock and Gold's refused to let me park it in their large, empty lobby (despite the fact I have seen bikes parked there before).  The manager blamed it on GM, and when I asked to speak the GM of course he was "busy."

I know customer service is supposed to be awful at gyms, but Gold's really goes out of their way to be extra unhelpful.

(*kudos to the young kid who they had folding towels that offered to watch my bike unlocked outside - very kind offer, but I didn't want to put a personal burden on him)
