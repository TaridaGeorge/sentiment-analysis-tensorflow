Early Board??

We are huge fans of SW and have flown them for years.  Our holiday flight from Long Island to Phoenix left us less than pleased.  We paid for early boarding. When we printed out our boarding passes, our numbers leaving Islip were in the 50s and our numbers leaving Chicago were in the 40s.

When I called  SW after receiving the high numbers, I was told that EB passengers got their boarding numbers 36 hours prior to departure while everyone else got their numbers 24 hours ahead.

While waiting in line to board, both on Long Island and Chicago, we talked to passengers ahead and behind us and discovered that in both cases those passengers did not buy the EB program. 

So, we paid for Early Board, but obviously did not get Early Boarding.
