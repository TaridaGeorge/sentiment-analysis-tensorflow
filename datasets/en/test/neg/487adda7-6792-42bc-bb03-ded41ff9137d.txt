Terrible service. The clerk was so "I don't want to be here " look. When I asked about a military discount the sales clerk and manager I asked to come over, had a weird attitude. I shop there a lot and was spending over$400. I will now take my business to the stores that offer it. Their are many other that do. I have asked several times and each time get a "I really don't care look" or like these 2 walk away and don't even say thanks for shopping with you. It was like I was bothering them and they were uncomfortable with the inquiry or didn't want to respond why or don't or can't. Considering their prices are considerably higher than similar stores, a little wouldn't hurt. Sports Authority and others are much cheaper on many items. They lost me as a customer.
