Mediocre food and poor service. Went in there today for lunch and the server brought me the wrong drink, and it took him 10 minutes to come back to fix it. He brought me the right order, but nobody offered to refill my drinks or even see how the meal was. Finally, when I asked about dessert, he disappeared for another 10 minutes and told me not to bother because it had freezer burn. I won't be back.
