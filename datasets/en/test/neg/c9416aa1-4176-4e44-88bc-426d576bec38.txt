This place gets 1 star because you can't give 0 stars.

The appearance is nice, at first glance, but it is a hollow vision indeed.  The office staff smiles through their teeth, they like you till it doesn't get them anywhere.  The tenants are going downhill, gangbangers (literally) actually live there.  The police are showing up there with more and more frequency, and the 'hot tub' is little more than a hole in the ground (no actual heat).  The saving grace is that the maintenance staff are actually genuinely nice people.  Avoid, it is going down hill quickly.
