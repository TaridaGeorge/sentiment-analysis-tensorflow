As far as low-cost nail salons go, this place is numero Zero.  I had a very bad experience here a few months ago.  They were very nice, but my nails looked like my dog painted them with her snaggle-toothed under bite.  And it took FOREVER.  Years ago I remember them being very good, specifically someone named Michelle.  But Michelle's long gone and my nailbeds hurt like hell.  I am unsure if I just had an inexperienced nail tech that day but I won't be back to roll the dice on my digits.
