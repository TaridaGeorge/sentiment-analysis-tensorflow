This lunch visit came from a suggestion from my boyfriend who claims the portion sizes are a great deal for the money - which is true. However, the less of this subpar food the better. I had the Hunan Special Chicken and my boyfriend had the General Tso Chicken. I'm more of a fan of white meat than dark meat, and most of the chicken that was visible through the fried fat and skin was dark. 

The staff was friendly enough but the place was dirty (food on the walls) and the parking lot is a joke. If you are in the mood for Chinese food, do yourself a favor and pass up this place.
