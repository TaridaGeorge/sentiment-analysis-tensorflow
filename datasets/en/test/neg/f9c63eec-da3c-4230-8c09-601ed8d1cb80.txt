Very unhappy with this place. We went for dinner on a weeknight. This is why I won't be going back:
--Wings were served in fast food paper baskets. It's a sit-down place with waiter service, so why can't they use real dishes?
--One server spilled ranch on our table and our cell phone. He stood and started until I asked for napkins. He brought some put didn't bother to clean any part of the mess himself.
--We waited so long for a refill at one point that I just got up and went into the server station to get my own.
--What kind of wing place doesn't offer you wet-naps or carrots/celery?! No thanks.
