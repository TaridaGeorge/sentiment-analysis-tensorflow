This location is pretty bad.  Be warned if you go in at an off hour they will just let you stand there and never take your order.  I have been here twice and seen none behind the counter at all.  Not sure where they go. They tend to always put way too many raw onions in the burritos.  If you have to eat here tell them to hold the onions.

Maybe the other locations are better.
