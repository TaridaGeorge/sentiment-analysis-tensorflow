Walked in...was able to order the lunch special...got our miso soup and the bowls the soup were in were completely filthy. Gunk crusted on the outside of both of our bowls. We told the sever and he made excuses. We canceled our order and left. Oh and this place doesn't know what air conditioning is apparently.
