After reading the three positive reviews I decided to give him a call. After taking down my number I did not hear back from him for nearly a week in a half. After sending me pictures of what I was asking he quoted me $80.00hr min 3hrs.  I booked him almost two months before the and checked that off my list of birthday party planning. Three weeks before my two year olds birthday I get an email that he overlooked his schedule and was not avail until next day =( that sucks. Than again. How rude.
