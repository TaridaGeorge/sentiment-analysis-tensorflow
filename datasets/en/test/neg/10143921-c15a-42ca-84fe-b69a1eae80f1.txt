From the outside I thought it was a sit down restaurant, when actually it was a fast food type joint.

I've tried the pulled pork and the chicken sandwhich. Quite subpar: very chewy and not fresh at all. When I recieved my pulled pork sandwhich I noticed that the meat was scooped on the bread, cafeteria style...YUCK.

There are better BBQ places out there.
