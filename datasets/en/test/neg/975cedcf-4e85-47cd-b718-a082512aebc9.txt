Nope. Nope. Nope. Where do I start?
The food tasted AWFUL...I got the chicken parmesan...I don't know whats up with this place and lettuce...but apparently I can't order a simple chicken Parmesan without leaves; gross leaves at that; in every bite!
The place was really crowded and the lady at the register wasn't very friendly.
There was an employee who delivered our meal to us who was really friendly, which stood out to me!
Sorry Wildflower, I won't be repeating this visit. I would not recommend to a friend. :(
