The doctor is very very very old fashioned. 

I had the Mariana put in before I moved to Michigan and loved it! When I was having some issues and cramping (Since it was my first 3 months of the birth control) I decided to visit this doctor to make sure everything was alright. 

Needless to say the Doctor was appalled that I had this form of birth control and did not have a child. 

She was completely against my decision, and made it perfectly clear everything she had to say had a bias.
