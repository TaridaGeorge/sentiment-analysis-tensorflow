I could have baked a frozen pizza better then what I ate today.  The server argued everything that we said, and literally wouldn't let us order thin crust.  Maybe if the server allowed us to order what we like instead of what he "eats every Sunday", it would have been a better experience.  I've definitely experienced better.
