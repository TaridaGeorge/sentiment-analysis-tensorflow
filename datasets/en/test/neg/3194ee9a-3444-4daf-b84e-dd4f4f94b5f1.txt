My brother and I came here on the last day of school before Christmas break, to celebrate our achievements. We were so excited to eat! We were waiting in line and there was a line of people with clipboards just staring at us, hard and smiling. It was as if.....as if they were...ROBOTS! They couldn't take their eyes off us, and just kept smiling. So we left and hadn't been back since.

No but I'm being serious, that really happened.
