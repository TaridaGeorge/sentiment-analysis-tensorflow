My husband and lil son went ther for the first time last week, I usually go on yelp to choose my restaurants due to there reviews.What a disappointment this was. I ordered chile relleno which was in a can not fresh and there was more cheese on the plates we ordered more than anything. We try to go to restaurants at least twice a week and I try writting reviews on each. It seems that a lot of people like this restaurant but if you are a true Mexican I plan to differ.The only thing pleasant was the server. Will Not be going there again
