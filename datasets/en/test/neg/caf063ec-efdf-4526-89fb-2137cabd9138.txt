A local friend recommended us to try this place and said it had good sushi. We'd good sushi there but it wasn't anything you cannot get from Ra Sushi or any other spots in Scottsdale. The price was 2x the other sushi spots. Furthermore the portions were really small too. The decor was nice and trendy but we didn't see any trendy people there on a Saturday night. The only plus was the wine and mixed cocktails.
