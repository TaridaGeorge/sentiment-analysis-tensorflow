It really hurts my heart to give this dog park one star. When the weather is cool I spend a lot of time here. But both of my dogs got bordetella last time I was there. My dogs are my children and anything thy gets them sick deserves one star. It's unfortunate because it's not really the park, it's more the people that go to this park. Time and time again I see puppies way to young to be at a dog park. I have also seen dogs that do not look healthy or properly cared for here. So I'm over it! I will drive a little bit to go to a nicer dog park that has people that take care of their pets.
