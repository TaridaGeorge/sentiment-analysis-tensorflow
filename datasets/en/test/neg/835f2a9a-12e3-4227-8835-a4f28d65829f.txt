My wife and I stopped by for a week day dinner, arrived around 4:30pm and was seated immediately. The waitress was friendly and attentive, the bread basket was the highlight of the day. The wife got a burger with fries, average burger and fries were unimpressive. I ordered the meatloaf, very sad, it was from a can then heated on the grill, mashed potatoes were instant and the gravy was store shelf canned at best. The vegtables were mixed brocholi and carrots, they could not decide to serve them raw or cooked, so they just half cooked them, carrots were very rubbery. Thirty dollars for this dinner was a disgrace, we won't be going back to any Mimi's anytime soon.
