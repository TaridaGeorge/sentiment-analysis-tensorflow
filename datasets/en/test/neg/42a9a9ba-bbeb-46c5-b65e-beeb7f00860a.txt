I feel like I could just copy and paste katie s.'s review to sum up the typical Fashion Square Dillard's experience. 

Understaffed, the staff there doesn't care about service, the ones who will help you are either rude (if you cornered them for service, even to throw money at them) or have that broken soul thousand yard stare. 

Love what they carry for women, their men's section is hit or miss, decent lingerie selection but no... just, no, don't even bother. Even the super depressing Dillard's at Chandler Fashion Whatever is far better, and if it is smaller and not a flagship. Even the clearance centers are better for staff being less soulless. Ugh x2.
