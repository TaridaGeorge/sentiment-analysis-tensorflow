This place is a joke. I have gone to this place 3 times and 2 of the times they were closed even though it was within their "open" hours. Today they supposedly open at 830am according to their hours outside the store. It was 845am so I asked the gas station rep when they will open...her response was "probably around 9". So they just open whenever they want to???? The other time I went there an hour before they close and I guess they decided to close early. Just go to a berto's restaurant and stay away from this joke of a restaurant.
