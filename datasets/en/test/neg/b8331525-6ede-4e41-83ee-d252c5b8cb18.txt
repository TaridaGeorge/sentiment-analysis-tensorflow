I used to make business trips to Kansas City where there was a Culvers next door to the shop I was at. We never once went to Culvers in KC on the advice of locals, but a couple years later this one shows up next to my home office in Phoenix. I tried it. I think I had a butter burger with a salad. It was nasty. The burger was basically a salted version of the junk you scrape off your grill after cooking meat. Also had a shake here once, it was ok.

I guess this will appeal to some though because the burgers do have butter and a uniquely crispy, salty flavor. And who doesn't love frozen custard?
