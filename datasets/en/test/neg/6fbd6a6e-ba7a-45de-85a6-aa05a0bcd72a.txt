Waited for my Genius Bar appointment over 20 minutes after checking in twice, both at the front and at the bar without anyone asking  details  on why I was there.. While I waited, walk ins without appointments were being booked in and told that they were running on time. I finally left  1/2 hour after my  scheduled time and still have not been contacted as to why I left. ( they have a phone number and e mail )
Sadly I was left with the feeling that customer numbers are more important than customer service.
