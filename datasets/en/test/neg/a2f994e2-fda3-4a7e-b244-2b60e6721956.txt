This dump doesn't even deserve half a star.  The food is all microwaved (listen for the frequent 'ding') including steaks. I've gone there twice.  the first visit was below average but showed flashes of promise.   the second visit was a nightmare. the original waiter, one of the flashes was gone, the menu was totally different, the food sucked, but the real low-light was watching the owner / chef berate a couple who had complained about something.   he actually called them stupid.   I really wish I'd recorded it for you-tube.  lousy food, horrible location, stupid owner.   Three strikes and you're out.
