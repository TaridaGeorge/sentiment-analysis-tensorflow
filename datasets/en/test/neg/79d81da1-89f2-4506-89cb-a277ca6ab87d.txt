Took our Accord here to get tinted.  While the tint color was as expected, we had some bubbles.  They did tell us to go back in 2 weeks if the bubbles didn't go away.  However, the tiny bubbles were not the biggest issue, the worst part of the tint is the back window - now we're seeing double out of the back window.  Not sure what happened, but I am sure that I don't want them to touch my windows anymore.
