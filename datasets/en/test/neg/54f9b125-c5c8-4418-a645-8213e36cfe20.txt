Immediately on arrival, we're informed it's a wait.  Kinda concerned that there are 8 empty tables on the patio, and 4 inside the restaurant that we can see, but clearly it's not a demand problem, it's likely a server shortage.   

I order the veggie pizza; hubby orders chicken saltimboca.  

Almost an hour later,hubby gets his food.  That's when the server tells me about the Great Eggplant Shortage of 2011 and that my food wasn't available.  Not when I ordered the pizza, because that would make sense.  

Holy hell.  This place is awful.  From trying to make reservations (they had none available)  to finally getting out of there,this experience was a freaking ordeal.  

And why hadn't I heard about the Great Eggplant Shortage?  Seems like it would have been bigger news.  

Buca di Beppo must translate to "Don't Eat Here" in italian.
