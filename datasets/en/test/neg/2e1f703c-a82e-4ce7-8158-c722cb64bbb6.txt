I agree with everything that Max A. said about this place.  

I went in here not too long ago as some friends really wanted to go for last call.  If you are turned on by watching some pale anorexic looking girl wearing a gas mask dance on a bar, then this place is for you.  If you like bad hair, white belts and crappy tattoos, this is also right up your alley.  I wanted to grab some of the girls in here and just give them sandwiches and some sunshine and tell them that their Daddy did love them.  

I won't be going back here, its just depressing.
