I was hoping this restaurant would be better. The biggest problem with this restaurant was the service.  We ordered three dishes and a soup as an appetizer. I had eaten there once before and wanted to give the restaurant one more try before I gave an opinion. The soups tended to be somewhat bland. Also, we ordered the sizzling rice soup. We had to serve the soup ourselves after a bowl was placed on the table. The rice was anything but sizzling. We also had a problem with one dish being VERY SALTY.  We complained to our waiter and she removed the dish as requested. Unfortunately, we were still charged for this dish and no accommodations were made to correct our complaints. The atmosphere is fun and hip, but the service will make me not go back to this restaurant. I hope they higher more professional accommodating servers.
