As mentioned in another post, this drive-thru is mind bogglingly slow.  There are times when there are two vehicles in front of me and I've waited more than 20 minutes for my soda. Then, after waiting all time, when I pull up to the window they take my money, close the window and walk deeper into the kitchen area.  I want to get out of my car and announced that the drinks are right next to the window!!

They drive me crazy.
