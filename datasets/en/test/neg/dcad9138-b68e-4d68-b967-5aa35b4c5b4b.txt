this vet is terrible! my dog was clearly sick, the vet was extremely rude, was not forthcoming with information and was extremely rude when i asked questions. my dog is a family member,  when asking questions trying to understand what was going on for treatment and prognosis, she very sarcastically said "well i have been a vet for over a week now" and was extremely unhelpful. clearly, she works with animals because she has NO PEOPLE SKILLS! I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS VET! AVOID THIS VET AT ALL COSTS! if i could have given 0 stars, i would have.
