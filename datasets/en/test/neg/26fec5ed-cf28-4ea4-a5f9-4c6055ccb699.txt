What a disappointment! Here are my Cons for last evening's dinner: 

-Over cooked Egg rolls 
-Server could barely speak English 
-Will not let you get half-and-half anything. I wanted half Almond Chicken, half Sweet and Sour Chicken, wouldn't allow so I chose Sweet and Sour- this was 2 out of 5 stars. 
-Entrees only came with white rice, we had to order a plate of Pork Fried Rice for $4.95 extra, which was greasy and not too tasty 
-Kung Pao Chicken had maybe 3 peanuts on the whole plate 

Sadly, I would rather go to PF Changs next time. Our $80 (we ordered a bottle of yucky Chardonnay) would be better spent somewhere that at least attempts to accommodate our requests.
