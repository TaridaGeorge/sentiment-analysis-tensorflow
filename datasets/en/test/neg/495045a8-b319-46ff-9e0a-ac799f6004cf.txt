ok after my last bad review, I thought I'd give them another chance.  Ordered a steak dinner -- probably the worst steak I have ever had -- was like eating shoe leather -- way over cooked and filled with grizzle.  Waiter never asked if we wanted a 2nd drink -- which we didn't anyways and never filled our water glasses the entire time we were there.  Entire meal for 2 -- one appetizer, 2 meals, 2 alcoholic  drink and nothing else -- $135.  Way over prices for the low quality food and poor service.  This time I will NOT be going back.
