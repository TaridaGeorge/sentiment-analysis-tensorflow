Took the kids school shopping the other day. Store was cluttered with stuff and not stroller friendly. Waited in the checkout line almost 25 minutes.  Cashiers were allowing people to cut in line . People at registers and on the floor are very unfriendly.  School close shopping in August was worse than shopping at Christmas time.
Many customers were complaining store needs to come to some resolution high-volume shopping days or will end up losing customers.
