I will never set my pretty little feet in this store again. Too bad for them because the spouse and I are serious runners in need of new Asics every 4-6 months.

We've been three times, always on a Saturday. Every time, they only have 2 folks working. On a Saturday! That's just crappy management. Typically, one of the employees is analyzing a customer's stride on the treadmill. And the other one is running shoe boxes from the back. The last time, we stood at the register to pay for our purchases for nearly 20 minutes before someone finally got to us.

Order from the catalog. Avoid the store like the plague.
