The people there are great.  The cheesesteak is pretty good and Rita is the best sandwich maker.  Her girls are very hard workers and very friendly,, always greet you with a smile and hello.  I go there often and have cashed in on many free cheesesteaks(punchcard).  Only twice have I had minor complaints.  Last time her husband charged me for extra cheese for some reason and all I did was read what was on the cheesesteak from the menu.  It says "interlaced with lots of melted white American cheese" and he charged me extra.  Keep him at home.  Forget the fries too,, I hate getting the end of the bag.
