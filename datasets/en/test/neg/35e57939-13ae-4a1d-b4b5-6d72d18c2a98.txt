The counter staff is great at up selling, but will never tell you what your final cost will be or the additional charges to expect when you return the car. I've rented from Budget 3 times in the past month and have been charged an additional $100+ in hidden fees each time. Return your car less than an hour late, expect a $50 late fee, they don't care if you were caught in unexpected traffic. Make sure the price they tell you your rental costs matches what you sign for, made that mistake because the counter agent was talking to me and I ended up paying more than double what I was originally quoted. Will never rent from Budget again after more than $400 in unexpected charges & recommend not using them or be ready to pay additional fees.
