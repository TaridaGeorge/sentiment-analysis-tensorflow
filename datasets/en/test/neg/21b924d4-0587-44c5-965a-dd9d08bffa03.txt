Horrible!  I echo what others have said.  I also purchased a deal through Living Social and I have tried calling several times and leaving a message.  No return call.  I also have not received my pedicure and the deal expired!  In my opinion, that is like stealing my money.  It isn't like I didn't try to set up an appointment.  And I understand if she is overbooked but honor the people who purchased the deal and maybe extend the expiration deal.  Or at least return your calls!  Unfortunately, I think this backfired and I will never go to her, whether or not she is good and will tell everyone I know not to try her.  Customer service goes a long way, people.
