Not at all impressed! The place is a maze - a condensed outdoor mall with lots of cheap stores.  The best stores are Target and Kohls which says a lot.  Desert Ridge seems to be for teenagers or young moms.

Difficult to find your way around the narrow streets - no large directional signage with store names. Instead you must drive round  and round to try to spot a store.  Drivers don't pay attention to Stop signs painted on the crosswalks - I almost got hit twice.

Even the walkways in the mall were tight and congested.  I think Arrowhead Mall does it right!
  
I was truly glad to drive out of the mall back to open space.  And, unlike Arnold, I will not be back.
