Today I really had to question the priority of customer service at Z Gallerie at Kierland Commons.  I wanted to purchase something, but they only had one and it was in the window.  The gentleman who is the manager refused to sell it to me and offered two extremely inconvenient solutions - (1) order one, wait a week and return to the store to pick it up OR (2) drive an hour out of my way to purchase at another store.  As a customer it was extremely frustrating to want to pay for a product that is right in front of me, but the manager won't allow me to buy.  I think this was a last straw.  I will no longer shop at Z Gallerie.  There are plenty of options out there when it comes to shopping.
