FATTY, "ANTIBIOTIC-PUMPED-TO-KEEP-ME-ALIVE, STOOD-IN-MY-OWN-POOP-'TILL-THEY-SLAUGHTERED-ME" _FEED LOT_ "MEAT". WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THIS COUNTRY'S MEAT???!!!

-- sure, on Wing Tuesdays they may be only $0.45 each, but the gristle, fat and squish they call "chicken" is barely swallowable.
-- "Beef" ribs are little more than fat on a bone, slathered with sweet sauce. ICK. SEND IT BACK!!
-- kitchen never on time. When your server stops by to say your food is on its way, that means at least 10 more minutes.
-- limited beer selection
-- bag salad mix sprinkled with bag shredded cheese and bag croutons. ugh.

sure they sell their 12 sauces in take-home bottles, but if they're cutting corners so heavily on the meat, just imagine what choices they're making in the sauces. BLECH!

Corporate quality gone amok.
