I have been here on multiple occasions and each time the customer service leaves a lot to be desired. Their selection in 38s-40s seems pretty limited. 

I've been twice now when I was looking for a particular color / style. When asked if I needed any assistance, the answer to "yes, I'm looking for x type of jacket in x color" should not be to say, "hold on a few minutes while I" do something and then to leave your customer waiting 10+ min for an answer.

Save yourself the hassle and go check out, pretty much anywhere else. I hear they sell jackets and suits at the thrift stores. At least there I'm expecting to be ignored and have to fend for myself when trying to find something.
