appalling food, unfit for human consumption 
food here while cheap, is utterly disgusting, while I am used to spicy food and love mexican food, and dislike the food provided by certain chains, the food here was the worst I have ever come across, the flavors were uniquely revolting, and the food so hot no one in my family was able to really taste the food. While we ordered different items, I do not at all in my right mind recommend the burrito bombero, or in that case anything on the menu.
- and the other listing which says los taquitos Mexican grill, is the same place as this one, do not know why it is listed twice
