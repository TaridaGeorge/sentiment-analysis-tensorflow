The food here was gross. Our waitress was clueless. I don't think they actually cook anything here. They must just have a micro to nuke whatever frozen stuff they buy. Will never come back here. Came here with my boyfriend, his sister and her 2 kids and no one had a meal they liked. Not even the chicken tenders or hamburgers. Stay away!
