After visiting this hip little place, I ran away. The sashimi was great but the slices were so big you literally had to cut them down to bit size pieces. The rolls didn't even stay together & they were golf ball size in diameter. To add insult, I didn't even get everything I ordered. I will never go back and I have no clue why everyone is giving them such high reviews.
