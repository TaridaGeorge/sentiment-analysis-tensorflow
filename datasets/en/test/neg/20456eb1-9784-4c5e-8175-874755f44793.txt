Why is it so difficult to find an egg and cheese sandwich on a hard roll in Tempe/Phoenix? Esp one that is good and under $5. Skip this one. You'd be better off going to McDonalds. 

Order: Bacon, egg and cheese w/ lettuce, tomato, mayo on a poppy seed bagel.

Pros: Name.
Cons: Microwaved eggs, microwaved bacon. They either microwaved the lettuce too, or by putting it between the cheese and the bacon, it got cooked. Yuck - hot lettuce! No mayo in the kitchen. Only packets on the counter. Oh, and the bagels.... well if you lived anywhere near NYC, these aren't good bagels.
