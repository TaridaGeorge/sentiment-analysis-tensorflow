So over priced!!! Check the cost of the Vans OTW collection. They double the msrp on them. OTW's cost no more then $85 at other stores. Great business practice. I even email these clowns six months ago about this issue. They claimed it was an uploading issues with the price point. Really, takes over six months to fix it? SQUIDS!
