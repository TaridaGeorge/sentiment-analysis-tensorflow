***Help Requested***

Does anyone happen to know the new contact info  for Amber Dennison and Jodi Mickelson?   They closed shop but did not return many pieces of our consignment jewelry.  Any help is greatly appreciated!

*****VENDOR BEWARE!******

Thinking of becoming a vendor for Amber Dennison and Jodi, former owners of now defunct Spoken Boutique, Phoenix, AZ? 

DON'T DO IT! 

After months of no replies to our voice messages and emails, they closed shop, without returning our consigment jewelry(and/or cash from sold product).  And according to this site's blog, both moved out of state. 

After repeated attempts and a number of voice mails to Jodi, No payment, No returned inventory,  No voice mails, no emails...no scruples.  Nice!

Who will be next?
