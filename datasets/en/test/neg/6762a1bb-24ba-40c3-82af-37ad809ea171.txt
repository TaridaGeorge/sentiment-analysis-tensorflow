I was so excited to see them open at 10240 N 90th St, Scottsdale, AZ 85258... they had good coffee; friendly service and my favorite maple bars.

that must have just been the opening team... now the grumpy service; no maple bars (the maple donuts have frosting that never sets; what a mess); the only thing that remains is coffee; but, I say that is not enough.

Silly of me to rate them because I'm not going back!!
