If you stay here, be warned!  I just checked my AMEX statement and noticed that this placed charged me TWICE!  I purchased my stay through Travelocity (as I often do for my travels) and the front desk clerk even acknowledged that, but STILL... double the charge!  This has never happened to me with Travelocity so I can only believe the mistake was on the hotel end.  I called several times to try and resolve this with Susan in billing but she was not very responsive.  It was after several attempts and contacting the general manager Patty that I got a "promise that a credit will be issued."  I keep calling AMEX to check and still NOTHING....... I stayed in March and it is June now... WTF?!  *****************DO NOT USE THIS PLACE**************** SHADY TO THE MAX!
