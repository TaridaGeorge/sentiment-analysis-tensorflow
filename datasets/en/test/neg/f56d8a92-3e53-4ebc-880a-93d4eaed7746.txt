After a terrible visit to the Elephant Bar in Emeryville, CA, I decided to give it the college try and visit again in Chandler, AZ. 

I should've followed my first thought and went somewhere else. While I will say that I love their happy hour drink specials, the food leaves much to be desired. I ordered the salmon rolls, which was disappointing. The roll was 92 percent rice, 5 percent veggie and 3 percent salmon. 

The only upside was the waiter at the bar provided good service. I will never return again. The Elephant Bar is a waste of money and space.
