I've been here many times...Mother's Day with family, dim sum with book club, etc. But I will not go back again.  I stopped in to ask the owner about a donation or reduced price for a class of under-privileged kids that I volunteer with.  His reaction was to scoff and shoo me out the door while handing me his card and saying I could email him.  He turned his back and headed off to the messy newspaper-strewn table he haunts between guests arrivals.  Maybe he's a community-minded business owner, but then again, maybe he's not.  I'll be dining elsewhere.
