Dear Denny's @ Scottsdale & Shea, 

I am very regretful to reform you that your restaurant is repulsive. Your hours, although appealing to the party animal which escapes from me from 11 PM - 4 AM, is not enough to make me return here again. Your food is, quite frankly, disgusting. I'm not sure where throughout the years the "Slam" in the supposedly infamous GrandSlam has gone, but I experienced a grand piece of crap on a plate.

P.S. - please hire prettier / friendlier / more enthusiastic waitresses. 

Love, Wesley.
