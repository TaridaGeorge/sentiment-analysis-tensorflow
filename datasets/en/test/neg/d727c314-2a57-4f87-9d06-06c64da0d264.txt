WORST SUSHI I'VE EVER HAD!

Yellowtail Sashimi was served like Nigiri without the rice- pieces of fish waaaayyy too thick-
Wasabi was dry and flavorless- completely NOT fresh-
Dragon Roll was nothing more than crab mix w/ Unagi and avocado on top- LAME!- and overpriced

Lost our name on the seating list and was sooooo not worth the wait-
When complained to the manager he made it seem like our fault that the sushi was so terrible!  I thought the customer was always right...

The only thing this place has going for it is location and stupid local Scottsdale yuppies that can't tell the different between fresh, quality fish and garbage!!!!!

EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING
