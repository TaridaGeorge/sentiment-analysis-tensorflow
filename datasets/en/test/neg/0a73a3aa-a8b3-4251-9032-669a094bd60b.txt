Don't believe the hype.  I'm convinced the only reason this place gets good reviews is that people are too embarrassed to give it an honest review after they just waited 3 hrs for a crappy pizza.  Coming from New York and Connecticut where the best pizza spots are (Patsy's in NY, Pepi's in CT) I'm here to tell you that this place is not worth trying no matter what people try to tell you or what you read.  The pizza's are tiny 'gourmet' pizzas and the toppings literally fell off my slice as I tried to eat it.  

Save yourself the time and get a much better pizza, go to Grimaldi's in either old town, DC ranch or I think Chandler too.  This place is actually related to Patsy's in NY and serves a MUCH better, traditional pizza that you don't have to wait so long for.
