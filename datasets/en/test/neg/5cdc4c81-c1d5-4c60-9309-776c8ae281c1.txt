very unprofessional outfit, we set up an appointment four days in advance.  Then they did not show up for the appointment, I had to call and leave a message.  Then I received a call back from Claudia Rosa saying she can not make it because she had to have some medical tests done for an upcoming doctors appointment.  She wanted to reschedule for another 6 days later!
I ended up calling another company, Colors on Parade, and they came out within 30 MINUTES and did the job the same day!
