Overrated.  I was shocked to see this place is highly rated on Yelp, I almost always agree with Yelp reviews... NOT THIS TIME. Went here highly recommended by someone, left highly disappointed.

Here's the story, me and five friends go for lunch to get sandwiches, for the five of us lunch was $75.00. us dollars.  Now I really don't mind paying for food... but at $75 for sandwiches, they had better be amazing, they were not.  No one was impressed with their meal, it was just ok.... really expensive ok. 

I got a pastrami sandwich that had very little pastrami and a load of "Russian" sauce (which tasted like a bottle of craft thousand island to me) not a good sandwich.

Everyone in my party had similar feelings about their lunch... my wallet still cringes every time I drive by there.
