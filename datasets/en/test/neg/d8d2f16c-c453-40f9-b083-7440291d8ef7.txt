I went to this location because of a Groupon offer.  It's just a little strip-mall joint with zero atmosphere, but I planned to take the pizza to-go anyway.  I ordered a thin-crust pizza and after waiting 25 minutes, I was told that they had burned it and they had to start over.  Reluctantly, my family and I waited for another pizza.  This time it took 30 minutes and although I had specifically ordered the pizza cut into slices, they cut it into squares.  So yes, a whole hour to wait for a pizza.

After all that, the pizza wasn't even very good (the sauce has no zing - tastes just like tomato sauce). Bottom line is that I would never go back to this place again.
