I just had the ice cream. That was when I didn't know where to go for ice cream. It tasted artificial, much like how everything else looked. There was also a weird feeling about the place - too self-consciously "cute"  suspension of reality - almost as if a crime was imminent like a bad TV show. Looking at the rest of the food was almost disturbing - like school cafeteria food, only worse. Oh well, it discouraged me from eating anything the whole rest of the day.
