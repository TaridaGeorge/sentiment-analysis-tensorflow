Stopped for breakfast and was greeted with loud acid rock music which is not conducive to dining and not appropriate for families with kids. I spoke to the waiter and the manager about the loud music and they basically could care less about customer feedback. In addition, since there are no acoustics in the restaurant, the music just grinds on your nerves. It was difficult to hear my partner speak and also difficult to enjoy the food. We will not be returning to BLD. Service was slow considering there were not many customers there and food was mediocre. Word to management is to listen to your customers. Don't just blow them off.
