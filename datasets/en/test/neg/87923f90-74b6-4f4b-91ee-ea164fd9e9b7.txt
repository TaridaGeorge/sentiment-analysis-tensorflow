A bunch of crooks!  We remodeled our bathroom with these guys and it was a NIGHTMARE!  They made a ton of errors and then charged us for them.  Their tile guy disappeared 1/2 through the project and it took over a month to get someone new in.  A 3-4 week remodel took over 3 months!
To make matters worse, when we called in an outside provider to fix one of their mistakes (on OUR DIME), they had the audacity to call the vendor and bitch him out for not running the work through them so they could mark it up!!!!! Unbelievable.  
I now have a very expensive bathroom that I hate because they never corrected all their mistakes and it impacted the entire layout and design of the room.
I know of several other people who have had similar experiences.
STAY AWAY!
