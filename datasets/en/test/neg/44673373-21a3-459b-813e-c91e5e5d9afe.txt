Went to babytime this morning. What a joke. We are used to Burton Bar and that is always great. It started at the front desk where the rep said: Is there any? It repeats every week. Duh.  
It started 5 minutes late and she ran through the program within 17 minutes. 6 songs, 2 books, bubbles....great pace for crawlers. Oh, and she didn't really sing. Everything was on cd. The remote was her friend. It was chaos and only 6 kids were present. Then she dumped toys on the floor and left the room. She didn't put any effort in creating a group event. All parents chatted during the program, it eas a mess. I wondered if we were done or not.....so I left. I'll drive to central library anytim. What a joke.
