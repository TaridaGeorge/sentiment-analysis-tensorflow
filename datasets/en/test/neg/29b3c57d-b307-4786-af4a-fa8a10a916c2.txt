I have once, in 6 years, received good service here. Usually it's adequate to poor. The last time I complained to the manager on duty about the 'terrible' service, she brushed me off & handed me a coupon that another customer had just redeemed. I noticed later that it expired the very next day. The apathy evident in the employees can't be their fault... they're only copying their manager.

The food is the standard IHOP fare, pancakes, french toast, eggs, etc... nothing to write home about. I'd happily never grace their premises with my presence again, except my son loves the chocolate funny face pancakes.

Grit your teeth as you pass through the door, and be prepared to wait. Hopefully they'll get your order correct the first time, and your drinks won't sit empty for 15 minutes or more.
