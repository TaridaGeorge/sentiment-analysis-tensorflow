If there was some type of cosmic explosion in outer space, and everything in the universe was suddenly sucked into this gigantic black hole, I seriously doubt the vacuum pressure created by such an event could rival the suck this AJ's produces.

This place sucks so badly, I won't even ride my bike near it for fear I'll get swooshed up inside like I'm in one of those drive-thru bank tubes or something.

All this leads me to believe that the 'cool' people always hanging in front of the store must have the same suck polarity as AJ's, otherwise they'd have been swept away by now.

Food poisoning twice. Once from the salad bar, another from a turkey wrap deli feature. 
If there's a God of suck, this is his Heavenly domain.
