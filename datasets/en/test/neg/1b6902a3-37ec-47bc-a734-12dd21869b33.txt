It had been over a year since I last visited this restaurant. I should have waited even longer. The place was empty which should have been an indication of how the food has changed - not for the better. 2 of us ordered the Gyros salad. How hard can that be to make? Gyro meat, lettuce, onions, 1 tomato slice and sauce. Unfortunately for us, apparently it was hard to do.  Because they seem to do little business, the lettuce was turning brown on some pieces. And the gyros meat had been on the spit a little too long. Pieces of it were crisp and hard to chew.  The meat really had no taste to it either. I won't be back. And from the looks of it, neither will many others.
