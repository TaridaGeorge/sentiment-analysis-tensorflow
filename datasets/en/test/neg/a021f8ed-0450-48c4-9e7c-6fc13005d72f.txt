I have seen the trucks around town and decided to call Cloud 9 to check out my irrigation system. I called early Saturday morning and spoke to a man. He asked if I would be around that day. I had errands and other things to do, but I said yes and provided directions to the house and my phone number. Staying home all day and delaying those other activities proved to be a waste of time as he never showed or called.
