Management of this club is elementary at best and Ashely is the rudest person I have ever had to deal with. Cancelled my membership and kept getting charged for months and all they do is repeat the same thing to you over and over again, they can't actually do anything and don't care either. Terrible customer service. Call headquarters directly if you want anything done and done right.
