I've been to Uni multiple times for a manicure due to its close proximity to ASU's campus. However, I always leave thinking I would rather have done my nails myself for free. Also, the technicians rush me upon my arrival which gives me anxiety about choosing a color which I feel I should do at my leisure given its a spa-like environment. The worst part of my experience at Uni is that I leave with messy looking nails, an empty wallet (a $20 mani?) and feeling of being unpolished (pun intended).
