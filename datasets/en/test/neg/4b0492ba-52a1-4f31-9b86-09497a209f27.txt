Food was just okay, and service was slow.

We waited for an hour, even though we could see at least three open tables the whole time we waited from the bar.

Duck-fat fries were bland.  Complimentary bread was cold and hard, but the accompanying kalamata olive aioli was great.

Prime rib was okay, but again not great.  The accompanying potatoes au-gratin were bland bland bland and gritty.

Fried chicken was also rather bland, and the accompanying mac-n-cheese was dry.

The highlight was 1/2 ounce of complimentary kalamata olive aioli with the cold bread before the meal.  Everything else was mediocre.

Bland.
