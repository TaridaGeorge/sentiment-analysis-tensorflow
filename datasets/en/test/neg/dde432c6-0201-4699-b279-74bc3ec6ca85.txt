Everytime I go into this store, there is only one cashier working but yet several employees meandering around?  Today was the same!!  But the worst was the POOR customer service I received.  I used to love this store as they do have a large variety of kids toys etc. After my freadful experience today, I wil never walk through those doors again.  Waiting over 20 mins in check out line is not acceptable.
