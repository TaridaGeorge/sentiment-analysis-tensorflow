OK I gave this place the benefit of the doubt by visiting a second time but when we visited for lunch they still continue to have major issues with the place. Our food order was once again messed up as it was the previous time we visited. The server also knew little to nothing about the beers they had on tap.  I think it is bizarre that when four people order food at the same time that the kitchen cannot expedite everything so that everyone gets served at the same time.
