Walked into the store today motivated to walk out with an elliptical. Only one other individual was in the store testing out some of the machines, so I was very surprised when I walked in & we didn't even receive a greeting or a quick, "I will be with you in a sec" (it REALLY ISN'T a "superstore"). I walked around checking out the equipment giving the store employee enough time to redeem himself from the poor customer service, until I realized that he wasn't too motivated in making a sale & walked out. If you're going to be employed in customer service be courteous to your customers if you want to make a sale-- you don't need a business degree to know that....
