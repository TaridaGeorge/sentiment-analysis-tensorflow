Ordered the Carnitas burrito, as well as the steak burrito. I also ordrered the cheese quesadillas with chicken.
The pork was WAY TOO SALTY!  I couldn't finish it without drinking a ton.
Figured that it was a fluke from a heavy-handed cook with that one particular burrito, so dug into the steak, and found it to be just as as salty. What a disappointment.
The quesadillas were not bad.
However, with how salty the two  burritos were, I can not recommend Desert Springs.
