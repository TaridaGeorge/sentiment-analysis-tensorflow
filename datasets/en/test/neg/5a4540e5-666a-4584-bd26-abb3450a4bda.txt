Their pharmacy is both accusatory and ignorant.  They question you about your purchases to the point that they might as well just come out and ask you if you are a drug user.  I understand that there are rules to follow, but it can be done professionally and employed through common customer service skills.  Simple questions like "oh, your a diabetic, what kind of insulin do you use" or "so, can you tell me a little about why you need the longer needles" rather than literally arguing with us for several minutes about the purchase of insulin supplies and accusing their customer of being a heroin junkie. 

Professionalism fail.  Knowledge of medicine fail.  Customer service fail. 

If there were an option for no stars at all I would have taken it.

I will never go back to another Walmart again after the way we were treated here.
