SORRY SORRY SORRY I went for the All U Can Eat Fried Cod today (Friday) at 5:30pm. At 5:55pm I requested two more pieces of fish. The waitress said they were out. Say what? This is FRIDAY All U Can Eat Fish day? She said but we're out of fish. Then why did you charge me $10.99 twice for two people that DID NOT have ALL the fish U can eat? Damn America! Wake up and quit treating people like their return business doesn't matter.
