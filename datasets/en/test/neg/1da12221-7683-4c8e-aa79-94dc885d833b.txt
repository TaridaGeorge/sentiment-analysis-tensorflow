Waited for a table for 1 hour and 40 mins but did not get any because we were a
Party a two . Atleast 6 parties of 4 got tables before us .. They were rude to us and had the audacity to tell us that their management does not allow them to give us a table for 4 even if we keep standing the whole day. 
While standing we had 2 carafes of sake . It was ok. Worth 8 bucks because we went   On a Sunday Which happens to be a happy hour all day . I was charged 65 bucks on my Amex . Weird ... 
If my review can stop even  a few people from going to these snobs I will be very happy ..
