Food was a C- at best!  Server never told us we would be paying $8 a bottle for water.  No wonder the busboy kept filing up the glasses.  Cesaer salad had no taste, the fried chicken was dry and the macaroni and cheese was more like a soup.   Oh by the way--the menu says whole chicken but you only get one drumstick and breast!
Overpriced wine list .  Not a good experience.  Finally, the seats were uncomfortable.
