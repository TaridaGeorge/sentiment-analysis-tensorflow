It is closed. It was a nice, clean daycare and our kids were very happy there, but it closed abruptly. Two days' worth of warning to the parents and that was it. They say our kids can go to the other location but I have heard bad things about it and it is not nearly as convenient. We're still in shock.. We can't understand why it closed so suddenly.
