Went Christmas week and it certainly had enough business to shuffle our unreserved party of 4 to the bar.  Nothing wrong with that, as I love hanging with the bartenders and chatting.  Unfortunately, there was a slight stench of rotten bar towels somewhere in the vicinity that was unappealing.  The food was delivered quickly and everything was just ok.  Nothing to write home about.  then we thought the dessert would be awesome.  Well, the nuts on the side were stale!!!!  The ice cream was crystallized and the blue cheese cheesecake was eh.
