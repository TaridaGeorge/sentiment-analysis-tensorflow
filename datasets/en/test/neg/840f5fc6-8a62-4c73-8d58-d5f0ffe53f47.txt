I had to endured  this modestly priced buffet during a moving party and found it seriously lacking in customer service and fresh food .
upon arriving to the buffet we were promptly greeted and seated so far so good unfortunately we must have arrived during a famine or maybe the recession caused it but the buffet was near barren and what items they did have appeared to have been prepared in an early decade, which judging from the counters is also when they last cleaned. the most upsetting thing about this experience was when the employees began emptying the buffet well before (an hour and a half) the advertised closing time. All told I will not becoming back here as a customer and i urge you to also avoid this sub par buffet .
