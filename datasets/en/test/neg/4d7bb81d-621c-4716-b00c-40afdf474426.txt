Okay so I don't want to bring my 6 year old into a sushi restaurant. Its Saturday and I call for take out, thinking we've done Ra and Sushi 101 so lets try Bombers. We brought home sashimi, tataki and sushi. Its priced between Ra and Sushi 101 but both my husband and I thought it was meh at best, blech at worst. Maybe its a better experience if you're there and drinking, but we were not impressed. Its not impeccable fish, its just okay.
