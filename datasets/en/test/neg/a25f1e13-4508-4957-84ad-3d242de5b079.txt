Was a decent alternative in the area for lounges. Poor customer service! Bartenders poor attitudes! Doormen are horrible and misinformed that the place is a Vegas type of place! $1000 for bottle/table service at an empty lounge is ridiculous. Wondering, 4 guys different ethnic backgrounds but ladies in our group too... Seeing older reviews, it sounds like they haven't changed and I wouldn't be sad or surprised if this place was closed soon!
