The two times I visited here after shopping at Kohls, I left very dissapointed. Firstly, the place was very dirty, thats one of the first things I look at.  Both inside the dining room, and where they prepare the food.  You guys need to steam clean that carpet, if that is what you decided on to floor the place, honestly, carpet is the worst choice when it comes to restaurants.  

Secondly, 

The food tasted old, like they pre-cooked it hours ago, huge turn off for me.

The place is run by a bunch of teenagers that dont care or know what they are doing, and they could care less about what the customer thinks.  

I will be passing this one up next time around.
