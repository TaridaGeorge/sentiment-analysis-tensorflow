Shocked with the customer service. I'm in from out of town and my friends took me to this place. They told the employee working that they had screwed up their order twice before (forgot an order of cheese). The employee said she would comp an order of cheese ( we ordered with our fries), then we get to the car and realize she left the cheese out! We go back and she says she was sorry but couldn't comp us the cheese... Why didn't she tell us this BEFORE we left??? How deceitful! We asked for the manager who huddled in the background during all this. He finally came up and said he would take care of it. Hope the owners of this place hire new people with customer service skills - my friends are looking to find some other location to give their business to.
