C and R used to provide good service but I can't say that anymore. They messed up on changing my bettery, never tightened the bolts and I almost stalled in traffic. I finally did stall and they told me something else was wrong with the car, til it was towed to the shop and they realized it was their mistake. Also, our rear window was broken and they checked the fuses and charged me $100 to rip apart our back door. Onlt to tell me that the mechanism is broken and it'll be $850 to replace.....oddly enough my husband fiddled with the wires and its as good as new.
Do NOT give them your business....horrible in everyway.
