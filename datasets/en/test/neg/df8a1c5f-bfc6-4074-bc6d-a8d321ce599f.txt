I wanted to try a different place than my usual and was sorely disappointed.  I was not acknowledged while walking in and even after standing for several minutes I had to ask for help.  I say never judge a book by its cover because you never know who your customers are.  Overall, I found that they were rude and had poor customer service.  They lost my business solely on that front.
