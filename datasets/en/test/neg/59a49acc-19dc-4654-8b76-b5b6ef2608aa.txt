Tried to go. Showed up at 1pm. The store is suppose to be open at 10am. There was a sign on the door saying they would be opening late that day...What does late mean?  Tried to call but their phone system was full.  Went to Fantastic Sams down the street instead.  Saved 6 dollars and they did great.  
All I can say is I tried.
