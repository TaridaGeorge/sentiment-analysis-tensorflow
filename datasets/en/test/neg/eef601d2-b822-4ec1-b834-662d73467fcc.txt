To be fair, we didn't eat there. We went in and the place reeked of that orange spray. We still tried to man through it and preceded through the cracked walls, dirty floor, and blinding flourescent lights. When we got up to the counter, the worker said, "Everything is to go." it was 30 minutes til close. More concerning... the counter smelled like sewage. so we turned around and got out of there.
