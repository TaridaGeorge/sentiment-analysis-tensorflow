The coffee was good.
I had the two egg breakfast and asked for toast instead of bacon.
I got bacon (and no toast) and reminded the server I asked for toast instead. I was almost done by the time I got my toast.
The portions were small. Really small. The plates are smaller than average. (I am not one for huge portions, but c'mon, I have seen child's portions bigger than this!) The hashbrowns were unremarkable. The bacon had a smokey flavor that tasted like your clothes smell after being around a campfire. The eggs were ok. The meal barely filled me up.
Maybe I got the wrong thing. Or maybe I am crazy to expect an $8 breakfast to be spectacular (or filling). When it is almost $40 for breakfast for three people it better be damn good. And this wasn't.
