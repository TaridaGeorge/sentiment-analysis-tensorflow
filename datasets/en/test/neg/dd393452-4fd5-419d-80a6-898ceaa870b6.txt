it's wendy's gross!!!

haha the place looks great after the update. Layout is terrible actually doesn't really work efficiently when ordering and getting food when its crowded. Just backs up all awkwardly..


the food is the same so guess what...i won't be back...

only yelping this because its a check in and i hate seeing things i need to review when i sign on.
