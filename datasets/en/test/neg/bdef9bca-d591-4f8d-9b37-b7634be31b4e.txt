Worst Applebee's every. Took 10 min for someone to get my water. Placed my order and when they brought my oriental chicken salad the chicken was hard and dried out, a drizzle of dressing. My soup bowl was completely cracked, so then I couldn't eat anymore, lost my appetite. Guy asked me once how I was doing, and didn't even give me a chance to talk. Never again!!!!
