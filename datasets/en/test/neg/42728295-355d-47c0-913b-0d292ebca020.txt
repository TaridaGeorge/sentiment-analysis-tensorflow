I'll keep this short and sweet.

Fries that are overly starchy and soggy. Burgers that taste like a Jack in the Box Ultimate Cheeseburger.

There's a Jack in the Box across the street. Save your money and go there. It tastes the same, but they've got better fries and you'll pay half as much.

Or just do what any sane person with functioning tastebuds would do... go to In N Out.
