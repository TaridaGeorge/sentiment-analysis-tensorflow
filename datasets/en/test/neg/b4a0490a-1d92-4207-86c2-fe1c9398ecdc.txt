Just sit right back and you'll read a tale, a tale of a crappy bar;
Good for me, it's pretty close, I didn't walk too far;
The food is poor, and the service is not very good, (it's bad!);
We went to eat at happy hour, instead the hour was sad.

My mate is a pretty special girl, she said "let's try this out";
5 people were inside the joint, 
For Giligin's Happy Hour...
For Giligin's Happy Hour...

The music blared throughout the joint, so loud that it caused pain;
On grimy tables, floors and chairs, 
We tried to chat in vain...
We tried to chat in vain...

This place is not my favorite bar;
I wouldn't hang out there;

With Giligin;
The waitresses;
The "thousandairres", and their friends;
The "You Tube Stars";
and the rest...they all can have my share:)
