Am I the only one who was totally disappointed with this place? I am a HUGE frozen yogurt fan. I've been driving out to Yogurtland in Scottsdale for my fro yo, but was excited about the new place (Zen Zen) opening up down the street. Tried it out tonight. All I can say is YUCK. I guess I was spoiled with my Yogurtland. Zen Zen was clean, yes. But, the selection was nothing like what was advertised on the website. When I finally did decide on just plain chocolate and vanilla, I was even more disappointed to find the frozen yogurt runny; not a consistency I'm used. It was way overpriced, too. I usually pack my cup at Yogurtland and rarely break $5. I spent $6 tonight on just over half of a bowl. Needless to say, I'll be making the drive out to Yogurtland in the future. :(
