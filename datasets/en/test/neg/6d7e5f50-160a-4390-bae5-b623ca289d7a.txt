The 3 teenagers behind the counter were bitter & not very helpful. I asked to try one sample & they acted like I'm wasting their time.  I only came here b/c I didn't want to drive to tempe for fro-yo.  I should of made the drive.  I'm not a big Pinkberry fan, and preferred the non-tart flavors.  I had their cappuccino flavor (which was so-so) & had the 3 item toppings which mostly fell out of the cup when the employee carelessly scooped onto the yogurt.  I hope someone will open up one of those self service ones where you pay by the ounce in the East side.
