Excited to try Brix and had a Groupon to do so. Several friends and I called at 12:30 because the Groupon said we needed a reservation. They assured no reservation was necessary for 6:30 pm. Got there early. They closed and they closed early. Sign on the door says they close at 7. I call shenanigans. Boo to Brix
