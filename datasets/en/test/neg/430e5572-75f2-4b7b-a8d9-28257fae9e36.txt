I was really looking forward to eating here. I went online and salivated over the menu. I got there and this is what I ordered.

Spicy Tuna-Super fishy and the rice was oily. The sea weed was tough too

Beef Skewers- It was very Tender but not very good flavor. Certainly not worth the price

Rangoon- This was actually really good but the sauce was terrible and Im sure from a frozen package. I would bet money they dont make the sauces or the rangoon in store. 

Save your money, this place is the worst sushi I think Ive ever eaten. The tuna was so fishy it actually scared me.
