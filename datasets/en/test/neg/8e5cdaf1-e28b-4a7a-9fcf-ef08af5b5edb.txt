I canceled my membership here because I felt uncomfortable every single time I came. Who puts the ellipticals and treadmills in front of a bank of mirrors? A pervy male, that's who.

Then, OF COURSE, he didn't mention anything about a 30 day notice and they charged me for the next month anyway. When I called, he got really defensive and told me that it was on the paper I signed, and told me that I needed to start reading things that I signed. I told him that all he needed to do was TELL me about the policy, and he hung up on me.
