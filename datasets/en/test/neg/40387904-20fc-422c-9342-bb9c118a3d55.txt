I was very excited to try this place out so we went there for a special treat for my son's birthday. 

The food (burgers)  was gross! Very gross. VERY gross! 
The server ignored my son (didn't even ask his drink order)  and couldn't have cared less that it was his birthday! 
The staff looked a little tired and very bored. 
We didn't wait around to try and get ice cream. We weren't feeling good after lunch! 
The place is cute with all the pink but it could use a good deep cleaning. I love Family Circus cartoons. 

I was very disappointed.
