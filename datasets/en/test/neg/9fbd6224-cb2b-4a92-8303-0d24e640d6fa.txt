A connection airport for our flight from SFO to EWR. Probably the worst airport I've ever experienced. The gates are scheduled way far from each other. My poor mother with her sore/sprained legs had to dragged her luggage down a 2 mile stretch of airport just so that we could make our connecting flight. Then it turns out that they changed the gate, so we had to go all the way back. Apparently a couple of people on our flight did the same thing. Never again.
