This place makes me realise that there is tremendous business potential for another Indian grocery store in the Chandler area. The owners hit the jackpot with the location and that is why they take every liberty to dole out substandard groceries. 

The expiry date is never mentioned on the packaging and if it is, it is usually wrong. The other day we bought some chapatis (Indian bread) with 22nd June '09 expiry clearly marked on it. When we opened the packet for dinner we found nothing but green fungus. On another occasion we bought some solidified pickle. There have been innumerable disappointments but we kept going back because there was no other option nearby. 

The first lesson that we learn in a Marketing class is that 'the customer always wins' and for now I have decided to shift my purchases to another store in Tempe.
