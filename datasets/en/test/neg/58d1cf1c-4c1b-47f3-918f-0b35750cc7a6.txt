The previous reviewer has it right! It seemed the mean grumpy lady behind the counter decided she didn't want my business when I walked in. No hello, no smile, no "can I help you."

Me: do you alter leather?
Her: What do you have?
Me: I want to alter the arms eye.
Her: That's going to be expensive...
Me: What is expensive?
Her: $90
Me: (thinking how does she stay in business?) I know someone who will do it for $40, you were just closer to where I live. (I walked out)

Not a friendly place at all. Very disappointed since I have so many things that need alteration, but I am sure yelp will point me to a good place!
