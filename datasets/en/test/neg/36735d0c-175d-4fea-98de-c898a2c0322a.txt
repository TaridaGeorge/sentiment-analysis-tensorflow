Had a very  bad experience here.

First off, many of the photos posted on Yelp don't actually exist on the menu. They are from some catering company which you will not be able to order from.

We ended up getting a wrap, Thai ribs and  a chicken salad.

The food was all tasteless and bland. I wanted to ask for my money back and walk out. However the group that I was with felt very awkward doing that but they agreed. 

I will never be back to this place. Very disappointed in this place because I wanted to try for such a long time.
