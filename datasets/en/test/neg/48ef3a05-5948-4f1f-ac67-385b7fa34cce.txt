Crap customer service! After spending $1200 on a built in oven, get it home and install it only to find it not working...but wait, I have a 12 month warranty, so no worries, right? WRONG! 
First, it's more than a week before they can get a repairman out. Ok, fine.
Day of the appointment comes and the repairman is a no show- mind you it's a 4 hour window I sat around waiting for him. 
Now, I'm supposed to reschedule and wait around for another 4 hour window! 
And still, I have no working oven.
Do yourself a favor and avoid Sears outlet like the PLAGUE! They sell shoddy appliances and have even shoddier customer service.
