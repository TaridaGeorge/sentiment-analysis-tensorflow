Bleh.  How do I describe - it's like a cheap museum with the gift shop at the end that you have to go through to get out.  The eggs were greasy.  The sausage was greasy.  The toast was not toasted completely.  The service is right out of the TV show Alice - "kiss my grits, mel'.  Don't expect great service or even digestible food.  Pass on this one.  Not worth the time it takes to park and get through the gift shop.
