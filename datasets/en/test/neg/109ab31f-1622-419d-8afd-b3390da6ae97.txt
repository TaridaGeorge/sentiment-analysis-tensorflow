I don't know why I keep coming back to this place. Ok I know the fries are ridonculous but I've had better service at a funeral home. I seriously had to wait to place my order at the drive thru while the cashier talked to her friend. Diggity dumb. I guess if the only ppl you can find to work there are meth heads then it's expected but seriously worst service ever.
