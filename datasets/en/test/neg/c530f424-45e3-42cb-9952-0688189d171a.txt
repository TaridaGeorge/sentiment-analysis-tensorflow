Horrifying!

I tried Chopstick express because they deliver to my apartment. I was going between it and another place--what a mistake.

I ordered Sweet and Sour chicken and moo shu veggies. Everything smelled great when I got it but I was keenly dissapointed just by opening up the boxes.

My moo shu pancakes? Tortillas. I'm not kidding, actual tortillas. Not rice paper, or won ton wrappers. Tortillas. And as I opened up the box with the actual veggies in it, it compleatly broke and smashed all over my carpet.

Moving on. The quality of the chicken was the worst. My first bite was filled with fat and the veggies wern't even cooked. (Huge pieces of raw pepper and onion). 

Absolutly horrible, I will never, ever order from here again. It was a waste of 23 bucks!
