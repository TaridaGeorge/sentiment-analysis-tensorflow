My grandma loved me.

This grandma only offered me . . . . margarine?  

Really?  In today's day and age and grandma has no butter?  Its not just about science here, its about taste.  Unfortunately grandma didn't have that either.

The hash-browns were flavorless.  The ham was only cooked on one side.  The french toast had a form of cinnamon in it but it still lacked in flavor, explain to me how that is possible?  I'm still perplexed.  The maple syrup was a far, distant step cousin to anything maple.  The coffee, a measure in any restaurant, was miserably lacking.

We went to Grandma's Kitchen based on the two reviews here on Yelp and I was sadly, sadly misled.  :(
