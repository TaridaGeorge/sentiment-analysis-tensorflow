Bamboo club is way overpriced and definitely not Asian. The food is rather on the bland side for being Asian food and just not served correctly. I once had to argue with a waiter that instead of mahi mahi I was eating the second dish I ordered--Mabu Tofu! Don't care for this place at all, I have yet to find my enjoyable chinese food place for dinner I guess that will just have to wait.
