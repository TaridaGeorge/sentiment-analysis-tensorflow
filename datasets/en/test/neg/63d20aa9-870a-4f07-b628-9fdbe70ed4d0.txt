We were very excited when they started to renovate this bar. Sadly it was all for nothing. This place has horrifc food. I tried to speak to a "manager" but all feel on deaf ears. The service was poor and the food, well, it shouldn't be called food. I tried to follow up on their Facebook page only to find my post deleted instead of addressed. I would advise staying clear of this place. :(
