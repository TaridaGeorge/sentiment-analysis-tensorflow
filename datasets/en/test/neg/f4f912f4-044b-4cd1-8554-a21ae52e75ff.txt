Today all I wanted was one of your delicious shrimp burritos, only to be crushed when I was forced to hang up the phone after an employee (a repeat offender when it comes to phone orders) kept me on hold for a solid 10 minutes without even checking in with me. How can you do this to me? Don't you know how much I love your salsa bar and tender rice? The worst part is that it happens all the time; the phone either doesn't get answered and just rings, and rings, or I am put on hold and ultimately forgotten about after a few minutes. This happens so often that the second I hear them say "Can you hold?", I know that I wont be getting food. Great place when you want to eat inside - but I'd skip on the take out.
