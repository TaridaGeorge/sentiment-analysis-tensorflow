I've been a long time fan of Mac Grill- but within the past year I've eaten there three times and service has been awful. Actually worse than awful. Bordering on rude. You wait to get a table- 3 people walk by- can nobody say, "we'll be right with you?" Takes forever to place your order, then longer to get your food- even though with the open kitchen atmosphere you see your food sitting there getting cold. Last time I tried take-out. No better. Took me 15 minutes to get somebody to ring me out. And again, there's my food sitting there. Getting cold. I won't be back.
