The food was fresh and hot, but the place was a MESS! I went today (Tuesday) at 1:30. It was not busy at all and 2 employees were taking a break. The tables were dirty, the floor was a mess, the drink area smelled funny, and the salsa bar needed cleaning up/refreshed.  What was worse was that two employees went to get drinks, but did not bother seeing straw wrappers and peppers on the floor by the drinks and salsa bar. It is sad when I have to go to a place to wipe my own table down.
