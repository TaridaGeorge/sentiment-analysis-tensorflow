This restaurant came highly rated on Yelp so we figured that we would give it a try.  What a terrible experience!  It took more than 45 minutes for an order of four rolls: a rainbow roll, california roll, and two spicy tuna rolls.  To make matters worse, people who came in more than half an hour after us got their food and were done before we even got our rolls!  

The rolls, once they did finally arrive, were less than one-inch in diameter (i.e., less than half the size of rolls at most similar restaurants) and consisted mostly of rice and vegetables.  The only thing we did enjoy was the shrimp ordered from the "japanese tapas" menu, which tasted outstanding.  

However we will never go back here, based on the horrible service and indifferent attitude of the staff.
