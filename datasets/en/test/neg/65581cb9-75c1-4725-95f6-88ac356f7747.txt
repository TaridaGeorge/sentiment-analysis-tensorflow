yogis is to sushi/japanese as panda express is to chinese.

i have been in here twice. the first time the service was alright, and the food was lackluster. the rolls were small and looked nothing like the ones plastered all over the wall. they were served in a styrofoam box. the second time i went in the food was even worse. the girls in the back were chatting while i waited up front for about 2 minutes to order. she was extremely unpleasant. it took them about 5 minutes to make my simple teryaki bowl which was filled with little, thin, fatty strips of dark meat and topped with [yuck] green onions. the sauce was alright. not even siracha could help this bowl.

disgusting.
