This was really really bad, from the amount of food left behind on the plates of other guests I should've known.
I'm leaving here and I'm still hungry, probably have to grab a burger somewhere.

Im very picky, ill admit that, my wife is not, she'll eat anything, and this was the first time I've seen her leave so much food on the plate.
