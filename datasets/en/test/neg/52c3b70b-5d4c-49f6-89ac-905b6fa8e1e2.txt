Ann Taylor Loft is one of my favorite stores, but NOT this one.

The Greeter pretended to not see me when I walked in--I saw her and know she saw me. Not friendly here, maybe it's that stuck-up Scottsdale attitude I guess. Not one single person said anything to me, it's not like I was dressed like a Hobo. 

Excuse me for not dressing in my Stepford-wife attire before I went shopping today.
