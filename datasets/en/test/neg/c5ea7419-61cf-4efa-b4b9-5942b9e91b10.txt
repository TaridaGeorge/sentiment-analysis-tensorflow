Went in to look at some lenses, and see what they had, price wise.  One salesman (British accent) was helping a customer and doing a good job.  I asked about a lens behind the glass and another salesman rudely snapped about how its just there for show, and its a terrible lens and would never be used on a camera.  His tone was pretty condescending and nasty and I felt out of place.  I'm no camera expert, but I'm not a novice, I didn't appreciate the way he acted, and turned around and left.  Shame, because I was looking to buy, but not if they are going to have that kind of attitude.
