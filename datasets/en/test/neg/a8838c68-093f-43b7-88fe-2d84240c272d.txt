I'm not one to review concert venues.  But this one I just had to.

The layout of this place is horrible.  At decent venues, the front-side seats can still see the majority of the act.  Here, the sides are wedged in the corner, not angled toward the stage, making it so those unfortunate people miss the show.

The TVs didn't have the correct contrast, and in the middle the show they went snowball (like a channel on your TV that you don't get, that white/black fuzzy thing).

If you have a choice, see your favorite artist elsewhere.  But everyone knows that you don't get to pick, so go ahead and see them here, just sit in the front center.
