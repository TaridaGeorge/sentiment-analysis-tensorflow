My bed was infested with some kind of small parasite. I felt crawling on my body all night, and found small bloodstains on my pillow in the morning. Further inspection revealed tiny, blood-engorged bugs. I agree with the manager that they did not appear to be bed bugs, as they were too small and red, not black. They were also not ticks or fleas. Manager comped us the room, but I slept badly and was horrified!
Service was polite, but room was shabby, amenities weak, and lots of construction.
