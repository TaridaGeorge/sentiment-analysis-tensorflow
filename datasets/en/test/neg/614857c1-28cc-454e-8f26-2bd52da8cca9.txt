This is a tough review to write.  The location was great and I'm sure the dinner would've been good too based on the other reviews.
Unfortunately, my team didn't like anything on the pre-set menu and the restaurant didn't want to work with them on finding alternates.  
I was a restaurant manager, so yeah, I get it - the food has already been purchased and prepped, etc.  But there were only 8 of us; how hard is it to be flexible?  How hard is it to say, "Yes of course, but we will have to charge you separately"?  When a group that is spending a couple thousand dollars on dinner tells you they're going to leave before you even bring the appetizers out, doesn't that concern you?  Wouldn't you send a manager over?
If you're Cowboy Ciao, the answer to all of these is no.  What a bummer.
