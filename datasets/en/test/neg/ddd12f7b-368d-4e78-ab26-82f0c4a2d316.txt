Several very good things about the Hyatt Place. Although it's in an ugly corporate park, about 100 meters to the east is an excellent paved trail that follows a dried riverbed. The complementary breakfasts were good. Outdoor pool. Comfortable rooms.

We only had one problem here. We booked using a third-party website that specified two double beds, and when we got here, all they had was a room with a king. I get it that those things aren't guaranteed. But to the general manager we attempted to negotiate with I ask, can't you at least pretend to be sympathetic? Even an insincere "I'm sorry" would have gone a long way. Did you miss that first day of class when you took Service Industry 101? Smug and condescending might be more fun for you, but nobody likes a little tyrant.
