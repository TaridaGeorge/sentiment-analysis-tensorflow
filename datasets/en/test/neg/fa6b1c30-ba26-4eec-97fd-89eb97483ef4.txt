Food was ok, THE SERVICE and waiter were HORRIBLE.  We waited over 20 mins for our drinks as he cleaned nearby tables that guests vacated (that was more important)

He showed his attitude and was rude.  VIG doesn't care about their customers anymore as they are so busy.  No one from management even walks the floor in the front of the house to asks guests about their experience.  The VIG got too big too quick and forgot about good customer service.  Get rid of the staff with attitude!!!

Wont even try the Vig uptown.  Wont waste my time.
