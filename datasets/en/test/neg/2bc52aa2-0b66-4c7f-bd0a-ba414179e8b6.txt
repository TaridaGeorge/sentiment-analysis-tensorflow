I saw so many great review on Zinburger we had to come and give the turkey burger a try. YUCK!!!!!!!!! I mean it was so disgusting we had grease running down our hands ( how do you get so much grease in a lean meat like turkey, what's the point!). then my husband had to catch a flight where he ended up belching the entire time with an upset stomach.

I know the review sounds harsh and I really hate to give such a low rating but honestly, it was the worst by far I have had for turkey burgers and a total disappointment. I thought it was also in poor taste to see some of the wait staff two tables away laughing and counting their tips and playing around. I wont be coming back. Just not worth the effort.
