Took 1 hr to prepare one sushi roll, two sushi and a grill fish. We were so hungry while we waited for the sushi chief to prepare our food. He was too relax and REALLY take his time. Overall took one and half hour to serve 3 dishes. The Uni sushi was NOT fresh and really sting. The others dishes were not worthed that price. Services were fine. But overall, very disappointed experience. Will not repeat.
