We hated this place! We went on a Sunday & there was quite a few people, but they prolly never had better Chinese food before. We were seated & right when we sat down, we felt like we had to watch what we ate. We stayed coz we were so hungry..but when we were done, we just felt like it was all a waste of time & $! Our hunger was not satisfied @ all!! But our pockets were already empty..do not eat here!!!
