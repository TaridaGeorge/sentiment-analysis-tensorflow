I didn't like this place. Red Velvet cake is my favorite, so me and my boyfriend are always trying to find a good one. First of all, this place looks more like a boutique than an actual cake place. Second of all, the Red Velvet didn't even taste like Red Velvet. It just taste like a bland chocolate cake.
