This place is HORRIBLE. They sold me a Blackberry as "new" for $350.00 that I did not realize until months later was actually used when I found pornographic videos on it! I called T-Mobile to complain and realized that they had also changed my plan and contract!!! I have been working with T-Mobile for weeks trying to get my plan figured out and send them copies of the paperwork I signed. Avoid this store as if your life depends on it!
