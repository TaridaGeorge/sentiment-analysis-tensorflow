The worst experience with this restaurant chain ever, management was not working with the host. A patron waiting behind me was attacking me on making a decision on whether I wanted to wait 90 mins to eat after the host asked me if I wanted to wait 15 seconds earlier. I came to Scottsdale to relax on vacation and left knowing people are so rude in this city.
