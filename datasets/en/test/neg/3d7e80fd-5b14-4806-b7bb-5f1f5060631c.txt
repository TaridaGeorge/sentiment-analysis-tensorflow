Prices were way to high. I was in there about two week ago to show my friend what I thought was going to be a cool candy store but after what i saw I'm never going back. It was a little busy when I went in but after seeing three kids lick the scooper and put them in the candy jar and lick them again I couldn't stay there another second.
