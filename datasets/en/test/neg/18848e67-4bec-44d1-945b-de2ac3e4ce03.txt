I got two mix drinks midori sour and gin tonic there and told the bartender to close my tab. So my tab came and the total was 31.50! The bartender was really really rude the whole time and kept yelling at me. And even used the "f" word just because I told her the price was ridiculous high. Anyways it ended up I refuse to pay the bill and my boyfriend paid In cash with 0 cent tip. And the girl just tole me "I already void your credit card charge" and would NOT gave me a receipt that proves it. 
That was my first time there and I was super upset. I had such a terrible night after that happened. And I told all my friends that I'll NEVER ever go back to that place and get yelled by a striper all night.
