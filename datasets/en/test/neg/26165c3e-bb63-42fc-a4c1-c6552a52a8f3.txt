Wow! This place was awful. Subs were not terrible, but not in any way great. You walk in, and all the employees (who could be considered the only "special" part of this experience) scream something at you. Then a lesbian greets you, and teaches you how to read a menu, and place an order. You wait 15 minutes, and one of the tards..err, I mean employees brings you your food. I honestly don't even remember what I ordered, that's how mundane the food is here. Their "famous lemonade" tastes like someone put a bunch of wet naps into a bowl of water, sipped it, realized it was nasty as hell..then put 8 lbs of sugar and food coloring into it. Every time I drive by, I visualize the place engulfed in flames. Fitting-
