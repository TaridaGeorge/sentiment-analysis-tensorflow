I have eaten here several times, since I usually stay at the Motel 6 when in Phoenix.  However the last time will be my last time.  I watched a cockroach crawl across the kitchen floor.

On the up side, the food was pretty good (pancakes, bacon, and scrambled eggs - orange juice from a carton).  I do have a strong stomach.
