This is the worst Starbucks I have ever been to across all 50 states. 

1. They can't multitask and serve multiple customers (it takes 20 minutes to get your drink). I don't care how busy you think you are; I have seen busier Starbucks figure it out. 

2. When they make a drink with flavoring, they put the flavor in with the milk and steam it, this burns the syrup and spoils the drink. 

3. No one smiles or says a simple 'thank you'. 

This Starbucks is less then a mile from my house (in walking distance) I am now a proud owner of a Tassimo.
