My waiter suggested the special of Cioppino and since I LOVE seafood, I ordered.  It was so lame.  Hardly any seafood on this dish, most of the items he described as being served in it, were missing.  It was the biggest rip ever.  WE will never eat there again.  You call that seafood?  Do NOT waste your money!!
