Yuck. 

Pho is rather tasteless, there is no pho-fragrance, and they use the wrong noodles. It's pho, not pad thai.

Stir fries use anti-fresh vegetables and if it doesn't come out of a can, they don't use it.

Stay away from here. 

I will, however, be returning because Grandma thinks this place is amazing, and I really think it's because of the owner. He's from the Motherland and she just loves that. It doesn't mean he can cook the food well, but sometimes we just suck it up and go along for the people we love (and the people they love, too).
