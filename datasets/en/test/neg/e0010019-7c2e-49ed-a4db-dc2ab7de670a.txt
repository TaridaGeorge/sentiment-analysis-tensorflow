Went for lunch today. No wait to get a table, about the only good thing about this visit. From here our waitress couldn't remember my wife's drink order, couldn't seem to refill anyone's drink very quickly, took 40 minutes to get our food and most of it was cold when we got it. When we told the Waitress, she said "really? It just came off the line!" Normally I would send it back or tell the manager, but we had a birthday party to go to so we just wolfed it down and left. 

I loved the north Scottsdale location but this one has horrible service, I will avoid at all costs. I was not the only one, I heard others complaim as we were leaving too!
