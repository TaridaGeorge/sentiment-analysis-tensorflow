I would like to give this service 0 stars but unfortunately Yelp does not allow such things.  So 1 star it is!

The monorail almost got me a bench warrant in the city of Phoenix. How?  Okay I'm from New York, we have TURNSTILES, you swipe your Metrocard THEN you enter.  This system has nothing!  Wait...It has 1 machine in the only area where you can choose to tap your card if you want to.  Otherwise, you board without a card and risk the Phoenix police issuing you a ticket in court the following week.  I was here on vacation, luckily no ticket for me or I would have been an outlaw in this city.

Ugh!!
