Very unhappy with this place. Spent over $50 on dinner for self, hubby and two sons (19) and (22). After dinner, went into bar area to shoot a game of pool and were asked to leave because my younger son wasn't 21. I find this ridiculous since Arizona law says servers must be 19 to serve alcohol. We were there as a family, weren't drinking and just wanted to have a fun family night. I won't be spending my money here any more.
