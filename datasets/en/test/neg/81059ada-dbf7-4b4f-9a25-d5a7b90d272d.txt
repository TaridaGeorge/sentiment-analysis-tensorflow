This was our first visit to a Chompies.  The menu is huge... it took forever to get through it.  The food tasted great, but they totally messed up my order.  When the waitress *finally* came over to check on us, I told her they messed it up, but by that time I'd already started eating it (we were on a time schedule... gotta go!).  She wanted to fix it, but since it took so long to get our food we didn't have time for them to 'fix' it.  The waitress did offer us a dozen (day old) bagels for the inconvience.

The bakery is extremely over priced for what you get.  Huge selection, but $2 for a sugar cookie that doesn't taste all that great... no thanks.
