Man, this place sucks. The service was awful. The server forgot my husband's drink. The food took a long time to come out. We ordered cheese sticks for $7.49, it came with only 5 cheese sticks. They charged us .50 cents for ranch even though it says on the menu that the cheese sticks come with ranch. Our server disappeared halfway through our dinner. Just as bad experience all together. Its a convenient place because its connected to the Best Western, but its overpriced. Avoid Hoot & Howl.
