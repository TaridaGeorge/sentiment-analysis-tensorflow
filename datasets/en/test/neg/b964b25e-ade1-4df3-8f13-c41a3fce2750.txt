My how the mighty have fallen!  Once considered a true resort experience, now run down and unclean.  Our in room fridge didn't work, the tv had to "warm up" and both pools we tried to use were very dirty.  In fact, the pool was so dirty that I slipped on the stairs from the algae.  I hurt my foot pretty bad which ended our time at the pool.  But the grand finale was finding two scorpions in our room.  With adobe chipping off the structures and dead folliage and trees througout the property, not to mention algae and scorpions, I will NEVER stay there again nor will I ever recommend that any friends, family or colleagues ever stay at this hotel.
