I have been frequenting gas stations for many years now and I have seen my fair share of dumps. I can't vouch for the quality of gas other than my car hasn't had fuel filter issues, but I can say the service there sucks. Their cc swipe on the pumps weren't working and I had to go in, to which I found two clerks chewing gum and leaning on the back wall behind the counter. I had to ask for them to ring me up. You would have thought that I asked them to change my tire. I know working at a gas station probably isn't their dream job, but it is their job at least for a little bit.
