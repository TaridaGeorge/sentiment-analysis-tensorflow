I'm convinced everywhere I go sucks. This place was at the chandler mall. nice ambiance inside and family oriented. the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever. the marinara sauce didn't have any spices or hint of authentic Italian to it. the whole menu is literally spaghetti so don't go with the idea of getting any other kind of Italian dish. the meatballs same thing. no big Italian taste or spiciness. the appetizer- the artichoke dip was bland. felt like old people food or kid friendly food. nothing for your palette to discover. very BLah. just save your money and go to Oregano's where your never disappointed I guess.
