OK I am sorry I know this is well liked on this board.  But I call it Pukes not Lukes.

Had the beef brisket sandwich thing it looked like a BM and tasted like a turd.  It was harsh.  Fries were OK, and the usual damn Pepsi products.  My God why can't you have Coke products?

To be fair haven't been in 2 years....but I hated it.
