This new theater just opened. What a joke and what a mess. Reserve your tickets on line? LOL lost them! No.one could find the prepaid reservation either... including manager. 

POPcorn was stale and the "new rocking seats" were of poor quality...very stiff. 

Theater lack signage as we spent 1/2 of driving around looking for it.

Movie its self was digital with no advertising. that was a plus.

You can buy food at your seat IF you can read the menu......no flashlight!
Panini was $7.25 and tasted just ok...nothing special.

Complained to manager Theresa. Couldnt seem to care much.

Advice is stay away a few months and see if it survives!
