Keep on walking......

My friend and I each tried different dishes and shared.  He got nice roast and I got a hamburger.  The place is really nice....open, bright....

..but the food is just a BIG disappointment.  A hamburger + 2 good beers was $37.   Expect to pay a lot for your food here.

Both dishes were poor.....

sorry, really wanted to like this one....
