This shouldn't even get a star. I went in tonight for hw with a friend and after I got a iced mocha. I was expecting it to taste like the pre made ones you can buy at the grocery store- definitely did not. It was the worst drink I have ever gotten from Starbucks and I don't know why the person that made it even assumed someone could possibly like how that would taste.
