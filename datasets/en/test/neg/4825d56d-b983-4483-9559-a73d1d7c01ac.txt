To call this hotel a 5 star resort is like describing the Reno Aces as a major league baseball team. If you're expecting the customer service, amenities and quality of a typical JW Marriott hotel, this is not the spot for you. The rooms are old and smelly (my guess is that the rooms haven't been renovated in over 20 years), the service is juvenile and the food is subpar. Although the area and the surroundings are beautiful, there are many other hotels in Paradise Valley that are encompassed by the beautiful Arizona mountains. If you stay here, you'll be paying JW Marriott prices but you won't be getting the quality.
