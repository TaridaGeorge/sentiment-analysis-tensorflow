Really as bad as it gets.
Crap food.
Over priced.
Ugly, tasteless interior
Bad music and music system
Tired staff
This place needs to either have a complete redo or it needs to close. 
I would rather go down the street and eat at Applebee's, and I have never been to an Applebee's. Too many other choices now in the neighborhood for this place to go on in its present condition. Then again, there might be enough people around these parts with really bad taste to keep the place going.
