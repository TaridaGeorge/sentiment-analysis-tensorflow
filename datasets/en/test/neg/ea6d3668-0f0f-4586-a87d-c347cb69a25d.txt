Absolutely HORRIBLE customer service! I can't purchase Philosophy products in my small town so I stopped in this Ulta to pick up about $200 worth of products. Neither of the two employees lounging near the front door greeted me (too busy chatting with each other) nor did they offer to help me find what I needed. Then when I finally found Philosophy, the girl at the counter nearest the products never even looked up to say hi or offer help. Thanks, but I can get impersonal service by buying online (and save on gas!).  I didn't buy anything from this store. If employees can't bother to greet me, then I can't bother to spend 200 bucks!
