My first first-to-review, yay!

It was horrifying :(

This review goes out as a warning to boba lovers everywhere:
Boba Deli makes the worst boba I have ever had, period.

I asked for a mango boba.

I got mango water mixed with finely crushed ice. You couldn't call it a smoothie and you couldn't even act like it was some new iced mango drink. How hard is it to blend the powder, water, syrup flavoring, and ice into a smoothie? 

If you want to make the junk that they called a mango boba, here's a suggested recipe:

Mix mango powder with one glass water
Add three cubes ice
Zap blend - 1 second blend
Add hard, stale boba
