This place is trash. The people all have three things in common at this location. They are all pushing three kids, 300lbs and only have three teeth. The store smells of bad food, and stale cigarette smoke. Nothing is is organized, trash everywhere, and English is the second language. Drive the extra 10min and go to the one on Estrella Parkway
