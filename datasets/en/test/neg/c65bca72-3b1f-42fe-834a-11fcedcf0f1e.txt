I've lived in Thailand and enjoy Thai food so I wad excited to try Thai Rama since I've seen it a million times passing by. 
Got the infamous trio I always get at a Thai restaurant: Tom yam goong, pad Thai, and green curry. All three were fails in my book. Since the flaming vessel they serve it in usually just keeps it warm rather than finish cooking it, we had a lukewarm soup with uncooked mushrooms and green onions. It was flavorful, but being lukewarm, fresh onions kept masking the flavor. Next, came the pad Thai. Too sweet and the noodles lacked definition. It was a big glob and they were really cheap with their proteins. Finally, the green curry came and it was very salty. 

Will not return.
