I am so appalled by this B and N!!  I went in here to buy some gifts and had them gift wrapped with gift receipts.  The man who rung me up didn't do the gift receipts correct so the manager had to be called over.  The manager, think his name was Jeff, was the rudest man I have encountered in so long.  He was so nasty to me and I was nothing but nice and patient.  He was mean to me for their mistakes.  I will not shop at this store anymore.  I told "Jeff" that I didn't like how he was treating me and he still was rude.  Shame on B and N to treat me that way.
