Went last week and what a disappointment... If it's a franchise, the owner needs to get her (or his) money back.

100% natural? bland and dry. they can still be natural and moist. Get a new recipe. Dry in cake is BAD!

100% naughty? yeah.. it's naughty of them to charge so much for these tiny little things. They are tiny compared to all of the other $3.00 cupcakes around town. 

And have you looked at the pdf menu thing on the lulu's website? Check it out and look at the bottom of page 2... It actually says "Orders must be placed by blah blah blah..." What the hell does blah blah blah mean?

Tiny, dry, and way too expensive for the size and quality.
