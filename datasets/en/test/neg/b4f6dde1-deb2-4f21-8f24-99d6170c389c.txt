This place is legendary in the valley, and I have to say, I have NO idea why.  I went there expecting to see things like cod and halibut on the menu, like a real fish & chips joint.  I expected the fish to be filleted and hand battered, like a real fish & chips joint.  I expected they'd know what tartar sauce is, like real fish & chips joints do.  

All my expectations were dashed when what I got in my little deli basket was a preformed, previously frozen slab of "fish" that I could have just as easily gotten at a grocery store with a Van De Kamp label on the box and cooked in my toaster oven, and fries (chips) that might have well said Oreida on them.   And a puzzled "WTF? look when I asked for tartar sauce.  Simply, stunningly, awful.
