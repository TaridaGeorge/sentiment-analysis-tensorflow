Take-Out:   8  "extreme breaded & fried"  wings, french fries, burger.  All I had to eat all day ( no medicines...) An hr after eating-my legs & feet swelled up fast.  Researched the sauces hve sodium benzoate-preserv (never had that kind of reaction...).  I mainly eat clean/healthy. What is in the lard ?  Service was distracted.
