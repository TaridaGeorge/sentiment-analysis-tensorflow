Two failures in the same parking lot. Imagine that. (Walmart is right next door.)

This place is dirtier than the State Fair. Floor tiles are missing, I saw two kids running around barefoot. Ew. Light bulbs are out, and the place grows darker by the day. The air conditioning in the summer was out for weeks. WEEKS, in Arizona sun.  Even the employees were complaining about the heat problem. 

In addition to all of that, prices here are outrageous. You can feel yourself being scammed. Take the drive to JoAnn's at Desert Ridge, the gas is less expensive than foam shapes at Michael's.
