I waited for the store to open at 8 AM the day after Christmas..... but they had the same discount they had before Christmas, so shop other stores....
A crowd of people were milling around the front of the store, speaking to the manager, asking why they did not make down the Christmas merchandise, as they were told it was going to be marked down by store employees before Christmas. Quite a few people were told the same thing.... yet the manager did not handle this very well, and quite a few people walked out....... shame on you Garden Ridge !
