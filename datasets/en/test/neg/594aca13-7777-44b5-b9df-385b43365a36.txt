THREE WORDS..... 

DON'T GO THERE!!!!! 


after eating some great sushi at Pear next door (Thursday evening), saw this club called CREAM...Hmmmm. 
girlfriend and i thought just check out what's that all about. 
so we ask the door man if we can just take a look inside of the place for next time when we want to come. He tells us $15 each!! we told him we just want to see the place. he still wouldn't let us in!! I don't know what all the hoopla about this place is, but a place of business don't have decent door man...thanks but no thanks.
Scottsdale has plenty of club and lounge, where they have great music and nice door man.
I give this place another year!
