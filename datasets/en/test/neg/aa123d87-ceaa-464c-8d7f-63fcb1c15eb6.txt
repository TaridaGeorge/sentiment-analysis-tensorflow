Worst service and mediocre food. After being seated, we waited over an hour and waitress never came back to take our order. We had to ask another waitress to serve us and might I add that this place was empty for a Saturday night. I will NEVER come back! Also, the food taste like it was warmed up in the microwave. Avoid Gallagher's at all costs!!
