Worst lunch I've ever had in downtown Phoenix. Just had time to take out a slice of cheese pizza and fried mushrooms at 1:00 pm. Pizza was old and rubbery.  Fried mushrooms were adequate but ranch dressing was too salty and runny.  I knew it was questionable when I walked in at lunchtime and I was the only customer. Not only did it cost me $8.20 for one slice and mushrooms, but they charged me .25 cents for an extra ranch which I ended up tossing anyway. So I spent $8.45 for two bites of cheese pizza and three mushrooms. What a waste. The only positive is that the lack of calories means Haagen Daas when I get home.
