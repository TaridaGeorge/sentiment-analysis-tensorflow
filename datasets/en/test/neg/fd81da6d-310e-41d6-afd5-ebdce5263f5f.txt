This place is a joke. There is nothing resort like about it. The organization has been pathetic, the rooms  are less than impressive and you are by nothing interesting. Don't waste your time. Save your money up and go to your local holidays inn cause it is no different. Anybody that even for a second considers buying a time share here is off their rocker.
