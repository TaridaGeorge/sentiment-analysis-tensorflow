Absolutely hands down the worst sushi I've ever had. I wouldn't  even say the food was fish-stick grade, much less sushi grade.  The wasabi was bland, my salmon roll was warm 'fishy' smelling and the order came out so fast I swear it had to have been pre-made.  If they offered me free sushi for life I still would never go back. Never. Yuck!
