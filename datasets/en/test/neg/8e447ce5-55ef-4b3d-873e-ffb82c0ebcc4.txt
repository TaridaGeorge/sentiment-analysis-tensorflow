Turned into parking lot and there were two ladies on the side of the building smoking. They see me walk in so they come inside. I did not see them wash their hands. Lady who took my order reeked of cigarette smoke.

The combo meal was close to $9. There was not much meat on the bread. Walking out I felt I had been overcharged for a bad lunch. 

Before I pulled out of the parking lot the two ladies were on the side of the building smoking again. 

Will never go to Cousins again. Too many other sub places to choose from. Even if the price for the combo meal was reasonable the woman just reeked badly of smoke. 

Spend less time smoking and more time running your business or soon you wont have a business and you will have all day to smoke.
