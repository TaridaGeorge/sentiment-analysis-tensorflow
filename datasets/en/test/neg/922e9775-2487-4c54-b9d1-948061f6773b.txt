We filled out all the paperwork and sent in photos of the items damaged in a move.   We even paid $75 for a furniture repair company to write up an appraisal for fixing the damaged items.  After not hearing anything for two months we called Anthem and were told that the adjuster had determined that our furniture "would have broken eventually" and that the claim was being rejected.  Anthem did not dispute that the furniture was broken by the movers; instead, the company denied the claim based on possible future events.  When I protested I was told for $150 I could take the claim to arbitration using another company.  Avoid any moving company that uses Anthem for its claims!
