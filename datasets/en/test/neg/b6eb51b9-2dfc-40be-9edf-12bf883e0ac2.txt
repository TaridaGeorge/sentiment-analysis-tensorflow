Food order - almost always wrong.
Availability of menu items - poor.  
Price - always on the rise
Customer Service - AAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAA  When I stand there for 20 minutes before the jerk at the grill says he can't make my chicken sandwich because he doesn't have any chicken and I ask to talk to someone about it and that mystery person can't be found...ahahahahahaa No discount, no discussion, not even an "I'm sorry!"  Or should we bring up the large amount of employees who don't understand English?  They never respond to posts on their facebook page, there are no contact email addresses...just...radio silence.

Save your $, save your temper, save your gas, save your lunch time...Go to any of the other food joints in the area!
