Came here real fast for a phone case. Asked a girl at the cellphone desk if they had cases for the galaxy nexus... she said "oh, no idea." Then, once I asked here where they had cases so i could look for myself, she argued with me that they had what I was looking for. Sorry, but I don't have a nexus, or a galaxy sII or whatever.  I showed her my phone and she continued to argue with me that i had the phone that went with the case she was trying to sell me.  then she went on the computer and kept arguing that my phone was the ones in the photos. I ended up thanking her and walking away as she was still arguing. Couldn't believe it.
