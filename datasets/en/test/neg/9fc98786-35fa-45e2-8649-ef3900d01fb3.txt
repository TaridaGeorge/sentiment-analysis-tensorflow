I really don't understand how this place is as bad is it is.  Vietnamese food isn't so exotic in this town to justify this place's horrible interpretation of the cuisine.

The menu seemed pretty weak.  We started with some spring rolls that were just awful -- bland and poorly wrapped.  The pho was greasy and fatty.  The stir fry concoction I ordered was just bland.  The service was pretty disinterested and our server didn't seem to know much of anything about the food he was serving.  All told, lunch for 3 people was nearly $40, which was about $40 more than it was worth.
