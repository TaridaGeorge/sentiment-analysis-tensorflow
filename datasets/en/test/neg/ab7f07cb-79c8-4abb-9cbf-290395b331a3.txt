I've been to this Zipps 3 times. First time was fun. Second time I ordered the wings and I ended up with food poisening, and the last time I went they overcharged my bill and forced me to deal with the asshole GM...

The food is great at Zipps and Goldies, but NOT at this location.

And the Management are idiots and condisending assholes. I don't recommend this location AT ALL!!!
