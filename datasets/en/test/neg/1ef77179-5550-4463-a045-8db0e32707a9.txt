This place left a bad taste in my mouth. We made the mistake of going on father's day with my best friend's dad (his choice). The place was nearly empty and it still took almost an hour to get our food. We had to ask management if we'd been forgotten. The group that came in after us were served well before us, even though I'm pretty sure they put their order in a few minutes after ours.

I ordered BBQ chicken nachos, thinking they would be nachos with barbecued chicken. That makes sense, right? I got chicken on top of chips covered in BBQ sauce. It's my fault. I come from a place where barbecue is a method, not necessarily a flavor. 

Minus a star for the bad food.
Minus two stars for the terrible service.
And minus a star for being Fox. 

Sorry, that's how I roll.
