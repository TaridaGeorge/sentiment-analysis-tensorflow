UGH. This is one of the worst places I've been to. Ever. I probably would have liked it when I was underage, but that's about it. Yeah, yeah, I get it, it's like three or four different types of "clubs" under one roof. But you know what? They all SUCK. 
I came here a few months back for a friend's going-away party. Couldn't wait to get home. Pools of foam, bucking bulls, karoake, a 'hip-hop' floor filled with the crappiest top-40-rap you've ever heard. Wow. I couldn't believe it was possible for a place to suck this bad.
And what's with the name, anyway? Who is this Graham?
