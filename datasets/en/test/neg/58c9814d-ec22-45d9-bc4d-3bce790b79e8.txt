Let me start this by saying I am a mom of 2 young kids. Needless to say I don't have the biggest nightlife, because parenting at 6am with a hang over is just NOT worth it.  That being said I've never had cause to visit a Wendy's at 1:30am, until tonight. I've been up all night with my 6 year old son who is sick. I thought a frosty would soothe his throat and do just the trick to get him back to sleep, but all I got was a foomy version of one from them, plus shitty, cold food. If their food is going to suck at 1:30am, then don't be open that late.
