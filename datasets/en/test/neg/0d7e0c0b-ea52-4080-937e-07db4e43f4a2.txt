I went here and I told the guy this is my first time I ever been in a cigar shop and I asked whats the difference between these two cigars? He responded with "if you need to ask you dont need to be here"  then it was just silent and I walked out and now I just go right down the street to cigar ware house on 10thst and camelback.
