I stayed here for a business trip (booked 2 nights) and noticed right away that the hotel grounds were very nice, but when I got up to the room, the carpets were stained and the room was very dirty and old. Well the first night, I got into bed and noticed...bedbugs. So horrible!!!  This was almost midnight.  They put me into a different room, but I didn't sleep all night.  I did not stay for the second night, checked into the Doubletree down the street instead which was much better. I'd say don't stay. What are the chances there are bedbugs in just one guestroom? Not very likely.
