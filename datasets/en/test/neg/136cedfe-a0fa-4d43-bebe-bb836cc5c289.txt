This place sucks.  A "deli" that serves slightly less than mediocre food should at least try to make up for it in customer service and ambiance.  The surroundings are nice, equipped with an outdoor patio and koi pond.  However, the customer services seriously lacks.  The three employees we dealt with had bad attitudes.  It was like they were put out by having to do their job or answer a simple question like where the soda fountain is.  I had a philly cheesesteak sandwich and my friend had pastrami/ sauerkraut in rye.  Both sandwiches were less than mediocre.  The rye bread for the pastrami was stale and seemed low quality. Both meats were flavorless and greasy.   There are FAR better delis in the area.  We won't be returning as well as anyone from our office.
