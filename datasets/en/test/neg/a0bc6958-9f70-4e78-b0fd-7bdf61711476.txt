No matter what time I shop at Best Buy there is NEVER a person to help you. The employees will walk right by you without asking if you need help and when you do ask, they typically respond "ya, this isn't my area, let me get someone for you". Then they talk into there walk-talkie and no one responds. Very poor floor customer service.
