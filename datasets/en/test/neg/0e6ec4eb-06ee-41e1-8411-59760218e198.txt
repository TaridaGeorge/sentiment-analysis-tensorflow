Very rude! Called to speak to her regarding leaving my dogs there for a couple days while I was in the Scottsdale area. She did not ask any questions, just immediately said no, it would be too much of a disruption for her. I was willing to bring my dogs in for a meet and greet and she still said it was too much work. I would think someone would be very pleasant to a possible new customer, but she was completely the opposite. I come to the Scottsdale area 3-4 times a year, so that could have been some extra business for her. Do not recommend, would not want to inconvenience her to take care of my dogs., despite the fact that that is her business.
