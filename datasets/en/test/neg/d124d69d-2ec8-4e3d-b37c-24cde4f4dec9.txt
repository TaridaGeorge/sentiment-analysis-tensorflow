I would have rather spent my money at Chipotle, enough said.   The enchiladas had a very funny, part sour, part plasticky almost bitter taste to it.  I was with my boyfriend's mom and she commented that not every place makes it like you're used to, so that was my cue to shut up and just suffer and eat it.  

Don't waste your money on worse than microwave food!
