I don't know why this place has such high reviews?

I never feel welcomed when I come here. Which is sad being a new age store, I expect good energy. Yet the people who work here are snobbish and rude. When I inquired about reiki classes they just brushed me off and didn't provide any information for me at all...

I only come back for their candles.

So disappointing, I wish they were nicer because then I'd spend more money here. Oh well...
