This place has definitely gone downhill. I ordered the gyro and fries. The gyro was dry and tasteless and the fries were under cooked. We were served by the teenage daughter that had better things do to. The place itself was pretty dirty, I can only imagine what the kitchen is like. I wont be back. Good luck Flaming Kabob!
