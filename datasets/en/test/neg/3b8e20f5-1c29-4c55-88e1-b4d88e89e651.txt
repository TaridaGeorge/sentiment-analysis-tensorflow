I went here for the first time last night and I thought I was going to have a good meal.  The bread was good and my salad looked good until I found a bug in it that was laying on its back with it's legs still moving.  All they did was offer to replace my salad.  Needless to say, I was utterly disgusted and found myself looking through my entree to make sure there wasn't another bug anywhere in it.  I had the filet stuffed with fontina and mushrooms.  Had I not been so worried about finding another bug in my food, I probably would have thoroughly enjoyed the steak because it actually tasted really good, but after the salad my meal was ruined.
