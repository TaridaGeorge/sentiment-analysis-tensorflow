I'll start with the positive.  They have some friendly members of staff.  That's it.  You might catch a staff infection here, so watch out.  It's like a shack that somehow got a bar licence.  I have a friend who drags me here on occasion as it's his favourite dive.  It's one wrong glance away from a fight, every time.  If you like the danger and excitement of drinking a beer in a building that may collapse on you, go for it.  If not, avoid the dregs of society and go somewhere else.
