I will never fly through here again.

Besides being a poorly designed airport where to make a connecting flight you have to leave the airport via zigzagging and try to catch a shuttle (20 rental shuttle buses to 1 airport shuttle) to the next terminal and face going through security all over again.

Security only had 2 lines and if your bag needs to be checked, there is only 1 guy there to do the exam, and he does it slowly.

We barely made our flight after they called last call.

Who cares about free wifi when you're desperately trying to run from one terminal to another??  There's next to no time to grab food or use the bathroom as you're struggling to throw on your shoes and stuff your liquids back in your bag in order to awkwardly run with your luggage to the plane huffing and puffing.
