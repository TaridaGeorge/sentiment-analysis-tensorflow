I ordered a cake well over a week in advance.  Went to pick and they got it wrong.  How do you mess up one of two flavors?  I ordered a chocolate cake and they made a vanilla.  They offered $5.00 off when they should have called ahead and advised me that they were not going to make what I ordered.  They should have given the cake for free as it was NOT what I ordered.  And they even had a more expensive cake price than other stores but I decided to go with them because they had Thomas the train (which came out not looking like it at all, the only resemblance was the plastic train set on top the cake.)  Way to go Suckway on screwing up a little kids birthday cake.
