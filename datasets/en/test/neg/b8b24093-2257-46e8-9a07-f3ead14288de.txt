Ok...I am into dive bars.  This place is not a dive bar, it is just plain filth.  I never felt so disgusting in a drinking establishment in my life.   My drink was horrible and my partner in crime was getting hit on by some nasty guy with sores on his face.  People were playing beer pong on a ping pong table...which then made me feel like I was 16 years old.  I am actually embarassed for this place.
