Tried it twice, not a fan.  Wanted to like it?  I know Olive Garden is down the street and can produce a quailty product.  If I compared the two I have to go with Olive Garden, quality salad, bread, service.  Stiff competition around here, if the service was there and the food quality was better it could maybe be as good as the Olive Garden.
