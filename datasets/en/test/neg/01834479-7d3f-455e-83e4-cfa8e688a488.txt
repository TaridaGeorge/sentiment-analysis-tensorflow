My boyfriend and I recently went to this show and saw "Murder at the Vampire's Wedding." Although we felt the cast tried to make it fun, we really were not impressed. The actors often came out of character and when they were in character the show was very hokey and pretty lame. They tried to get the crowd involved but it came across as them trying too hard and most people did not seem very impressed - most acted involved to avoid being called out and made to do something even more ridiculous. Additionally, the food was really bad (we went to Cocos). We were counting the minutes until we could leave and will definitely not be returning.
