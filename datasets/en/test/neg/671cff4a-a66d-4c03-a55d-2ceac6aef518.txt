We found a bandaid with the panang.  We ordered panang with chicken, not panang with bandaid. 

When we told the waiter, he argued that it wasn't a bandaid.  I'm sorry, there's no mistaking a bandaid!  The icing on the cake was that they charged us for it!!!

If you like bandaid on your dish, this I the place to go!

Too bad yelp doesn't allow 0 stars. This place definitely was a ZERO.
