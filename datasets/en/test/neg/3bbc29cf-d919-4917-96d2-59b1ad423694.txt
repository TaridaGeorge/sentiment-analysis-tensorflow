This place is horrible to say the least. There was only one server and she took FOREVER to get our orders. We were there for a good 20 min before anyone ever came by. Once she did, she took our drink order, took another 20 min to bring or menus, and another 20 min to get our watered down/ lukewarm drinks...you get the point. Maybe she was new or something?! We'd see her walk over to the touch screen to place orders, and she'd be there FOREVER trying to figure out how to use it each time. I don't care if it's happy hour all night Thursdays or all week, I will not be back here.
