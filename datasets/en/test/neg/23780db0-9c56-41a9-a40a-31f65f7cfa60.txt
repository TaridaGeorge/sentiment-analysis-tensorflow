There was only one item that I would come here for once in a blue moon and that was their 99Â¢ double stack. I am not a frequent fast food connoisseur and don't eat it on the regular but the double stack was one of the only exceptions I would make every so often. Well they have taken it off their value menu and raised it to $1.79 and officially made it easy for me to never step foot in a Wendys again. It's just not that good to pay any more for.  They also reduced the nuggets to 4 pieces instead of 5.  And they increased the price of their small chili to $1.49.  I will miss your value meals and dollar double stack and your beautiful red pigtails Wendy. RIP Dave Thomas.
