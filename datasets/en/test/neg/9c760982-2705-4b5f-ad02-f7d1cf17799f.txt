People rave about this place so we finally checked it out tonight. We're not impressed. We ordered Salsiccia with additional spicy salame topping. For a $17 pizza, we expected it to be loaded with meat. It was just the opposite and tasted mediocre. Fresh & Easy pizza tastes better than Cibo. The service was also horrible. The girl who brought us the pizza just plopped the pizza onto the table and walked away. She didn't even ask if we wanted another beer. For good pizza with fresh ingredients, check out Grimaldi's. My next adventure will be Pizzeria Bianco.
