never, ever sit in the balcony if you are going for a speaking engagement. i saw and tried to hear david sedaris on april 22, but the echo was so bad i couldn't understand what he was saying without very careful concentration. the person i brought with me is slightly hard of hearing, and she couldn't understand him at all. further, there was no video projection, so we couldn't even try to read his lips. i like gammage, but i feel like i wasted $80.
