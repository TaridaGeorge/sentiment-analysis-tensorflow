Glendale glitters is horrible! They charge for parking now and it is more like a carnival than anything else. It was so crowded that I had to use the stroller to push through the crowd. I didn't have time to look at anything because I was worried about getting trampled by someone. I will not be coming back which is sad because this was a family tradition.
