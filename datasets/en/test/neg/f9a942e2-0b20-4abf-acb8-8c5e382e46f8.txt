Visited this place twice and both times received really poor service, once at the bar and once a table. Pizza was okay; better than Domino's but nothing special. I like playing Buzztime Trivia and QB1. The third time I went there the Arizona Cardinals were featured as the QB1 game. I go to a sports bar to watch the other NFL games because the Cardinals are on regular television. If I wanted to watch the Cardinals I would do so at home. I didn't stay that day and haven't been back since. The place might have gotten better, might still be the same. I'm not willing to take the chance.
