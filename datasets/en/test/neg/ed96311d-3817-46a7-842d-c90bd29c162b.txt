SWEET SAUCE! The age old question about what makes pizza great, sauce or crust. While both are important, in my opinion, sauce is king. I tried Spinato's based on great word of mouth and the postings on yelp. I feel an obligation to write in and let all the sauce lovers of the world know that this sauce has more sugar than sweet tea in Georgia! I won't be returning and do not recommend this place.
