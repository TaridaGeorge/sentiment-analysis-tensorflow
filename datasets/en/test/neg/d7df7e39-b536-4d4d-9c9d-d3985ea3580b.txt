I have had the misfortune of staying at this place on a corporate contract for work. everything that could be wrong with this place, is.  dirty rooms, horrible/unsafe location, loud, not enough parking, bugs in the breakfast food, homeless people everywhere...
i am forced to give this place one star although i don't think it deserves even that. Try another hotel in the area, like Comfort Inn or Hampton Inn.
