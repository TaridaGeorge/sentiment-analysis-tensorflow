I will NEVER go to this specific restaurant again.  I have been to this location for dinner about 5-6 times.  The last time I was there, the service was horrible.  We waited 15 minutes for someone to come by and TAKE our drink order.  Then we wait 40 minutes to cash out. 

DON'T GO HERE.  

Go to the one on Mill Ave instead.
