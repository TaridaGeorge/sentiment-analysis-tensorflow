It seems like when this place gets a sick animal the first thing they do is push you off on someone else, they can't be bothered.  My Black Lab was mis diagnoised with thyroid cancer, they said it was a fat mass and wouldn't biopsy it, my yellow Lab swallowed something that got stuck in his intestines, they took blood work and said they would call in the morning.....I ran him right out to Cave Creek for an ultrasound, we were sent to a hospital a block away and took him in for emergency surgery, he would not have survived the night.  I believe if you dog needs only shots, your probably safe, anything else...run, run far away.  They don't care about your animals.  There are so many caring and outstanding vets who truly care about animals, get away from these people!!!
