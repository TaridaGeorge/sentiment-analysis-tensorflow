Sonic use to be so good. I miss the fire island burger they use to have many years ago. That was their best burger. 

This location's food was not worth the stop. Burger was dry, bacon was burned beyond belief (see pic), toast wasn't even toasted, and the tater tots were super salty. The cranberry sprite I got was good but that was the only refreshing thing I received. 

Will not go back.
