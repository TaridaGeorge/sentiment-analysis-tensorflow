Talk about a stomach ache.  Too bad I can not give this place a 0 or negative star review.  First off, I have eaten very authentic Thai food in Thai Town in Hollywood.  The prices are dirt cheap and the food is excellent.  This place the food was more pricey and I had tremendous stomach and digestion problems the next 3 days!  My best friend who is Thai thinks that the curry I got lacked the curry.  Thai curry has the peanut sauce and curry base.  He thinks I got all peanut and no curry.  Just thinking how much peanut I might have ingested makes me want to puke right now.
