When I stopped and asked for directions to this hotel, some girls explained the lack of a sign here because "if you don't already know where it is, then they don't want you there".  Real nice.  It wasn't easy to find.

So upon walking in, the girl at the guest services was so snotty and rude I left.  Bad vibes. You could hear a friggin pin drop in that place it was so dead.

Why hasn't this place closed yet?  Its so overrrated.  Old looking building, rude greeting staff.
