Definitely not what I was expecting. The fried rice was very generic and the sweet and sour pork was only 3 pieces. The pieces seemed like they were on steroids and not in a good way. The mushrooms in the almond chicken seemed like they were fresh out of the can, mmmm. :/  So if you are like myself and enjoy fresh ingredients, do yourself a favor and run!
