This review is to all parents! 

Papago Park is going to crap! What happened to Papago over the past few months? Maybe since it is summer the city's staff isn't taking as good of care of the grounds as they should, but there was dangerous broken playground equipment, all kinds of trash in the sand, and the general upkeep of the playground was horrible. 

BTW: I just have to say, Papago park gave me the creeps today. It was completely empty other than a few shady guys in the parking lot that I am pretty sure were doing a drug deal. I wont be going to Papago Park again. 

I like to hike there (just N. of McDowell,) but I don't feel this park is a safe place for my kids to go and play anymore.
