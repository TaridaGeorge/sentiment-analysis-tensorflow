showed up at 940 for a 945 show.  mgr greets me at box office and says, sorry, we are done for the night, you are like the tenth person to come in but, moviefone and flickster are wrong, we close early every night except sat and sun.

Me: ok, can you give us a couple of passes for a future movie for our trouble?  We planned our whole night around this info.  
Him; No, sry not our policy.
Me: (a litlle aggravated) its ok, this theatre wont be open in 4 months anyway.  You guys are horrible.
Him;  I couldn't care less
