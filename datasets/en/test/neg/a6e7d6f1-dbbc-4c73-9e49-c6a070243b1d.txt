Don't put coffee in your name if you don't make it well, care about it, or focus on it. I had the misfortune of having a water flavored espresso here... ew. My boyfriend had a water flavored brewed coffee. Just thinking about it makes me angry. They do use decent local tea though (china mist, which I'm into). Everything else is crap. Everything. 

Make the drive to Echo or Cartel for your coffee. Eff, go to Starbucks before you go here. You can thank me later.
