This place is terrible. The rice used for the sushi is overcooked and the fish taste as though is was just defrosted the same day is was prepared. The service is horrible because is usually understaffed. It takes for ever to get refills and the wait staff is drinking on the job. To top it off the owner John is a drunk. There are so many other places to eat so stay away from this location.
