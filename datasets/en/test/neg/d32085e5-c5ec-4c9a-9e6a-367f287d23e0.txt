Ever wonder what our country will look like in the future when Mexico has successfully invaded our country and Hispanic Mexicans are the majority population? They will treat us white eyes like trash, bump into us without regret, and cut in front of us as if we didn't exist. 

Well, there is a place you go to get that kind of futuristic treatment today. Arizona Mills. The place is in Tempe, Arizona. We were driving through Arizona to get to San Diego and my wife wanted to stop near there for the night and visit the mall. Bad decision. 

This place never fired the first shot and has already won the war!

If you are ever in the area.....keep on driving!
