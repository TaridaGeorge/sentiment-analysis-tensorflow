RA is a chain restaurant and being such I was surprised that they do not offer better choices for gluten free options. One cannot even eat their sushi. They use white flour in the rice to keep in from sticking. I have gone to many different sushi places and no one else has ever done this. I won't be returning to RA for this reason. On top of this they are pricey.
The service was so so and could be better.
