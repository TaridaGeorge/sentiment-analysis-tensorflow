I detest this store. soooo much. This is like....a Kmart and Goodwill crashed and made a baby. No, the stuff isn't donated, but the items are definitely bottom of the barrel quality. Bad lighting, awful cramped spaces and a general aura of disorder and mess....If you need cheap stuff, or you need stuff NOW, then yes, it's good for that. If you want something Good, something that'll last more than one or two days, then this is Not that.
