Read the review in the Republic a few weeks ago and was excited to try this place.  Just went over there, 9 pm on a Saturday night, to find it closed up tight.  The parking lot was empty, the inside deserted and the doors were locked.  There's a "Now Open" banner flapping in the wind and they're supposed to be open until midnight.  What happened????
