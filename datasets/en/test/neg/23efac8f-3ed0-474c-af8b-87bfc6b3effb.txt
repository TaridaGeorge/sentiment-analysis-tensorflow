I loathe this place. Partly because its a faux Irish pub*, partly because the service sucks and the food is mediocre at best. 

I go to bars for good drinks and good food.  If the staff is hot girls in skimpy outfits, that can be a bonus, not a replacement for the other two.

There are places doing the "hot waitstaff" concept much better, find one and go there. Or better yet, find a bar you like that just happens to have a cute bartender, and be a regular there!

*True story, was once having a bad day and needed a good Irish whiskey to cheer me up. I asked what their selection was and after ~5 minutes of searching their backbar they found a (singular) dusty bottle of bushmill's. Nothing else... weak sauce!
