My wife and I went for early dinner and found the place to be extremely noisy, not from people but the crap music was way too loud. The meal was $19.00 for two burgers, fries and sodas, way too expensive for what you get. The burgers were sooo greasy my wife would not eat hers, the fries are fake potatoes, and the soda machine was broke so we had warm can soday to add to the ice which diluted it very quickly. For half the price we can go to In and Out and get a really good meal without the grease and the noise. We won't be back that is for sure.
