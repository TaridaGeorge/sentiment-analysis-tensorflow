These people are liars and will tell you anything to get your buisness. They destroyed a ton of our stuff and never reimbursed us! We filed complaints with the BBB, where they have an F rating already. They still did not reimburse us or apologize. They took a month when they promised a week to deliver our items. The guy even hit on me when picking up our stuff. We saw them drop our boxes and they denied it. Do not use this unprofessional and terrible company.
