It was my first time and probably my last.  I went here for my birthday dinner and we ordered:  Pretzel Bites, Crab Stuffed Chicken, Sloppy Joe burger, Mussels, and Beef Stew.  I was not impressed.  The pretzel bites with the cheese fondue was just that.  Pretzel bites that were pretzels you can probably get at the mall or even at softball game in smaller pieces.  The crab stuffed chicken was a chicken sandwich!  Two chicken filets as the bread and the crab in the middle.  It was not good.  The sloppy joes was ok, but can't distinguish if it is better than any other sloppy joe burger i've tried before.  The beef stew and the mussels were forgettable.  I was pretty disappointed to have spent my birthday here..Happy Birthday to me.
