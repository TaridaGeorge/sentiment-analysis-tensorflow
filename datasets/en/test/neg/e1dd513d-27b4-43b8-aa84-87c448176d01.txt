This had to be the worst chesesteak I have ever had or seen. The meat is such a low grade that I wouldn't have trusted giving it to my pets. The steak was so tough, tasted so bad, and smelled unlike any meat I have smelled before. Located in Sky Harbor in terminal 4, I highly warn you to avoid this place and go to one of the many better choices located in the airport. The counter you order from was dirty, messy, and unappetizing, similar to how the cooking area behind it. 

Terrible! No stars!
