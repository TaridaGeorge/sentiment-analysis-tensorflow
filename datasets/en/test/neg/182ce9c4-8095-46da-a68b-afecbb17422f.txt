I always try to give this UPS store my business for its close to home but every time I've been in the employees always have a chip on their shoulder - dude I'm just trying to mail something and its your job to help me get that done!  Terrible customer service.  They could be a lot nicer.  I prefer to use FedEX but sometimes I need to use UPS so I will go to the other UPS store on Indian School from now on - they are super nice - shouldn't every store be like that!
