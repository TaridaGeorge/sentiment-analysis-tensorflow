Went for several back pain treatments with shots in my back.  Doctor did not explain what substance he was using nor the course of treatment.  Treatment ended when I received a phone call referring me to a chiropractor for pain relief with no explanation of why.  I returned each time he requested--oddly he gave me 4 shots of something within a 6 week period of time.   My back pain has been worse since this treatment.
