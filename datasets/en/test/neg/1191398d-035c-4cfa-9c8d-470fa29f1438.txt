Went in to get my radiator checked because it was leaking. Estimate came back at $911. $285 for labor, which would have been acceptable if they were charging a fair price for parts. For new radiator and fan, seal and hoses. I called my brother a mechanic and he said I was being gouged! Radiator $100, Fan assembly $110, tSeal, upper and lower hoses. Midas is charging double what this job should have cost! This should be a 2 hour job and they charge for 4 +. They over charged me for an oil change and I went on my way to get the work done elsewhere. I used to get my oil changed here religiously as its close to home. I won't be back! They charged me for the estimate, but were ashamed to leave their price tag on it!
