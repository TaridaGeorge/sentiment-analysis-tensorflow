We tried to call ahead to place an order (with a credit card) for dining in for more than an hour away.I explained we have small kids and they can get impatient and cry, and we didn't want it to be uncomfortable for other guests. Ashley told me they won't do it and refused, then told me the manager is unavailable. However, they do have carry out. I asked for the corporate number, of course she tells me there isn't corporate, and then starts to cut me off and be even more rude. After I ask for the owners name, she said she could do our call ahead order. Before she couldn't but now she can? What kind of policy is that?? We usually get takeout once a week... Sorry Nellos, you've lost another customer.
