No. No. No. No. and NO.

Ohhh Grimaldi's your yelp pictures look so good, but you were a disappointment to say the least. So again went here for dinner one night during MLB spring training. Definitely pizza place looking for sure and crowded, so we assumed it would be good. We sat outside, next to a group of obnoxious 12+ 40 year old wannabe 20 year old women plus one dude. They kept referring to their one lesbian looking friend as "Justin", which was pretty funny because she did actually look like Justin Beiber.

Our waitress was really nice, but the food took like 40 minutes to get out to us and all we really ordered was pizza and a salad. Their white pizza, absolutely disgusting. No flavor. Too flat. Dry. EW.

Definitely not coming back here...
