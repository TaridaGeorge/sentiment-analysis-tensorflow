I've lived here 3 weeks and it's appalling to live here. I tried to look past all the little issues because it was a decent apartment in a nice area until it rained and my apartment smelled like cat pee. I complained to the apartment from my move in that the carpet is nasty and after I complained this time their contracted carpet people say it's my fault because the people THEY hired see no issue so at this point I have to deal. STAY AWAY!!!!
