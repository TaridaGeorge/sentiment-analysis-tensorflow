Everything at Fuchsia reminded me of my dream bedroom when I was 11; pick, tacky and frilly. I went there for facial and massage; hoping to find a new local place for regular primping.  The facial was quite good, and I was looking forward to my massage. 

Sadly, the massage was painful. I complained during and afterwards, and didn't feel the staff responded in an effective manner. Overall it was a poor experience, that I don't intend on repeating.

I would never return; there are too many salons and day spas to consider even trying them again.
