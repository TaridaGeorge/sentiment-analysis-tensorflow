First time trying the place. Had my doubts and my doubts were right. Cute place, cute menu but god awful food. Started off with potato crunchers (jalapeno like poppers) $4.99 those were good but the food didn't make up for the poppers. Ordered the honey fried chicken (8.99) which comes with: carrots, side salad (horrible), cornbread (inedible) and french fries (good). Husband had chix fried steak. BLECH!!! that's all I can say. I really liked the carrots and though they were the bet part of the meal. Let's just say don't waste your time.
