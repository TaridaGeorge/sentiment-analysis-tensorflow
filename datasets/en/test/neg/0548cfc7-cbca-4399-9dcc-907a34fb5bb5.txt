First time here and I will try to remember it is a sports bar and it is a bit close to the burbs for us but "Groupon" reeled us in.

 Just ordered apps (rings and fingers). Atmosphere is definitely sports bar flat screens everywhere.  Live band the night we were there (Fri Aug 19). 15 minutes for appetizers they better be good...  Such a let down.
