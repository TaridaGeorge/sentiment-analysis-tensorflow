What a shithole.

I came to watch some MMA fights in the parking lot of this sad establishment. The parking lot was a secret garden compared to the inside.  After a few cocktails by the ringside my girlfriends and I didn't want to use the port-a-potty so we went inside to use their restrooms. It was disgusting, everything was filthy and run down. There was a hallway you had to cross from the bingo room to the casino, the hallway wreaked of urine, like people had been pissing in there for years.  My buddy tried to get me some free stuff for my birthday from the casino and I told him to forget it, I didn't want to touch anything in there. 

Never again.
