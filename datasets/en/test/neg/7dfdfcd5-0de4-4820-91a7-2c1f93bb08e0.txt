If this is the Post Office on the corner of Bell Rd. and Parkview Pl. In Surprise then this is about you. Put a hold on my mail via internet, got a confirmation as well as a yellow card left in my mail box indicating the hold was acknowledged. The yellow card left in my mail box indicated the accumulated mail was to be delivered at the ending date shown on the yellow card, 7/17/12. it is now 7/23/12 and I don't have my mail. All attempts to call this Post Office have failed because they will not answer their phones.


Update, received a call from the local post office holding my mail, at 5:45 on 7/23, probably because of the call I made to the 800 number from the USPS.com website. The lady that called assured me my mail would be delivered today, 7/24. Guess what, no mail.
