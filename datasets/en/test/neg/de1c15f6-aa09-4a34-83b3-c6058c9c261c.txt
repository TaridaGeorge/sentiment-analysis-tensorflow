if you are a non smoker be prepared to be a smoker, they smoke right outside the door on the patio, the staff & smoker patrons will not let you keep the door closed & if you try  you will be verbally assaulted. You are forced to breathe their carcinagins. Finding a new place to go. It is also very loud even with ear plugs.
