No.  Just.... no.

I should have just turned around when I arrived and there was already a police cruiser parked outside.  At 10 pm.

One side is country-karaoke, the other is a hip-hop room, and it all sucks.  I would have given it two stars for the sheer entertainment factor but the bathroom was covered in vomit.  Plus, I'm pretty sure some chick was snorting something in the stall next to me.
