Wow, as I was going through my reviews I found that someone had deleted my review for over easy..i thought they could not do that.. My whole review focused on the owner and how I saw him in line at safeway buying cheap store brand lunch meat huge packages of it..and how he wears shorts and crocs..i mean cmon buy some pants and real shoes..you have some pretty bad reviews.. Own up and stop buying safeway brand lunch meats..some og your most loyal customers have not returned..
