My flight was cancelled and I was given a room here for free.  The staff was busy and trying to be efficient and we were tired.  We were given a room as far from the front desk as you can get and after having walked there, the room had not been cleaned, unmade beds and such.  We went back to the office and I asked for a complaint form, they didn't have any and they didn't know how to record a complaint.  They gave us a room closer and it only smelled dirty and there was only a small wad of hair in the shower.
Yuck!!@!!
