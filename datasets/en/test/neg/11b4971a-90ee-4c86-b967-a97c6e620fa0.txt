OK, so what if it's an authentic 1950s ice cream parlor? The stuff they're scooping up is boring major brand-name label ice cream full of air, and the toppings are nothing special? And the wallpaper is dirty and faded? And the carnival-esque decor is kinda creepy, unfortunately like some of the elderly clientele who sit here staring sadly off into space as their ice cream sodas melt away? You can almost imagine the opening scenes of a tear-jerker Lifetime movie set here. That's not good.
