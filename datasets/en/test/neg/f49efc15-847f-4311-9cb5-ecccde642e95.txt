Wow. I've never been to such a slow fatburger. I ordered a burger and fries - no one in line, and 1 burger in process ahead of me, and it took more than 30 minutes. I don't think the cook was aware you can start another order while one was on the grill.
  The quality was standard Fatburger - it's a chain.
  Don't come unless you have lots of time.
