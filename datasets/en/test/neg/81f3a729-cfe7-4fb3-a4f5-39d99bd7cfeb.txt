After reading the other Yelp reviews we decided to give them a try.  I made the mistake of taking all of our dry cleaning instead of just taking a few things as trial run.  My wife had 3 expensive cardigans that all came back faded and pilly.  My wife had spilled on an expensive dress at a wedding we attended, and when I dropped off the dress the women was very nice and placed tape on the stain.  Unfortunately, the stain was still there when we got everything back.  All in all, with my wife's delicate dry cleaning it was a very poor experience.

I have to go back tomorrow to pick up my dress shirts.  Hopefully they will turn out better.
