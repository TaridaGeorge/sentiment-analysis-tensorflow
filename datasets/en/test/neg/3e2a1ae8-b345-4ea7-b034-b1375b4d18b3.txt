Well... where do I begin...

The parking lot is INSANE. 

The atmoshphere is good, open kitchen, which was fun watching the chefs. 

The employees were great, friendly, and knowledgeable. 

The food... not so much. We started off with the chicken meat balls. Had no taste, and had way too much of some herb. I had the petite chicken as my dinner. This dish as well, had no taste. It was nothing special. For $16.00, I hoped it would have been amazing. Will not be back. This place is just too expensive for the lack of taste it offers.

On a side note.. if you bring in your own birthday cake... they charge you $1.00 per slice. WHAT!! Yes boys and girls... THEY charge YOU $1.00 PER SLICE of your OWN birthday cake YOU bring in.
