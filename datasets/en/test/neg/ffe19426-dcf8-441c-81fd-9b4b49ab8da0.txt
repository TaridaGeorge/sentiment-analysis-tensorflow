Had the filet. It was.. Well nothing to write home about. My friend said no mushrooms, but guess they didn't see the note. Our server was good. But the other staff who kept coming to the table and interrupting our conversation ... Drove me crazy!!  I mean really!!! The manager/ floor supervisor whatever it was, just too much. Trust your servers that they know how to do their job!!!  Once we paid then we really got to talk without getting the '"is every thing good here??" Every 5min!! I have been in the biz for a LONG time and if I had to deal with this kind of work place I would scream!!
 Food was ok. Server was good. The place Dark. It would be a great "bar" kinda place but not for dine in. I wouldn't go back.
