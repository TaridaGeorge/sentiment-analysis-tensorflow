I have had 2 bad experiences here and both were similar. There were several open tables and we waited 30 minutes+ each time, I don't think the pretentious tone of the hostess helped our mood. The wait staff was slow on both occasions and the food was very mediocre compared to the other options of similar genre in the area (on both occasions the food was luke warm and we ordered based on the wait staffs suggestions). I have a feeling that if we had sat outside I would have had a little better experience however it would not have made up for the eh food and poor service. Good spot for drinks though if that is what you are interested in.
