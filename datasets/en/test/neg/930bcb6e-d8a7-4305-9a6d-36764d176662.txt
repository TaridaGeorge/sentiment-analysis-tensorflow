Had an issue with cross-contamination of foods on the Teppanyaki grill, which caused me to get e-coli. I was very sick the night after. 

I had the steak and shrimp. My steak was cooked next to someone's chicken. Additionally, the steak was very cold when it was served to me. 

When I spoke with friends about my experience, they told me that they either had the same issues or knew of others who got ill. 

My suggestion is to go to Benihana instead if you are craving Teppanyaki style Japanese cuisine
