Odd menu, poor choices, poorly presented. The way the food is served is strange, they give you the cooked meat, with the flavor (sauce) on the side. Good rice. I was disappointed with the menu it is very limited as far as Asian restaurants go. They have no side dishes... I mean really? What is a Chinese dinner without a few side dishes? Comfortable dining room and a nice bar. The service was marginal, the  waiters seemed confused and not familiar with the menu, even as small as it is. They scrambled and wanted to charge me for a 13 dollar dinner, just because I wanted a side of noodles. I will not go back. Disappointing if you are used to really good Chinese food. To sum it up... find another place!
