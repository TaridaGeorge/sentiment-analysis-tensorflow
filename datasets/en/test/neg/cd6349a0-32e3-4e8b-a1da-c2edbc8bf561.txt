We love going to the Lolos at the downtown location but had a really bad experience at this one.
We were around the area and was craving fried chicken so we though we'd stop by. This location is completely different from the downtown location. There is no service here. After being seated, we waited a while to get our drink order and after the drink order no one came by to take our order. There was 3-4 staffs behind the counter and 2 staffs on the floor and no one seemed to give a crap. After waiting for  over 10 mins (which is really long when you're starving already) we decided to walk out of the restaurant and go somewhere else.
