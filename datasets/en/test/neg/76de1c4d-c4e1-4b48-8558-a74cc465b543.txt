While eating in the restaurant, I saw one of their employees yell at two customers (who looked to me like professional women) and refused to sell them the cake they had picked out.  I called to report this to a manager, and it turns out it was the owner who had thrown them out.  She said they had made a rude comment about her to an employee, but I didn't see that, just her coming out from the back with the cake, refusing to write on it or sell it to them.  She told them she didn't need their business.  Very strange!
