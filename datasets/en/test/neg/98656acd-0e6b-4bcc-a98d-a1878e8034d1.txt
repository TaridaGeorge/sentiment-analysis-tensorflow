Played the Wigwam golf courses during my stay in the valley.  They are by far in the worst condition I have ever seen a course.  The locals have nicknamed it The Pigwam, and members I spoke to are outraged by the new ownership/management's apparent lack of interest in the courses conditions.  The greens were not puttable, punched and sanded but not rolled or cut.  Very little grass in the fairways, and the rough is nothing but weeds of varying heights.  One of the courses is so wet, mowers and golf carts have left huge tire ruts in the muddy rough.  Tree limbs down for days.  Grass growing in all the bunkers.   Large areas of dirt around the greens.  I played several other courses in the valley during my stay, and all were near pristine, with only minor seasonal issues.  Save your money and play elsewhere.
