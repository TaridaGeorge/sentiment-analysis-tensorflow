The location really hurts this theater (being in a mall).  2 things will be guaranteed with this experience: Crowds and Kids.  Things that can ruin any cinematic experience.

Additional tip: Assuming it's because of the mall location, but this Harkins Theater charges more than the others...  It's true.
