Horrible service!  The food was mediocre.  Waiter was rude and acted like we were inconveniencing him.  The place wasn't even that busy for a friday night and he acted like it was slammed.  To top it off he added the gratuity right into our bill, and we were only a table of 2!  Will not be going here again!
