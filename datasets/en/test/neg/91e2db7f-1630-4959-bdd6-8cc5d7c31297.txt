If I could I'd give zero. 

Came to this store with a question about a part. 
The book they had only featured  models until 2009 (we have a 2011) so that was useless. 

We waited to get help for 20 minutes. No one helped us. However, someone was there to answer the phones, help people in the parking lot & 2 employees doing things in the back (yet visible from the front). 

We were going to purchase additional things as well but left empty handed due to the lack of being helped. 

Off to Pep Boys we go thanks to the recommendation of a customer in the parking lot.
