Do I HAVE to give this place a star to post a review?  Maybe .01 rounds up to 1 in yelp math . . . ?

Flat out, the place smells like ass . . . and not in a good way.  There's this sour smell . . . not quite dumpster juice, but in the same ballpark.  Maybe the bar was built on an indian sewage plant?  The wings were ok, but unless somebody else was driving and I was incredibly drunk, I can't see myself ever going there again
