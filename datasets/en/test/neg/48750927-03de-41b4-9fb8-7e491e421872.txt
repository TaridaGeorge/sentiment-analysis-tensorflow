Well we came in with high expectations and left under-whelmed....
First off, it seems as if most of the food is reheated, yeah this happens but really seems to be the case here.  Then there was the greens and they were simply way too spicy.  Now don't get me wrong, we like spicy food, but we like to taste the food as well and the 1st time we mentioned it, "I actually season my greens for flavor..." was the reply when asked how we liked it.  The real issue was upon our departure was when we were asked again about how we liked it, we offered an honest opinion and again advise about the heat level of the greens "Our people season to flavor...."  

Sorry last visit to Fitzi's with a comment like that.  Completely uncalled for and the food (and relative higher cost) not worth it.
