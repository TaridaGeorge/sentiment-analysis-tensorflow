We were at Lee Lee's market and decided to get boba drinks. I ordered passionfruit to try something different. The flavor was very artificial and the drink was very watery. I went back to get a different drink and the girl at the counter tried to charge me for another drink. I asked why they would not just replace the drink with a different flavor and she responded with a smirk that it was my fault because I ordered it. That is extremely poor customer service. I am bummed about this experience, because we have always gone to this place for boba and had never experienced this kind of treatment before. I think the girl was the owner's daughter. As I was being refused, the owner walked behind her, grinned, did not do a thing. Businesses do not succeed with this type of behavior.
