Went for extreme bowling on a Saturday!

1. The place looks trashy and dirty - inside & out! 

2. Other than the Extreme fee of $16.00, even though I had my own shoes & socks. I was charged an additional $4 for socks with no explanation or refund from the manager.

Safety issue - if you bowl here and have difficulties with seeing in the dark, remember to step up on to the bowling platform. They have no colored tape/paint that there is a step up.

I will not be returning!
