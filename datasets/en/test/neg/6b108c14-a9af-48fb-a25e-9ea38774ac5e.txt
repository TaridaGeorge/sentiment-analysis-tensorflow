This is THE WORST Mcdonalds in the history of Mcdonalds. The fries are ALWAYS cold and old and same goes with chicken nuggets. None of the crew members speak English and if they do they are all very rude and don't know how to say hi or thank you or even have a great day. I actually drive 5 minutes to another Mcdonalds just because this one sucks so bad ( btw- I live next door to this one ). Please, do not come to this Mcdonalds.
