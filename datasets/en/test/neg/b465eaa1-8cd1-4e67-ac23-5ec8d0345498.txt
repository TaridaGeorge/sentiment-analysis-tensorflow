My jaw just dropped to see that this place even has 3 stars! I just got home from eating at this place and I still feel disgusted. 

Dear yelper friends, I tried, I seriously tried to give this place a chance. Especially after I paid $12.00 for a Sunday lunch! Sadly, every single item I tried was absolutely awful! Everything including the most basic foods like mac & cheese and fried rice were tasteless and stale. 

I hardly ever write reviews but the humanitarian in me just needed to warn everyone: you will instantly regret eating here! Run away!
