The service was non-existent and when someone did come to our table she asked to take our order but failed to give us menus!!! WTF!  We complained to the manager whose command of the English language was lack luster.  We couldn't understand what he was saying and wasn't sure he understood what we were saying.
Overall it was the worst restaurant experience I'd ever had.   The vibe in the store was strange too - like the place is filled with hate, anger and misery.
4 waitresses came out to sing happy birthday but none of them would come over to take our order.  We sat there, they all sang and walked away.
All I can say is there's something terribly wrong with this RR location.
