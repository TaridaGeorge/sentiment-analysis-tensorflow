Seriously.  What kind of restaurant doesnt have child seats?  I didnt stay for the food because they didnt have them.  Just looking at the place makes me think it would be a lovely place to have lunch with my other mommy friends.  After reading most of the other reviews, I guess I should consider myself lucky that I didnt spend the money.
