Stay away! They do an alright job on the car wash but leave a lot of streaks and don't do a through job on the inside of the car.  The reall kicker is they took two Harkins loyalty cups and the free refill popcorn bag.  We went from the car wash to the movies and it wasn't until then we discovered our stuff was missing. I mean really what a sad thing to take. Stay away from these dishonest people.
