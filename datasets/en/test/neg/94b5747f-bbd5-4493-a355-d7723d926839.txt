What a nightmare. Moved us into a filthy rental, with tons of repairs needed (90% of which would have been found if they'd inspected the property). HOA dues are in arrears as well, so we cant get pool keys, which is why we rented this house. Nathan has spent the last two weeks telling one lie after another and finally today, Tom Caldwell let us know all of this is "common" and apparently this is how Brewer Caldwell does business. STAY AWAY!
