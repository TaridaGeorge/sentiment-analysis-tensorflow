Sorry, after 4 days of horrid food poisoning I need to drop them to 1 star... or actually no stars.  I'm confident it was the improperly prepared Cobia that left me hunkered down in the bathroom for nearly a week.  I suggest they stick to fish that is easy to prepare and turns quickly... salmon, tuna, etc...
