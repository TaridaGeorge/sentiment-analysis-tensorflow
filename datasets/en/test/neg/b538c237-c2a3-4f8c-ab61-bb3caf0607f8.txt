By far the worst place I've ever eaten. Selection and quality is horrible. Sushi was like rubber. They had store bought pound cakes and cookies for desert. The salad bar consisted of lettuce, cheese, croutons with your choice of dressing. Everything I tried was not good. Guess we'll head to burger king after paying our $22 bill for 2 buffets of disgustingness. Seriously, do not waste your money!!!
