Nice atmosphere. BAD service!

It took them 15 minutes to even recognize that we were there. 35 minutes to be exact from the time we sat down to the time someone took our order. This was just after lunchtime, and the place was only about a third full.

Food was very slow to come out. When it did come out, it was not worth the wait. I had the "Sliders", described on the menu as "Mini burgers topped with double-thick cheddar". What it actually was, was four small burnt pieces of burger, on lightly toasted buns, with a cheese slice. They were so dry and burnt it was unbelievable.

Had to ask two different people for ketchup, three times. In the end it was easier to go hunting for it myself.

I would not eat here again, shame as the place looks nice.
