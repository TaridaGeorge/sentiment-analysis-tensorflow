You know when everyone seems to love something, but then you experience it for yourself and it's very anticlimactic? Well, that's how I feel about this joint. I just don't get it. It's so average, nothing special. Still people rave like they're having an orgasm.

I'm sure this will sound like am an elitist, but I guess if your only options were Burger King, Wendy's, or McDonalds this place might deserve 3 stars.
