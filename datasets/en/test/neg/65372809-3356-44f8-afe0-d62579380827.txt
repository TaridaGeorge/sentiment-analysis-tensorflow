Pretty disappointing.  Had nail polish all over fingers and toes, didn't cut nails or cuticles.  Supposed to get massage with what I paid for but it was bad.  nails were smudged but she didn't fix them and she didn't know how to do gel. I almost cried because I had wasted 2 hours of my life when I could have done them better at home.  Please don't waste your time.  I wish someone had warned me.
