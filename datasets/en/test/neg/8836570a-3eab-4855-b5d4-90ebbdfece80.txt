I hate to be a downer on all these night clubs so far but that whole section (axis, myst, crown room, PCL, Suede) is all crap. 

I can't imagine ever going here again.

People are rude, snobby, fake, the guys all have some kind of entitlement issues, the chicks are getting wasted, loud and obnoxious, and this place especially houses a lot of creepy guys.  I've never gone there and not been sexually harassed in one way or another.  

I've never once had a good time at PCL.  The only times I've gone is because I've been forced to.  Kicking and screaming most likely. 

One day I'll write a positive review on a few clubs I *do* enjoy but I've been feeling especially groggy today LOL
