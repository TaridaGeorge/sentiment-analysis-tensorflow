Brand new car. Been here three times. No mas.

Pushy up selling, third party vendors selling stuff at front door, cash register personnel asking for donations du jour.  The place reeks of scam. I feel like I need a wash after doing business here.

Detailer during hand wash broke the cargo cover but didn't say anything.

Next visit - dirt and debris not completely vacuumed from cargo area.

Last visit, last straw? Scratches on front hood - they appear to be due to someone using a dirty cloth. I cannot reasonably attribute the scratches to anyplace else.
