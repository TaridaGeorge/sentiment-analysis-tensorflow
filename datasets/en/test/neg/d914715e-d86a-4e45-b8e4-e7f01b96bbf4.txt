How does IHOP mess up breakfst? Like no service. Place is run down-outdated. I sat 25-30 mi- till the waitress said the computrr went down..lost my order. Shld've walked out. Re-ordered-waited 10 more min. Food delivered cold - waffle,  sm. portion eggs, wierd texture, 2 strips cold fatty bacon! Stomach ache.MANY places + service have lost it--is it just not getting the customers? No apology or thanks. Not worth it.
