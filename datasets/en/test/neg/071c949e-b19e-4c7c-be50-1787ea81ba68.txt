Total rip off for a car wash. Saw a $15 off offer on the Internet to get a discount on a car wash after purchasing gas. Purchased $50 in gas and then wanted to spend more on a car wash to get my carpets cleaned. They wouldn't give me my $15 discount then after filling up my tank with their already inflated gas prices. No wonder there is not a lot business here with people washing their cars on the weekend.
