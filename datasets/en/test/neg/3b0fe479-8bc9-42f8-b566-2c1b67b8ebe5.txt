Cummings took over the company that we originally used, and since they have taken over we have had nothing but problems.

I haven't seen a single bug in years in my house and as soon as we started using Cummings we've found a bug almost every single day and not just 'bugs' but cockroaches. I called Cummings to ask them about why this was happening and the receptionist was extremely rude saying they didn't do anything wrong. I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone. 

Needless to say I will be finding a new pest control company today.
