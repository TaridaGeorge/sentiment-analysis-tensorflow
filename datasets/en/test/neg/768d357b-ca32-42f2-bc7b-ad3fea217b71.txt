This place reminded me of something you would find along a truck stop driving cross country.  When I walked in, I expected a sports bar of course, but it wasn't a clean, cool, or well dressed scene.  

The food is okay, what do you expect from a sports bar?  Its pretty hard to mess up hamburgers and french fries.  

I would expect it to be just a little bit nicer and cooler to attract a crowd that doesn't resemble a trailer park.  The one on via-de-ventura is a lot better and cleaner.
