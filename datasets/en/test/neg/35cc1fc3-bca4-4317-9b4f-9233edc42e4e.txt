The location is pretty good. There are plenty of games for the kids to play.  BUT, the food was terrible.  I wasn't expecting much, but it didn't even deliver "just ok".  The management needs to step up their game.  There were bad grapes mixed in with good ones.  And the salad looked old.  I know, we took the kids there for the pizza, but not even that was good.  I'd at least give this place two stars, but the employees were lazy and a lot on the rude side.  It's almost as if they were saying, "We know you're still going to bring your kids here because your kids ask for it."  If we had been at an adult restaurant and were treated the way we were here, we would have walked out.
