Yes, Abu J.. I will elaborate. Just for you.

$6 burger Fail .. you probably cost 35Â¢ to make and you were cold.
Soggy french fries Fail .. How do you F up fries? Srsly.
Sprite lacking Co2 Fail .. It is NOT hard to reattach a new tank.
Customer Service Fail  .. I don't appreciate being scowled at while handing over money.

And honestly, I never liked this place.. its crap IMO.
