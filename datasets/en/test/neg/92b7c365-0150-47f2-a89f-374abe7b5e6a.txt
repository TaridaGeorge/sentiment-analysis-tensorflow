We went there a year and a half ago and the food and service were great.

Tonight was a different story.

Chips were half full of broken ones on the bottom.
Service was indifferent and half-hearted.
Food was just OK, if you think that a soggy Chimichanga should have the texture of a burrito and you really, really like salt.
Ran out of water. Never refilled.
Ran out of chips. Never refilled.
Table not bused until the waiter needed a place to put the check.

I noticed that they add a 20 percent gratuity for parties of 6 or more. Thankfully, we were only three. Normally I tip well even for bad service, but not for bad food AND bad service.
