Nice looking place, but my last stay was an abomination. They up sold me a suite, when all I wanted was a regular room. They said there were not available. I later found out that they lied. The front desk was rude.
I had to wait 3 hours to check in. The waits for the restaurant were long and the pool bar was empty because the bartenders were ignorant and betting on football games.
