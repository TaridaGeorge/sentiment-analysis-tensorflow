Absolutely horrid!! We ordered here because of a flier on our door and they deliver. The main dishes were ok, it's hard to mess up sweet and sour and teriyaki. The fried rice was the worst I've ever had, I can't believe they even choose to send this out. The crab puffs were hard and soggy at the same time and the filling was just Philadelphia cream cheese alone. The eggs rolls had a tolerable texture but were almost bitter in taste. After waiting for over an hour for delivery this meal was terribly disappointing! We will never order here again!!
