Eh, it was okay but overpriced.  The food was passable.  The service was bad.  I saw her smiling and being friendly with others, just not us.  Maybe she is relying on being cute to make up for her lack of manners.  She would not give my fellow diner a fork, the bus boy heard the request denied and gave him one.  He was a tad miffed, and I was outright pissed.  But hey, it's her restaurant, if she wants to be a jerk about it, then I'll go elsewhere.  And I will.  To seal the deal, I read their Maricopa County Health Services report, GROSS.  Cyclo, you're dead to me.
