I wouldn't know what the food is like because we were ignored for 15 minutes and my 3 and 5 year old children were antsy, hungry and thirsty so we left.  We went inside and sat at the counter. There were four other people in the big dining area, the register/ server man didn't even look at us. It was rude and I will never go back.
