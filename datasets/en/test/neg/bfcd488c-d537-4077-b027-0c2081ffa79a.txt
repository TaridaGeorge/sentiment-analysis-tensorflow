WATCH OUT FOR THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!  They told me I needed work done that I didn't!!  And they tried to take advantage of me, knowing that I don't know anything about cars.  The guy was smiling as he told me I needed $900 worth of repairs!!  Luckily my son's father is a mechanic and he took a look at my car instead (They weren't so nice when they realized they weren't going to get my business).  The repairs I needed done were less than $150!  

It's places like this that give shops bad reputations!!!!!!!!!
