Decided to try out this one for breakfast with some out of town guest.  Hummmmm...  Definitely overpriced!!!  A two egg breakfast was $20 ... Four for breakfast was $80 and one in my party did not even eat we shared a fruit plate... Definitely not worth the money and since we were the only table in the dining room you would have expected the service staff to be falling over each other to wait on our table... NOT.  Don't think i will be returning and will not recommend to anyone else... Good Luck!
