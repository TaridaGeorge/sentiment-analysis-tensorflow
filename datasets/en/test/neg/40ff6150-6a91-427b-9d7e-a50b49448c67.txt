Dear nothin'-native about New York. You suck.
Your pizza is gross and never thoroughly cooked (ie: the crust is doughy and thin), your chicken" strippers" are the size of a baby's thumb...(true story, I totally compared on a 6month old.)
Oh.... and did I mention the servers have a terrible attitude, and everything and anything is over-priced.
I ordered fried zucchini once (for 6 dollars) and I received 6 nickel-sized soggy things. Really? I could have gone to Carl's Jr's 4 times and been more satisfied, and I don't even like fast-food.
Heed my warnings; this place is a total waste.
The only thing that is vaugly redeeming is the trivia game system, however; Buffalo Wild Wings has the same thing and you wont feel robbed after leaving.
