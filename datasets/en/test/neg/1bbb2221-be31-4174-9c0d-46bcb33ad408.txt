Been to a lot of Denny's and this is easily the worst of them all.  The biggest beef was seeing our food waiting for easily 10 minutes under the warmer before being delivered to us. The service was slow even though the restaurant was nearly empty. The food was luke warm (no surprise sitting under the warmers), pancakes were crusty on top (no surprise sitting under the warmers), waitress never refilled drinks, and we had to ask for the bill. Overall disappointing experience. I'll be happy to get back my favorite Denny's in San Jose, CA.
