I want to thank Tempe Feed for giving me a difficult time in there store and asking me to leave. I was talking to co-workers and was told to try PET CLUB on McClintock, and being new to the area I had a plesant experiance there. All natural foods, and a big selection. I was surprised that Arthur didn't have Natalie C. get PUPPY food that has DHA in it for optimal nourishment for the brain for a smarter more trainable puppy, as explained to me at the Pet Club.
