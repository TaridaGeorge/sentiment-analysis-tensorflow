Terrible. That's all there is to it. That and the incorrect information they're totally willing to hand out. I called and asked if they did eyebrow threading, was told that yes they did, went in a couple hours later and was promptly told that they didn't do that there and maybe I should check at the mall. So I decided to get them waxed anyway. When I went to pay, the woman told me the waxing was 8 dollars. Then, after running my card and handing me a receipt she told me about the 2 dollar charge for using a card. Which was something that would have been nice to know before she ran the card in the first place.

Would not go back or recommend.
