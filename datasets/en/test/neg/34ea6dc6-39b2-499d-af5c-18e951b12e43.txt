Decided to try out the shooting range with my daughter since we both grew up with guns and took several training classes there with a retired cop...I will never go there again...never been treated so rudely by one of the rangers. Instead of talking to someone at a normal level, he would scream at you and talk down to you like you were a complete MORON.. Constantly trying to start an arguement. Several  people actually left due to the way he was treating people.  All the other rangers that were there were very friendly but due to this one guard we will never shoot at  this range again. By far the absolute worse. I recommend shooting elsewhere!!!!!!!!
