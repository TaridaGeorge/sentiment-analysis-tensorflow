Horrible service almost an hour to get our food.  NO discount on our food, but yet the manager had no problem sitting at the counter eating his pot roast.  Not once came by to apologize or comp food.  Complained to corporate office and got a generic all purpsoe email.  Umm yeah about the $25 I blew for bad service, cold food, and attitude.  I was starting to turn my attitude about Denny's thinking they were doing better but they proved they aren't.  THings happen, but when the corporate office can't even call to apologize that is saying we don't care.
