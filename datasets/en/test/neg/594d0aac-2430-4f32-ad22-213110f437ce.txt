I feel sad to say this...because I know it is locally owned by a small family...but yucko!  I went there to lunch hesitantly, but my friend wanted to go there.  

The place felt old and dirty, too big for too few people and too quiet.

I had the egg salad sandwich.  It was bland and boring and served between two slices of stale white bread.

My friend got a chicken salad and I could tell it was disgusting...she barely made her way through it.

The ice tea was ok....but it was really disappointing and I fear it is on it's last leg unless some changes are made:(
