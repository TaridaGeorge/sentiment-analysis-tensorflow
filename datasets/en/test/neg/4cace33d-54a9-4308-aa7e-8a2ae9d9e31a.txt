For  a place that specializes in breakfast, omelets in particular, they were TERRIBLE!!! Be ready for a giant lukewarm pan sized egg scramble placed on top of your cold fillings and if cheese is one of the fillings, it will be placed on the top of the flat egg thing, not melted. If you want a good breakfast for a lot less money go to Randy's on Chaparral Rd (cash only). Skip this place for a breakfast, you'd make a better one at home, save your money. Service was not great either, the waitress was looking for fast turn over and must not realize she gets tipped on her service. Was here on a Friday, 10-1030 am. Never going back.
