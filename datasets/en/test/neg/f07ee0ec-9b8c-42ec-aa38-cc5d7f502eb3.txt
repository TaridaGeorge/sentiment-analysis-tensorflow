The terrible egg.....

Our food came out cold, dry , and, BURNT!

The waitress acted offended that we asked for  a new plate... I told them I will eat it regardless because, I was dead hungry (AND pregnant I'll eat anything)

Manager was kinda a you know what when we nicely explained to her the problems... She did bring us more potatoes though even know we said no..... Surprisingly they came hot and not burnt... Not hard to do things right the first time....;


She said she'd take care of the bill for us.. Cool.... She came and handed the reciept to me.... 13.00.... For two people knocked off a whooping 7.00 (When both of our plates were 10+) and I dont mind paying it but, i didn't eat it! come on now lady!
