Reached home with my order and it was the opposite of what I requested.  Called them and they simply told me that I ordered wrong.  I paid good money for something I could not eat.  Since when is chicken and a bowl full of white rice Teryaki Lite...  Ok, no time to go back - as they were not going to make it right anyway.  Tried to eat it... Chicken was dry as cardboard, and rice was a sticky mess.  Never again.

Save your money.
