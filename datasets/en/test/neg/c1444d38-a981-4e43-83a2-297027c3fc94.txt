We went to US Egg today & it was terrible! The place was packed, which made it excessively noisy. The service was very slow, and when our food finally arrived, half of our group was given a cold meal. My friend ordered bacon and it was so badly undercooked that it was inedible. I requested that the chef substitute bacon for the ham in my breakfast burrito, and they got it wrong and left the meat out completely.  We were very disappointed with the experience, and we we will not be back. I think this is a place that does not function well when they have a full restaurant all morning.
