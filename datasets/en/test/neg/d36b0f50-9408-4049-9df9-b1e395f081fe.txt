Burger seemed like Costco food. The burger was dry and not appealing to eat, we thought it was going to be a cool little joint like scrambles next door but it was disappointing with the poor seating area, and EXTREMELY loud tv. The produce was old and I didn't like that the cashier made my food. I hated the cheap pre measured fries... If I'm paying that much for a burger I should get more fries than a hand full.
