This is the one of the most overrated place in town.  The vegetarian sandwhich is terrible.  I've given it three chances:  I tried it while I was drunk, I tried it for lunch on a weekday, and on a weekend afternoon.  The bread is horrendous and the flavor combination is far too random.  People who don't care about good bread might like it.  The bread is terrible.  It's like fat wonder bread.  I do like their drink specials.

I think they stay in business because U of A alums like to reminisce about their days in Tucson.
