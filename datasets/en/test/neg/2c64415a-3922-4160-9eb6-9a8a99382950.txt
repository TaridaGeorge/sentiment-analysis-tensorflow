After arriving it is a pain to get the rent a car because they are located off site, and you have cross a few lanes of traffic to get to the bus pick-up. Every time I have flown in there have been long lines for the bus. Ride is about 10 minutes and if you don't get GPS you have to drive past terminals to return -- complete pain in the a**.

It is also very confusing to get picked up due to door on each side of baggage claim.

On the return (outbound trip) security can be a pain when flying AA. They are in an old terminal (no Admirals Club) and there is no "premiere" line. After cleaning security there is only 1 sandwich shop and 1 crappy little bar.

The gates themselves are old and run down.

I do remember the SWA gates being nicer........
