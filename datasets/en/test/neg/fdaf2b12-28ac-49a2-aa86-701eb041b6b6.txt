Ordered from NYPD Pizza a few time here in our office. We are about 2 blocks away. It takes them over an hour to get us our pizza. They also charge a deliver fee which is fine but don't expect a huge tip when it takes over and hour to get our overpriced pizza. Well the driver wasn't too fond that we tipped him a few bucks on top of the delivery fee and stormed out of our office cussing and making a seen and drove off in a fit of rage. This is the second time this has happened from this same delivery guy. We called in to talk to the manager and he was nothing but rude and did nothing about the situation. We will not be ordering pizza from this place ever again!
