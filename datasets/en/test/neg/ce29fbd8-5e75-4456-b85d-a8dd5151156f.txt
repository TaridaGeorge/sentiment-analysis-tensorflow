Very disappointed with brunch here. I ordered the eggs benedict.  The eggs were overcooked (cooked all the way through, no running yolk), and they used very little hollandaise sauce. If a restaurant with the word "egg" in its name cannot make a decent eggs benedict, you know it's a bad restaurant.  The two other people I was with got different egg dishes and were similarly disappointed.   Needless to say, I will not be returning.
