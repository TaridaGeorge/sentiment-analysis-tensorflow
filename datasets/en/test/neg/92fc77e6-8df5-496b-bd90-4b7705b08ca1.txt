Dear US AIRWAYS, You caused delays, a financial burden and stress for a uniformed US Army infantryman coming home for Christmas. Your reason was not for weather, but because of a scheduling problem with staff. You told me your crew had "timed-out".  We not come to a satisfactory resolve and we are completely disappointed in your lack of respect of a solider who defends your right to operate a business in our great country. Shame on you!  Case: US-12MEYERS-M09N24-T2W
