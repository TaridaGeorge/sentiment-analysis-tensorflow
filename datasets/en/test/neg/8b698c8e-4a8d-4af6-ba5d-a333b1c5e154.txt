Terrible! Service was blatantly rude and unattentative, they encourage you to sign up for their email list and then when you inquire about the emailed advertisements they won't honor them. Happy hour menu has only 3 sushi rolls, they ran out of draft beers (which were on special or $3, then charged us $5 for the same beer in a bottle), food was so-so, and they charge a 5% tax per bill for dining in. This was my second trip and I am very unimpressed, will not be returning!!!
