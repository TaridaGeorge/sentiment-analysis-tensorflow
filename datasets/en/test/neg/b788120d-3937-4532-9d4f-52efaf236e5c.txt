I had the macaroni and cheese which was very good, but the server and hostess were so rude and slow that I'll never go back again.  We knew what we wanted right away and I asked if we could put in our meal order after he took our drink order (3 waters, please), and he straight up said, "No, I'll take your order after I bring your drinks."  SO rude.  Our server never came to check on us after we got our food.  We had been done with our meal for about five minutes and our server walked right by me, I looked at him and waved to him as he walked by to get the check and he completely ignored me.  I'll never ever go back.
