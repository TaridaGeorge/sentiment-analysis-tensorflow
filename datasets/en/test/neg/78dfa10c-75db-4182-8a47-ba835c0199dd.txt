I also purchased a voucher through livingsocial.  I had left several messages and finally got a call back but missed it.  The message left (@ 8pm) stated they were 'in the office now' and provided another number.  I called right away and received the same mailbox that you get when you call the number on the voucher.  I have now left several messages over the past few weeks on both numbers - still no return call.  I have contacted livingsocial to advise them that this business may no longer be active.
