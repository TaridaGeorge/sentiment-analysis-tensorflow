I hate this Dunkin Donuts. Every time I go through the drive thru they say the order back to me wrong, can't listen to how my order should be, and in general are just rude. One of their employees, unfortunately his name escapes me right now, is always lethargic, rude, and acts like he doesn't care at all about his job. Customer service needs to be a priority!
