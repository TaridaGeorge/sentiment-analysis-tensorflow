My mom and I just left this place. It was actually appalling. The woman who did my nails barely filed them, and didn't clean under my nails well at all, even when I was blatantly picking grit out in front of her. The result of this manicure was streaky nail polish that didn't fully cover my nails. My mom had cotton stuck to her polish, and her polish didn't start until a good chunk above her nailbed. The woman barely did anything with my cuticles. This is the worst manicure I have ever had, so needless to say, I will not be going back.
