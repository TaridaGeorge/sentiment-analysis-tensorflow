Just about everything that makes a coffee shop good is lacking here.

1) uncomfortable chairs (what the HELL!? Sure they look "cool" but they are really really are uncomfortable)
2) roasting beans inside which just REEKS
3) lack of a decent number of outlets for laptops

And for the coffee ... just middle of the road ...
