I had never been to this store's location in Scottsdale before Saturday. I have frequented the Biltmore location (and I'm a HUGE fan of their store & clothes). However, I will NEVER go back to the Bogota location because of the service/staff. The only people in the store who were getting good service or help were the snotty sales girl's friends. Not only were they unhelpful, but the sales girl actually insulted me to my face ("YOU're a size 2?" - YES, actually I am).....I walked out and went to the Biltmore location to spend several hundred dollars. 

I am a big supporter of luluemon's products and store....but avoid the Bogota location if you want any service or a good selection.
