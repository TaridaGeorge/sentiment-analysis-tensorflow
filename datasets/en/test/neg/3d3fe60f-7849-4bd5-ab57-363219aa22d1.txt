Went in on labor day 2011 at around 1:30pm with my fiance. Was told the kitchen was backed up TWO HOURS!!!! What the hell is up with that?? Who the hell do they have back there preparing the dishes?? That is a bunch a crap. If they can't handle being busy then they need to get outa the kitchen. Will never go back there. Very disapointed:(
