I have to say I went here based on these reports. I had acrylic nails done - pink and white . They were absolutely awful. The fake nail that they put on under the acrylic shows through as he didn't put the white down far enough. He cut me on 4 fingers while he was using the tool that takes off the acrylic. Totally bad experience. I would never go back here.
