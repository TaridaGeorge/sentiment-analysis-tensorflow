I've had WAYYYY better experiences. We chose this place based on their location to the Salt River Fields for Spring Training.

We called ahead of time to see if they could handle 3 pedicures & 1 manicure at the same time. They said "Yes, come on in." Um, no. There were only 3 ladies working, and one was already busy. What should have been a 45 minute trip to the nail place, ended up being an hour and half!

The ladies here are not friendly, and they are slow. My toes look like I could have painted them myself. They severely lack color options for regular polish and gel. The space is average -- clean and newer pedicure stations, but the seats were not very comfortable. I would not come back again nor recommend to a friend.
