The place was very small, with a cold feeling, The service was not good either, We ordered our food and about 3 other table of guest came in after us got thier food before us, and of course they left before us also, not sure why. They didn't seem to have enough help. The food was your normal Asian food, nothing special or that stood out. The fried rice on the lunch plate was just white rice with soy sauce, nothing else added. Prices were ok. $5-$8ish. I'm not going back because I wasn't happy with my experience at all. I give them a negative star!
