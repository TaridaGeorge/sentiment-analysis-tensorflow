TERRIBLE! Everything was either fried or so salty I could not even eat it. The atmosphere was nice, laid back and stylish but the food was not good. I got the tofu with veggies and brown rice and it was so salty I could even take more than 2 bites. We also the hummus and pita as an appetizer. The pita chips were FRIED and so greasy! I left with a stomach ache. Very disappointed. I came all the way from the bay area to try this place and will not recommend to vegan friends or anyone else. Sorry guys! Need to go with fresh local produce menu and help make vegans proud... help all people  eat healthy...not stuff them with fried processed food that will contribute to America's obesity problem. Good luck!
