Really?  One of the best Mexican restaurants?  This was recommended by a friend and maybe the friendship should be examined, or at least their taste.

Although they advertise take out, there is no take out menu. For those who wish to stop in for a quick lunch, there is no bar and you have to sit by yourself in a very large booth.  The atmosphere is stale and the service adequate. 

I ordered their burritto and enchilada with red sauce, rice and beans. It was heavy and greasy. Good food does not consist of drowning the dish with cheese and grease. My stomach was upset by the small amount I sampled. 

I will not visit Jordan's again.
