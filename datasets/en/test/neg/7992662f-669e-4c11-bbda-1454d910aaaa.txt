I wanted to like this place. I am always hesitant of the "downtown lunch places".  It is nice inside and the staff was very friendly and helpful.  The three cheese calzone was absolutely disgusting. No self-respecting restaurant should serve something that bad and be able to sleep at night.  

The pasta on other people's table looked good.  I may give them another chance and try that.  But if you are capable of something that awful, it makes you wonder.
