Never ever rent from Avis. This place had $609 of hidden fees that they not only refused to refund but were the most disrespectful and insulting customer service reps I have ever had the misfortune of meeting. Please just use someone else. I have e-mailed their customer service and will change my review if they manage to fix it and if the manager that insulted me manages to personally apologize to my satisfaction.
