This place is WAY OVERPRICED for such casual dining and not so great food. Rolls are extremely small, sashimi seemed like it had been sitting out and was served on a stinky bed of something that smelled like it had been rinsed in dirty sink water. there was no kids menu so we were charged $10 fora TINY teriyaki bowl that again was not very good. I could have got a better rice bowl from jack in the box. BTW this is the first review I have ever done on a restaurant but leaving this place left me SO disappointed I felt I needed to. I would never go there again.
