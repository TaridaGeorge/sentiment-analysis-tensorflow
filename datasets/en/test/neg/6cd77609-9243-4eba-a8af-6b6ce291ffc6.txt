I very rarely eat fast food, but I was craving some crunchy chicken goodness, with a biscuit and slaw. The only think awesome about the place? SPORKS (why haven't they ever become mainstream, the world may never know)! They were OUT of biscuits and dropped my change onto the pavement without offering to make it right. They may be right down the street from me... but I will be sure to stick to local mom and pop shops going forward.
