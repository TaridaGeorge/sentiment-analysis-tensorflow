We went to CCOM for two reasons: 1) we had a gift certificate. 2) we saw on "The Best Thing I Ever Ate" on Food Network.

I have no idea how it got that rating - while the food wasn't bad, it certainly wasn't the best thing I ever ate.  The portions were absolutely LAME!  Seriously - $9 for a sandwich that left me hungry.  The one they showed on Food Network actually had more than one layer of meat - not mine.  They MUST have paid Beau Macmillan a lot of money to talk highly about the sandwich - he even held his finger & thumb up to indicate how thick the sandwich was.

Read the rest of the reviews.  These guys are cashing in on the kitchy nature of the place - they're not earning their money!
