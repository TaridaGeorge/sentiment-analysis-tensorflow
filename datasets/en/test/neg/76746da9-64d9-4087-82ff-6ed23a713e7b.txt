We walked into a nice atmosphere.  The hostess was nice, and our waitress was great.  The food was not good, and not worth the money they are charging.  The appetizers made no sense with the offerings on each plate.  We have eaten at some of the best restaurants on the east coast, California, and New Orleans (Commander's Palace for example).  Cork's offerings are way over-priced.  The duck was so salty I couldn't eat it, and they took the entree off the bill.  My wife also complained about her entree being too salty, but they did not take her plate off the bill.  Sex discrimination?  Maybe.  One thing is for sure.  We won't be going back, and we won't be referring any friends here.
