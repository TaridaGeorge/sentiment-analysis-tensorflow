This place has potential, but it's so far away from it.  I've been once and that was enough. Like most other reviews have stated, the bar is small.  A friend and I decided to try WOB out on a Wednesday afternoon around 2pm; there were no seats available anywhere and we had to stand around in everyone's way until two bar seats freed up.  The selection here is amazing, but it's so overpriced!!! I had three bottled beers and paid over $20.00 before tip.  This place is a joke.
