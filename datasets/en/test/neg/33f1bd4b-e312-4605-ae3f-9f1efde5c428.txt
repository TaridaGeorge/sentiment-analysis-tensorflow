This place is definitely not closed. My friend just moved out of there last month. Maybe they had such bad reviews (like they do on Google http://maps.google.com/maps/place?hl=en&rlz=1G1GGLQ_ENUS260&um=1&ie=UTF-8&q=scottsdale+spring+apartments+review&fb=1&gl=us&hq=spring+apartments&hnear=scottsdale&cid=17923775598020519810&dtab=2&ei=9WzYS7a8HMGqlAfkzYSKBA&sa=X&oi=local_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAoQqgUwAA)  on Yelp they reported themselves closed to get rid of all their reviews.

Well Scottsdale Springs, you can run, but you can't hide from the people.
