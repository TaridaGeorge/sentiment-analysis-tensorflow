Much has changed in the two years since my initial review.  Apparently Nick's has decided to toss customer service out the window.  I should have known it would be a problematic visit when it took nearly 15 minutes to be acknowledged to put in our order.  Well, it only got worse.  After nearly 45 minutes of waiting, we realized that our food was never, ever going to arrive.  Ever.  Time to leave, and never come back.  Ever.
