We had the special roll for an appetizer, not bad but not great. Wife got the tempura bento box, it was ok but the batter was very thick. I had the Nabeyaki soup bowl, it contained two overcooked scallops, one mussel, one tiny crab leg (about the size of a crayon) and two mushy shrimp tempura. Soup was ok but a little too salty. Got the tempura ice cream and it was horrible, there was more batter than ice cream, just 3 gooey scoops. We told the waitress and she said they all come like that. Overall they are not quite on par with Tokyo Express. Not worth $55 for lunch without alcohol. Service was very slow even though there were not too many people there.
