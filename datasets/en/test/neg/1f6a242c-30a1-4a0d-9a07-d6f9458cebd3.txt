Wendy's new BREAKFAST blows!

I've never been a huge fan of Wendy's food, however seeing their big window sign of their new breakfast sandwiches drew me in.  My God they looked good!  And my God was I disappointed.  

I had a sausage biscuit with a kick ass looking buttermilk bun that was infused with syrup.  The meat was spicy (ala McDonnalds) but the rest was just yucky.  I highly recommend you skip Wendy's for breakfast.  Bummer.
