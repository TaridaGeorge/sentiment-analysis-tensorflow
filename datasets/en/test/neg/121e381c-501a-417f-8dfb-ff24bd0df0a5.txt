I bought a service package from these guys in 2011 with an expiration of mid 2013.  Now in January 2013 they decide they will no longer honor them.   If they offer you a warranty how do you know if they will honor it?  Take their word for it?  They don't even honor written expiration dates on their own coupons.  This is how they treat a loyal customer of 15 years, just think how they treat new customers.
