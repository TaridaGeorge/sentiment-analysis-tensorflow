We were with Monotronics for at least five years.  At first, everything was going good until we found out that for six months they were not receiving a signal from our home which means that if we had a true emergency such as burglary or panic button they would not receive the signal.

What tickles my elmo is that FOR SIX MONTHS they were not receiving an signal and not once they did call us yet they are supposed to be monitoring my system 24 hours 7 days a week ? 

Whatever !  We cancelled so beware of this company and any other company that promises to protect you and your home 24/7.
