You do get what you pay for!!!.  Had a convention in Scottsdale and wanted to find something more reasonable then the Scottsdale resorts.  Happened upon the Scottsdale Athletic Club and it looked great.  The price was slammin' so I encouraged a colleague and client to get reservations.
The rooms had all the charm of Motel 6.  I was really disappointed and embarrassed for my client.  Found myself saying I'm sorry over and over again.  
Hope I can save some fellow Yelpers from the same experience.
