Wow.  I don't think I've ever given a 1 before.  But this place deserves it.  Super Bowl Sunday.  We arrive and the place is probably 25-33% empty.  We are then informed that everything is by invitation.  Wouldn't have a problem with that, except that we looked at the website last week and again today, no mention of invitations.  Just around the block from us, and we were looking forward to finding a nice place to go on the weekends to watch games... we found it.  It was Babes on Shea, not this place.
