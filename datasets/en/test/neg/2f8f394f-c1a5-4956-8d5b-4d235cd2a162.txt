I'm a regular customer of Fair Trade and I usually have nothing but good to say about it. Just ten minutes ago, though, I stood at te counter for about five minutes watching one employee talk on her phone. When the second employee came out from the kitchen she returned to a plate of food. I have no idea what impression they think that produces in customers, but I left without being served and I wonder if I should ever return. I have no interest in patronizing a coffee shop that doesn't have a sense of customer service. I will think very hard about going back, which is too bad considering the many days I've spent there.
