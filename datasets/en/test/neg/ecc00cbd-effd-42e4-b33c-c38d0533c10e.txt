Absolutely, without a doubt, THE GROSSEST excuse for sushi I have ever attempted to consume...
Please, God, remind me the next time that I'm in a hurry and craving sushi, to head to the freakin grocery store!
The rice was oddly wet and smooshed down (I could barely detect that it was rice), the seaweed was mushy, wet and stringy, and my tempura shrimp roll was the size of a woman's fist. 
The whole experience (if one could call it that) was deplorable...
The woman did give me my money back after I took the slop up to the counter, but oh, my God, I can't get that foul taste out of my mouth....
What was I thinking?
