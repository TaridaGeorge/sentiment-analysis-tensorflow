Not a bad place as atmosphere goes, but the prices are way out of line. The beers are $5.00, Dr. Pepper's are $2.50 (no refills), and $8.00 per appetizer. You could go to a decent retaurant for dinner, and then out for less money. 

Skip it unless you just can't go out to a place that doesn't have a dart board.
