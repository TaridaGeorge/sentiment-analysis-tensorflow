We drove by on our way to Vegas.  We were hungry for breakfast so we popped in.  I had the scrambled eggs with toast and hash browns  There was so much grease on the plate it was shining.  My husband had the same thing I did and one hour after eating he felt sick.  Said he wished he never stopped here.  Denny's has a better breakfast and cheaper too.  All in all this place is a run down greasy spoon.
