I was very disappointed with our service at RA. We went in for happy hour on a weekday. There were very few people in the restaurant. We got a round of drinks and said we needed a minute to decide what we wanted. After waiting for a half hour for her to come back we finally flagged down another waitress and asked for the check. It then took almost 20 minutes to get the check! We were very upset and very hungry. It's the closest sushi place to my house, so I may try going again. I just hope they don't make a habit of completely ignoring their customers.
