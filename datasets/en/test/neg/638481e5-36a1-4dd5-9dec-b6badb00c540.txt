Horrid - stay as far away from this place as you can.  Over-priced, bad food overall.....horrid service. I ordered soup and had a lot left - when asked for a to go container was told they did not have soup to go containers.  Since, I was sick it would have been nice to be able to have the soup later .  Told the manager I was disappointed (guy with the long hair) and he told me he didn't care.  Save your money - the waitress did not get a tip this night, which I never do unless it was just the worst - IT was the worst ever.  The whole place has a feeling of being overwhelmed. Again, do no go here.....Bad - Bad - Bad!
