Let it be known that of the 7 or so 1 star reviews I've given on Yelp thus far, 4 were eventually shut down. Not an accurate predictor, but interesting nonetheless.

With a location like this (next to the Suns arena), I bet this place relies on only their location to get by. I mean the 4 of us reached a unanimous decision that this place was a horrible decision for dinner. Their pizza had no taste at all and the penne pasta, well you can taste the bad tap water that was used to cook it. Even when doused with pepper, the food was still unpalatable.

The lines at U-S Airways Arena are incredibly short (even at peak times), that you are better off grabbing food inside the arena or elsewhere nearby.

Also, the owner of this place owns Maria's Mexican Grill... just an fyi
