As mentioned by other reviewers, the prices are high, the staff are not helpful, and the return policy is crap. I returned a pair of ballet shoes, with its receipt and was given a receipt back with a note on it that said "In-store Credit". I understand it's a small business, but if you can put my information in your computer, you should be able to add a note stating that I have in-store credit. Once I use it, I'll NEVER spend another penny there. And I'll tell the dance studio owners I know the same thing. Zero customer service!
