Your kidding right?

Bland, bland, bland.  Subway is far better.  And Subway is pretty nasty, so that says a-lot my lil' Schizzle!

The bottom of my roll was hard.  I asked for no mayo but with mustard instead, and for that I get neither?

I don't know what I ordered, it was the Italian Combo thing, it had no FLAVOR!!!

Yuck, Jimmy Hell Spawn's more like it.  

Crap on a roll.

Later,

Hated it.

Never again.

Bye, bye don't let the hard roll hit you where Jimmy John's CEO split you!

ps how F------ng incompetent do you have to be to not substitute Mustard for Mayo as requested?  I should have asked for extra mayo, then I would have gotten no mayo but mustard like I wanted.
