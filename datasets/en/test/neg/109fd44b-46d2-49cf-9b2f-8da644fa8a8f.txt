Dreadful food ( have not tried their pizza). The lemon chicken and the Greek salad were tolerable, but the spaghetti and sauce, plus the chicken parmigiana, we're tasteless. I would suggest, if you want Italian, go to a real Italian eatery ( Uncle Sals comes to mind)! This is warmed over food at its worst. Spaghetti on ice heated by immersing in hot water is unacceptable. Food should be fresh at the very least.
