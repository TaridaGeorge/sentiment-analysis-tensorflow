Came in for the second time. Clothes are pretty awful but I needed candles and with the recession I have to search high and low. The clerks are very rude , no eye contact, hello, goodbye or thank you. Loud personal conversations are going on in every department. I should work here. It is basically clock in then stand around and talk for 8 hours. The store is dark the mercy is very bad. The whole place smells like cheap glue. Poor lighting. You really feel like your at the salvation army
