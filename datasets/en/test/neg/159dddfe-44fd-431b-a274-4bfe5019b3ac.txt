I eat a lot of Asian food (of different sorts).  Asian is actually my go-to cuisine since I have a lot of food allergies.  This place deserves a thumbs-down, unless you love Americanized Asian.  The food was bland, breaded and just not worth any money.  Next time I'm in Phoenix, I definitely won't eat here.
