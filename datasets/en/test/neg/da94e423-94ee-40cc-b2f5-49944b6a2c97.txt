Wow, I thought it was only pre-internet days that companies could get away with being this rude and unethical.  Overcharging me for an oil change while telling me "but it comes with a tire rotation and a 21-point inspection" then when you go to ask them how the inspection went they stare you down for 30 seconds like you have a third eyeball...  I should have marked my tires cause I have a feeling they didn't rotate them either...  Please shut this place down and put in a Taco Bell or something, it would serve the community a whole lot better than this place.
