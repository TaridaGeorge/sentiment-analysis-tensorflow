The piano player is great fun!

We have been going to the place for over eight years during our spring trips. We loved the great food, wonderful service and especially the piano music.  The clay pots were our favorites.

Last week we made our yearly visit and were horribly disappointed. The food was cold. The dishes had very little imagination, and were tasteless.  

We were very sad when we left because this restaurant was one of our favorites.

If you like piano music to accompany your dinner, the Golden Buddha is for you. 

If you want reasonably priced imaginative, creative Chinese food, I suggest you try another place.
