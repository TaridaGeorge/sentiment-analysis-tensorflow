I've never been to a place so dang bland! I actually went to this place on a whim before I had read any of the Yelp reviews and was surprised that my experience was pretty much like others had noted. When I walked in during prime Lunch Rush hours my sister and I were the only patrons. The cashier/cook was very nice but the food was pathetic. I had the Hawaiian BBQ Chicken lunch plate with Macaroni Salad and rice and literally everything had NO taste. I tried some of their special sauce on the side and good thing I put it on the side because it was nothing more than some watery soy sauce concoction. Sorry WikiWiki, I so badly wanted to like you but I just cannot waste my money like that.
