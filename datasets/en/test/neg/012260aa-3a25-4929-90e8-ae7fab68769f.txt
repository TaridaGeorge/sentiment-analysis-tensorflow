The price is good for a haircut, however that is if you want to listen to the person who is cutting your hair talk crap about her other employees, tell the person more then once to fix your hair cause she is to busy talking instead of paying attention to your hair and an underage employee begging for someone to buy her cigarets.... I will never go there again.
