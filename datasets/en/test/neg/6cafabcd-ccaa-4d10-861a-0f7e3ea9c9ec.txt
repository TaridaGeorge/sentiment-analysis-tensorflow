Really wanted to try this place but left before ordering. Drove 30 min to get here based on the amazing Yelp reviews but servers appeared frustrated, confused, and unorganized from the moment we walked through the door. 
Our party of four walked in & when someone noticed us they told us to seat ourselves at one of 4 empty tables.  We then waited for 25 min while servers took orders & brought drinks/appetizers for people at 3 tables who arrived after us. We decided that if this was how the dining experience was going to go, we'd take our business elsewhere. We told our server why we were leaving and he said "sorry, we don't have sections". Oh well.
