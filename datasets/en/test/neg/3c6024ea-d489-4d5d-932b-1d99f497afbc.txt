I live right down the street from here and decided to come in with my husband for some food and drinks. The place was pretty busy when we arrived and we were told that we could sit anywhere. The only place available to sit was on the picnic tables outside, which would have been fine if they were clean. ALL the picnic tables were covered in cigarette ashes and sticky stuff. A server came by and explained a trivia game they were playing and took a good 5 minutes with this. Never asked if we wanted anything, he just left, and so did we.

The employees that we came in contact with had no people skills at all and were not very accommodating helping us find a seat. The place was also very dirty and run down, will not be back here.
