Ridiculous. That was the word of the night. Ridiculous prices. Even more ridiculous portions, really almost laughable. I would be embarrassed if I were the owner. The food itself was nothing special. The atmosphere was loud and cramped. The next table only an arms length away. Service was slow. This place is only good for impressing a "high maintenance" date, if you're into that sorta thing. Otherwise I recommend some place else.
