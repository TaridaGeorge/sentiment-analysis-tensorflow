This place was a JOKE after reading in Essence about this place I travel 60 miles to get here for a consultation in which my hair was never actually examined, they only asked me what style I wanted - I could have told you that over the phone. Then I figured maybe I had the interpretation of "consultation" confused so I made my appt for twist in which I left looking like a 2nd grader in school. Complete and total waste of time and money, I came home and washed my hair and did it myself - consumer beware, apparently ANYONE can buy a ad in Essence/Ebony/Black Enterprises, the quality of the pics in print are not what you get in person, which probably explains why they've been in business for YEARS and only have 3 yelp reviews.
