Hated it from the moment we stepped foot on the patio.  Very little seating inside and out.  Staff utterly rude.  Some drunk jerk pushed his way practically on top of me to order bartender could care less he preferred to help drunk pig over me waiting who was already waiting patiently.  We said forget walked out.  Both husband and I agree not our style.  We prefer Gordon Biersch.  Will never go back.
