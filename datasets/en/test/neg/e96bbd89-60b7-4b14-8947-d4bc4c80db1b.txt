I am a nurse and work at a hospital nearby. I ate a country burrito- potato, egg and cheese. It was extremely tasty. Unfortunately, I got the worst food poisoning of my life- lost 7lbs in a week. My girlfriend who ate the other half of the burrito got sick too, so it was certainly from this place. I actually got tested for Hepatitis A fearing the worst thinking that I could have been infected by this dirty food. Hep A negative, but food poisoning from hell.......... POSITIVE! Almost needed to be hospitalized for dehydration. I never get food poisoning, never get sick. This place wrecked me. Please do yourself a favor and do not put yourself in a situation in which you could become a patient of the hospital across the street. SKIP THIS PLACE.
