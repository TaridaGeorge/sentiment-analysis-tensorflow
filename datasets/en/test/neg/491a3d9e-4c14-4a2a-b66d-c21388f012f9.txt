I was in town for the Fiesta Bowl and decided to try another hotel.  I always stay at the W in Scottsdale, but it was sold out.  All I have to say is that this place is a complete dump.  The service is terrible.  Apparently, they find it necessary to book all the rooms with what seemed to be an entire fraternity, then have no security to monitor them after the bars closed.  Did not sleep a wink.  Will not stay here ever again and will make it my mission to make sure no one else does either.
