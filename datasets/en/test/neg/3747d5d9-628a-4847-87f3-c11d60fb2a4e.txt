Room 123 is supposed to be a non-smoking room, however there was a lingering stench of cigarette smoke, and cigarette burns in the comforter and the chair. Internet access painfully slow. The bed was the most uncomfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in. The toilet consistently ran all night. None of the most basic amenities in the room upon arrival such as shampoo, conditioner, lotion, coffee packets, etc. TV remote took a lot of figuring out on how to switch over from cable to the DVD player. Perhaps because I'm a director of food and beverage for a large hotel, I'm overly-picky, but overall I was very underwhelmed by my stay; not a 2-star quality hotel in my view. --- Ending on a positive note, front desk staff was very welcoming and accomodating.
