The tacos were not all that great. Most taco places let you mix and match three tacos, but here, they do not. My fianc√© asked to have three different types, and they said they couldn't do it. Every other place does a mix and match combo. Don't know why this place is the exception. 

Also, their sign out front says they have "Lunch Specials." So when I went in, took a seat, and then inquired about the lunch specials, I was disappointed when the waitress told me that they don't have "Lunch Specials" on food. The "Lunch Specials" are for drinks only. What kind of a "Lunch Special" is that? Completely bogus. When you say "Lunch Special" on your sign, I'm assuming there is a discount on food. Alas, there was not. 

I will not be returning to this place.
