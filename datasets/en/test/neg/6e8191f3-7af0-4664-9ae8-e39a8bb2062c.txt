If I could give no stars, I would.  Do not eat here.  The management is rude and gives passive aggressive answers to simple questions about their buffet.  The pizza at the buffet was like cardboard and so we complained that it was not worth our money.  Suddenly, we are given the comment, "If you don't pay, we'll call the police."  Wow.  Our kids started crying because of the mean temper from the management.  One of the worst if not THE worst dining experience of my life.
