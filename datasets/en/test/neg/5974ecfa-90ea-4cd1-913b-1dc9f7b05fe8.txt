On Monday I tried to stop here for a late lunch/ early dinner (about 3:45pm) and they were closed. The hours on the door clearly indicated that they should be open during this time, but no... the doors were locked with no explanation. 
This is a bit odd and makes me wonder about the management and service. 
I have been here once before in early 2010, I wasn't all that impressed but figured I'd give it another try.  
Oh well. 
Also, why do they not have a phone number or business hours listed on the website?
Go figure.
