Where did I end up eating? The reviews here do not match the atrocity of food I just ate from Asian Cafe Express.    The lo mein was so oily and the fried rice was crunchy....an 'uncooked' kind of crunchy!  I ordered the family special with orange chicken, sweet and sour chicken and mongolian beef.  

They did not put ay sauce or give me a side of sauce for my sweet and sour chicken, and the orange chicken was mushy and plain. 

Everything was so disgusting, I ended up throwing it away after a few bites.  I was very disappointed after having such high expectations with the reviews.  I will never go back and the only word of mouth campaign I'm running is "Do not go here!"
