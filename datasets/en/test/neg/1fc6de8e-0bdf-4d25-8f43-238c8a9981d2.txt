I probably should have yelped it before I went there.  But I was on the road and craving a rice bowl.  The place is dark (makes it dingy for me) and it was so quite for a lunch crowd.  Ordered the house chicken togo.  The taste of the sauce was weird...  not to garlicy, just blah...  Very disappointed...  Never going back!
