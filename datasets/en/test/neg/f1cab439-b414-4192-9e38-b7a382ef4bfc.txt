This is the worst  hospital around.. The experience I just had there (I wouldn't wish on my worse enemy) these RETARDS lost my blood results.... and just gave me the run around all freaking week I've been sick for 3 weeks and yet they don't know what to do!! Sound like they don't need to be in business anymore.. I RECOMMEND NOBODY GOING THERE!
