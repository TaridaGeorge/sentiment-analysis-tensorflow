Went here twice in the last couple of weeks. First time I thought it was pretty decent. The second time the food was the same, pretty run of the mill. The big problem is value for the $$$. I took my two children and my wife, we ate 3 pulled pork sandwiches and a half rack of ribs. The cost was just about $45 which for the quality of food seemed to be over the top. The half rack was tiny and fatty unfortunately. I will probably not go back. Would like to try other BBQ places first.
