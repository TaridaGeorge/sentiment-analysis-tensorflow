Was seen for an infection which landed me in the ER  the day *after* I was seen here.  Dr. Tang's treatment was quite painful (no topical numbing agents were used before a direct injection into a wound). I did not find the doctor personable or responsive to my needs as a patient. A culture was taken at the facility, but no results were reported even though I called to check for results and left my contact information.
