Tried to get my oil change and tires rotated on my truck here today, but I decided against it because apparently one of their jacks is broken. That means that they only have one jack, which is being used all the time, which means that its probably about to break as well.  It's definitely not going to be my truck that falls to the ground when this jack breaks.  I also went to another Jiffy Lube near by on Apache and McClintock, same story.
