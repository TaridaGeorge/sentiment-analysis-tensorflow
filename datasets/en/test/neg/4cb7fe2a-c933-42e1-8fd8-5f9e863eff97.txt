This post office offers the worst customer service I have ever encountered. There can be a line out the door and only two people working the counter and they will never add an additional employee to the counter or work at any faster pace to move things along. If this place was not government owned it surely would go out of business. Every single employee will offer you different information on what their "policies" are. They don't have a clue in there and they treat the customers like crap.
