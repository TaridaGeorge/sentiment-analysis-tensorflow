I experienced some of the worst customer service here that I've ever had in the restaurant industry. The staff consisted of snotty teenage girls who were extremely rude to my mother when she simply asked them to pack the tomatoes for her sandwich separately and they didn't understand. Meanwhile, the manager just stood there and stared into space as my exasperated mother attempted to communicate what she wanted to no avail. We finally just gave up and went to the Ray and 54th St franchise. As we were walking out the door, the girls started laughing and pointing at us. I will NEVER go there again.
