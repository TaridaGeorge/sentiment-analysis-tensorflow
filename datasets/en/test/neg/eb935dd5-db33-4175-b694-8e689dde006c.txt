Terrible staff.  food is average.  When you go to watch a game there, if your entire party is not there right at that moment, they dont seat you at all.  they make you wait.  Very odd.  Crummy staff, average food, and the best of all.  I WISH I were joking.  I ordered a basket of french fries and there was a beer bottle cap in the middle of it all.  stay away from this dump.
