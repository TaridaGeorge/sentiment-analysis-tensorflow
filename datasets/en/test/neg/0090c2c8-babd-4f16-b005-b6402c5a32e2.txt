Agreed!  The Marquee in Tempe is a joke!  That was theeee worst place I've ever been to for a concert.  The ladies room was the fiflthiest I'd ever seen.  I mean 3rd world filfthy!  THERE ARE NOOOOOOO SEATS! NONE!  ZILGTH (SP?)!!!  If you're over 15 don't go there!  you'll stand allllllllll night long.  It was awful.  My feet were in so much pain.  This is not a place for pretty women.   don't wear heels to this place.  wear your slippers with plastic bags wrapped around them - use lots of duck tape!  
there were drunk people walking, no, staggering with filled drinks.  you can picture the rest.

ok I'm done.  I need to get that off my chest.

Hey, if anyone sees Erayka B, give her the finger for me!
