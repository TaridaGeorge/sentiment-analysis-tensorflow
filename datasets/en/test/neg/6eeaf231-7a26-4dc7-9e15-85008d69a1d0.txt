NYE, we attended the Lustre Bar Winter Wonderland NYE party.  We couldn't get a drink at the bar due to stressed out waitresses and a very crowded bar.  So we went downstairs for a drink at 12:30.  We were told that they already had last call and they were'nt making any more drinks!  Seriously, it's New Year's Eve! Plus the staff was rude and ignored people and talked to people they knew.  Really bad customer service especially if you wanted to impress guests and keep they're interest.  Blue Hound, you didn't succeed.  Hope you try better in the future.
