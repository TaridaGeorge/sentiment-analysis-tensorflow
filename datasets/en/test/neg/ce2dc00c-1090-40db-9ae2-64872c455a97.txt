Bought a groupon now for here. They said they no longer have a contract with groupon and would not honor it. Then when I checked in to yelp there was a coupon for a free drink once again they lady said they wouldnt honor it. Finally the lady gave me 10% off and a free drink. I was happy at that point until the food arrived. The chicken in my salad was delish but quality of the lettuce and the lack of other ingredients made it undesirable. They barely give you anything and they over charge you. Your pretty much paying $8 bucks for lettuce.
