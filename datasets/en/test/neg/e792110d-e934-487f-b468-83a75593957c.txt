Hit every one of my pet peeves about contractors:
Did not return first call, took two calls,
He told me to send email and he would follow up
Took two emails and another call
He came out to look at work I needed done, said would send estimate.
No call
I emailed him again asking about estimate - was told "can't do it, flat on my back" and never heard from him again.
If you can't be relied on to return calls and follow up - how can one trust you to be reliable once work has started?
