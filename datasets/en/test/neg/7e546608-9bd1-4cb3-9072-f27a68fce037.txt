I took my car in many times to have it washed and it wasn't bad at all. But then I took my BRAND NEW CAR in they broke off one of the knobs and tried to lie about it. I SAW THE GUY DO IT! It took them 4 months to "get the part in" after weeks of calling and harassing them. Then to find out they installed a part that wasn't correct so I had a knob... but it didn't work. My boyfriend took the parts of the broken knob and the new knob with the wrong connections and made it work... 6 MONTHS LATER!!!

I STRONGLY suggest not taking your car in to this location, IF YOU DO WATCH THEM!!!!!!!!!!!
