What happened to this place?  It is going down hill fast. 6 of us went in for the Sunday brunch, which ended up being a horrible idea. They seem to be skimping on the bloody mary bar. For lack of better words it sucked. They were out of champagne and most of their import beers, which we slowly found out over the span of an hour, leaving more than half of us drink-less for most of the duration. When we finally got our food it was all wrong. We played musical plates until everyone collected the combination of what they ordered. The server didn't bring rolled silverware... she brought a pile of dryer wrinkled napkins and loose silverware! It was ridiculously bad.
