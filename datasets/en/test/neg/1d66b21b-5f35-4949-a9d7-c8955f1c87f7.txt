I am uphauled, I used to like this place until...............................................

I went there with a few people and we started to have a good conversation with our waiter, he was nice and outgoing...A little too outgoing.

He quickly shared wit us that they advertise as no MSG but they infact do use it . In all of the soups and dressings and sauces!!!!!

If they blatenly lie about that what else do they do.

Bad ethics, eith er use it and say you do which of course would lose lot of business or just take it out. 

I couldnt believe this, who can I report them to if you know?
