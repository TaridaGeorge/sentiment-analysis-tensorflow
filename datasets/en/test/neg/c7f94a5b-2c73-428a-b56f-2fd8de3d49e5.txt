This government office gets an F for being handicap accessible. The parking does not provide enough van spaces. Several able-bodied people were parking in the available spots with no placard. The ramp was too steep and the door had no way to open automatically. Still waiting in the initial check-in line, so perhaps the verdict on the rest of their services will be different.
