I went here last night because all my mid-west friends said it was amazing!  I have to say I was very disappointed!  Not to mention that I'm pretty sure my burger had a piece of bone or rock in it.  I bit down and seriously thought I chipped one of my molars.  

Do yourself a favor and go to In N Out or for that matter McDonald's!
