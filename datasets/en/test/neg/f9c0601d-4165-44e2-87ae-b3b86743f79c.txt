(I have not ate at this Saddle Ranch. This review is for SR on weekend nights after 10 pm).

You will like Saddle Ranch in Old Town Scottsdale if you are:

A creepy middle aged guy
A creepy douchebag
OR
An attention seeking skank of a female who likes to ride mechanical bulls in super short dresses

Seeing as how I am none of those, I dislike Saddle Ranch as a bar/late night destination. Plus the bar service sucks and you can get cheaper beer at other places.
