If you are looking for a nice, stressfree getaway, I warn you not to stay at the Four Seasons Scottdale. The hospitality, communication skills (or lack their of) are by far the worst I've experienced in all of my travels. As I will get into details once I've checked into my next destination, i warn you at all costs not to stay at this hotel. It is by far the worst (what they call) luxury hotel experience.
