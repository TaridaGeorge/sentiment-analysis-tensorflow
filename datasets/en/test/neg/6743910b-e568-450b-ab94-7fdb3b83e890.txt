How disappoint was I when my husband returned home from a Spring Training trip with 20 friends and was told the bouncer at your establishment ejected my husband from the bar and told him to "take his lesbian friends with him".  I thought we as a society have come further than these types of remarks are we are for sure letting all our heterosexual and Gay and Lesbian friends to stay away from your establishment.  SHAME ON YOU FOR EMPLOYING PEOPLE THAT THINK THEY CAN REFER TO PEOPLE IN THIS MANOR AND STILL HAVE A JOB!
