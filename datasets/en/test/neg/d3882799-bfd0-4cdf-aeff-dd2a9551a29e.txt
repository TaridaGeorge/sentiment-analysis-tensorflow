So the day after, I found out why it didn't hurt AT ALL when I was waxed. The hair was ripped off at the skin, not the follicle. The results were just like shaving. Nice the first day, but stubble the second. 
I still have no complaints about the customer service, but the service itself was a let down. 
I will NOT be going back here. I'll pay more and go to a salon next time.
