Oh I hate to whine however....Mr Chao cant cook!!   

Overpriced chinese food.  Ordered a simple dish---chicken fried rice.  
Re-heated chicken has an after taste...This chicken was reheated and it tasted 
like rubber!! OMG...this is a simple dish to do and they totally screwed it up!
I didnt want to complain about the food. You know what they say when you complain about the food.  They bring you back a dish with God you dont know whats in it!  Tukee people---go to Peiwok!!! Their portions are bigger and its tastier!!!!

Bistro my butt!! This place is no bistro!!
