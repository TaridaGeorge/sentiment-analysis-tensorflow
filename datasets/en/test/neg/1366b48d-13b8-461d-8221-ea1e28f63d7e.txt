How horrible this place is!  They committed to doing a fund raiser for Cesar Chavez elementary school, school sent flyers, promoted them.... Then decided to not follow through because they ONLY support Arcadia High School.  Sad that a group of elementary school students had to miss out on their fund raising opportunity.
