I know, I know you all loved it right?  I went it was like a tourist nightmare.  The food was very average.  The usual re fried beans and rice crap that Mexicans think White people love, but in fact many of us think it is boring and tasteless and uncreative.  The Margarita was so-so.  They want it to look authentic, but it is like Macayo's with a cooler looking establishment.  Won't be back.  Boring food...Tourist attraction to bring people from Idaho to see.  Good chips and salsa though, I give them that.
It is not authentic, it just looks authentic to fool tourists.

Oh yeah, the Fundido was a cardiologists dream come true.  A truly horrific glob of greasy cheese mutation of food.  Honestly, this place is abysmal.
