I've been in here half a dozen times with my family over the years and we always really enjoyed the tuna sandwiches. So this past January, my boyfriend and I stopped by for lunch... he ordered a sub and I ordered the tuna sandwich. He described his sandwich as "blah" and wasn't impressed with the shredded lettuce or unripe tomatoes (he said that he has been more impressed with the variety and selection at Subway). I on the other hand enjoyed my tuna. 

HOWEVER, I became violently ill a couple hours later with the worst food poisoning of my entire life. My boyfriend called and left a message the next morning to inform them of the tainted tuna but we never received a call back...  I will never eat there again!
