Paul's personnel were courteous, prompt, and professional - but even after 6 or 7 visits, were utterly unable to eliminate  - or apparently even slow down the termite infestation.   
Inexpensive termite control contract came with house purchase- only $99 per year.  No problem for couple of years but then the beasts arrived. IDespite 6 or 7 treatments there was no apparent effect on the termite invasion.  They did not appear deterred in the heavily treated areas - and were spreading even after repeated visits. They were not only apparently not deterred, they didn't even appear mildly discouraged. Gave up after last treatment by Paul's in 10/08. Paid a comparative FORTUNE for treatment by Truly Nolan - but they stopped the invasion.
