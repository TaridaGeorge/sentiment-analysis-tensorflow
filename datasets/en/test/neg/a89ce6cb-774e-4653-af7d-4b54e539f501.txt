Tried to get ahold of this dude to no avail. No personal message on his answering machine at all. Website sucks for information to let me know what sorta work or quality thereof he does.
I tried to call here @ 6:53pm tonight and again...no one picks up the phone. So fed up with flaky contractors. Do they want work or not?
