Wow, I'm Shocked how many people gave this place 5 Stars. They must not know what good wings or good fish taste like Or they work there and are putting up fake reviews.. The wings were not that bad not great but not bad. The fish I didn't want to eat the whole this way to salty no good favor just taste old and salty. For what you get I feel it's a little over priced but everywhere is getting to be like that. Will not go back again
