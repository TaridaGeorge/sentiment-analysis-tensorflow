.... this place SUCKS.

Customer Service is the worst I've ever experienced in a long time.

Food was horrible. My sister's order was spoiled and they served it anyway.

Drinks?  As mentioned, the waiter was horrible.  And the manager?  He had no backbone to ensure our waiter was doing what he is paid to do.

Aside from the snide comments from lackluster waiter, which was cute - cause I've been called worse, this place isn't a place to dine at. :(
