Well, on this particular visit the associate in the men's department was pretty douchey. The associate was busy racking items and I guess did not see us approaching him as he walked back and forth putting clothes out. When we got close enough my bf asked him about a particular brand of clothing and with hardly any recognition replied in a rude and unprofessional manner. Really didn't make me or my boyfriend want to spend any money in this store. On to the next store :).
