Ugh. In a word, gross. Don't waste your money or your time. We got takeout here and had the sechuan beef, chicken low mein, egg rolls, and the sizzling soup. Pretty much none of it was edible. In fact, we threw it out after a few bites. Super greasy, and not a lot of flavor and frankly, I'm a bit shocked by the positive reviews here. 

I don't want to sound like a jerk, but I will never eat here again.
