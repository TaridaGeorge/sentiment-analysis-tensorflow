I didn't try the hot food but got a Rainbow Roll. The crab meat was horrific. It tasted like a chopped seafood salad you get at a supermarket -- or worse. It was $9.99 which is huge for a quicky place. Yuk, yuk, yuk. It's a hour later and I think it is finally time to go use some mouthwash. 

The place was pretty crowded so I imagine there is something good on the menu -- just not California rolls!
