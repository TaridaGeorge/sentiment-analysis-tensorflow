I've been a resident of this "beautiful" community for three years.  Three years too many.  I have dealt with several unbecoming situations in this complex including a used condom taped to my door, a combative leasing staff, being walked in on naked by contractors this company has hired.  Dirty grounds over run with stray cats and cigarette butts.  Save yourself the application fee and RUN!!!  This place is horrible and I can't wait until my lease is up so I can be done with this living hell.  I have been startled awake many times in the night having to call the police due to domestic violence issues.  So much, so that the police dispatcher knows my voice!  Management gave a "devil may care" attitude regarding such a dangerous situation.  For your safety and health, DO NOT RENT HERE!  DO NOT MAKE THESE PEOPLE ANY RICHER!!!
