My family and I decided to give Jade Palace another try, we have been to their Shea location and were not too impressed with the menu. I am Chinese and we were look for a chinese restaurant to celebrate the Lunar New Year. We didn't have reservations but were willing to wait for a table when we were told the wait might be 15 mins. So we waited and we watch tons of people get seated. Then the last straw came when they sat 2 groups that walked in as we stood waiting with no reservations get seated. So we left and I will no be going back ever again nor would I recommend them to anyone. They seem to only want to take care of their regulars which is great but new clients are important too and they did not seem to care.
