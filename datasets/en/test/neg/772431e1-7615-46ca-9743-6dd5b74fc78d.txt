A WRAITH OF AMERICANA LONG UNDEAD, CHURNING OUT CACA AT OUTRAGEOUS PRICES

--$3.50 slice of ham
--$4.00 glass of concentrated OJ
--3am best time to visit; you're going to be sick in an hour anyway from the booze you drank earlier. 
--no "honey"-calling, gum-chewing flos anywhere to be seen
--only the blur-in-motion Mexican-girl dishwasher/busers who can clear a table in 3.8 seconds
--24-7 operation means this place never gets a deep clean and it shows
--bathroom towels NEVER stocked
--window blinds caked in mud
--buser station crusty with layers of splattered milk and grease

And the food is atrocious. 
Not even grilled cheese makes it past the gag reflex

Get me outa here!!!
