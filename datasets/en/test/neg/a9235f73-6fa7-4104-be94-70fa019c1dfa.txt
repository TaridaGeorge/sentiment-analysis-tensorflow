Left my IPhone 2 hours told them I needed ALL my photos downloaded to iCloud and backed up.  None of my most important photos were downloaded and transferred to my new phone, none of ITune ringtones were transferred, had to re-load all my apps myself.  We opened 2 new lines with them.  NO SERVICE IN CAREFREE OR BOULDERS, PERIOD.  Wish I never left Verizon!
