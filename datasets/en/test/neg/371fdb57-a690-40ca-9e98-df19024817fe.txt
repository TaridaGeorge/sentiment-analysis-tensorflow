This Nail Salon is located on the Northwest corner of Indian School and Litchfield Road.

 I walked in today for a manicure, it wasn't busy. Two customers and three employees. 

I signed in and asked how long was the wait...they told me "right now". Then another customer walked in after me and needed a "set"...and you guessed it, I got BUMPED! 

They started on the OTHER customer first (no, they didn't have an appointment either----another walk-in like me). How RUDE! I turned around and walked out.
