yes i must agree w/my fellow yelpers i understand they are under new mngt so i thought i would give them another opportunity so i poped in and right when i walked in the door i heard a yell from the back of the store ....I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU SIR........which was at least an acknowledgment i was there un like my first visit a year ago when i walked around in the store while the staffed argued with each other never the less i was there a 1/2 hr and the only employ was with the same guy she was with when i walked in and there were two people in front of me so i said x*%& this and left
