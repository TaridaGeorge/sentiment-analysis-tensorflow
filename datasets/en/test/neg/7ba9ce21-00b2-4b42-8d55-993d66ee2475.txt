What a great concept!  What poor execution!!  This place is rubbish.  It is literally like a yard sale inside a building.  There is no atmosphere, no color, no style, no substance.  The record selection is minimal and the candy selection is actually worse than Smeeks (which I didn't think was possible).  I have no idea how this place pays rent but it should be closed.  At least then homeless people would have a place to stay - providing more value than it does right now.
