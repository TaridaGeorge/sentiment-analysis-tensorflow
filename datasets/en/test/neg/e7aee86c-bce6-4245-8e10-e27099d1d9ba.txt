Visited Portland's last Tuesday, nice ambiance, very short staffed, the food was so-so, we went to try the parmesan fries which were decent, but sub-par in comparison to Chelsea's Kitchens', and at $7.00 for a side order, a bit pricy.  The dessert, apple strudel/ice cream was comparable to a grocery store bakery, and had absolutely no flavor.
