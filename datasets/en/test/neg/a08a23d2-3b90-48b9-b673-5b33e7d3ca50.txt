No inventory, no service. The trees looked weak and not cared for. The people their do not care if you need help or not they are just their to take your order. The nicest people were the ones that did not speak English but always at least tried to help by getting something. Not very happy with this place. Only went their looking for one tree that I was having a hard time finding and they did not hardly have any trees at all.
