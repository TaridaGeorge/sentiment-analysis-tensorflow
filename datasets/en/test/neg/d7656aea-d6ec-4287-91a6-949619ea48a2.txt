Asked for a manager at this store location, associate called and manager asked "what is needed", associate: "guest would like to speak to you", manager: "regarding?", she eventually came and spoke but had no excuse why no associates were servicing the fitting room and long checkout lines were building. Customer service had a long line and there were plenty of associates that could had assisted the front of the store. The manager needs some respect to customers and store associates need to be team coworkers instead only doing what their walkie talkies suggest them what to do. I say "suggest" because it seems the store associates and manager don't take the communication device seriously enough.
