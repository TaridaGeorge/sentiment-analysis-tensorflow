I guess I should have looked here first before I stopped off on the way home, but I just spent 8.00 for a meal that was unedible.  I had the number 20 but asked for a chicken enchilada, so had to pay more.  Well I finally opened up the enchilada to see if there was any chicken and there was NONE. There wasn't even any cheese, it was just a rolled up tortilla with sauce on it.  The taco shell was so hard I had to discard it and just eat the meat inside.  To add insult to injury, the food was cold.  I won't be back or eat at any other filibertos.  It really sucked.
