We drove from Avondale to the Arcadia location, waited over 20 minutes and were bumped when a 5 top a waitress knew came in and asked for her. We were fed some line about how they were on the list, left before their name was called and it's policy to seat people that do that ahead of those that were waiting at the restaurant.  The name she pointed to was a party of 4. Customer service is lacking. Every other restaurant i know of, and have worked for, has the policy that if you're not there when your name is called it is crossed off and you go to the end of the line. The food is good but we don't wait an hour to be treated like that.  We ended up leaving without being seated and going to Taylor's.
