Why in the world does this place have 4 stars???  Not so great.. I have had better asian buffets. I am sorry I don't think any oriental buffet deserves 4 stars, but whatever.  This place, from what i remember was just a normal oriental buffet and didn't have anything special to offer.  I do remember thinking that it stunk and I didn't love their selection of buffet items.
