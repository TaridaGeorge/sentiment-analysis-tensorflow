I've been here a few times and I honestly feel that the food has gotten worse each time back; but that's not to say that it was ever very good to begin with.  The scene is lively and it's sort of a novelty with the decor and mechanical bull, and apparently that's how they've managed their success because it certainly isn't due to their food or service.  It's disappointing that a place with obvious financial resources behind it can't come up with more satisfying food or offer better service.  However, the large open space of Cadillac Ranch is good for large groups of people, and the music and scene seem to be entertaining enough to continue to attract clientele.
