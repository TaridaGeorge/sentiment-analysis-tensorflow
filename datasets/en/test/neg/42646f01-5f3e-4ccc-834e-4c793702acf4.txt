Decent at best!!  This burger was beyond greasy, and by the time I actually got my burger, the bun was completely soggy.  This never makes me happy!!  I think at the very least your bun should be perfect!!  I couldn't really tell too much about the flavor of the burger because it was crumbling in my hand, and grease was dripping down my arm.  Needless to say I wasn't a fan!

The fries were good, so I will give them that.  But I wouldn't say that they were spectacular.  I would rather just walk down the street to Chuckbox for a real burger than waste my money at this place.
