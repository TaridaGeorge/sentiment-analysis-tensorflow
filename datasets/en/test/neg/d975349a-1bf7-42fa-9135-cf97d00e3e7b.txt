The cut of rib meat used is cheap. Doesn't compare to the quality of baby backs or St. Louis ribs. Didn't seem to be smoked that long. The hot links are cheap too. I also ordered 1 lb or sliced beef. Didn't check my order before leaving. I got 1 lb of shredded beef in a styrofoam cup. I'd never ever go back again.
