I used my Groupon with Sacred Hogan Navajo Frybread. I did not have a very good experience.  Both my friend and I got chicken frybread sandwich, and the chicken was very dry and tasteless.  They ran out of picante salsa, and we had to beg our neighbors to give a little to give some taste.  Even with that, the taste did not improve that much.  We asked our server for some side beans to hopefully give some flavor, and he returned about 15 minutes later when we almost finished telling us that they ran out.

I was taking my buddy out for his b-day, and this was the not the b-day experience I was hoping to give.
