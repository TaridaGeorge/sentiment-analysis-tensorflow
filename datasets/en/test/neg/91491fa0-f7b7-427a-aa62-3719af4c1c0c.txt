This was my third time eating at Carrabba's and my last. In the past I have eaten at the one on Bell Rd and the one on Dysart in Avondale during the short time it was open but I thought I would give the Surprise location a try, same crappy food different location. I nearly broke a couple of teeth out on an olive pit and the waitress could  have cared less when I told her she might want to warn people that their pitted olives aren't pitted. Just like the other reviews said, small portions, high prices, low quality food, very limited menu. They make Olive Garden look good.
