I went in to this place this morning on a free pass!  I took a tour of what seems to be the oldest, most dated, cramped gym in the valley.  This place needs to be redone.

I immediately needed to know where the cleaning solutions were located in the gym to feel safe. Apparently they have housekeeping clean the machines three times a day. Really? I swear that place has to be growing out antibiotic resistant bugs that scientist have never dreamed of...

I had to leave. I could not bring myself to even use the free pass. My butt will stay flabby a little while longer. Bally corporate seriously needs to focus in on upgrading and cleaning the gyms that they have. I believe that their customers deserve better for $25/month.
