when i first moved here I thought this pizza place was the bomb but apparently I came on a good day. I have ordered pizza twice since my last post and have been disgusted. I asked the girl on the phone for a bbq chicken pizza, and she says they can make it. So when I came to pick up my order, the pizza literally had hot wings on top... HOT WINGS!  i have never seen a bbq CHICKEN pizza with hot wings on top, however despite the disapointment in my pizza and the rude service, I figured I'd "try" it. I was repulsed, tossed the pizza and called papa johns. NEVER AGAIN.
