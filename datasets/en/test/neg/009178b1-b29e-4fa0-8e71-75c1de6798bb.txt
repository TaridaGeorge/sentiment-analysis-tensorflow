Yeah...


Overpriced, greasy, and not really that British.

However, they have AMAZING Bread Pudding.

Simply incredible bread pudding.


A more detailed review...

Beer was way too expensive, service was slow, even for sitting at the bar, the fish fell apart, fries were cold and lumpy ( were not CHIPS), NO FULLERS.

The good? The relish served with the Ploughmans, and the bread pudding was amazing, warm, served with fresh nutmeg, awesome custard.

However, in the end, that's the only reason why this place gets a star.

Avoid this, pay less and get better food in Tempe, at Rula.
