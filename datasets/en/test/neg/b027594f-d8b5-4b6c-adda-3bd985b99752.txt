Xtremely  hostile, Xtreme arrogance,  Xtremely  poor  customer  service.  Made  appointment almost  a  week  ago  and  showed  up  in time.  This  business  asked  me  to  reconfirm  the  appointment  and  when  arriving  I  was not  greeted,  they  made  me  wait  over 1/2  hour  without  any  apology or  explanation.   When  I  complained in a polite way,  I  was  walked  out  the  door.

I am happy  that  I  found  out  before  even  entering  into any  business transaction with these guys.
