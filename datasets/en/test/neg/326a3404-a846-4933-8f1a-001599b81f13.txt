This place is bad.  It's hard to tell what the underlying issue is, I would guess poor management, inexperienced ownership, and bad training to start.   Credit cards get mysteriously lost then returned at the end of the night.  Days later erroneous charges appear on statments.  Bouncers act like they're the keepers of the keg cup at a frat party and are overly aggressive.

As bad as The Library was, this place is much worse.
