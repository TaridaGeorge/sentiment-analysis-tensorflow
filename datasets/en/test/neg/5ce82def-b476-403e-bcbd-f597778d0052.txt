i thought this place was crap, but my gf didnt think it was that bad. the menu was nothing special, typical phoenix restaurant choices. they ran out of the scallop dish at 7pm. we waited about 45 minutes for our food on a wednesday night. the choices were overpriced. and my mashed potatoes were cold. nuff said. 
gf thinks the mussels were good though.
