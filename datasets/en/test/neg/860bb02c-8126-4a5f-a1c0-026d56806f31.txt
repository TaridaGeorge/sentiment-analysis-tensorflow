Went  to this KFC and  when friends & I walked in, the PIC rudely stated that he was closing the dining room. 

Don't know if it was because they were getting ready to close the store or they didn't order the right amount of food, but was told by other customers that they were out of food. Either way, this place did not score well on Customer Service!
