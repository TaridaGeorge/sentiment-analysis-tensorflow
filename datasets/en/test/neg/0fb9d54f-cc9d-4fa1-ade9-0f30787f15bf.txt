Their service department ripped me off. I brought RX330 in for a blown engine fuse that should have been covered by the extended warranty. The service writer called me and told me that it was not and I had to pay for it. She then told me the fuse was INSIDE the engine. They charged me over THREE hours for this repair, but didn't get my prior authorization for the repair cost. When I went to pick it up and argued with them about the cost, they told me I had to pay it or they would hold my car until I did.  Do not ever take your Lexus there for service. I feel that they lied to me and held my car hostage until I paid $400 for a $50 repair.
