I cannot recommend this business. Although the owner was friendly, the workmanship was very poor. Water from rain and car wash leaks through into my car. Also my interior was damaged by this company when they removed my windshield. 

Definitely extremely frustrating. I have had to open up another claim with Progressive because of these issues. Not worth the hassle. Use one of their approved companies instead.
