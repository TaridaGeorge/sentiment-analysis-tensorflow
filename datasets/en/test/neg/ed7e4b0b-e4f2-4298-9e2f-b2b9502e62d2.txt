I don't know how this place is even open anymore. They've constantly put signs out front and even on the corner advertising deals practically giving their pizza away. I gave this place a try when it first opened around the corner, but one try was more than enough. When you're trying to grab a quick bite to eat on the way home from work, this isn't the place to go. Even for a cold pizza and calzone, I waited 30 minutes... that's plain ridiculous. The owner talked my ear off, not that that's a bad thing, but look dude, I wanted to be nice and support a local business, but once I left your shop and unfortunately tried your "food"(??) I was done.
