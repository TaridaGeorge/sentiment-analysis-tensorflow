I'd rather spend my hard earned dollars elsewhere than receive the bad customer service that is Dillard's!  I went here on a Tuesday night and while I did find a ton of cute shoes all six of the sales associates were standing at the cash register griping about having to help customers b/c they lose their commission if someone returns an item. Seriously guys?! I was the only shopper in the department and it wasn't difficult to overhear what they were saying. Needless to say I won't be going back.
