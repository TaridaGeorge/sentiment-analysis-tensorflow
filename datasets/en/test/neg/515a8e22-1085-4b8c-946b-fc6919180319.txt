What? Squeeze me? Are you serious? More hip hop? No 80s dance music. I'm going to crawl into a cave with my Depeche Mode t shirt, my glow sticks and poppers. It's just not fair damnit! Pistol Pete? You lil pistol. I better hear that raspy Richard Simmons voice sometime soon. Or. Or. Or I'll start listening to some heinous classic rock while wearing acid washed jeans and moccasins.
