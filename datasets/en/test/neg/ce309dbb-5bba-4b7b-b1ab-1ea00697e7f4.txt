I strongly recommend using any other car service other than ExecuCar.

We reserved an ExecuCar for our wedding to pick us up at our reception and take us to our hotel, and they did not show up. 

After multiple phone calls of them telling us 10 more minutes, we were finally driven to our hotel on our wedding night by our parents. We missed the send-off from our guests because the car never showed up and we were the last two people to leave our wedding because of this company. They are not only unreliable,  they  don't know how to value important events, or respond to customer complaints or issues. 

Do not use this company for any important transportation because they are completely unreliable and untrustworthy. I strongly recommend using any other car service other than ExecuCar.
