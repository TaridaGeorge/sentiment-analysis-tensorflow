don't, don't, don't...  don't believe the hype.  aside from the apparent body odor special they were running today, the food at this joint is nothing special.  the egg drop soup tastes like frozen peas and carrots.  the lemon chicken lunch special is nothing special - the chicken was fried and very chewy and grainy.  both the customers and the workers were pretty rude - but what do you expect in phoenix?  for people to actually form a line and not begin ordering in the middle of your order?

suckered in by good reviews.  guess that's what i get.  mark this one down as a fail.  won't be returning to this shithole.
