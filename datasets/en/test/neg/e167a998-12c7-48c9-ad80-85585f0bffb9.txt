I had received an email from a student retention telling me that I still owe money for the time that I had taken classes (two weeks) although these fools canceled my financial aid. I will sue this school if they even attempt to collect money from me and I have withdrawn from the classes on the right time, but this rep. told me that the withdrawal period was Jan. 11.
