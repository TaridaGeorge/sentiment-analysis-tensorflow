Worst experience ever. Im not too picky, but don't like being treated like crap. Went for a nice lunch on the patio. 45 minute wait. We were then offered a front patio spot since we didn't want to wait. Waited forever for service,drinks, and food. The table next to us were friends of the server and got everything immediately. Guess you have to know someone working there to get good service.  Will not going back.
