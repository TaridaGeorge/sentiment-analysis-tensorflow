I entered the store and was not acknowledged. The party/wedding rental area was abandoned, save for a price list and a variety of wedding vendor business cards on a table. Walked around, nobody came in. Not really my job as the customer to go LOOKING for a warm body. Found the prices on the list to be higher, item for item, than any other rental company in the valley. This place was a total waste of my limited time.
