Corbin's has been a disaster from the beginning, literally.  I anxiously waited for their opening day, even with such enthusiasm that I dropped by to get a menu prior to my first dining visit.  I made a visit shortly thereafter only to find that their official hours weren't the same as indicated on the menu.  Big mistake.

On later visits, when I was able to eat here, the food was interesting in that it was non-traditional on many accounts, and had good presentation, but was very lacking in taste.  Service was poor, staff was snooty, and I could have sworn that those were 10 ounce mugs used for draft beer at happy hour.  Even if they were 12's, come on, the norm is 16 oz. pint or larger these days.
