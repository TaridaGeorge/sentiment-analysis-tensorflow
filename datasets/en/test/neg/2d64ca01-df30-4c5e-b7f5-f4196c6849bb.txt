Where to begin?
The staff is cold and uninviting.  Rolling eyes at the inconvenience of patrons trying to navigate past servers, searching various corridors trying to find the bathroom.

Design / architecturally is fine.  Very current.

The atmosphere at the bar was horrendous.  Vulgar.  Drunks.

If you are a twice divorced post-middle age slightly overweight dude.... this is your place.  Enjoy.
