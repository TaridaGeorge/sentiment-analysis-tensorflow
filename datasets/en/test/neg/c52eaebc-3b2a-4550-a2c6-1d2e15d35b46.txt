Unless it's dishonest and uneducated salespeople and sticky counters you're looking for, go someplace else. Their staff is all slimy used car salespeople-in-training.

If someone's helpful, it's because they're getting commission. And take a close look at that slip you take to the register -- they're known for secretly sneaking in additional items or the next-level-up product.

Here's some things I've experienced: 

-Man in memory section told me I couldn't grab an OEM box of Windows 7 from the shelf (just a few aisles away) and had to include it on his commission slip --sneaky
-Man in home a/v had never heard of Roku Player.  --uninformed/uneducated salespeople
-Man in Apple section (where they have the new Apple TV) excused the fact that they're not demoing one with "Yeah, Apple doesn't let us set them up." --tacky
