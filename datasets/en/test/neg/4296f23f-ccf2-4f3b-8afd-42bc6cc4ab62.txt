Do NOT take your pet here.
1.  They would not allow me in the back with my very old dog
2.  I heard her yelp and ran to her anyway
3.  They tried to get me to pay for four different shots (She is a 14 yr old OLD indoor dog!) PLUS 40 dollars to have the vet look at her (for the shots that she didn't need!)
4.  I've been taking my dogs to a great vet in Scottsdale; just happened to be on the other side of town and needed her anal glands expressed.  

NEVER NEVER NEVER again. These people are crooks and are GREEDY - not in it for the animals...just your checkbook.  STAY AWAY.
