We ordered chicken wings, chicken fingers and sweet potato fries.  The food arrived barely heated and I sent the fingers back.  They brought out another batch that was just barely warm.  We had a few bites of everything and the flavor was akin to cardboard slathered in bbq sauce.  The screen is small and the constant scooting of the waiters is annoying.  This combo of theater and restaurant fails on both counts.  I will be sticking with my usual restaurants and the Cine Capri from now on....lesson learned.
