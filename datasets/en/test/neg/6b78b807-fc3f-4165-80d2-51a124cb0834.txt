This "dog park" is a joke.  Steele Indian School Park is huge and all they can offer the dogs is a small GRAVEL hill??  Dogs need GRASS...or at least dirt to run in!!  

I really wish the city would move the fence so the off-leash area would include some of the large grass field that is adjacent to it so I could actually take my dog to this park to play!!
