I told my friend that I'd rather eat out of a vending machine, and he said.. "Yelp THAT!"   I had the calamari app, the caprese salad and the eggplant rolotini.  The salad was served in what i can only describe as a burnt, upside-down bread "hat" that was inedible and in the way.  The rolotini was a hot pocket, only dry and crappy.  Boo on you, Crust!
