I squirmed through most of "Circle Mirror Transformation" on Saturday 4/23/11.  It was as engaging for this theater goer as being a voyeur into a baseball locker room after a loss but before the players have showered.  Most disappointing production of what otherwise was a delightful and enjoyable season at the Actors Theatre.  Perhaps the actors were depicting the failings of the rest of us non-actors  and demonstrating via their awkward fits and starts and infernal silences why the rest of us should never hope to appear on stage.  But -- except for Theresa -- these characters simply failed to make me care about them or their aspirations.
