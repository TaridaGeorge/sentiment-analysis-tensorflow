I realized just the other day that I never updated this review.  Sadly, US Air still gets one star. 

After months of waiting, filling out paperwork, and jumping through annoying hoops. we got reimbursed for less than 1/3 of what was lost. Not to mention that the biggest things lost were hand-made Christmas gifts.  We've learned our lesson about checking baggage... and about US Air. 

After such a fiasco, I won't be flying US Air again if I ever have the choice.  If I have to fly on their airline, everything will be either shipped ahead or carry on.  Ack!
