After speaking to some of the workers. (not the waitresses) I will not go eat at a place whose waitresses will screw the other workers over by not giving them what they are rightfully due in tips. I was eating my dinner while speaking to some of the real workers. Dishonesty makes you lose business. I paid, did not finish my food and I left. Will not be back. I was there on a very busy weeknight (Wednesday). Will be going to fuddruckers instead. Very sad way to run a business.
