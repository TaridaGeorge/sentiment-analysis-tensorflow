Ordered jalepano cream sauce over linguine with tilapia. Was their special of the day. One of the worst dishes I've ever had. Staff is bad, food is below average, but the beer is decent. The outdoor patio is nice, but lacking character. The garlic fries are good. Overall, go here because there are few choices in the "land of chain food".
