Every few months I go back, just to see if it's improved any. I'm a sucker and it's down the road.

Honestly?  I imagine you will encounter this brief scenario: There will probably be a long line and frazzled employees.  You'll likely realize that you arrived home with a bread and mayonnaise sandwich upon arriving home.

The food is lousy and the service poor, but the bread really does stand out.  Without anything to hold that up (and, as someone else pointed out, microwaves on the counters), I don't have any great desire to return.
