I have been there several times and have now sworn off this place.  Like other reviewers, I think the county board of health should take a close look.

Should you touch salt or pepper shakers, you will definitely stick to them - They get refilled but never cleaned.

Yes - I have seen a cockroach or two.

The 5 gallon ice cream tubs open to all is less than appealing as you kind of wonder what else has been introduced into those tubs.

While the presentation is generally ok, I suggest avoiding this place.
