This place is so awful.... I walk in with a Droid 2 Global I had just gotten in the mail because my last 3 messed up.. This one as well did the same... It wasnt making calls 100% the time like it should... So i go in and tell the salesmen what was wrong with the phone... he looks at it and says... OHHHH I SEEE... there is lent in the head speaker... REALLLY!? LENT!? come on dude... then i said i doubt thats it... he comes back to say its a combo of the lent and holding the phone cock eyed... OMFG. I was raging pissed off. But he made a call and it worked (this time) so I couldnt say anything.. Later that night it does it again... But really for them to even say that was whats wrong? wow.
