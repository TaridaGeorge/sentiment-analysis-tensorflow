Ordered take out, and asked specifically for no veggies, since I'm allergic to one of the main veggies they use. Pick-up due in 20 mins.

Arrived 25 mins later, order hadn't been done. They put the veggies in with both dishes, make it impossible to eat either (didn't realize until I got home.) The lamb was boiled and in a sauce that made it impossible to taste the meat - it was just chewy sauce. The mexican rice had next to no flavor, the salsa ordered came in two tiny side containers you'd get at Filibertos, and one of the two salsa types had next to no flavor - it was water, cilantro, and a couple of chunks of onion and tomato. 

The guacamole was tasty, and the chips were fresh, but that is the only good thing I can say about this experience.
