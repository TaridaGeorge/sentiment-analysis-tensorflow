I lived down the street from Carly's for 5 years and only managed to go there once. That was one salty, miserable biddy at the bar and from what I could see, that's the kind of trick they always like to hire. I am not trying to have an adversarial relationship with someone who is bringing me drink and food. Place reeks of the famous Phoenix snarkiness.... F that!
