Ouch & GROSS!  Expensive and Disgusting!!  "Cal-Ital" food...How stupid.

Honestly, I ordered the number one listed and recommended item on the menu seafood carbonara pasta dish, and it was absolutely tasteless.  It tasted like wallpaper paste!  

It was surprisingly awful, since it is owned by Cowboy Ciao across the street, which is very good.

For good carbonara, go to Uncle Sal's - formerly mafia owned by Sammy "The Bull" Gravano.  I choose good food over decore anytime!
