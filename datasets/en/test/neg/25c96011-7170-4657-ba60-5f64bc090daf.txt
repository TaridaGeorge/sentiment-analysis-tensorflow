Uhhhhhh, definitely overrated. WOW what a dissapointed. The cupcakes were dry, the icing way too sweet. They could pass for Walmart cupcakes or the like. Crazy pricing too. The only cute thing here is the decor. As a dessert-lover-foreverandever, this cupcake joint broke my heart. Hopefully the other locations have better quality cupcakes because where else is the hype coming from?!
