Not cool!  Just received a bill in the mail for this allergist.  They apparently think I owe them $200 for uncollected payments over the last 2 YEARS.  Its literally a bill that is 10 pages long with small charges from the last 15 months.  I went there for over 2 years and these payments were never once mentioned to me.  Not very happy about this at all.
