Casual restaurant seems to have been mistaken as a requirement on the staff, not the customers. 

In a far from full restaurant.  Long time to get from door to seat, from seat to drink, from drink to appetizer.The inferno wings are a cruel , dry and salty joke.  Less heat than a jalapeno and drier a Stephen Fry observation given at midday in death valley.   

We both had the same 8oz steak, well one of us may have had because one was frigging tiny.  I seriously feel like punching myself in the gut because we paid the same here as we did at Fresh Wasabi in Glendale the day prior. http://www.yelp.com/biz/fresh-wasabi-glendale
