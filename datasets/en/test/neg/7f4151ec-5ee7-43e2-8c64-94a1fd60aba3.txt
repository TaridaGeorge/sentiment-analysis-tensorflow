With two very good, family run BBQ spots within 7miles of this place, I'm not sure why anyone would go here.  Their BBQ sauce is not homemade, it arrives at the store in bulk, and is no better than something you would find at Safeway.... full of additives, preservatives,  "natural flavoring", and most absurd, GLUTEN.  Skip this place and go to Cooper's or Joe's in Gilbert.
