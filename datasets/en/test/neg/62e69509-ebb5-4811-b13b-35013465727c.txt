I don't understand the attraction to this place. My daughter loves it but she's 11. I keep trying different things in the hope of discovering something edible. Last night I tried pasta and meatballs. The pasta was rubbery. Sauce and meatballs were Way too salty. I ended up asking for a 2nd dinner roll because that was the only edible thing. On the positive side, all of the staff are very nice and attentive.
