Lynn's has the dubious distinction of being the place where I got the second worse mani/pedi of my life.  (The worst pedicure coming at Lauren's in Boston where my foot was stabbed and I bled for 40 minutes...)  While there was no bloodshed at Lynn's the manicure was awful!  Every single nail on my finger bubbled to some degree, some to a really horrible degree.  The pedicure started chipping after 5 days.  I actually had to get another mani/pedi when I got to Vegas because this one was so horrible.   It was definitely not worth the price.  Be forewarned- their pedicures are pretty much a la carte and they only do cash tips.
