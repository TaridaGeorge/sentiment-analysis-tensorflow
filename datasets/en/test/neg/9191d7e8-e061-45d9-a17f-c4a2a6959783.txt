PetsMart groomers are serious losers. They've lost the paperwork twice. They called a phone number I didn't give them--twice, so it's not their fault they can't get in touch with me, right? Pay big $$ extra to get the nails trimmed, and they don't trim the nails on the back feet. They use a choking collar on dogs while grooming so now two of my dogs have trachea problems. If you hate your dog and don't value your time, this is the perfect place to learn where "huffers" go after rehabilitation.
