Let me give you some bullets of tonight's visit:

*We asked for lemons twice in our water, but ultimately had to get them ourselves from the bar.

*We waited 1 hour for our food. The waitress told us that the kitchen got slammed, but a large table that came in after us got served before us. Clearly, she forgot to input our order and then lied.

*I ordered a burger medium-well, and it came out pretty much raw. When we showed it to the manager, his jaw nearly hit the floor. He could not believe that it was that pink in the middle.

*We were never offered drink refills

*Our table was never checked once we had food

Sorry, Goldies, but you have failed. 

I would say that if you are going here, just stick to beer.
