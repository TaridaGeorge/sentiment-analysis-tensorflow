I'm sorry to say that this place was a major disappointment.  I have never walked away from a restaurant actually wanting my money back.  This is far from authentic Mexican food and was literally flavorless.  The meat was dry, the salsa tasted like tomato sauce, and the rice was way over cooked.  All in all, I will never go there again and highly recommend that people don't go there unless they want a tasteless plate of mush...  I had the Classico burrito meal with the spicy beans and pork and my fiance had the chicken taquitos.  It was a waste of $20
