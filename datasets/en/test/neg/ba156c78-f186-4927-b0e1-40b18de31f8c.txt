So let me preface this one star with the fact that we never did eat here. The reason is because despite the fact that the website says they close at 9:30 on Saturday, they actually were closed by 8:00 when we went there....TWICE! Note to Au Petit Four, this is 2011 and either update your website or inform people if you close early because it is slow. We drove from Southern Scottsdale to Arcadia and it was a waste of time. Also, waste of groupon money!
