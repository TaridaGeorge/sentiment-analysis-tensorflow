I met up with some buddies here and the service was non-existent , it took the server 20 minutes from the time I took a seat to get my drink order another 15 minutes to take my food order. I think it took her this long because she was chatting away with other employees and ignoring my friends and I. After eating the chard wings we waited 45 minutes for the check I got fed up and it took the manager to give us a refill on our drinks. We were there for 2.5 hours most of the time was waiting for the server to get our orders and to give us the check. Horrible service horrible food , I suggest you go elsewhere I will never eat here again .
