Wow, I haven't ever had Vietnamese food that wasn't at the least ok. With enough sriracha, sambal, and fish sauce, you make just about anything taste good enough to eat. Unfortunately, all the sauces, garnishes, and prayers couldn't help me at Saigon Nites. It's not so much that it's flavorless food here, it's just funky.I couldn't tell if my pho was rancid, but it tasted that way. The appetizer sampler platter was nothing but "from the box" frozen selections most likely created by some giant corporation in Nebraska and intended for the frozen food section at your local grocery store. On a positive note however, my tab for soup and frozen "delicacies" only dented my cash roll 52 bucks....WTF???
