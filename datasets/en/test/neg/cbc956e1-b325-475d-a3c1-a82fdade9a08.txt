I had lunch outdoors at the Delux on Saturday (2/13/10) and ordered the Delux Burger. My burger (medium temperature) was undercooked and since the waiter didn't check to see how everything was tasting in a timely maner I asked for the check when he finally did take time out of his busy day to check on me. I was also pissed because there was a group of 8 people hovering next to me by the railing waiting for a table to open up outside. In short, the ambience does not match the hefty price of the meal.
