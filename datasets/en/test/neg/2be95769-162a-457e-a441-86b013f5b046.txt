I've been here three times and each time I tell myself I'm not going to bother coming back...

I've had the Caesar Salad before, BAD.

Today I had the wildflower salad.  It was so blah and small.  Especially for the high prices.

There's always a long wait to order and an even longer wait for the food to come out.  I don't know why I bother coming back.
