Our three year old big screen television suddenly just turned itself off and wouldn't come back on. We know it's likely not a good investment to fix a television these days, so we went on a search for a new one. One stop was Best Buy. We couldn't find an employee to help us and when I searched afar, I found two employees conversing. I apologized for interrupting, but apparently my apology was not accepted as the gal who "helped" us was useless and it was obvious she didn't want to help anyone. We excused her and we bought a television at Costco instead. The guy at Costco was extremely helpful!!
