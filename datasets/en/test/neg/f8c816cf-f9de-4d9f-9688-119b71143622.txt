My wife and I took a trip from the mid west to California, and decided to stop at several restaurants featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.  Of the four we visited, two were ok (nothing special) one was bad and one (Over Easy) was absolutely horrible.  We ordered pancakes and a side of crispy bacon - we got overcooked, hard as a rock pancakes and undercooked bacon.  How can you screw up pancakes and bacon?  McDonalds has better food.  Heck I can cook better than that. And we haven't even talked about the unfriendly service.   All told, we have been to six restaurants featured on triple-D and the best only rate three stars and most are one or two stars.  Our new motto: If Guy Fieri recommends it - avoid it.
