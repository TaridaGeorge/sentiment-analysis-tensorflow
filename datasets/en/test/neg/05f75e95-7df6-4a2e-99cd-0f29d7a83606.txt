I walked into Petco today to buy some dog biscuits. They didn't have my biscuits but I witnessed the most horrific training methods that I have seen in a long time. The trainer was using a modified choke chain and hanging this puppy for not staying. I spoke to the manager and he informed me all Petco locations use the same training methods. He told me it was actually considered positive training. I knew better since I train dogs in agility. I told him I would never be shopping at Petco again.
