Driving by on my way home one night, pulled in on a whim and ordered  a steak as take out. Pictured dinner without fuss and a little tv. Unfortunately after 2 bites (one for starters and a second to be sure) I threw it in the garbage. Didn't taste fresh - could have been the grill wasn't clean, but not exactly sure.  Just an odd taste. The sweet potato on the side was beyond mushy, almost watery.  Wait staff was nice, but of course that's not enough to keep me coming back.
