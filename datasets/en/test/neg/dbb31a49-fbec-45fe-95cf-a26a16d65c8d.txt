Do I have to give it a 1 star?

Don't be fooled by the fancy remodeling. Everyone that works here, EVERYONE, is a trashy douche. Do not expect to be treated like a human being by ANY of the employees, including management. Every time I'm here, I have issues with them and their attitude. I will never ever go here again and I will disown all my friends who do. If you are thinking of going here, please contact me and I swear I will give you $5 if you re-think it. Or I will go with you- but not to bowl... To vandalize and terrorize. I hate Brunswick.
