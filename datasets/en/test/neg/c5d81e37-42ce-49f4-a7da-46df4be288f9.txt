AGAIN, BUYER BEWARE. This company seems to have no problem breaking the law. A.R.S.  44-1522(A)It also seems the only way that one can get mark to reply is when it's public. The only reason this company has a so called flawless BBB rating is because of the short time lines allowed to respond. Also, if you want to learn of the BBB then go to u tube and type in BBB. Do you know that they gave the terrorist group Hamas an A- rating. So it seems that a company of which you only need a credit card for a rating has a seriously flawed system. They are so involved with rating other companies that they can spend the time to look at themselves. If you Google AZ Laser you will find other complaints.
