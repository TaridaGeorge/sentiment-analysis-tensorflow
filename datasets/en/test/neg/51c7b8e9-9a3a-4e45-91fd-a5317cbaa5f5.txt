This place is terrible, I have been here twice and I do not plan to come here ever again. 

The valet crap is a joke, everyone wants to flaunt their "so called" money and cars pffff! 

The guys at this place are douche bags, I think women have more luck meeting a "real guy" at a gay bar. lol

The bartenders are overbearing and slutty, the 2 times that I have been here, I have seen numerous bartenders slip phone numbers to married men right underneath their wife's noses! I mean come on!

I have to say this place really sucks, tons of fake, fake, fake people. This place is nothing but a competition to the most elite, superficial,  people of the world  

The ultimate epitome bar of Scottsdale hands down.

I give it 2 thumbs down
