I hate this starbucks. They take FOREVER!!!!!! Who was the genus who designed this drive through? They can't do both at the same time or something. It always takes forever to get anything. The drive through is a bit quicker than getting out but I prefer not to idle and pollute phx more than it already is. So this place sucks balls and I am not going back again! Never had a really bad person but I did not really notice. 
HATE THIS PLACE!!! HATE IT!!!!
