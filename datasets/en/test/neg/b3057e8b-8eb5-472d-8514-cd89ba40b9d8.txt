Oh jesus their sushi is uncommonly awful. I'm somewhat proud of Arizona sushi, as it seems sushi purveyors try so hard to make people forget we're landlocked, and they often succeed. Not so here at Ichiban. They seemingly exalt our not-next-to-the-ocean situation in quality AND quantity. Not only is the fish putrid, but in the tiniest sliver portions I've seen. 

Pass.
