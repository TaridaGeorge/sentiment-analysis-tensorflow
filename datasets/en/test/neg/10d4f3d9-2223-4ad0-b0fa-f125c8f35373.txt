I hate it when it takes 15 minutes to get a cup of coffee.
I hate it when i don't ever get a second cup of coffee after waiting so long to get the first.
I hate it when you get swedish pancakes, and they overcook them so they're hard and crispy.
I hate it when places serve you sausage patties that were cooked a day or two ago, then reheated (and completely dried) for your breakfast.
I hate it when your server speaks barely enough english to get by.  
I hate it when breakfast places only carry sweet and low ("they just have the pink kind? really??") instead of equal or splenda. What decade is this?

This location is by far the worst i've ever been to.
