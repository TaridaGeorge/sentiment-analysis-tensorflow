I HATE Sprouts.  I see lots of people shopping here and I don't get it.  Their produce isn't refrigerated, and in the summer time in Phoenix, this is a necessity.  The store circular advertises incredibly low prices.  The problem is, the food comes from Mexico.  You wouldn't dare drink water from Mexico unless it was bottled from some place other than Mexico, so why in the world would anyone buy anything made there?  If drinking water is contaminated, how good could the water be that's irrigating plants?
