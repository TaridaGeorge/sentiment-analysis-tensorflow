By the time I got seated (not at a table, but at the bar, in a group of 4, so we couldn't even talk to each other) after 5 hours, we were so WASTED from drinking in the "pen" next door that any pizza would have been good.  I think they mask the average-ness of their pizza by making sure you are drunk by the time you get to eat it.  OVERRATED.
