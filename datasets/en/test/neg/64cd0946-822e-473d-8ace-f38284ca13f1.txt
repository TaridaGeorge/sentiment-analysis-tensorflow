There are few resources in Arizona for dancers, actors and performers, so it's best to order online if you have the time to wait for shipping. Dee's Dancewear is overpriced and because they know they are the only game in town, their customer service (and return policies) have suffered.
In an emergency situation, you're better suited going to Mischa's Dancewear on 33rd Ave and Bell or Capezio's in Scottsdale. Otherwise, order online and steer clear of this establishment when possible.
