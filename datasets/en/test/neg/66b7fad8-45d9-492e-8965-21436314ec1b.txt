No bueno. I remember coming here when I was a kid and thinking the food was pretty good. I took the wife a few months back and had to apologize for how bad it was. The service was very slow and the place was empty except for maybe 2 regulars. There were several people coming to pick up so I was hoping that was a good sign. It wasn't. It's a shame what some of these restaurants are serving and the people just seem to be lapping them up without knowing anything different. We'll the wife had a taco and an enchilada I believe and she refused to finish either of them. I had a burro and didn't finish mine either. The flavor was not good nor was the ingredients. Very bland and unimpressive. I will not come back.
