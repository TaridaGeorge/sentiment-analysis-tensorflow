this place is horrible.food is terrible. the frozen appetizers comes out still cold and half thawed. way overpriced. lousy pours on alcohol. i would never go near this place on the weekends and have to deal with all the douchebaggery. if you make it on a weekday for reverse happy hour you can score a 90 schilling or a decent IPA for $3, honestly no sense in going here even if all your buddies are super horny, might as well just skip the overpriced bs and just buy them a lap dance at the strip club. i guarentee you they will enjoy it more than going to a horrible creation of an "irish" hooters.....
