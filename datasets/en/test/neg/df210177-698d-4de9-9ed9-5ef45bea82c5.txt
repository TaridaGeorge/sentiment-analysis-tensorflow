Bad service - super long wait. This place was empty- NOBODY was in there. We waited 2.5 hours to be seen; and the doctor was a JOKE. She moved so slow; she finally got in our room - said nothing remarkable. Read of her computer screen... was so unhelpful. Avoid this place like the Black Plague. That doctor needs to be seen mental health issues.
