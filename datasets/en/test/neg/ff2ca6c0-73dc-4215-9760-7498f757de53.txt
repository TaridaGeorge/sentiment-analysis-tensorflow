The customer service here is outrageous! I will never be back here and recommend you take your money somewhere else. There are plenty of rock climbing gyms that you would be better off giving your business to a better and friendlier company. I walked out after 40 minutes at the front desk with out ever rock climbing and not getting my money back. Extremely disappointing experience for what was supposed to be a fun adventure.
