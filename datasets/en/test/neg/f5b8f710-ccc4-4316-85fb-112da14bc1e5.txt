Wow. Yeah, this isn't really my place. Lots of karaoke. Lots of weirdness. Not so bueno. I was in the bathroom and overheard two women discuss loudly the fact that their boyfriends had very specific physical problems which I would have preferred never having to overhear. The bartenders are nice, the regulars not so much. No Bombay Sapphire and the bartenders didn't even notice they had a Bombay dry gin getting dusty in the corner when I requested the Sapphire version.  I admit, I got out of here in a hurry. Probably won't be coming back.
