This is a really good pizza, but its not worth the wait or the nasty hurry you up staff.  If Chris Bianco wants to work short days and not be open two days a week and close in the summer plus only be able to seat 60 people that is fine but people should start walking away when the wait is over 30 minutes.  There is way too many places in Phoenix and the surrounding towns that offer great food at great prices without the wait.
