So we got the groupon and reserved a good table. The music was awesome and the service was fast. Our entire group had a good time... Until the check came. Each of our tables paid our tabs and tipped at least 18%. Everything was cool until the waitress came back and spoke with our tables individually and solicited us for larger tips!!  She kept asking if her service wasn't good, and if it wasn't she wouldn't have gotten nearly what she got. She wouldn't go away and kept insisting we didn't tip her. I've never been solicited for tips when we obviously gave her enough.... And its not the first time I've heard this happen at the Big Bang. Its like they were taught to do that. We will never be back.
