No.

The first night I went there was 30-thousand dollar millionaire look-at-my-new-haircut night, with specials for check-out-my-new-poof f*ck you i'm hot girls.  

Seriously - this place is too cool for itself.  Though the bartender made us some bomb shooters, they were 8 bucks a piece!  Also, I really dont come to a downtown bar to see little skanks wearing "catholic school" outfits serving overpriced drinks to the wanna be hot guys only, completely ignoring us chicks.  No thanks
