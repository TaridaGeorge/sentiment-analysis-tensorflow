I was very disappointed in the customer service that I received from Jiffy Lube.  I went in with a coupon for a 29.99 oil change and walked out pay $80 for services that were not discussed beforehand.  When dealing with mechanic's I've always been skeptical and this place did not change my mind.  I am in need of an honest mechanic that isn't required by their employeer to upcharge the customer.  I will never return to this place again.
