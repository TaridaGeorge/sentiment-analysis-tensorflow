Unsafe!  The battery on the door lock on my room door apparently died and would not take my key card.  The maintenance man met me at the door, jiggled the window for a few seconds to open it and then reached into the room to manually open the door!  Any criminal could do that in the same amount of time.  If you stay here brimg some of those thumb screw window locks.

Other than that, the free breakfast was ok.
