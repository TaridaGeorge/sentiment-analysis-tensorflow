The pizza was good at one time...... what happened? 
This is the saltiest stuff I ever ate.............did the chef change about 8 years ago....  and show up with nothing more than a salt shaker..... the only thing you taste is salt......... I know it is the sauce.... so everything must be this salty.........maybe that cookie is good..... Is that salty too?????
definitely pass on this one...... yuck.......
