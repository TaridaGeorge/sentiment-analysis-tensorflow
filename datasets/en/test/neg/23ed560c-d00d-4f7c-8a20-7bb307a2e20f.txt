They was good when I first went. I even brought them another client then another person I recommended had a horrible experience with Jenny. She was not satisfied and was told to come back. Well when she came back the man (owner?) refused to redo her nails then Rosie was upset and yelling in the people that I recommended face. Very rude and would not recommend! Poor customer service! At a salon you should feel like a queen...Don't bother giving these people your business!!
