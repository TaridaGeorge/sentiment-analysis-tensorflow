If your into over cooked eggs and your hash browns drowning in oil accompanied with a server with a chip on her shoulder, then this is the place for you.
I will never return and i recommend you reconsider before going and dropping the money they are asking for this sub-par food. Go to Denny's, your food will be prepared much better and taste just as equal with probably better service. At you wont have toworry about your server reach over you and across the table to pick up your straw wrapper. I mean really! Ask me to hand it to you, DON'T reach across!
