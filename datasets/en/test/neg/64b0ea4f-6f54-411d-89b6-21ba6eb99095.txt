The bar itself, for drinks only, is ok.  It's very alpha-male but ok.....I can live with that.

The food is TERRIBLE.  Myself and three others ordered different items.  I got the pulled pork...and it was about as good as wendy's.  Even the hamburgers were below average.  Not just me saying this...three of my buddies as well.

bottom line -- ok for a beer or two but skip the food for sure.
