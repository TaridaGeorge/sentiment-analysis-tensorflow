The waitress was very friendly and helpful.  However the food was not worth the price I thought I was eating at Peter Piper's with the quality that was served.  I ordered the HUGE portobello mushroom and received two small ones that were flattened  The only thing worth going back for was the beer on tap since they do not produce it.  I would say over all the best part was walking out the door.  The pricing on the menu was like a Scottsdale restaurant but without the atmosphere.  I would not recommend this place to anyone.
