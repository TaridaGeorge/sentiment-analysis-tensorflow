DONT BOTHER!
The majority of women who work here are very rude.  I have spent THOUSANDS of dollars here in the last 3 years and when trying to us a free 5$ coupon here that wouldnt scan, I was accused of already using the coupon and trying to double use.  Are you kidding me!  If you dont want to offer the savings Babies R Us, then DONT!  
Not the first time myself, sister or mother was treated poorly here.  Sad, but true.  
This store needs new management to come in and do some housecleaning with the staff.  At this point, I WILL not shop here and will pay more elsewhere just to avoid this place!  You have seen my last dollar Babies R Us.
