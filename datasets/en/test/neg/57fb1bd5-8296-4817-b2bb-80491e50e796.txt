Oh. My. God. This place is awful. Everything ordered tasted like it was just opened out of the can and thrown in the microwave. The staff doesn't seem to really know whats going on. Stupid location. The only thing good about this place is that when i was finished, i was able to go to the frozen yogurt place a few doors down. It's a shame that this plaza is home next to TWO awful restaurants (babbo and this one.) 

in conclusion, YUCK.
