Very disappoint in the burger!! Very sloppy presentation. Quality control isn't there. I got 3/4 of a patty and very little grilled onions and mushrooms were from a can!!! I ordered lettuce but it was sparse, too. The Burger had no flavor. However, loved the french fries and the cool soft drink machine was fun to operate. Didn't like all the yelling from the cooks. Would rather have had an IN and Out burger any day! This is certainly NOT the best burger in the Phoenix Metro area when we have Joe's Farm Grill, Delux, Zinburger and Bluburger. I don't desire to ever return and will head to IN and Out the next time for a quick burger meal that has these Five Guys beat in quality and value.  Don't waste your money.
