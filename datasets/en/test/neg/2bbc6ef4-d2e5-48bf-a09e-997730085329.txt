I bought 6 cupcakes and1 Salted Caramel nut bar
The cupcakes I reviewed on olliecakes. This review is for the Nut bar.

The buttery shortbread hardly made it out of the bag. It was falling away from the caramel and pecans before I could get to it. Thats annoying. the taste of the caramel pecans was ok to goodish. But having it almost detatch from the shortbread is a no no. It was crumbs EVERYwhere... To bad it it had stuck together I may have given it 2 or 3 stars. 

also, I'm tired of seeing tip jars EVERYWHERE! The guy behind the counter boxed up 6 cupcakes- and 1 nut bar, wasn't all that friendly to me ( was to the teenagers girls ahead of me) and he moved on to the next customer before I even signed my receipt......Where would a tip play into that????
