I've had very bad luck at this location.  The most recent time I tried the "call ahead" reservation, gave my name, and time I'd be arriving.  They took my info an said they would see me soon.

I get to the restaurant, wait at the line to check-in.  The walk-up customer ahead of me was given a 50 minute wait time.  I give my name, they look up me, and tell me that I'd have a 45 minute wait time...whaaat????  I said I was on the call-ahead list, the girl says yes you are, 45 minute wait.  I ask what is the point of the call-ahead, she just shrugs and gives me a take-it-or-leave-it look, so we left.  Walked over to the blu-burger grill, walked in and was seated right away.
