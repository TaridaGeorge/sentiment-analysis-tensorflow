If your buying a Mastercool evap from Home Depot do not have Delta Mechanical install it!   Less then a week after having Delta out a second time after installation and the Mastercool was supposably fine, it started making quite a bit of noise. I hired a heating & cooling company to see why the Mastercool was making so much noise. They found that it was not level, one side was an inch higher, the belt was too tight, the water level was too high causing a lot of water drainage out the pvc pipe.  Besides all of that they left the cookie tray laying up on the roof and didn't supply a customer care booklet nor the warranty card with the cooler.  I must say though they do excell at blowing smoke up your ass!
