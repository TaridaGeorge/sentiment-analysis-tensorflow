I've been here about 100 times and seen some really good bands. The Nazi-like control that the owner, Lucky Man Productions, has on this place always ruins it for me. Pretending to be a "local indie" promoter with exclusive rights to this weird dome of a music hall, they charge you and arm and a leg for everything. Ticket fees, handling fees, expensive drinks, even more expensive hot dogs and to top it off, they charge you to park there, in the dingy, hobo-centric underbelly of the 202 freeway. It's never a pleasant experience. For all it's worth, the sound in this place is just OK, but the sight lines are good for a place that holds 1,000 people.
