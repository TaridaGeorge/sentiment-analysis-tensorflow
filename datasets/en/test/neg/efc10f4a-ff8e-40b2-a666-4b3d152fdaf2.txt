The last time we went there we were so grossed out by the staff that we will never return.  A waitress sat at a table rolling silverware into napkins.  She touched EVERY piece of silverware at the top while also wiping her nose.  Then, a waitress in the kitchen was trying to pick something out of her teeth... had her mouth wide open while digging in there.  We asked for the manager and the waitress stood at our table like a big bully wanting to know why we wanted the manager.  It was a truly a GROSS experience.  We haven't been to any Village Inn since.... that's how bad it was.
