Probably the worst, most over priced food I have ever had!!!!!!! Their Salad was straight out of a bag, the fries were cold and rubbery, the cowboy burger was over cooked, and the bacon was undercooked. How can this place even be in business?? I could have made a better meal with my arms cut off and my eyes gouged out. Save your money and go next door to Durant's.
