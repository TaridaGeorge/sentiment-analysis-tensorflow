I would give it zero. I don't understand how this can be a brand. they dont DO anything. their clothes have NO design touch to them at all. You can't even count the colors since they do every color so they dont really have to think about that either. I'm sorry but 50 bucks for a boring cheap hoodie just isn't worth my time.
