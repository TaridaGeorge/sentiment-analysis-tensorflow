Please stay away from this establishment.  I've purchased "indian" hair from Sunnys several times and with each visit the disappointment meter increases.  The hair tangles, my hair dresser tried to dye a piece and it caught on fire (seriously I have pictures)  and the closure pieces mat when washed.  Closure pieces priced at $220 should do nothing other than lay there flawless, and $180 for 4 oz of hair should never shed like kittens. The customer service is lack luster at best, manager is mysteriously never around to attend to client concerns and the girls working there are well, let me leave that alone...  If you want real Indian here, this is NOT the place to go...
