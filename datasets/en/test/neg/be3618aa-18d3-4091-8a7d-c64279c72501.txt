To start with, I tried 'Idli' (with Chutney and Sambar). The Idli was way off course and actually didnt taste like one! The chutney probably had 10% coconut (as compared to 100% coconut that I have come across many Udupi Cafe's across US) and the Sambhar....absolutely pathetic!!! Moving to main course, all the curries were highly reduced and were not that delectable. I am keeping this review short and sweet because you cant write much about how pathetic food was for the price that I paid. I am never going back to this place any time in my life.
