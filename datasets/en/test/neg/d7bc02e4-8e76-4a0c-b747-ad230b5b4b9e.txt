most mongolian grills allow you to decide how to eat your single-bowl (no refill) order.  

instead of following this custom, yc's prohibits "sharing"

not only does their large chalkboard announce this prohibition upon entering, it also says "TELL THEM TO GET THEIR OWN!"

i would never be so rude to my date.

for $10.95 for one bowl (this perhaps the highest priced mongolian grill i have seen) i should be able to "share"

i questioned the cashier about this policy and was told "our sales are based on the number of bowls we can sell to our customers..so we don't allow sharing"

amazing...

you can, however, get the portion to go...

so, we had to get the portion to go and eat it outside and away from the yc's.


please take down your rude message (and lower your price) or i'll never return.
