I agree with Alist R.'s review above.  I just got back from Prestige Carwash, the only reason why I went is for the coupons I get in the mail.  So I pull up and guy #1 is trying to sell me on this Express Carwash for $39, after 5 min of saying "no" to this guy, guy #2 tries to sell me on getting the cracks on my windshield filled in, that was another 5 min of saying "no".  The wash itself isn't that good.  It's NOT a hand car wash, they run your car through a drive through car wash and have some guys do a quick dry and run Armor-all on the dash while missing some spots.
