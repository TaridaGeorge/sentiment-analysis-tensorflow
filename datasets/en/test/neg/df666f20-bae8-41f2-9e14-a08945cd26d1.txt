It's a dive bar redone in wood. Big deal. Cute, maybe. The service is horrible. The alcohol selection stinks. Bartenders with major attitude. God forbid they have to walk out from behind the bar before a server gets there. I guess we weren't drunk enough to see the 5 glowing stars everyone else does. Blah...
