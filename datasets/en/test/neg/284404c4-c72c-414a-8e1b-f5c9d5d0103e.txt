At first this seemed like a good business.  I printed out the 10% coupon that I found online but the technician that came to my house did not honor the coupon.  They also refused to give me an itemized receipt.... be aware that there is a lot of room for manipulation in their pricing.

Sometimes you are better off buying a new dryer than getting a technician to come over and fix your old one!
