Wow... I had to share tonight's experience....
We stopped in to get some take out ...for the 30th time....
My wife told the owner about the terrible Chai Tea from the last time...
Instead of giving her a $2 tea and saying "Sorry" she gave my wife a lesson on how precise the tea is always made!
Then we both commented on the Lettuce Rolls when we got home...
That's 99% of what was in there!
Hmmmm ... Why was there one couple in your place for dinner at 7 pm on a Friday night?!?!?
Thai House is lookin' a little closer to Fountain Hills from now on!!!
