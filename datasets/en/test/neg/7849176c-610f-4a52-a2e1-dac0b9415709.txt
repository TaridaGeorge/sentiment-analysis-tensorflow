"Asian tapas and sake bar".  Sounds good, right?

The food was edible, but besides the tiny (and expensive) portions, there was nothing else memorable about the food here.

The decor is modern, but I felt like there was no vibe to the place.  Why go here when there are so many better establishments to go to?

Mmm mediocre and overly expensive food!  Eek!  Methinks not.
