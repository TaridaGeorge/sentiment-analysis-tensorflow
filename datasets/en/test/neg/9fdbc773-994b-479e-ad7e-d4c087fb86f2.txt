I can't think of anything positive to say about this place. For the quality of food you get here, I think this place is overpriced. My boyfriend got the fillet and said it tasted like it had been refrozen then cooked. I don't know what that tastes is like, but I guess horrible. I had the salmon and it was flavorless and overcooked so was the rice. The bread didn't taste fresh and I wondered if it was just bought at the grocery store and heated up in the micro. Our server was slow and ignored us most of the night even though there were maybe 4 other tables seated in the place. And the singer was well, different... Won't go back here and won't recommend this place to others.  :(
