After reading all of the positive comments about this place I thought it would be fun to try with the family.  I have to say I was truly disappointed.  The pizza had little or no sauce, the chicken parm sandwich was very dry and I had asked for extra sauce but it still came out dry.  The fettuccine alfredo was actually very tasty, but the spaghetti and meatballs was not good at all, very overdone and burnt tasting.  Overall I cannot recommend this restaurant, although they do have quite a nice selection of italian groceries.
