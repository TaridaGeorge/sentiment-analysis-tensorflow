I don't like to criticize Art not being an artist, nor music not having the balls to get on stage myself. That being said I went to Phix last night to see a band, the place was lacking AC, the bathrooms were disgusting, the sound sucked, the art....
I paid $8 bucks for that torture and that hour of my life I will not get back.
