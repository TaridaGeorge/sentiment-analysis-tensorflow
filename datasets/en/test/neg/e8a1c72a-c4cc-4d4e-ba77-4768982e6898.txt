Smallest buffet ever. The food is just OK with almost no selections. Why go to a buffet with no choices. The noodles were burnt and the pork overcooked.  Staff is friendly enough tho. The Guy started serving on buffet line to control portions....it wasn't even busy (surprisingly enough) that is just soo cheap...c'mon now...really? Totally and completely not worth the stop at all. I give it a big fat BLEH!
