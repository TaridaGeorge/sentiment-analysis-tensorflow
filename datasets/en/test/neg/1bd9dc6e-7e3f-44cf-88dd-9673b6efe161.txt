I'll keep this simple - we ordered 2 sampler plates, and all the meats were very dry (brisket, chicken, ribs, and pulled pork).  I could say we were bbq aficionados from Austin to try and make this review more relevant, but when the meat is this dry - it doesn't take a bbq snob to know this place stinks.

I did think the sides were okay (mac and cheese, cheesy potatoes, apple crisp), but we came for bbq.
