Nope nope nope nope nope.

The coffee might be good and the decor may be trendy

HOWEVER BEWARE!!!

HUGE "hip-ster" crowd.

I've never been so amused in my life!!

The crowd, huddled over their laptops mostly "pretend" to be working on them while others scoff at why one wears a Fruit of the loom T-shirt instead of an American Apparel. 
 
Snotty, snobby and downright disgusting "wool cap" wearing crowd who act like wanna be (but can't afford to be) Californians jam the place tight.

But, not my problem that your not "understood" or more obvious unemployed.

If you're looking to go to be "seen" having a cup of coffee I recommend Starbucks on Robertson here in Los Angeles, at least there it's okay and expected.

And you can do all the "freelance" work you want YIPPPEEEE!
