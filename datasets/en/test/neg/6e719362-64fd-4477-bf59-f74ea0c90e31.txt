As a Lux devotee, it took me a long time to check this place out, but I went in with an open mind.

My drink was so bad (iced soy latte) that I'm going to be real generous here and assume that Something Was Amiss or the barista was new or something.  I ended up having to toss it.  How did they mess up something so basic?  HOW.

The girl at the register was not friendly.  At all.  The wait for the drink seemed absurdly long considering I was the only person there (again with the new barista theory).  I expected a lot more from the interior.  It was all right, quite airy, but basically bland and boring.

Microscopically cheaper than Lux, but I regret wasting my money there and won't be back.
