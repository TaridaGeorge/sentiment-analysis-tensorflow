RUDE!!!! I didn't bother to even set an appointment because the person who answered the telephone sounded like she was completely put out having to answer the phone.  When I told her what I thought of her phone etiquette she said "Sorry!" and hung up on me.  Yeaaaah, that's the way to boost your business in a slumping economy!  No thanks!
