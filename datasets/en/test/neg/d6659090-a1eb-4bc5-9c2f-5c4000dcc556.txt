Terrible store. It's not well stocked, the shelves are a freaking MESS, and the worst, the WORST is the area in the front for printing, copying, etc. It looks like a bomb went off in there no matter when you go in. Clearly no one ever cleans up or restocks anything. The employees are unhelpful and seem to hang out leaning all over the counters chatting and texting. 

Not impressed. Sadly, the FedEx Kinkos in the area isn't that much better. Go for a pack of highlighters, but not for the service, variety, or cleanliness.
