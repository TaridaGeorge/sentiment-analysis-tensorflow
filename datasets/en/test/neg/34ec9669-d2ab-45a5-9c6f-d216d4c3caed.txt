I am have been coming to native new Yorker since they opened but today the food/wings/service we're horrible the wings there we're so tiny as if the killed a baby chicken the bones were so brittle that it jammed in the side of my mouth the waitress never came back for any refills and to top things off they were not busy.. I am so disappointed with location I specifically requested fresh wings avoid this location 1 star for crappy day here...
