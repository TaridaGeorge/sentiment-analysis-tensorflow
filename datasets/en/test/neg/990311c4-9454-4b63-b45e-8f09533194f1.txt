the only word I have to say is terrible. I would never go back. Service was extremely slow and servers were inattentive and often confused. They mistakenly tried to serve me appetizers I never ordered twice! It took over half an hour for the waiter to take our order and over an hour before we were served.  They also served our main courses and desserts while we had no utensils. Additionally bartenders were extremely rude and sarcastic.
