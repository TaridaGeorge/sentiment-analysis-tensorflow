Ribs- I'd rather eat the ribs out of a hungry man meal. The brisket- ill just do it myself rather then pay these inflated prices. And by the way, if you say the ribs are 6.49 a pound, then give me a pound or less. Not more and then charge me more. I don't see McDonalds weighing their 1/4 pounders and charging you more because it's over a  1/4 of a pound. I paid 8.49 for what the menu said was 6.49. That's BS. Give me the right amount or less. I know good BBQ and this place is sad.
