Terrible service! Our bartender/server was so high on crack and prescription drugs it was unbelievable. Not only could he not form a sentence, he forgot everything. Drinks to the wrong person, forgot to place order, was absolutely freaking Nuts! We just wanted a few drinks, some sushi, and to be gone in about an hour or so. It took forever to get the food. By the time we got it, we needed to go. He had to leave the bar to go to the front to try and ring it up. That took 2 or 3 times...Are you Kidding me? He says as we leave "Tell them I did a good job, as I need some help. A few people have complained about me lately". Really? We tell what appears to be the manager on our way out, all he can say is sorry. I will never go back!
