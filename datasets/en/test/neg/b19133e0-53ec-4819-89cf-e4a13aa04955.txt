This place is awful.  I've tried and tried to like it because it's close to my house, but they have never once gotten our order right, and they burn EVERYTHING.  Tonight was the last time I'll ever have it because after ordering a kid's meal with regular chicken nuggets, they managed to give my toddler burned spicy chicken nuggets with burned french fries.  I understand it's fast food, but it's not THAT difficult.  They just really don't care about the quality of food or the quality of workers.  In an economy like this, I'm sure they could find someone willing to work and do a good job.
