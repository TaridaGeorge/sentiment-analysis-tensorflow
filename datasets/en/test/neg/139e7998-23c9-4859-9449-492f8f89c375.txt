Many of times I've overheard someone in passing talk about how "RA has the best sushi, ever!"

I've only eaten here once. It was one of the first places I ate after moving here from L.A. and man was I dissapointed. The first bite I took into the my tuna sashimi, I was greeted with a nice frozen center. Nothing like fresh...uhhhh....frozen sushi. I sent that back. 

It's horribly overpriced too, not to mention douche/boob job central. I'd never pay that much for shitty sushi again.
