There are better bars close by. I went to catch up with a friend and to have a few drinks.
Food was disgusting (we took our waitresses suggestion) 
Service was ok (until we spoke up of our dislike of the food)
We ordered the spinach dip and we got a lukewarm bowl of white velveta with bits of "spinach" (could easily have been dried parsley due to texture and taste). Our drinks were brought to the table where 1/2 of them were spilled out onto the table (the napkins consumed as much alcohol as I did). Needless to say I will not be returning anytime, ever.
