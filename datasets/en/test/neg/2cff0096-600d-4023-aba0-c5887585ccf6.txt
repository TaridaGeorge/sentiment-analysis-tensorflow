Cracker Barrel has been our family's favorite breakfast restaurant for 30 years. We've eaten at this Cracker Barrel dozens of times. Not any more. Something changed. They started serving our breakfast cold. We sent it back and it was still served lukewarm. We figured they had a bad day so the next time we politely ask them to make sure our breakfast was served hot. It was servied cold again. We talked to the manager and he apoligized. We tried eating there three more times and every time it was served cold. So, we stopped eating there. We now eat breakfast at the Waffle House where they we watch them make our breakfast and serve it directly to our table HOT. We miss the Cracker Barrel but I expect a hot breakfast and they can't seem to provide a hot breakfast.
