Suffering from a serious case of inconsistency, Flo's has alternately provided some of the best and worst chinese in NoSco. Their lunch special is a steal, with fried wontons, salad with some of my favorite dressing, and a healthy portion of many of your standard offerings. 
Unfortunately, the quality often lacks. Breaded chicken used in a variety of dishes including sweet and sour chicken, etc., is almost always too dry to swallow without significant liquid assistance. 
Speaking of assistance, good luck getting any. Wait staff is on par with McDonalds in terms of skill and experience.
Then there are the BUGS. 
Only a mass-production assembly line approach to running a restaurant kitchen can result in the number of undesirable additions that can be found at Flo's. 
If you are repeat customer, it's not a matter of if, but when, you will experience the same nauseating discoveries.
