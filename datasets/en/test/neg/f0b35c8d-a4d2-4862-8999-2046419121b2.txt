Last time I checked, customer service for family and community orientated businesses was supposed to be key.  Unfortunately, the owners of the Sugar Bowl are not equipped to provide any friendliness-factor.

It's okay that the Sugar Bowl doesn't do group events, but the way to communicate that information to your customers isn't "I'm really going to pass. No. I need to interrupt because the answer is no." There are so many ways to communicate a message, but rudeness is a way to lose business fast.

History or no history, the Sugar Bowl has lost this customer for good.
