We were greeted in a friendly manner and promptly seated. Water and menus immediately---went downhill in a hurry.  Waited twenty minutes for the appetizers---my husband's arrived, but mine did not. Waited more-- complained-- was offered a glass of wine. I don't want to be placated with alcohol and excuses about the kitchen. I would like service. My appetizer finally  arrived. Waited another twenty minutes for dinner-- same thing. His arrived; mine wasn't served for another ten minutes. Cold and mediocre. 
THEN we were charged for a bottle of wine when  the only beverage ordered was one glass of wine.

Who needs this with so many good Chinese restaurants in Scottsdale??????
Never again!
