the one star is for the atmosphere. 
i had a very similar experience as Sally M.  ordered the chicken saigon bun and the meat smelled ROTTEN. i had the server take it back and switch the chicken with pork. the pork was under cooked and fatty. sadly, they still charged for the dish. i ended up with an aching tummy all nite and bad case of d. if u want me to make a recommendation, go to any of the standard dive-y vietnamese restaurants.
