I remember Der Wienerschnitzel from literally decades ago. I enjoyed the hot dogs back then. Maybe because I was much younger. 

What a sad excuse for a hot dog I had today. 

I paid $2.59 for the so-called Chicago-style hot dog. It was loaded with relish (should be pickles) and minced onions (Should be fresh onions). There were two UFO peppers off to the side.  I bit into one of them and couldn't even break the skin, instead it squirted all over the table. Two wafer thin tomato slices (should be wedges) and a minuscule wiener.  I mean, I had to look to make sure the dog was even there. The relish overpowered everything else. 

Terrible.

Topping it off, they only serve Pepsi products.
