Got a Jumbo Jack - it tasted like a veggie burger, not 100% beef, tasted like it was full of fillers and only 20% actual beef.  I wonder if certain JITB franchises order their beef from sources that give them beef with fillers to save money.  There is NO WAY pattie was 100% beef.  I could have made a veggie burger at home.

Coke was watered down.

Going back to Wendy's - they never used pink slime, 100% beef.
