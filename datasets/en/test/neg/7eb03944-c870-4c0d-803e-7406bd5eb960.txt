My wife just took our kids here for a haircut, and we found out the gal who had been doing the kids haircuts previously just left. We thought no biggie and just went with it, but it was brutal! Her replacement couldn't stand to cut my kid's hair because he moved a lot and was crying. (He's 2 years old...that's what they do!) So let me get this straight...you want to cut kids hair, but won't do it if they're crying or moving around?  Good luck with that!  After her dirtly looks and complaints, they just left and went to Cool Cuts where they pulled it off like pros.  We won't be back, which is too bad because we've been going there for a while.
