I had a terrible dining experience at House of Tricks. 

I had just given up on a ruben that tasted like it was made of soggy band aids just in time to have the jerk off who either runs or own the place take time out of his day not to apologize for the free lipstick that came with my  glass of ice tea but to tell me that, while sitting on an empty patio, playing This American Life from my iPod was driving the no other diners to distraction.

Maybe the trick here is they charge 10 bucks for a drowned sandwich but throw in the dirty dishes for free.
