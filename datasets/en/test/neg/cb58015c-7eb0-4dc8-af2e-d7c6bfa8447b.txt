My wife and I both ordered a "Greek Gyro". I chose fries for the side, she chose salad. We also bought a side of hummus.

The fries and the pitas were warm and fresh. Unfortunately, this is the best we can say. The fries were dusted with stale parmesan and not salted. The salad was a mix of iceberg and butter lettuce. The gyro meat wasn't bad, just, mediocre. Worse was the watery, flavourless hummus.

Less important, but still off-putting, were the cheap paper plates and the tacky hand-written sign next to the soda fountain insisting "Only 1 refill".

"Bland" sums up our experience.
