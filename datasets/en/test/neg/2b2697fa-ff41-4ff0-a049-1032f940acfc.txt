I would rather take my business to baja fresh.   Margaritas are weak and overpriced, why would u top them off with soda water...took one sip and sent it back...they didn't even take it off my tab. ..come on. ..charging for chips and salsa.....tried the burritos and tacos...both bland and small portions. Been there four times and everytime i regret wasting my money.
