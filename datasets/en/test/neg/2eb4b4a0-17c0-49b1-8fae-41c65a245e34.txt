Took my vehicle here two weeks ago because the coolant light was coming on intermittently.  Before even looking at the car, the rep indicated perhaps the light was malfunctioning.  (I had just assumed the coolant was low).  After inspecting the car, they quoted $868 because coolant was leaking and the light was malfunctioning.  Due to the high price, I went to ACE Automotive in Gilbert for a second opinion.  Interestingly enough, they put it under pressure for 1.5 hrs and there was NO leak and the sensor was not malfunctioning.  Only needed to be topped off with coolant, which they did for free.  I will not go back to Greulich's.
