I've been to this store over and over again because a friend keeps dragging me along, but have never found anything that tempted me in the least.  Much of the stuff is obviously worn out, damaged, or passed over for a good reason.  This isn't a necessary feature of a "last call" type of store--I just think this particular store is useless.
