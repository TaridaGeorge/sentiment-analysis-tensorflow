Had to be the worst customer service experience I have had in a long time. It still blows my mind that I have to make all the arrangements to have bathroom installs. The fact that every employee in my area was playing "grab ass" and not willing to help us is just ridiculous.
 Left and went to Lowe's where they bent over backwards to help us, made my purchase there and will continue to shop there.
