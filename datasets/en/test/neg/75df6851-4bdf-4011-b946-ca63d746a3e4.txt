When I went there (Ive been multiple times) off the bat there is hardly anyroom. If you are in a wheel chair, you literaly wont be able to eat there. Which is fine for me but still uncomfortable.
I  poured the soy sauce out, it was black and old. 
When soy goes bad it turns black, taste bitter and like pure salt. They had obviously never changed out the soy in their bottles. It goes bad in a day w/o refridgeration.  For me this is a sign of poor food handling. 

The fish had a very fishy flavor and a terrible texture. Actually I have got minor food poisoning there 2 times. 

Go to Roka Akor if you are looking for fresh creative food. AMAZING, I will never go anywhere else.

They use no hydrogenated oils or preservatives. Freshest cleanest tasting food ever.!!!!
