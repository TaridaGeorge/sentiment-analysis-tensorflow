The room was nice. But, the place is a maze. We asked the front desk where we could get prime rib and they sent us to there restaurant down the hill and they were wrong. We walked almost half a mile for nothing so I called the front desk to complain and they hung up on me. At that point we grabbed are stuff and checked out. They kept my money too. The pool also had a water beetle swimming around in it. Drinks were over priced and there computer was down so we had to wait 25 min to settle are tab. I was with a big group and they over charged us from the rate we were supposed too get. I would avoid at all cost.
