I've lost all faith in Trader Joe's at this point. They are supposed to be all about the customer experience but I guess that's not profitable anymore. I sent an email to customer service and even though it says I will receive and email back, I never did. Apparently my experience is the norm and negative shopping experiences do not get acknowledged or addressed.
