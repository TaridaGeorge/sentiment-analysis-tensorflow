Mediocre, bland, low quality food topped off with painfully slow service.  I worked in the neighborhood and continued to return occasionally "just in case it's gotten better", for reasons I could never fathom once the plate of abysmal food was placed on the table.  The salsa and rice are usually good, but that's the most I have to offer.
