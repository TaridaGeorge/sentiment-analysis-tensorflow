Sad to say definitely not a fan. Ive experienced much better Mexican for less than half the price. I'd rather get a cheap Crunch Wrap Supreme from TacoBell and save myself a couple bucks. 

The food wasn't necessarily bad it just wasn't good either. So with prices like that you'd be crazy to actually go back when truth is, it just isn't worth it... like at all.
