Very nice venue. Beautiful views. Poor condition rooms. Our suite was missing a light bulb in the main light for the living room, the AC did not work, the bathroom door was about to fall off the hinges and was difficult to close.  The room next to ours had trash from the previous occupants, missing sheets on the pull out bed, and only three towels when they knew there were four occupants. I wouldn't expect this from a Motel 6 let alone a Hilton for $189 a night.
