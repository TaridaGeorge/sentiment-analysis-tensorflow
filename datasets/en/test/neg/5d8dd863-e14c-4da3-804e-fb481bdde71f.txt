So I have gone into this CVS location to fill my prescriptions a few times.  Every time I walk in I am rudely greeted by this older woman with short brown hair who is probably 60 but dresses like she wants to be in her 30's.  I walk in to drop off my scrips and of course no hello ever its just a big sigh and "ARE YOU WAITING TO GET THESE NOW?" I let her know that I would like to wait and she sighed again and rolled her eyes.  If you want rude service without a smile when you are trying to simply fill your scrips go here otherwise stick to your local Walgreens.
