We have purchased yogurt from Golden Spoon on Shea in Scottsdale for several years.  The yogurt is good. Either we didn't notice or the place has become filthy quickly.  It is disgusting. The place is filthy. We have seen bugs (I won't tell you what variety, but one can guess).  The door, windows, mirrors, and display case glass seems to have the same dirt each visit.  The franchise owner, Kyle, obviously doesn't care.  We will not return!
