Employees openly discussed medical history of a young woman who had been taken out by an ambulance in front of other patients. I'm sure that the sick patient would not want that information to be public knowledge as much of the information was quite embarrassing. Also, while waiting the two hours to be seen, doctor gossiped for over 10 minutes about someone in the community with one of the nurses, while a sick child cried and cried in one of the rooms waiting to be seen. I was shocked at the lack of professionalism. I will not be back.
