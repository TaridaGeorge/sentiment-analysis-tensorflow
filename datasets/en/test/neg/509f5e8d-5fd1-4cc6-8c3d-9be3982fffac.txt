i live 4 blocks away from this "ghetto long line safeway" (as seen on facebook check-in).  worst customer "service" ever.  usually only has 2 lines open, 3 when people start blocking the entire front of the store.  i stopped by tonight to buy a few bottles of my favorite alcoholic beverage, went to the shortest line (the "express" line) and was told by the rent-a-cop that this line was closing and that i had to wait in the other line that was 8 carts deep.  

i set my basket down, walked out and drove to Fresh & Easy.  see ya Ghetto Long Line Safeway.
