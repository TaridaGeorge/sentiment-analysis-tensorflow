Oh NO!  A disappointment, again. 

I was too late for lunch and the same old bartender had the same old line while I listened to the same old music from the same old guitar player. OK, so the guitar player is the BEST thing this place has to offer. 

Last time I was there, the bartender also was the cook and the waiter while the owner stood at the end of the bar and sipped from his "water" pitcher. 

Come on now, Cowboy. Saddle up and give us something new on a Sunday afternoon. How 'bout a coupla Cowgirls serving beer and nibbles that don't stop at 4pm. Maybe you could smile once in awhile and welcome your guests and make them happy to stay longer. 

If I could buy your business, I would call it the SILVER SPUR and nothing "RUSTY" about that. Yee Ha!!
