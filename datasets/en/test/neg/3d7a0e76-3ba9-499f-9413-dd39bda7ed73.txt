We ordered the Italian beef with giardiniera and were very disappointed.  We each took a couple of bites, and ended up throwing the rest away and going elsewhere for dinner.

The giardiniera was nothing but diced jalapenos and zucchini, we couldn't taste anything but jalapenos.  We're big fans of spicy food, but there's more to giariniera than jalapenos.  The meat was very tough and dry.  

Overall, we were very, very disappointed.
