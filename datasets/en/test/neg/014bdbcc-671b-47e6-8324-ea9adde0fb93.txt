Waited 20 minutes for a table.  Ordered and waited another 30 minutes before the waiter told us he forgot to put in our order -- "Sorry" was his only platitude.   He came back and said "the manager was aware of the situation".  Waited ANOTHER 30 minutes for our order to come out and it was wrong.  #$%(*#$U%

Got up and spoke to the manager.  She had NOT been told anything.  The waiter had lied.  Her response was "sorry" again.  We left.  Horrible service.  I will avoid in the future.
