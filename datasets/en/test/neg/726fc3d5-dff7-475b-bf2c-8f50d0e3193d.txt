I went in to get 4 new tires. My alignment was fine before I got there. They put on the tires and tried to sale me a $79.99 alignment. I told them my alignment was fine and I didn't need to check it. After I left my car had HORRIBLE alignment. It now turns right instead of going straight. I am 95% positive they screwed it up on purpose. I don't trust them.
