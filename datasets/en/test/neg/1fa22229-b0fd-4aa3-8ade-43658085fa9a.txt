Great gas, plenty of snacks, convenient location...what's wrong ya say?   Simple, the customer service has gone downhill in the last year or so.  No greet, no acknowledgment, the most recent cashier was again indifferent (almost unfriendly during slow business) and no receipt...when did NOT giving an option for a receipt and NOT counting change (debit transaction and later a large bill transaction) for the customer become the norm.   Are my expectations a Business Faux Pas?  Best to spend my moolah elsewhere...tired of the attitudes.  Peace.
