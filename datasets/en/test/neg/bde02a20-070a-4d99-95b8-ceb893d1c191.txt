Ate here last night with my husband for dinner. We waited 1 hour for a table. We were finally seated at 8:30pm. The place was not busy at all. Half the restaurant was empty. So not sure why the wait. There were 4 hostesses standing around and several very bored looking bus boys. They failed to tell us eating in the bar was an option. Ordered a steak with loaded bake potatoe and saut√© mushrooms. When food was brought out, they informed me that they were out of potatoes and mushrooms. A steak house with no potatoes. Really???  So I paid full price for a very sad steak dinner. My plate consisted of a very good steak and a piece of soggy Texas toast.
