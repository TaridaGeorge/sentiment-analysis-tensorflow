Wow...I just learned a very valuable lesson. Steer clear of Danny's Family Car Wash on Northsight around 11 a.m. on Friday's. This place was super busy; 16 to 20 cars in queue waiting to be dried and about 6 workers. I waited over 45 minutes for my car to be wiped down - however the folks that drove Mercedes, BMW's, Audi's and Infiniti's were most definitely given preferential treatment. I watched the dryers meticulously manicure these vehicles while the rest of us got a "lick and a promise" wipe down. I guess they figure they'll be better tippers? Well unfortunately waiting 45 minutes for my car to be wiped down warranted a pretty crappy tip. 

I typically have had good luck with them, so I'll give them another chance. Screw up and, well, they're not the only game in town!
