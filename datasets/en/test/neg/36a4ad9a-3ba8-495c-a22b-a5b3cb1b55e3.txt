Pros:
Ordered delivery, got here fast

Cons:
Wings were clearly freezer burnt.
Garlic "Flavoured" crust had no flavour
all the toppings (with the exception of pepperoni and cheese) were in a 2 inch circle in the middle of the 2 pies we got
Crust was very hard for being a pan crust
After all was said and done (2 pies and an order of wings), it was kinda expensive for the quality.

This place has taken the top spot on my pizza to avoid list, dethroning domino's.
