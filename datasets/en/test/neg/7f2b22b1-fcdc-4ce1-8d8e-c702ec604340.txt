This company is not really a company - it's a very loose association of phone numbers that seems not to have people at the end of the line. What a great business model, though - get thousands of people to pay a hundred bucks to exercise outside (which you can do for free), and provide zero in return. The vendors are making money by selling products, and everything else is donated. Tried to reach this company both by email and by phone for over a month - no return emails or calls, and finally got a hold of one guy who seemed to have answered the phone by accident, and was completely unhelpful, except to explain how "busy" they were. Don't waste your money with Red Rock - there are plenty of other race companies out there who actually pay attention to their athletes.
