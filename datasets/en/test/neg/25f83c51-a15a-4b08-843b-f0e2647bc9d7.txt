If you only knew the story behind this place. I have seen the kitchen and the food handling antics. My goodness gracious people. Beware. I can't count on my fingers and toes how many police involved stories I know about concerning the owners harassing patrons and the treatment of the employees. Look for a pathetic looking blonde-haired witch drunk at the bar, and know that she is in charge of the operation. 
By the way, please tip your bartender/server as they are illegally not getting paid to work. Ownership decided to cut wages of the employees and make them work for tips only. In these tough times, people nee dto make ends meet, and unfortunately they are taken advantage of by owners like these.
