Horrible! It wasn't even busy and it took the waitress 15 minutes to come to our table when we arrived. Meanwhile, she was standing at the counter playing on her iPhone. The food was the worst and we have eaten at different streets of ny before and loved their food. Bread was stale, salad wasn't fresh, pizza was just ok. The manager stood next to the bar the entire time playing on his phone. I never plan to visit this location again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone!
