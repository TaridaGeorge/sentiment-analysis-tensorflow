I had a terrible experience and I will not go back to this store location.  I have a gift card for Charming Charlie's and was looking forward to shopping there.  The downtown location is also closest to my house, however I was unable to shop there.  Being downtown I parked on the street but only had enough change for 20 minutes in the meter.  I thought it would be no big deal just to run in and ask for change for the 2 dollars cash I had. One employee and perhaps her supervisor both refused to give me change.  Now I wasn't asking for something for free, just for quarters for the meter so I could shop in their store.  I won't be going back for sure!
