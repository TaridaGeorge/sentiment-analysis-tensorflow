Who knew that calling AT&T Customer Support (we are experiencing a higher than usual volume of calls) would be faster then driving and entering a store for customer service? I have discussed with AT&T numerous times that this area has a lot of dead spots and unusual consistency when dropping calls; yet it falls on deaf ears.
