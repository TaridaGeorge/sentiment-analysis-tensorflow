I purchased a rosemary focaccia dough from this store.  

Following the instructions on the focaccia, including poking holes and allowing dough to rest before baking and after baking, I baked the dough at the appropriate temperature for the recommended time only to find the bread was hardly near ready.  

The wrapper suggested 15 minutes at 400 degrees...but at 20 minutes, I pulled the bread out.  

Not done...and hardly salvageable since I cooled the bread  for 20 minutes after.
