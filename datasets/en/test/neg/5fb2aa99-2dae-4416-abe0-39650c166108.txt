All I can say is, um no thank you...this place is completely awful. And, I have not, nor will I EVER attempt to sell anything here.  I remember being a huge BE fan when it first opened in the SF Bay Area in about 1990.  I was a starving community college student and would be ecstatic at the overstuffed bag of  cute, stylish clothes that I could purchase for less than $30 bucks.  

How times have changed.  I can't believe they are actually selling used crap like this for $15-25 a piece, and previously worn shoes generally turn me off unless they're in excellent shape with an equally awesome price.  But, $26.50 for some nasty old Target clod hopppers, WTH???  This place makes My Sister's Closet look like Neiman Marcus!!!
