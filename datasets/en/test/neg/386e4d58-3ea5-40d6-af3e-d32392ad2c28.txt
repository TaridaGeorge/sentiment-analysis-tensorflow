I live in SF and was looking at a 2003 Porsche Targa that these guys are selling. Dealing with Lonnie in Internet sales, I asked to have a pre-purchase inspection done at a local Porsche mechanic (in Scottsdale, with excellent reviews on Yelp, who has been around for almost 40 years) at my expense. When I told him who I wanted to use, he replied that they were "a$$holes" and that he wouldn't let them look at the car. Instead he recommended a mobile PPI service who were not Porsche experts that would do the inspection AT the dealership (with limited capability, and under their watchful eye I'm sure). 

That's some sketchy used car BS if I ever saw it!!

Stay away from this particular car, Lonnie, and the shady dealership!
