What an embarrassment! We took our friends from LA to this establishment for dinner on Saturday night. After a 50 minute wait, the dish I was craving, roasted pork chops, was no longer available. The drinks took over 15 minutes and the worst of it all, the place sold out of ALL desserts. How can you not have ANY desserts available on Saturday night at 10PM! Our waitress gave us every excuse possible why they were out of desserts, which made it that much more pathetic. We will not be back and St. Francis is fortunate they are in Phoenix, because this would never be tolerated in NY or LA.
