Ok so I was going to a movie and I really wanted a coffee.

The nearest thing was coffee plantation.

I got a cup, one sip and I was the keystone bitter beer face guy!

This coffee was like if Propel made coffee water.

This was the most watered down coffee I've ever tasted in my life.

NEVER DRINK IT!!
