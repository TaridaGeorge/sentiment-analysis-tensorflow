I have some friends that love this place. I don't get it. For anyone from back East, this is not your traditional pizza.  Most of the pizzas that people rave about are the California take on pizza. Not a fan, but they do have more of the traditional pizzas also.  Those pizzas are ok. Nothing speical and I almost would say that several of the larger pizza delivery places can make a better pizza.

As for the service... it's an ALL TIME LOW of bad service in Phoenix.  I can't think of a place I have eaten at the consistently gets your food out so slow.  Doesn't matter what you order or how busy or slow it is. You are going to get SLOW SERVICE.
