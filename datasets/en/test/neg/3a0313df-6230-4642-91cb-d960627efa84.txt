Please don't take your pet there!

They don't really seem to care about your animal, all they seem to care about is upselling you one of there plans or some testing or procedure that your pet probably doesn't need.

My dog is already dying of kidney disease and they insisted on me getting her tested yet again before they would give me a new prescription card for her kidney disease dog food.  I believe the test was around $130 dollars.  

Not surprisingly, my dogs levels were worse than the last time and since there is nothing they can do about it it was just a huge waste of money and it also made me sad to have it pointed out to me that she was getting worse and there is nothing that can do about it.

I will never use them again.
