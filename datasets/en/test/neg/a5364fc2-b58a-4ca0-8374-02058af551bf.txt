Fedex SUCKS!  

I worked for an internet company years ago who shipped fedex.  After years of crappy shipping service we switched to UPS.  Best choice that company ever made.

9 times out of 10 when I use fedex for personal use, the package doesnt get there on time.  And when you use express shipment they will hold the pkg in their sorting facility until the due date (even if it gets to the facility  days earlier.)

Have I mentioned Fedex sucks!  Use UPS instead.
