As I already stated the item was broken.  It was a key chain.  The internal spring was broken and is not going to show up in a photo.  Amazingly when I told Amazon.com about this they refunded my money no questions asked.  They didn't even ask for the item to be returned.  NOW that is customer service.  Something that this company knows nothing about.  DO NOT BUY FROM this company.
