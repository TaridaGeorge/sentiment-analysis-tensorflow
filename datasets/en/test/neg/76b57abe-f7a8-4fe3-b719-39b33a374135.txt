I absolutely HATE this place.  THe service is the worst service I have ever had in a restauant, and the wait is not even worth it.  You can tell their food is half-assed.

They make you wait at least 30 minutes for a table, and amongst that every person who works there is just RUDE and UNHELPFUL.  I HATE this place with a passion, and I would encourage NO ONE to eat here.  It's a waste of time and money.

The food barely comes out hot, and its sloppy, not done right, and not that good.  I've been here probably 4-5 times to give it more chances, but I'm done wasting my money here.
