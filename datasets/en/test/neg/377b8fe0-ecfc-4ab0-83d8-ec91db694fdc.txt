Rice was very grainy, fresh wasabi wasn't chopped wasabi and was charged extra for, no uni (not like one should even consider eating uni here), above average prices, all sushi came out at once, rolls with weird looking and tasting vegetables like marinated peppers, and weird tuna tataki roll.

Miso soup: There is no seaweed in it.

Salmon was ok but nothing spectacular. One of the rolls had lemon on top of the Salmon. For me there's nothing worse to ruin raw salmon than to put lemon on top of it.

Toro: Mediocre at best. I've had regular Bluefin that was superior to this over-priced Bluefin Belly (11$ for Nigiri).

The Vietnamese Ice coffee, while good and flavorful, was not as good as it is in real Vietnamese restaurants and really doesn't belong on the menu of a Sushi restaurant.
