This is my worst experience at a Sonic. The location is hard to reach, the service is real slow and even though it is all set up for a drive-thru, there is no drive-thru window. I felt like I could have gone to Applebees, ordered, ate and left before I got my meal from this Sonic location. If you ever have to endure a meal at this location you may be as shocked as I was at how impossible it seems to be to access - it's almost like they don't want customers.
