Not smart to snub an informative question about Macanudo with a derogatory "that's for beginners". America's most popular smoke is apparently too good for this store. Customer is king, but not here. Large humidor, but poor selection. Also, don't expect any understanding when you buy a bad cigar. I had two $10 cigars with a bad draw, but the owner could care less. Bye, bye Havana! Like another reviewer noted, plenty of much better selected, friendlier and better priced lounges in metro Phoenix. Maybe an idea for somebody to do better in Anthem...
