Do not go here. If you have any kind of billing issue or want to dispute a charge they have zero customer service. They'd rather keep their few extra dollars instead of accommodating the customer, even when it's not the customer's fault. No one will return your calls. You have to harass them to get a response and everyone will tell you a different story. The whole office is disorganized and very unprofessional. The dentist and his wife are pushy to get you to buy things because all they care about is their bottom line.
