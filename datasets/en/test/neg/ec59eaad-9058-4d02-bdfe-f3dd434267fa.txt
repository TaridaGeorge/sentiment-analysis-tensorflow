I played there in Mid July. I would not recommend playing this course. It is very short and plays very slow. There were (2) groups waiting on many of the tees. The best part of the experience was the pro shop. It makes you think you are in for something very special. Everything after leaving the clubhouse is old. Old carts, old style golf course, a 225 yard par (4) on the back nine. Silly and dangerous as you cannot see the green,  just about anyone is capable of flying it on the green. 

It was cart path only when I played and they had lost much of the turf. 
The view of the city on 18 is terrific, but going thru (5) hours of golf on this dog track is not worth the wait.
