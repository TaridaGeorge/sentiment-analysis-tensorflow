I wish I had read the reviews ahead of time about being upsold insurance you didn't want, because that's exactly what happened to us.  I complained when we returned the car and of course, they refused to take it off.  In 30 years of renting cars, I have always DECLINED the insurance, and that's exactly what I thought I had done on Monday, Jan. 2, 2012, but Dollar is apparently making too much money on the insurance to hear you when you say, "Decline."  I will NEVER do business with them again.
