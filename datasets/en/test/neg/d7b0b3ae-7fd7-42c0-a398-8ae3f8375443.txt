This review is for their cocktail bar, not their coffee.

The feel of the cocktail bar is nice, and the throwback approach to classic cocktail making, commendable. However, the execution left us wanting. 

I ordered a Rob Roy, but received something with Coke and whisky. Sure, there is a child's softdrink named after another gentleman with "Roy" in his name, but if I had ordered a Manhattan I surely hope they wouldn't pour me a Beam and Coke.

Before they attempt complicated cocktails with St Germain, Aperol, muddled strawberry and rose water, they should learn the classics.

For coffee, they get 4 stars.
