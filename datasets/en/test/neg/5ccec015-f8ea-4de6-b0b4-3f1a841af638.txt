This place must have an insect infestation. About a month ago my sister ordered take out and found a cricket in her almond chicken. When she called and confronted them about the situation they showed no remorse or shock. The next day she took the food back. What is really disburing about this is that when I shared the story with my best friend she said she had a fly on her plate several years ago. I will never eat here again.
