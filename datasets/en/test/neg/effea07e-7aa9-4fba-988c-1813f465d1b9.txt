The Good: Only Good clean Indian Restaurant in the 300 mile radius. Wife says the Tandoori Chicken is the best she had ever.
The Bad: The chef/cook thinks Paneer and Mushroom are the only foods in the vegetarian food group.
The Ugly: Belly Dance?Seriously? and the Owner/Manager decided to join the dance half way through. Yuk!! no thank you, don't care to watch people dancing around me when I try to enjoy a quiet dinner with my family. btw, when did Belly dancing become Indian?

Don't go there if you are vegetarian and don't care for Paneer and Mushrooms. I came out hungry and disappointed.
