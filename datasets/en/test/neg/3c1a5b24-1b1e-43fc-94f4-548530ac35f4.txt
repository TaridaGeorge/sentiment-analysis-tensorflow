I have tried this located several times and it seems each time I get a crappier waitor or waitress and worse service than before, which I didn't even think was possible.  Today my meal took so long that I couldn't even eat it there.  I asked for a box and had to take it with me to enjoy at a later time.  I have a whole hour for lunch, I didn't order anything crazy to make.  

This place has poor time management skills and is very disappointing.  The only thing good about this place is Zach the manager and Nichole a server.  I guess I should get their schedules and only go when they are working.  What a shame to have such great food and have it ruined each time by poor service.
