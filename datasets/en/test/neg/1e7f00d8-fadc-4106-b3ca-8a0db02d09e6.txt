In the mall and decided to get some Thai tea from Yoyo. Tea was not ready and took 20 min to make. Upon receiving our Thai tea it was not sweet at all ( made wrong ). If something is on the menu staff really should know how to make it right. Ended up throwing it away after a couple sips. Yes, I should have know better then to buy Thai tea from a non Thai restaurant.
