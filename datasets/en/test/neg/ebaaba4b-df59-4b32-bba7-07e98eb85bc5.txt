Had both Don and Kendall to come out for pigeon removal. They charge a little over $400. However, 2 to three weeks later, the pigeons were still coming. Called Valley pro and got the run around. twice they didnt come out and the work is suppose to be a 10YEAR WARRANTY. Just this week called Valley pro again because one of the wires came off because of the wind. My husband couldnt get a call back. They gave a fake owner name when my husband asked to speak to the owner, when they are the owners. Don hung up in my husbands face when he asked about customer service and said they were too busy to come out. Will report them to the Better Business Bureau.
