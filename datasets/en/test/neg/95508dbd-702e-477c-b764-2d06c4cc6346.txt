This place sucks!!! Don't go there!!! The sauce was spoiled and we notified the "manager".

The Manager said he would give us our money back- so my husband and i went to sit and finish dinner-

when we were done we went to the register and asked him for the money and he said- the taco we had had the same sauce and chicken- that why did we eat that and not complain.  

he didnt give us our money back nor did he give us our burrito...

THIS PLACE SUCKS!!!

SUCKS REAL BAD- I HATE IT!!!
