I was not greeted until I was about to leave out of the store, the lady ( said she was the owner ) at the register clearly saw me, as I was looking at some tanks right by the register, she said NOTHING until I was about to head out, that's when she wanted to ask if I was looking for anything in particular.  I actually wasn't I just wanted to see what they had to offer, being that it was my first time in the boutique.  I asked if she was the owner and she proudly stated that she is, and that she has another location as well.  

Even if I would have received good customer service, this definitely isn't a store that I'd be out on the prowl for, the items seem a tad bit chintzy and out dated
