Will never go back - first they ruin a St. John suit even after We clearly discussed how it needed to be done, and they said they were accustomed to St. John. Secondly- they promised a gift certificate for all the inconvenience and never sent it. I asked for a linen suit to be washed and sized lightly and they dry cleaned it instead.
