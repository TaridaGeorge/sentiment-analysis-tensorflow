I diverted here on the way to the airport as I needed gas.   Paid about 20cent more than my local QT. 

Also needed snacks for the plane ride so I thought i would get some here instead of paying the huge airport terminal mark ups... i knew gas stations were more expensive than walmart etc and expected that... 

As it turned out the terminal mark ups weret cheaper than this gas station!!!! o well.  

Judging by the array of glass counters and pipes, its the local head shop too!
