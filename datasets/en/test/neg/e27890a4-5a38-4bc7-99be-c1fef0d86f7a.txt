Read about Tom's, was intriqued by both the history and new ownership.  The staff is friendly, the decor is nice (if a bit too bright for a tavern).  However, the food and service are lacking.  Ordered a cheese burger medium rare with no bun and a fried egg; delivered a raw burger with a bun and no egg.  When the food was returned to be cooked - received a terse comment about ordering a medium rare burger - do we want it medium.  Actually, I would have rather enjoyed a medium rare burger without the added commentary.  
The caesar salad warm warm and wilted.
We will not be back; my wife and I enjoy the resurgence of the downtown area - but next time I want a burger it will be 5Guys right across the street.
