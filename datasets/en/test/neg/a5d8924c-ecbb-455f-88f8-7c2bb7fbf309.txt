Hate this airport & the limited food options are a big reason why. This place managed to screw up a quesadilla. Which is basically a Mexican Grilled Cheese. Wings are terrible too. Food tastes like it was taken out of a box & cooked in a microwave. The worst part is it's practically the only game in town. Pray for a short layover.
