2 and a half years later and I am still having gum bleeding when I floss between two teeth that I had the fillings replaced from here.  My current dentist said last time I saw him that my xrays look okay but quite sure it will be needing replacing/treatment in the near future.  The fillings right afterwards had been so tight that I couldn't floss between them!  Should've seen that as an omen!
