Sadly, what I considered to be, by far, the best and most reliable bagel shop in the valley seems to just not care anymore. The last several visits, some bagels had the texture of not being boiled before they were baked. The taste is now hit-or-miss, as well. The other day I was in the store and didn't recognize a single employee. If they're having new people make the bagels, they need to stop now. Several bialys were undercooked and odd-tasting and, again, a few bagels were off in their texture, as well as taste.

It's bad enough that business seems to have been non-existent since the move to the new location, you can't afford to screw up your main selling point.

I just can't recommend this place anymore for bagels.
