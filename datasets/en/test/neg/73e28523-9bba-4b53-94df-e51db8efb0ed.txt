During my recent trip to Rubios I purchased the Chipotle Ranch Salad. The salad was actually just okay nothing too impressive from Wal Mart salads. Not to mention the poor poor service I was provided with in the Casa Grande,  AZ location I visited. To sum it all up personally if you ask me NO I would not recommend it.
