Not the best... or even average. I ordered take out from here, and just finished eating right now. I got the crab puffs which had been highly reviewed from a fellow yelper. I was very disappointed, yes they were large. but not filled with crab or anything tastey...just filled with cold cream cheese. 

my entree much in the same. it was cheap chicken that was oversalted. i think that the chef must be a smoker because he obviously cannot taste the salt content in his food.

The place was pretty full, so i'm guessing some of their dishes must be alright or people wouldn't eat there. I dont think ill be going back anytime soon, or ever at all. 

Next time ill just go to Panda Express across the street. its alot cheaper.
