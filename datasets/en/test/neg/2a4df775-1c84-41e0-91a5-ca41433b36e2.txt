I love the things that are sold there. Wonderful bunch of odd things. The woman who owns and runs the store is terrible. I ask her how much something was and she told me that I couldn't afford it! I ask about a book she had out displayed and she siad it wasn't for sale. Who has things in thier store that are not for sale and insults you when you inquire about her items? I would love to shop there as I am into bizarre and curious things, but I will not shop where I am insulted and treated badly. Apparently she only lets certain people shop in her store. NO THANKS!
