Ok, I'm a dude that likes meat and cheese, so, hey, sandwich with meat and cheese should be pretty awesome, right?  I love Chicago-style Italian Beef, and this is kinda similar components.  

So why is the Italian Beef so delicious and the Philly Cheesesteak so repugnant?  

Wiz.

Blech, blech, blech, blech.  

Whoever invented Cheez Wiz needs to be punched right in the balls and made to refund the $10 it cost for this sandwich.
