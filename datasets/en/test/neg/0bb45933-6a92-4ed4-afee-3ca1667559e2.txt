I'm Vietnamese and recently moved here from Seattle. 

I've been looking for a pho joint for weeks, this was my first (and last) time I'll eat here. 

The noodles were way too soggy and there was way too much noodles in the bowl. There were literally 5 slices of meat and just broth. I was given only one stem of basil and a piece of lime so small it was insignificant. 

The only good thing about my lunch was the waiter - he was polite. But maybe that's bcus I'm Vietnamese. Who knows.
