Not the best venue in the area by a mile. They should rename it the Douchehouse. The unfortunate proximity to ASU and the all ages policy/PBR on draft really bring in the drunken jackasses who are there to talk rather than watch the show. Parking is a pain in the ass; the business complex next door was blocked off and the lot was full. The bathroom situation is a serious joke. I've never been in a place where the better option is to leave and go next door to piss. The DJ playing music before the show should be fired. You've got an incredibly hot electro-indie band about to come on, and you crank up the hip-hop and 70's disco? Retard.

Sound is good-that's the only positive thing I have to say. I won't be going back unless it's a band I absolutely have to see.
