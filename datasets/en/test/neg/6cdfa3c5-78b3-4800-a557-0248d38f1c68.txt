Beware!  After encouraging customers to order on line with a discount, that discount was discontinued.  The owner also decided (for reasons the manager could not remember when I asked) to charge $1.50 for ordering on line AND charge an additional 3% for using a credit card (like you have a choice).  So on top of the already close to highest prices in town for frequently overcooked pizza, management is now also trying to stick it to its loyal customers with new charges hidden in the fine print.  Think twice before doing business with these folks, and watch your wallet.
