I went in for gas and the CC  machine wasn't working properly. I had some gas in the car, but decided to fill it. Their gas prices are reasonable. I paid the clerk $20 with the same CC. Apparently, I only needed $17 worth. The clerk (caucasian man in his low-50's) refused to give me my 3 bucks back. He was a total ass!
