We ate at the Arrowhead Mall Johnny Rockets tonight. The service was terrible  and the food was cold. The waitress never came back and offered drink refills or a refill and the supposed unlimited fries. 

I worked at Arrowhead Mall when it first opened and ate at the Johnny Rockets a lot. It was a favorite.  I swore it off 2 years ago the last time I had poor service. We made the mistake of trying it again. Terrible.
