This has been my favorite place to eat for years, but over the last few months it has gone completly downhill and after last night we will not be returning.
My fianc√© and I went wen with a friend and 3 young kids for an early dinner and asked for split checks.
Food was so so, service was extremely slow and only checked on us once. And when the bills came we were charged an automatic gratuity because of our party size eve if half were kids and it was separate tickets. They also charged for things they never have before like guacamole and kids drinks.
This loyal customer is done! $65 for 2 adults and kids for dinner, I don't think so.
