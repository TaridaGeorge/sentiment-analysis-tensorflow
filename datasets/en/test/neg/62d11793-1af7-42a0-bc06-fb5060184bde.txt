I went because I was given a $150 gift certificate. I ordered the steak & lobster combo, steak medium, my wife the salmon. The steak came well done, then it was returned rare - finally it was cooked medium, and the cook personally comped it, which was nice because then the gift cert covered the meal with a decent tip. Get the picture? Also, the lobster was tough. The ambience is ok but crowded, and unless you have a gift certificate or too much money, I can't think of a good reason to burn money here. You can get a comparable steak-lobster combo at a number of other venues at 1/2 to 1/3 the cost.
