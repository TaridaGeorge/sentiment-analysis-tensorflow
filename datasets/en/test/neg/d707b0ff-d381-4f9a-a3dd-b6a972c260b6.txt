I recently moved out of here and was charged with some very outlandish charges. The people here are very nice but the corporate ethics are in the trash.  I tried to call the regional manager to discuss the charges that were not taken off after my initial visit to the leasing office.  Mary answered my call and talked to me like I was some uneducated lower class citizen that probably shouldn't be in Scottsdale until I called her out on it then she changed her tune.  If you want to be treated with fairness, equality and in a ethical manner I would not rent from this company (Equity Residential).
