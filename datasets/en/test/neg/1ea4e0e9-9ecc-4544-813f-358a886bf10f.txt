Worst pedicure ever!  I have never written a review before but this was so bad I almost cried at the salon.  My husband gave me the morning off for my early birthday pedi/mani splurge and I'm sad I wasted my free time at Debon.  The lady in charge not only butchered my nails, but she made me bleed, and didn't stop filing even though I was clearly wincing in pain.  When I asked to remove the extra polish all over my toes (they were cut down so low that she couldn't help but polish my cut skin), she dug her nail into the cut.  I finally made it clear to her to please use a q-tip or something.  Needless to stay, I didn't stick around for a painful, rushed manicure.

Do yourself a favor and go to the nail salon by Pita Jungle.
