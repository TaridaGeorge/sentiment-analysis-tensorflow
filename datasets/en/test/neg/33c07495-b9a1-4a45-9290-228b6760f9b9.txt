I havent been to PV mall for many years since moving to north Scottsdale, so it was a surprise to see how run down the place is.
The final straw for me was watching as a young man shook down a shopper in Dillards for bus fare. 
Yes, panhandling in the main aisle in Dillards, but even more impressive was overhearing one of the salespeople explain to another salesperson "how it happens all the time and management doesn't do anything about it."
I walked out of the store looking over my shoulder, thinking the panhandler was following me out after having made eye contact with him and seeing him do a quick turnabout in my direction.
Who needs that shit.
I will never go back to PV Mall....it IS the new Christown!

Shame on you Dillards management!
