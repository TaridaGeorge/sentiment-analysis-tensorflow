Not impressed.

Dark, which is good because I'm not sure it would pass a health inspection otherwise.

Are fried cheese curds supposed to be chewy like silly putty?

Burger was way over cooked and drrrrryyyyyyyy.  I ordered some state, they name their burgers after states, that had a pepper sauce only it wasn't saucey, explain that please.

Two good points: decent fries and lots of tv's.
