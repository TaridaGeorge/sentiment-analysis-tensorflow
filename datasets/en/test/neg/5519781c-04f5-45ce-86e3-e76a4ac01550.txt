I had color copies made here. The staff did not know the prices and then they charged me $1.50 for me to use their computer to access the file from my flash drive. The computer was so out of date it could not even read a Word 2007 file. When I looked at the copies the next morning they were misaligned and the print quality looked like a poor inkjet rather than a laser print.

I called them and they said they would have to talk to the manager. When I went back after the weekend, he was not there and the clerk would not give me a refund.

Poor equipment

Poor attitude

Poor customer service.

There are other UPS stores relatively close. I suggest you use those. I will stick to my local one in Ahwatukee.
