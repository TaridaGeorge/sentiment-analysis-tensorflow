It sucked tonight. Been here a couple of times with no problems but tonight.... A friend ordered his steak well done but had to send it back twice because it was still pink inside. I had finished eating by the time the 2nd steak came out so my friend did not wait for a 3rd steak. Half the wait staff was too busy flirting & talking to a woman sitting behind us to even care.  If you like Texas Roadhouse, stay away from the Metro Center location. People call it ghetto center for a reason.
