If zero stars were an option... 
By far the slowest kitchen (based on 3 visits..average time from order to receiving a simple sandwich. 20 minutes)...regardless of crowd. Menu ..dismal.  The only items worth ordering..beer. Anywhere else in skyharbor will top this place.  Over the past year the kitchen response time here has had serious service problems. The waitstaff are friendly -- and clearly at the mercy of an understaffed and inefficient kitchen. There is no excuse for skyharbour  licensing this establishment.
