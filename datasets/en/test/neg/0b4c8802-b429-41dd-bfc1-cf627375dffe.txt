Worst place to live in Tempe, I'm sitting in the apartment as we speak with no water and so are my neighbors. I called in about the issue hours ago on their emergency maintenance line and still have heard nothing back. Last time I called in on a maintenance issue I heard back days later. Would not recommend anyone live here.
