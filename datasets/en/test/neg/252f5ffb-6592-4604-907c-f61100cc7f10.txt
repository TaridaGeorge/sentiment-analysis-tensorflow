I was so excited to revisit the Swensens of old but this was definitely not the same. We waited quite a bit before we were attended to even though there were only 3 tables occupied. The woman who waited on us looked miserable and was definitely not friendly. The chicken sandwich was ok but the hamburger tasted as though it had been in the freezer for years. I mentioned this to the waitress and she seemed perplexed. I explained that I did not like the taste and she argued with me and insisted there was nothing wrong with it. I never experienced this treatment from an owner (we later found out).  Please someone give her a clue regarding  customer service and food quality.
