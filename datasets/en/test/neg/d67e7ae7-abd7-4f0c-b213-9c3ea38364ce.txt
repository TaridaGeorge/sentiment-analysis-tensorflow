So disappointed with this place! If you like bland no taste chicken then this is the place. Quantity for the price doesn't measure up. I got four tiny chicken fingers, a piece of garlic bread that had no garlic taste, fries and cole slaw. The size of the chicken that you see on the menu is not what you get. I would not recommend this place and will not be back.
