If you are a vegetarian and you love Greek food beware of Jay's Gyros their vegetarian selection is overpriced and tastes like trash. I understand the name of the place has Gyro's in it so I can't say that their meat selections are bad.  The hummus is tasteless and runny, the dolmas taste like pine sol, and the falafel is bland I just couldn't believe I paid $9 for a dinner I couldn't eat.  I will stick with Greek Patio and Pita Jungle for tasty Greek food."
