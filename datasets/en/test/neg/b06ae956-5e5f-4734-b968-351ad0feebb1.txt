We went to Cibo last night, our service was awful!! We were seated and waited ten minutes for a glass of water. Many of the tables around us were seated after us and received their food before us. Our waitress was just beyond rude, and would not even look at us when taking our order. 

The food was only ok, and the worst part of it was four of us got food poising! 

I have heard great things about Cibo, but our experience was horrible!!!! I will not be back!
