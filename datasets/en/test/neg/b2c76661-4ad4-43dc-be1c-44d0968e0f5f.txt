Horrible just horrible...I went to Pawn 1st to see if they had any good deals on jewelry. After witnessing multiple rude employees completely ignoring the customers, and just lazily standing around talking it was clear to me that this is a place to stay far far away from when looking for a good deal. Not to mention how overpriced their items are. I saw in their showcase a camping knife marked up as double than what it even sells for in the store retail. Save your money and the aggrivation and stay away from this crooked store!!
