Frightening.

We pulled into the parking lot, took one look at the place, and drove away without even getting out of the car.

It was next to two porno theaters and three liquor stores. The local prostitution trade seemed to be prospering, based on the number of provocatively dressed folks walking around on the streets. Maybe the circus was in town or something.

They refused to refund our reservation, of course.
