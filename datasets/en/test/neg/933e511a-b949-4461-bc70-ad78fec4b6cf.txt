I really wanted to like Cadillac Ranch, As I walked in I thought "I could drink a few here." I sat at the bar and waited..
and waited
and waited
FINALLY a hot blond girl took my order, a simple beer
and walked away. 
There I sat. No beer, no menu, hot girl attitude ALL over me.

Finally got my beer 10 minutes later. Not even a "sorry"

STILL no menu.
Got up and left

This place SUCKS!
