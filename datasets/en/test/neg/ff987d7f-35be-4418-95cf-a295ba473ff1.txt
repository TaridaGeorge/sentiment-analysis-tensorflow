I went to Chompies for lunch. The pickles were unusual and didn't fit in with the menu. The bakery looked amazing and I was so excited to eat a cake! The menu was hard to read. My daughter had a corned beef sandwich, and granddaughter had tuna melt. It was greasy and heavy. I ate buffalo wings and they were average. I ordered red velvet cake and the icing was tough and the cake was stale. It was not fresh and made you feel bad inside after you ate it. DON'T GO THERE! The service was horrible!
