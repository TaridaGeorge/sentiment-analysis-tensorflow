If you like rich, bland, expensive food this place is perfect. The service is great, but the food was disappointing to the point where I would not even consider going back.

I've heard the only thing worth ordering is the trout and a Caesar salad. Great, and all that paper they waste printing out daily menus.

I was here several months ago and I don't remember it being so terrible. Like they cheapened the ingredients and raised the prices. My parents have a M&S loyalty card but I think they'll be burning it.
