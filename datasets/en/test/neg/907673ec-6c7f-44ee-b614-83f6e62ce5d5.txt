Zoyo has by far the worst tasting frozen yogurt I have ever had, and I have had them all! It literally turns into liquid in seconds.  My girlfriend and I decided to enjoy some yogurt one evening and within seconds our toppings were submerged in melted nastiness.  They should be ashamed of themselves. The fact that they are still in business blows my mind! Anytime you walk into a frozen yogurt place and wish you had McDonalds instead...you know its poor! Next time I will make the drive to Yogurtland!
