Bleh.

Most of us have ventured to the rock at some point in time. It has always been quite awful, but I had some hope after new ownership took over and renovated the place. It is always sad to see a place that has potential, be complete crap.

Upon walking in we were greeted by a small room used as a bar area, with random bar tables along the side. And whales. And scary looking people. And a DJ...well...kinda...he was playing music from a computer..you know...like you would so at home.

We ordered two beers and sat down. Why not give it a chance, right? Just when we thought that things couldn't get worse, we heard a sound. Like a squealing sound. Yes, you guess right, horrible karaoke ON A FRIDAY NIGHT!?!?! Why God, why?????

We chugged our beers and left.
