I went here for an eye exam which went well, I told the eye doctor I had itchy eyes  and was told she would give me a prescription for me to try for some relief. When I left they had forgoten to give me the script. I later called for the prescription and was told I would have to come in again for an exam, I told them I would not pay for another visit in order to get a script that was already promised. They still wanted me to come in again and pay a co pay for what? I will not be coming back to this place.
