A Deal is NOT a Deal at Chapman!  DISHONEST!
My husband made a deal with the sales manager for a used car leaving me to handle the paperwork. Ten minutes after my husband left the sales manager told me he could no longer make that deal.....sorry. Sitting in finance I was told the included bumper to bumper warranty was misstated by the sales man.....very sorry, they said. 
Deceitful and unscrupulous they then padded the contract $2,000.00 for that warranty!  
I am not sure if they treat everyone this way or just women. Either way I suggest you choose an honest dealership we did!
