Not a good meal.  Meatballs and chickpea crepes were too salty. Eggplant and spinach was an unappetizing greasy pile of slime and tasted oily.  The meatballs were accompanied by truly tasteless tomato sauce.  The pasta was nothing special.  Crispy Brussels sprouts were anything but..undercooked and chewy.   And three slices of bread was brought to the table with just enough olive oil for two slices.
