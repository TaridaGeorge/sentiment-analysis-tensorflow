Was told this is the best place in downtown Phoenix to catch a game. It's not. They play crappy music instead of the sound from games, food is typical sports bar junk, and drinks are expensive. On top of that the crowd is pretty crappy unless you like washed up jocks acting like they own the town. If that's your thing, this is your spot.
