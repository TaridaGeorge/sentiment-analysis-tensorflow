I went here for lunch one day with a co worker, and was not impressed. We sat at the bar, hoping to get faster service, since we were on a time schedule. After about 40 min, and 2 drinks later, our food finally came out. Wasn't impressed. I got a chili dog, and to my surprise, there were 2 of them on my plate. I ate one, and saved the other one for later. Needless to say I was friends with the toilet that evening and threw the other one away. I'll leave the chili dogs to Chicago, they seem to get it there.
