I have been to a number of dentists and I was not pleased by this place...they kept us waiting for over an hour, then didn't even get to finishing my husband's teeth. They said they would reschedule him for the following weekend, then cancelled and never reconfirmed his appointment! When I tried to do it for him, they wouldn't let me. So disappointed.
