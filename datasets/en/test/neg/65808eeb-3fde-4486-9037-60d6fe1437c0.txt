This place always gave me bad vibes. I had a friend who worked here once and got fired for no reason at all...then was asked to come back a week later. I've had both the coffee and the food here-- both weren't worth talking about and left no impressions. While the space was nice-- a 60s mod-chic type layout, the people were weird and were less than friendly when it came to busting out the ole' laptop to get some work done in the middle of the afternoon when there was absolutely no one else there...it was also expensive. A crepe and a coffee shouldn't clock in at $14 unless it comes with a side of duck confit. Catching up on Phoenix bookmarks, I'm happy to report that this business is now CLOSED.
