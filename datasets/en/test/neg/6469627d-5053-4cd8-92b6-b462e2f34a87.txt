The pizza (had the thin crust, bistro classic) was no better than what you can get from a CPK's frozen pizza.  They deep fried their chicken wings to death.  It was dry and hard to bite into the drumettes.  Waited for the pizza for 40 minutes upon ordering.  This place is old and run down.  This is my first and final visit to this joint.  

If you want real pizza, go to Pomo's Pizzeria, Cibo's, or Pizzeria Bianco.
