I was visiting Phoenix and found Tod's card.  I called him because he said he would do a  2 for price of 1 massage $140.  I asked that the massage room be warm.  I arrived for the appointment and the room was very cold.  The massage was ok.  I booked the 2nd massage.  1.5 hours before the 2nd massage he cancelled with me.  He said he would refund me on my credit card but he has not credited me yet.  My experience with Tod is he says he will do something and does not do it.
I was frustrated and unimpressed.
