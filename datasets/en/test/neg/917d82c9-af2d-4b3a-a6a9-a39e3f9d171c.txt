Forget abt the earlier post abt their acceptable ramen.  Went there just a few days ago and its ramen is on par with republic ramen, equally bad.

Pls go to sushi Ken, that is really the only good place for good ramen.  order their spicy miso ramen there.

The ramen here is 3 thin pieces of pork and noodles and some "western" vegetables like cabbage and brocoli.  yes, its that bad.  if i wanted this kind of stuff, those packet ramen noodles would be better.
