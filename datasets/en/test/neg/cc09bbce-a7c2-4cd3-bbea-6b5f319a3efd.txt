EEEEEEWWW!  Total disappointment! I can't believe this place has any good reviews... what are people thinking?  I guess I'm spoiled with super delicious Thai food in San Diego. hmmm.... I am in town and found this place on google.  I ordered Yellow Curry (because of the positive reviews) and a small cup of Tom Yum soup.....$17 + change total.  Not only was I totally ripped off, my curry was extremely watered down. There was a crap ton of Tofu (which was the one good thing) and only a few pieces of potatoes and carrots.  The soup was watered down as well and prepared completely different then what I am used to.  This place sucks and I will never go back.  Epic FAIL!
