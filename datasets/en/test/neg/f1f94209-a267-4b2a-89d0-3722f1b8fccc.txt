My god, avoid this place if you care about your vehicle. I had been taking my cars here for awhile since I was right down the street, but after my last experience I'll never come back! 

I had them replace the radiator for my 2001 Acura Integra. A few weeks later the radiator starts to leak! Apparently they installed it half assed, so I took it back and they fixed it. Fine, but it should have never happened! Two months later, and the radiator starts leaking again, this time from the bolts. I can't take it anymore, and I bring my Acura to Hon-Amotive. They replace my shoddily installed radiator with a Honda factory radiator, and I haven't had a problem since. 

Don't try to save money at the risk of damaging your vehicle. These chain mechanics can and WILL rip you off and do bad work.
