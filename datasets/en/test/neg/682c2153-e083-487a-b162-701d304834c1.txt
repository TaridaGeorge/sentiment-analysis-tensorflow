Went to Coal Burger on a Friday night with hubby and brought a coupon they had sent me.  After we ordered I remembered the coupon and noticed it expired the day before.  We asked the waitress could they still accept it and she had to check with the manager.  The coward of a manager made her come back to us to say they could not honor it a day late.  Really!!  They sent the coupon, how does 1 day make a difference!   The place was half empty, it wasn't like they had a line of people trying to get in for a burger and could care less about coupons.  Isn't the idea of a coupon to get people in your business?  We are spending money in your establishment and you won't honor your own coupon??  Needless to say we won't be back.  Shame on Grimaldi's you know better.
