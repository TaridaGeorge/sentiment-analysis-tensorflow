Overpriced for the quality. This shop is expert at staging. We bought a vintage sofa and the upholstery nails were popping out by the parking lot.  The 'vintage' piece has new wood.  The upholstery buttons on another chair pop out if they snag on your clothes. Spent 50 percent more than I could have at a furniture liquidator because I thought these were unique and lasting pieces.  They are crap glossed over to sell at high prices. If it's going to fall apart on a year I could have saved a load of money and gotten furniture that I expected to last a year.
