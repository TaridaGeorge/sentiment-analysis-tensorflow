I don't know if it was just this location, but I was totally underwhelmed. So was my friend. I was so excited to eat here. Everything was just blah. The drinks were so bad, we didn't finish them. One drink tasted like Nyquil. Their signature drink tasted like it was made with rubbing alcohol. I wish I had just gone to the cheesecake factory.
