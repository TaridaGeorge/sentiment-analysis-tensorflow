I'm a huge fan of Greek food.  Huge.  And I will eat even really sucky hummus.  But I draw the line at really, really sucky hummus.  The sun-dried tomato hummus at MBFGR is better than the regular hummus, but none of it is great.  Their Greek salad wasn't good either, and their fries with feta (which sounds *awesome*) tasted funky.  I don't like giving a 1 star rating, and in truth this restaurant maybe deserves higher than a 1 -- perhaps a 1.3.  But because friends and dates keep dragging me there (the Arizona Center location, the Tempe location -- they are EVERYWHERE!), and I know I can count on a lousy meal each time, I have to go with a 1.
