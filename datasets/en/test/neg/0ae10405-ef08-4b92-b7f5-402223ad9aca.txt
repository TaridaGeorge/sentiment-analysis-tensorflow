Gee..... I wonder why this place went out of business? Maybe because THEY WERE HARDLY EVER OPEN FOR BUSINESS. 
I don't know if anyone read my frist review of this place, but I tried several times to go in to this establishment and eat and they were never open even though they had posted hours on the door. I know for a fact they were still in business when I tried to go, because I had friends who went in here to eat not long before or after I attempted to go in. Oh well. I guess this should be a lesson for all businesses. If you have hours posted on your door, you should probably abide by them. Other wise, you'll go the way of Viet Kitchen.
