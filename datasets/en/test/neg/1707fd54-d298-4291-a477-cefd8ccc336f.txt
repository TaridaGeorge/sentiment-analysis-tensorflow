Used to come here almost everyday. Now a bunch of dirty teens work at night laughing and pushing eachother around in the back. Fries were soggy and cold and were covered in sticky red stuff. This stucky red stuff also on my drink. I was so discussed I wanted to puke. Threw it all out and will NEVER be coming back. You could not pay me to eat here again.
