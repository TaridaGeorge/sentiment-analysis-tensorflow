I really wanted to like this place as it is close, and was recommended by friends. Sadly we won't be going back. We ordered takeout and it was mediocre at best, and inedible at worst. Eggrolls were soggy & tasteless, sweet & sour chicken was rubbery, fried rice was bland. The duck was ok, and the best dish was broccoli & oyster sauce. My wife suggested I toss out the leftovers, but I wasn't about to chuck $43 worth of food. I heated up leftovers for  lunch today, and the chicken was literally inedible. The rest of the dishes weren't much better. I now have a miserable lump in my gut and the rest of the leftovers are in the trash. My search for good, local Chinese food continues - so far China Bamboo on 16th is the best but still not that great.
