Okay. My first trip here in a while was breakfast time. They asked me to pull in front to wait on my hash browns. 6 minutes later I had my food. Usually when fast good places make you wait too long, they give you bigger fries. But not this place. My second trip there (the next day) I had to wait 10 minutes for my food which was also at breakfast time. Despite how delicious their breakfast menu is, I won't be back here for a while.
