TOTAL RIP OFF !!!    They told me over the phone that it would cost about $340. to replace my brake pads. If they needed to replace the rotors, it would be another $160. So around $ 500. total....That sounded fine with me....So I took my car down there. After they had the car up on the lift, they told me that it was going to be $800. !!!! ( For just a simple break job). I was freakin' shocked. I told them to forget the whole thing, and I took my car to my regular mechanic 2 days later. (I didn't take it to my regular guy at first, because he is kind of expensive.)...It turns out that I DIDN'T need my rotors replaced, and he did the whole job for $400. ---AVOID THIS PLACE------DO NOT GO THERE------YOU WILL BE RIPPED OFF.
