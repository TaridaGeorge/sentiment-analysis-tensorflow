I hired The Yard Experts nearly three years ago to care for my lawn while I was away on military duty.  The first year their customer service and lawn maintenance was great.  The next year the lawn service plummeted; I was paying them to mow 2/3 of an acre of DEAD grass and had dead trees.  Needless to say the management wasn't monitoring the crews and their work.  When I reported my findings, they made good and credited me a month of service, but did I mention it also cost me a few $600/mo water bills?  Unfortunately, this last year, the customer service and maintenance is worse.  I was recently charged for pre-emergent treatment, but later told I needed weed control for yet an additional cost...HUH?  What's PRE-emergent for?!?  AND they wanted to increase my maintenance service.  My lawn looks like a desert weedscape.  No thank you.
