I can't believe the rating on this crappy place... The pizza reminded me of the crap they would sell at a bowling ally or roller rink. Plus Ottos is cheap 50 cents for refills. I ate 2 slices of my medium pizza now I am going to give it to some homeless person or I shouldn't put them thru the torture...
