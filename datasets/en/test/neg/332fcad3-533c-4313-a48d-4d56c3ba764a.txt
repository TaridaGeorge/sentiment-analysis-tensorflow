While the actual bus and driver they sent to take us on our trip was great, working with them was a nightmare. I'd never use them again. They charged my credit card while holding a check for payment and telling me they absolutely would not charge my card on the phone. I didn't find out till a week later when I got my charge card bill and the uncashed returned check. Then nobody would take responsibility as to why it happened and the customer service rep who promised to call me once he found out what happened never did. No attempt to make it right either.
