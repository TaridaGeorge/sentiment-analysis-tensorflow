Being the first time here, we have been let down on all the raving on how great it is first... Our server was soooo rude and could care less if we where helped or not , then we asked recommend us on the top sellers, we picked " top hat "something ... POINTLESS! Not thing special. A piece of bread with vanilla ice cream and a OVER load of fuge . And did I forget to mention... Over price?  Once he served us our ice cream, he never bother to check on us until we asked for our check . And still had us waiting ! Never am I coming her again...
