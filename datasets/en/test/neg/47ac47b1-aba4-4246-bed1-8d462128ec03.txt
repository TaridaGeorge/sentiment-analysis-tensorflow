This was the worst medical care I have recievied.  The doctor was no responsive and when her nurse did contact me her information regarding my case was completely wrong.  After going to another doctor I found out that they did not run a complete work up on my condition before making a decision.  

When I asked to speak with the office manager she would not talk to me to discuss the problems with the practice.
