Requests not taken on dishes.  I'm not a big fan of carrots and asked if the dish I was interested in ordering could be prepared without them.  "no".  I then asked about several other dishes and the bottom line was that they prepared them how they wanted to and the customer be damned.  

When my food finally arrived, I asked for a refill on my drink -- that refill never came.  The food was bland and I had to remove all the vegatables I didn't want.  

Every other Thai restaurant I've been to has no problem with a simple request like this, and had much better service.
