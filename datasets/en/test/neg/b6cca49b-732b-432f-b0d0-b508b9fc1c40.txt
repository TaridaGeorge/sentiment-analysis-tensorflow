We had the worse service there this past Tuesday night.  Our waitress (can't remember her name but I remember the sour look and nasty attitude).  She even changed the amount of the tip on the final receipt!  Added $20!  I think that is against the law.  ;)  We are trying to contact the manager but they told my niece he was busy after she sat on hold for almost 10 minutes! 

 I have to say, I used to go there at least twice a week but moved and hadn't been there in over a year.... THIS place obviously has gone DOWN hill!!!!!!!
