Do not order anything for pick up from this place!  They took my order and then when I arrived to pick it up, they claimed to have never gotten it.  They said I must have called the other location-but I didn't.  They told me it would take 15 minutes so I agreed to wait.  It took 30!  They did not comp anything or even apologize.  I will never go back.
