The service here is horrible! 
I went in very early on Friday morning and there were pallets strewn all over the floor right inside the door, hello big time hazard. The store looked messy and there was not a smiling face to be found. 
When I got to the counter the girl behind it looked like she hadn't slept in a week and she was barely functioning. I asked for a peppermint hot chocolate. Without even looking up she mumbled that they were out of peppermint. Huh? Its Black Friday at 5am. Talk about bad inventory management. 
She was so rude. 
Starbucks is really loosing me. I would be hard pressed to go into another one anytime soon, but never this location.
