It took multiple visits to get a refund for double billing me. I then had to write the Better Business Bureau to get a refund for a separate rebate check. Instead of apologizing, they sent a nasty return letter stating they had already told me about the refund (they hadn't) and I was lucky to get my refund. They are truly the Kmart of Tanning Salons. Prepare to fight them for a long time if you have a problem and check your bank statements for double billing!!
