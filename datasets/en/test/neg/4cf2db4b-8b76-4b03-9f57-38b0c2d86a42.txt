This is a hair salon that does nails on the side. I think if nails were the main source of revenue they would be better at it and have a wide variety of name brand polishes to choose from.

The manicure was below average, I should have suspected as much when I saw the condition of my manicurist's nails & cuticles.

I will not be returning.
