this place sucks. Behind the posh veneer created by nice architecture and beautiful women lies a shitty bar. I could only fit into this place if I waxed my eyebrows, gained 30 pounds of steroid induced muscle, leased a BMW, and purchased the flashiest affliction/ed hardy v-neck t-shirts. This place has it's head so far up it's bleached asshole that it's missing out on quality patrons.
