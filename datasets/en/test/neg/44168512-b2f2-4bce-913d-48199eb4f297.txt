I had the same experience as a few others who have posted here.  The salesman pounced on me the second I walked in and wouldn't leave me alone.  It did not matter how disinterested I looked or how many times I walked away from him, he just kept following me.  The words "thanks, I'm just looking" meant nothing to him.  After about 15 minutes of this I just turned around and walked out while the salesman was in mid sentence.  Seeing as others have had the same experience, I have to believe this is store policy, to badger customers into buying something or annoy them out of the store.  What a great business model. 

On a side note I walked next door to the Roomstore and was allowed to browse all i liked.  The salespeople were available for questions but not overbearing like Lazyboy.  Will never go back.
