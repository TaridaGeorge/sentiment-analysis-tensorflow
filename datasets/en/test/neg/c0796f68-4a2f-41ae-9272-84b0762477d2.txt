First contact was great.  The customer service was excellent but the product did not meet the standards set.  I ordered a custom dashmat in a suede finish for my vehicle and waited a week for it to be made.  The fit was not very good to my dashboard and the quality was lacking.  I paid $54.99 plus tax and was sorely disappointed.  The stitching was sub-par, it was about 1/2 inch too big, and after speaking with them, I was told that it was perfect and no alterations would be done.  Luckily, Laura was very professional and understood my concerns and offered up the option of returning it.
Laura gets 5 stars, but the product was 1 star for the price.
