This place is a poster child of how not to run a hospitality business. The front desk clerk (don't know if he was the owner or not) was rude and curt with me. He made it a point to tell me when check out was the next morning, as if I was not welcomed. I did not understand why he was so rude, but I wasn't going to put up with it. I told him if he wanted to act in such a manner I would take my hard earn money elsewhere. I won't be back there under any reason.

Since I wound up not staying I cannot attest to the property's standards and layout.
