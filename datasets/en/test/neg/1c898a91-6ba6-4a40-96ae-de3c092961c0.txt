My wife ordered the Sea Bass and didnt care for it. The waiter took the dish back and then the owner came over to our table and berated my wife on why there was nothing wrong with the fish.

We never asked them to remove it from our bill, and they didnt. Being scolded by the establishment was not what we had in mind. 

Never again for this place ever!!!!
