One less star for every piece of hair I found in my bowl of fake Bun Bo Hue.   Found a total of 5 but yelp requires me to rate at least one star. Besides the HAIRS, the broth was greasy, and unflavored.  Every ingredients I tried to add to make it taste better  was useless....USELESS!!!  They took it back and gave me a new one and still made me pay for the meal of hair that I had to eat!
