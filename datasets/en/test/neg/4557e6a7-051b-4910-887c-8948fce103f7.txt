I really hate this branch of Pita Jungle.  I think this is due to the college-age hippie stoner slackers that dominate the staff.  I eat at the Pita Jungle in Scottsdale often and love it - worthy of at least 4 stars.  The Tempe branch - yikes.  Bad bad sloooooooooooooooooooow service. Maybe I am being overly harsh but my last experience here was so bad I actually walked out of the restaurant without eating my meal or paying.  After sitting there for over an hour, they managed to serve me the same cold plate of food twice (it was supposed to be hot).  And it wasn't  even that fact that I got served cold food twice that really ticked me off.  It was that no one there - not even the manager - seemed to give a shit.  Unacceptable.
