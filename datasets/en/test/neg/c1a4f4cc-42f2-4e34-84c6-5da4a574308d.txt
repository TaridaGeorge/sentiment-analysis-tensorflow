Groupon brought me to this joint....and been here several times over the past few months.  We went there tonight for dinner and *BAM*, there was a notice on the door that the place was being repossessed by the property owner.  It's CLOSED.  Another victim of Groupon.....so many deals on Groupon are from restaurants that go under.  This is one of many recent joints to go bye bye....
