This airport is a joke.

So there's one level for both departures and arrivals?  I can only imagine how cluttered this place becomes during peak-hours.  Once you're inside, you realize arrivals go upstairs and each terminal has their security checkpoint.  Why is this so complicated?  And the North Curb and South Curb?  Why?

The whole place, inside and out, appears to be very cluttered.  Maybe I'm just spoiled by spending many years at JFK and LGA.
