Went there on a Sunday night at 8:00 pm; their kitchen was already closed. Some food plates were empty and never refilled unless you ask for it. Even thought there were still 5 tables of customers there. 

It's a family owned business, I saw a young kid, believed to be the owners, playing around the dining area; this is unacceptable. 

Soon, all the employees sit down on different tables started eating their dinner. Can't they see customers are still there?

They should tell me their kitchen was closed, but they didn't. In other words, they charged me to help them eat the leftovers; very nasty.

I will never go back again.
