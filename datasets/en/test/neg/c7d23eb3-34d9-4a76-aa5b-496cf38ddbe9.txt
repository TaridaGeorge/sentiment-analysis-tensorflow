I am so upset with this souper salad. They are never consistent with their food. I love the pizza but the last 3 times I have gone they have always been out of it. The service is TERRIBLE! It takes the servers take atleast 10 minutes to bring out drinks..they take their sweet time to refill too. This souper salad is never crowded, never busy. I don't see what the problem is. But the straw that broke the camels back is when I went there last weekend and the pound cakes used for the strawberry sauce was replaced by undesireable chunks of a hard biscuit thing. Ugh. I will never return to this establishment again. Consistency is key here, and they are consistent at being bad.
