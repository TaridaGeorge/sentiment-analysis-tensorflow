I ate there on the day it opened for business and the food was horrible. The chicken was so dry and tough I couldn't get it off the bone. The pizza was bland, and the rest of the food lacked the seasoning and flavors I look for in Mediterranean food. I suggest you look elsewhere for something to eat! I'm sorry that the Asian food is gone. If I could give this place a zero star, I would! Crappy, crappy food, waitstaff didn't really care (took a couple of minutes for them to seat us), seemed like the A/C wasn't working, and who wants to walk through a Hookah lounge to get to a restroom that had a really bad smell! STAY AWAY!!!!! A REAL ZERO STAR RESTAURANT!!!!!
