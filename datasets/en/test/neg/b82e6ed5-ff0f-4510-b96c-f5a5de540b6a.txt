Not great...seriously dumbed down Chinese.  Okay I get it, not a lot of Chinese or Asian come through Phoenix on a layover compared to the rest of the population.  But really?!  Their version of chow mein is cup o' noodles with some other sauce on it.  They are very soggy and had no depth to them at all.  A microwave could have made this stuff.  The orange chicken was hard and over battered and...that's it.  I'm surprised this place isn't called Oriental Food, cause they have no clue on what is what here.
