I ordered a spaghetti with marinara and meatballs, which is not an easy order to mess up I might add, and it was Terrible! The marinara was flavorless and they forgot to drain all the water from the overcooked pasta. The meatballs were tasty, but that's the only good thing I have to say about this $10 "kid's meal".
