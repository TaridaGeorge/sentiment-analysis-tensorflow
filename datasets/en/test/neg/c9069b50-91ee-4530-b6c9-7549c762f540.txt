I was very disapointed in this establishment.  Music was terrible, everyone in the band were bad singers very off key.  I would not recommended this place to anyone!

You order a drink and wait 60 minutes before the waittress appears again.  You end up walking up to the bar to order a drink.  Then when you decide to leave and ask for your bill you wait so long you end up looking for the waittress.  That is not good.l
