Remember where you came from, what I mean is I've been going here since they were still painting the walls and hanging pictures.  There is a crew of us that live in the hood and frequented there.  Lately the service has severely lacked, it's like they're doing us a favor by serving us.  A pasty is a pasty, but bad service will shut you down.  Kick your servers in the ass and get back in gear...
