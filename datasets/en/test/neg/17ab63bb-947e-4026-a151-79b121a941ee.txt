I'm surprised at the existing reviews. I am reviewing on yelp for the first time specifically because we thought this was the worst sushi place ever.  Yucky rice, tepid salmon in chunks when I ordered spicy salmon. the chicken katsu was horrible.   I will agree with others that the place is clean and service ok. maybe we just expect good Japanese food in a sushi place.
