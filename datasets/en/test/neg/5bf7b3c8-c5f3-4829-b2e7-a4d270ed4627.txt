I went here to get my nails done about a year ago and they were completely rude to me and my nail technician cut me several times with her drill. She also drilled my real nails down so bad that I have dents in a couple of my nails that have never healed. Go up the street to Royal Tuyet Nails by Albertsons. Wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy better.
