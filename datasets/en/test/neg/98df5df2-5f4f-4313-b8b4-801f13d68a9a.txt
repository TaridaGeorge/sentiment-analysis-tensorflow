Beware! This credit union charges a $25 account closing fee!

I have accounts with 3 other credit unions and 4 other banks; NONE of them charge an "account closing fee".

When I opened an account here, this fee didn't exist. At some point in the last few years, they added the fee and supposedly notified customers in the usual account mailings that I love to ignore. When I closed the account, I was surprised by the fee and complained, but the customer reps just kept saying "you had a chance to close out the account when the policy change was mailed out." Well, I'll instead take this chance to warn my fellow yelpers of this strange fee. And who knows what new strange fees they'll add in the future?

I would steer clear of this credit union!
