4 stars? Are you kidding? This is the grossest restaurant in the entire planet!

My brother had severe food poisoning after eating Shrimp Fried Eggs here (Xia Ren Chao Dan). The shrimps must have been toxic and the eggs were not fresh at all. He was throwing up the night after eating this crap here, and then continuously puking and suffering from severe diarrhea day after day, night after night, even fainted a few times. This lasted a few days. He had never been this violently sick in his whole life. 

The reviews are so inflated here... I'd say that the level of hygiene in this restaurant is highly questionable, if not downright appalling. I'd recommend that you go elsewhere for your meals unless you want to risk being poisoned by unknown toxins hidden in their dishes. Stay away!!!
