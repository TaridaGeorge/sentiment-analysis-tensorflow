I ate there last week and the rib eye steak was not good.  I asked for medium rare and I got a medium rare.  When I was in the middle of eating it i can taste a weird taste.  I flipped over my steak and my steak was all burnt.  I have never tasted a medium rare steak that was burnt on one side.  :(  I could not finish this steak.  I felt bad sending it back or telling the waitress I didnt want the steak.  Felt someone in the kitchen might rebel and spit or do something to my food next time around.  I come from Texas and have eaten many times at Texas Roadhouse.  This was the first time I was dissappointed in Texas Roadhouse.
