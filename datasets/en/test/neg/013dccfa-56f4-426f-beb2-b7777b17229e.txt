They did a terrible job. My car was still dirty, I had to wait forever and there was still fuzz on the carpet. Looked like they never even vacuumed it. I had to pull up to the free vacuums after and do it again myself. There were also dried dead bugs all over my windshield that didn't come off and weren't cleaned. They used a moldy smelling rag to wipe the inside of my car and I could not get that moldy smell out of my car. It got into my AC and everything! I'll never go back there.
