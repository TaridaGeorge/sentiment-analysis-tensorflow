Food great, service terrible.  If you want some expensive, gourmet food, I highly recommend.  Just don't expect to be waited on with any class or friendliness.  The waiter at the end of the meal spilled the entire leftover and actually began to box up the items that spilled on the floor with his bare hand.  Wow.  Hard to believe this happens, but I would not recommend, there are better options at the Biltmore for the same price and better food quality.  

*I guess there's a reason why the restaurant was empty when we were there.
