We decided to try this place instead of Tea Lite Cafe because Tea Lite has a rude man there always accusing me of taking soda from machine for free.  First time, the 
vermicelli pork was good.  The second time the pho tasted like canned broth with too much anise.  My child said it was the worse he has ever eaten.  Don't go there for pho.  The atmosphere is good but the food is just too terrible.
