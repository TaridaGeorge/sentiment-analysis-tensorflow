Not a review on their food or drinks (don't really recall) but their service.  I was flipped off by my waitress after leaving the restaurant.  (My friend paid the bill since we were out celebrating my b-day, so no clue on tip other than there was one).  I have no desire to go to a place where an employee would do that to a paying customer, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else either.
