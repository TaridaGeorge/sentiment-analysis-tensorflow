unreal Just went in tonight ....an hour before closing and waiting up front to be seated.  Was there for five minutes and just couldn't believe in that amount of time someone couldn't even acknowledge my existence.  I could understand if it were during a rush but there was not many there and two servers noticed us but didn't didn't say a word...sad
