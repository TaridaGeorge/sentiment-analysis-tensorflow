I know why they have 5th in their name (the street they are on) but not sure why they even have Wine in their name....the wine list is terrible!  My wife couldn't find one decent wine to have so we ordered one cocktail and left immediately.  Very unusual atmosphere, definitely not a place to watch the pretty people.  I felt like we were at a Steak & Ale.
