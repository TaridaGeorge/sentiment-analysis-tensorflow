He make me a Crown that I don't Need it! Screwed my teeth! The Insurance says that Is not enough proof for do a Crown I said I will not paid for something that the Insurance said is was right! Finally now I found a very good dentist he is trying to fix it but I need to replace it because I was allergic to metal, things that Dr Payne never ask before. Now I have to paid extra 1300$ because a New crown and Insurance not cover crown if is less that 5 years, and maybe I need a Root Canal too so extra money too! Thanks Dr. Payne I want to send you the bill
