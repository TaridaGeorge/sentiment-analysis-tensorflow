this place sucks!  I hate how dumb people are!  People only like this place because it is trendy.  The food is horrible!  I got the eggs Benedict with the fillet minion and it was hardly a filet minion, more like a cheap piece of stake with alpo on top of it.  I would not recommend going here.  If you want some real breakfast for less money and much higher quality, than go to the pancake house.  

If you have kids I would not recommend going here because of the nasty food and the extremely long wait.  The parking is awful as well and the Scottsdale police department is well aware of this situation.  If you are lucky you can see a minimum of 5 police cars swarming the area, ready to hand out a nice ticket to the customers of "The Breakfast Club".
