The first time I went here I had a bad experience. The burger was super greasy and the fries were cold and soggy. So I decided to give it a shot again. The burger was a little better this time, but still dripping with grease. And again the fries were cold and soggy. And if you plan on eating here make sure you the only thing you have planned after is to go home to take a shower. You and you cloths are going to smell like greasy food. For paying close to $15 for a burger, fries, and a drink you would think for you enjoy your meal. And it would be very expensive for a family to dine here. The service wasn't very friendly, and it's way to loud to have a conversation with anyone. I will never eat here again.
