This place is still as bad as it was when I first reviewed it.  I got suckered into giving it another go because I didn't want to eat alone, and there were literally no redeeming qualities.  

For those reviewers who think reviews like mine are BBQ snobbery, I'd say even when I'm starving and don't give a rip I'd rather have ANY other BBQ in Phoenix than this place.
