New owner not FULLY honoring "Entertainment Book 2012" coupons.

Full Disclosure:  They did give us $5 off instead of $12.

But the food was totally bland.  One dish, the main meat was WAY WAY WAY too salty.  The other two dishes were so bland it was impossible to pick out what individual spices were in the meal.

And the amount of food for the price was lacking - too little food, too much dollar bill.

Won't be back.
