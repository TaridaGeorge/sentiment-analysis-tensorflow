Kudos to the omelette maker and the waitress! However, I'm not sure why it was so difficult for four hostesses to find me a decent table. 

Overall the food was okay, not that great of a selection for $30 per person though......the bread table had a great display, but was inevitably just there for looks and stale. 

I'm a vegetarian and tend to look for healthier options like fruit and a nice salad bar which was not offered.

I don't recommend this place at all. The cigarette smell from the casino seriously kills the appetite.
