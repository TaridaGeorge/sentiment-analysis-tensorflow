This place sucks, not my normal car wash, but was in a hurry and needed to wash my car. They did a horrible job for a $20.00 car wash. And I don't think anyone there spoke English. Everything in the shop was overpriced.  Had been here once before, and I could not remember why it had been so long...now I remember. RIP OFF!
