This gym does not even deserve one star. Not only are the gym staff rude, so are managers, and child care staff. The child care staff, with the exception of one person (Diane), are all worthless and should not be working with children. I realize it does not take any brains or skill to work at a corporate gym. After today we will not be returning.
