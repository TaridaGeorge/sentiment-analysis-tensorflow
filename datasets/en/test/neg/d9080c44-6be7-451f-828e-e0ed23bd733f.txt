Literally the worst shopping experience I've ever had. The moment we walked in someone asked us what we were looking for (which is fine), but when we said we were "just looking around", we still got chased around the store with far too many follow-up questions. "what do you like?" "do you want a sectional?" "a chair?" "what do you mean you don't know what you want?" It was rude and intrusive. I don't know if they really believe that that sales technique works on people.
