I recenty went to this Sears Auto to get the A/C "recharged" on my car since the A/C stopped working. I knew my air compressor was ok since it was still blowing warm air at me.  After Sears inspected my 12 year old American car, the quote came out to just over $800 - which would've included a new compressor, hose and freon recharge. I decided to get another opinion and Firestone did the recharge for a total of $117. For a couple weeks now I have functioning A/C in my car and boy am I happy that I didn't let Sears take the job. Extremely disappointed that I was scammed at such a big chain.
