Area was convinient but the hotel was way over priced! Arrived to room and the hall way had NO AC felt like a heater. THen the toilent was stopped up and took them 5 hours to fix! Later that night a huge light fixture from the hallway fell and block us in our room not a good experience at all.....no one even apolagized for any of it! Dont stay here
