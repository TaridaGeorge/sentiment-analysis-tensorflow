Went for my MRI and these folks took 3 hours. I was on time for my MRI at 2:45 pm. I left SimonMed at 5:45 pm into the busy 101 traffic. Something that takes 45 minutes (Check IN 15 mins, MRI 30 mins) took 3 hours. Staff was insensitive to the delay. Manager did not do anything.  Feel sorry for the Senior Citizen who was delayed too and was scheduled after me. 

SimonMed, 
         If u r running 3 hours behind schedule can't u call up the patients and inform them about it before they arrive there so they have the option to reschedule or come prepared for the delay?????
