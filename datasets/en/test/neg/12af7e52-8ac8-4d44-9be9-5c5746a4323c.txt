The star was for the second wine list - the one by varietal.

The chopped salad was disliked by my date for the smoked salmon, by me for the couscous that ruined the texture.   Barely ate any.

The blue elk taco was almost inedible - the elk was treated to an unpleasant batter frying, the beans with almost sugary... Barely ate any.

The mushroom ragout was not particularly flavorful, just a bit hot.  The fried polenta was ok, but a bit dry.  Barely ate any.

The wine was good.
