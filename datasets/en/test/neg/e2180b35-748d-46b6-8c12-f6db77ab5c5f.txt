I normally give places 2 chances before they are written off.  This time, one was all it took.  If a year from now they hang a new "Under new ownership" sign out front, I might give it a second try, but not before then.  

They are trying to be Panda Express and they are failing miserably.  Really really miserably.  Overpriced for what you get, and what you get isn't good at all.  And while I'm not saying everyone will feel this way, we both felt a bit icky about 20 minutes later.  

Really want some fast Asian in the area?  Try the Panda Express down the road.
