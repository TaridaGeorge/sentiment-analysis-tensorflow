Penny pinching people. 

I have purchased food for a year at Beijing restaurant yesterday I purchased noodles and other items and I had the noodles today it tasted rotten, I called to see about getting a discount because the food was tasting right like its spoilt. I always buy singapore noodles so why does this one taste bad. I asked why it tasted off. The guy that picked up the phone has poor customer service and rude. Refuse to give the names of the owners and refuse to give me a discounted meal or if possible return it. I was prepared to buy another on discount and buy broccolli and  more food and show them the original singapor noodles. I will never purchase anything there. The food is just OK. The only reason I go there because the other chinese restaurants are not near my home.
