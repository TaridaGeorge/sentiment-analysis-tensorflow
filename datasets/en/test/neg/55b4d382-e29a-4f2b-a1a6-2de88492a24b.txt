I ordered the pizza and wings special with pepperoni, when I got home much to my surprise the pizza had 10 pepperonis on it.... What a joke and the wings were the traditional wings and they tasted old and dry and very small the sauce was on the sweet side, I had to add franks red hot just to make them taste decent, the pizza was well ok, nothing to rage about, I might try it again.
