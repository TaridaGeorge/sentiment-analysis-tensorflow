I know this place is overrated crap. I have tried 3 times to eat here but just cannot wait that long for a fucking pizza. I seriously doubt it is worth the wait. Even when it was DEAD, it was still 45 min. FUCK YOU! I have had great pizza in my life, in NY, SF, CHICAGO, LA and San Diego. Hell there is even good pizza in Phx. Why this place gets all the love is beyond me. The staff is snotty too. I have no desire to eat here, ever! The pizza looked OK while I was waiting. But Pizza is simple, if you know what your doing you can make as good or better than this joint....hint: Grazie's !!! No wait. FUCK this joint. they can suck it. I refuse to be a loser waiting 1,2-4 hours for a fucking pizza! Just stupid!!!
