There is nothing here for adults who just drop in. The exhibits are minimal. The "lift off" was just a video playing on an old TV. The "training" facility is meant for a group to spend several hours together, so they just showed it to us. The rest of the time was spent watching the docent perform basic science tricks for the pre-teen kids, but they seemed to enjoy the show.
