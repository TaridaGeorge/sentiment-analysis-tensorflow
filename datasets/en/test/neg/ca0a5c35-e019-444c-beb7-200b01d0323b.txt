Horrible service.  We had waited 45 minutes and still didn't have our food. The table next to us came in 20 minutes after us, ate their food, and left.  At one point the server brought us our drinks and said "let me go put down my tray and I will come right back to take your order".  It took her 15 minutes to put down her tray.  She also said "sorry your food isn't up yet, we had a large table ahead of yours", she was saying this as another table next to us, who had ordered after us was receiving their food.  I am sure she took our order and had to "put down her tray" before she sent the order to the kitchen.  We left without eating.
