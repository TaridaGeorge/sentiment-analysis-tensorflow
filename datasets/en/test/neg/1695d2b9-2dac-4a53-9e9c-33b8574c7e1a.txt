When they built this Walmart, they put in the El Mirage mailout it was the biggest Walmart in the State of Arizona! I don't see it. 
Whenever I shop here, regardless of the time of day or night, the wait time in the checkout lines is ridiculous! I see it as a problem when I spend more time standing in line than I do shopping. The tax in El Mirage is ridiculous. Your better off going to the Surprise Walmart to make big purchases. The one good thing I can say about this Walmart is the greeters are all very friendly.
