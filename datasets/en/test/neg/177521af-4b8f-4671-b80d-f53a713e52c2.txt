Worst experience in a security line EVER.  These creeps seemed to be punishing travelers with extremely slow service as they got on the loud speaker and announced in a "nah nah nah nah nah nah" way, that "you all can make this move faster, if you just take the liquids out of your bags."  We watched and rarely had anyone missed a liquid - they were just messing with us.  
Have a shot of whisky prior to entering security - otherwise you're at risk of an aggravated assault charge.
