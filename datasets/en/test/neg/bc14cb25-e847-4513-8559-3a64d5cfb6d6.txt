After seeing so many gorgeous photos of the Clarendon's roof-top bar, we made the trek over to check it out. Let's just say they have a fabulous photographer because this place is really a dump.

The roof-top deck had no bar service (you can carry your drinks from the ground-floor bar). Mix that with peeling paint chips on the astroturf-ish deck, no music and rickety chairs ... it wasn't a winning combination. We quickly left and found another spot that was a bit more welcoming.

We did get a peek at one of the rooms on our way out and they looked nice. Still, I would be hugely disappointed if I booked a room here.
